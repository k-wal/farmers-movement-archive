According to the minutes of a June 30 meeting — attended by Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain, who is also the chairman of SRDC, corporation officials, and traffic and transport department officials — a concept note has been prepared for running low-speed electric golf carts with a maximum speed of 25-30 km per hour to help the elderly who visit the market. Officials from the transport department are expected to apprise the Delhi high court about the proposal. The cart service will be free. “Commissioner (Transport) suggested that Hon’ble High Court may be apprised about the intent of the government to ply Electric Golf Carts in the restricted area for elders and infirm while simultaneously making detailed deliberations,” according to the minutes, which HT has seen. Conceived in 2006, the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project was launched after a prolonged delay in December 2018 following the directions the Delhi high court which is also monitoring the project. In the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric and other cables were shifted underground, and dedicated lanes for non-motorised transport and walkways were constructed.During the meeting, officials also discussed that for public roads which have been made pedestrian exclusive zones, running non-motorised vehicles can be considered on lines of the restricted zone around Taj Mahal in Agra.Jain suggested that the agency could explore possible tie-ups with various traders’ associations of the market for operating electric vehicles. Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said the association has started approaching companies for CSR initiatives with regard to the introduction of electric vehicles. “The idea of introducing electric vehicles sounds promising. We are looking forward to this and will approach private players for CSR activities who can present innovative designs,” said Bhargava. In addition to initiatives aimed at boosting pedestrianisation in the market, consultations with private hotel chains are underway for plantation drives in the area this month. Jain approved the horticulture initiatives and directed that they be completed by 25 July. Delhi governments public works department (PWD) will extend support for plantation and maintenance. During the meeting, it was also decided that PWD officials will review the status of arterial roads such as Church Mission Road and Esplanade Road for maintenance and improvement by mid-July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/electric-golf-carts-may-ply-in-chandni-chowk-to-help-elderly-shoppers-101625336577956.html

03-07-2021||Noida||Noida: Restaurants seek weekend relaxations, write to CM||Noida: The restaurant owners in the city have asked the Uttar Pradesh government for allowing them to open their establishments on weekends.Varun Khera, head of the National Restaurants Association of India (Noida chapter), said that he has written to the UP chief minister in this regard. “Under the new guidelines, restaurants are still not permitted operations on weekends. However, with the decline in Covid numbers and improvement in overall situation, we humbly request you to consider permitting the opening of restaurants on weekends as well,” states the letter signed by Khera.After a gap of 50 days, shopping malls and restaurants in Gautam Budh Nagar had been allowed to reopen from June 21 with 50% capacity. However, they were asked to operate their businesses from Monday to Friday between 7am and 9pm. As per Khera, while it has been almost two weeks since the restaurants and eateries in GB Nagar reopened, the business has not picked up. “We are still running in losses. Weekend crowd is a major revenue source for any restaurant. If we are allowed to operate on weekends at 50% capacity, it will be a big respite for the hospitality industry. In GB Nagar, there are at least 200 restaurants and eateries that are struggling to survive. We hope our request can be considered,” he said.Vicky Saluja, who runs a restaurant-cum-bar in Sector 18, said that the restaurants were expecting that relaxations would be given from July 1. “I had not reopened my establishment on June 21, as I was waiting for complete restrictions to be lifted. I was hoping that the weekend curfew will be removed by July 1 as cases have gone down. However, since no such announcement has been made, we are disappointed. But I will be reopening my restaurant on Monday,” said Saluja.District excise officer Rakesh Bahadur Singh said that bars in GB Nagar are allowed to operate from 10am till 9pm on weekdays.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the decision to allow operations of restaurants on weekends lies with the government. “Presently, the weekend curfew stands as it is. I am aware that a request has been made by NRAI to the chief minister regarding it,” said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-restaurants-seek-weekend-relaxations-write-to-cm-101625335077822.html
03-07-2021||Noida||Noida forest department offers free plants from its nurseries||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar forest department said it will give away plants for free from its nurseries from July 4, the day the district will observe a mass plantation drive, to maximise the year’s plantation target. Residential organisations and institutes can avail of the free plants till July 31 through the development authority concerned in the district.The Uttar Pradesh government had earlier set the annual plantation target for this year at 300 million throughout the state, to be held. Of this, Gautam Budh Nagar has a target of planting 1,026,955 saplings on Sunday. This year’s drive is to be held on July 4.“We have decided to give away free plants from our departmental nurseries to the general public so that they can carry out plantation drives in their localities or high-rise societies. For this, they will have to write a proposal to the respective authority, which will forward the proposal to us, after which the saplings will be provided. We are reaching out to the concerned officials of the authority regarding the same,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.He added that there are over 12 lakh saplings at government nurseries in the district, of which about eight lakh saplings have been kept on reserve for different departments for the mega plantation drive, which is to be carried out on Sunday. Of these, the forest department plans to plant over 325,836 saplings on Sunday.Though the plants will be made available from Sunday, they are above and beyond the mass plantation target for the day for GB Nagar, said officials. “If we keep all reserves, aside there are over 400,000 saplings of 35 different species that we are offering to the residents of the city. These include Arjun, Jamun, Guava, Kanji, Amla, Pomegranate, Neem, etc. We encourage and urge people to come forward and participate,” Srivastava said, adding. “We have enough stock at our six different nurseries to give away. The initiative is being taken to promote plantation throughout the month and increase the green cover of the city.”Officials from Noida authority, meanwhile, confirmed they have received a communication from the forest department.“The forest department’s target is to plant over 300,000 plants. A total of 26 different public departments will be carrying out the drive, of which 19 departments have been given a set target,” Srivastava added.“Though we have received a letter from the forest department, there is some confusion – if the free plants are only for organisations or residential bodies or for the general public as well. We will have this clarified,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty, health, Noida authority.Last year on July 5, the district saw a massive plantation drive wherein over 936,000 saplings were planted against a target of 850,000 lakh with the help of different staff, paramilitary, and hired help.The massive plantation drive in UP was started in 2019 – the first one was held on August 15 – wherein eight lakh saplings were planted through at least 26 different public departments in the district. The aim of the drive is to increase the green cover of the state to 15% (36,146 square kilometre) of its geographical area by 2021, from the 12.09% as of 2019 (29,133.5 sqkm).Of its total geographical area of 1,282 sqkm, Gautam Budh Nagar has 19.99 sqkm (1.56%) of the area under green cover.

03-07-2021||Noida||Noida to get deputy registrar office for societies soon||NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday directed to set up an office of the Deputy Registrar (Firms, Societies and Chits) in Noida. The move will help residents get the issues involving their resident bodies resolved in a timely manner.Currently, the hearing of disputes related with residential bodies, including apartment owners associations (AOAs) and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), in all districts of Meerut division -- Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Meerut and Bhagpat -- takes place only at the deputy registrar office in Meerut. Various residential bodies in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad had been demanding for an office in Noida so that they do not have to travel to Meerut. “This decision was long awaited. We face a lot of issues as the deputy registrar office is in Meerut. We hope its new office will begin functioning soon. There are hundreds of AOAs and RWAs in the district that will benefit, and residents also can get an easy say in dispute cases,” said Rajiva Singh, president of the Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), an umbrella body of at least 70 AOAs.There are at least 400 RWAs and AOAs in GB Nagar, Singh said. Dilip Gupta, deputy registrar (Meerut division), said, “We will set up our office in Noida soon which will function for two days in a week as per the government order. I cannot comment further on the development.”There are around 100,000 societies registered with the Meerut office. “We had put forth the demands of residents before the chief minister with regard to setting up of an office of deputy registrar in Noida, and the same has been accepted. Now, residents can get speedy justice,” said Pankaj Singh MLA, Noida.Police officials have also welcomed the government’s decision. “RWA or AOA disputes often take ugly turn and become a law and order problem. Now, addressing such issues in Noida office will be easier due to better coordination,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida. Some experts feel that setting up a deputy registrar office in Noida will take a long time. “I do not understand how the government will provide adequate staff in Noida. If they hire new staff, it will take time. The process of setting up the office should be prompt,” said Mangreram Bhati, a member of GB Nagar Bar association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-to-get-deputy-registrar-office-for-societies-soon-101625334898415.html
03-07-2021||Noida||After over 14 months, active Covid-19 cases below 25 in GB Nagar||NOIDA: The last time the number of active Covid-19 cases Gautam Budh Nagar was below 25 was on March 22, 2020, when the count was 24. It took the district about 14-odd months to come below that mark again, with active cases below 22 on July 2, 2021.The first case of the coronavirus disease was recorded on March 8, 2020. In that month, there were no deaths, while a total of 38 cases were reported, with an average of 1.58 cases per day. From then on, the monthly tallies kept rising up to a peak of 5,797 cases in October last year, with 15 deaths and an average of 187 cases per day for the month. After this, the cases counts declined and rose up again during the second wave of the pandemic seen this year. From 175 cases and zero Covid deaths in February 2021, the tally saw a sharp incline to 15,232 cases and 121 deaths in April, and 21,024 cases and 238 deaths in May. In June 2021, however, the monthly tally fell drastically to 698 cases and 16 deaths. The first two days of July, meanwhile, saw only six cases and zero deaths. According to district magistrate, Suhas LY, “We are now preparing for the anticipated third wave, if it comes at all. Our focus will be on reducing the number of deaths as during the second wave, the district recorded as many as 375 deaths. For that, we are ensuring maximum contact tracing and testing nearly 4,000 people every day. While the recovery rate in GB Nagar is still over 99%, the case fatality rate (CFR) is only 0.73%, which is much better than the state’s overall CFR of 1.32%,” he said.The DM further said that till date, as many as 1,308,908 samples have been tested in the district. “We’ve so far taken as many as 945,903 people under surveillance. As far as vaccination is concerned, it’s going on at various booths despite limited stock available. Till Friday, as many as 1,110,399 doses had been administered in the district, in which 1,059,475 people have taken their first dose. On Friday, as many as 13,590 people were vaccinated at different private and government health centres in the district, of which 6,397 doses of vaccines were administered at 36 government health centres,” he said. Echoing similar views, chief medical officer, Dr Deepak Ohri, said that due to state-wide paucity of vaccines, it is unlikely to start any major vaccination drive at least in the coming fortnight. The state headquarters have to evenly distribute the available stock of vaccines, so we could get altogether 24,000 doses only on Friday, which will be used for vaccination of 6,000 people for four days. Till a bigger stock arrives, we’ll continue vaccination with the available doses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/after-over-14-months-active-covid-19-cases-below-25-in-gb-nagar-101625334897846.html

03-07-2021||Other||ED issues third summons to ex-Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued the third summon to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with an alleged money laundering case linked to a purported bribery racket operated through dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze.A senior ED officer, confirming the development, said that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader has been asked appear before investigators at ED’s south Mumbai office at 11am on July 5. The agency has also summoned Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh on Tuesday.Deshmukh had failed to visit the agency’s office for questioning despite two summons. Through his lawyers, he had sought documents pertaining to ED’s complaint against him and also requested the agency to record his statement online. Both his requests were turned down by the agency. Deshmukh had earlier denied all the allegations against him in the past and claimed that he is cooperating with ED.The central agency on June 26 had arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde on the grounds that they have “deep knowledge” of all of Deshmukh’s activities. The duo is in ED’s custody till July 6.The agency has claimed that it has found that Vaze had collected ₹4.7 crore from various orchestra bar owners in Mumbai for the “smooth functioning of the bars”. Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to two Delhi-based brothers who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that the brothers, at the behest of Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh, diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the Deshmukhs.ED has claimed that while collecting money from bar owners, Vaze told them that a part of the amount was to go to “No 1”, the crime and the social service branches of Mumbai Police. The anti-money laundering agency has also said that Vaze – who is currently in Taloja jail in connection with his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hirani murder cases – in his statement to ED claimed that Deshmukh had called him to the latter’s official residence and instructed him to collect ₹3 lakh from every bar and restaurant in the city. He was also given a list of the establishments.ED has also identified 24 private entities that are directly and indirectly controlled by the Deshmukh family and found that huge sums of money had been transferred to them. “From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers, and it can thus be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had stated. The agency also said that during Palande during his interrogation admitted that a meeting was held on March 4 with police officers, in which a discussion with regard to Covid-19 restrictions on bars had taken place. Palande in his statement also allegedly said that Deshmukh had a role in transfer postings of police officers, especially with respect to those belonging to the IPS (Indian Police Service) ranks. However, the defence lawyer had refuted this allegation.The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered based on an FIR (first information report) by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him on April 21. CBI had started the probe after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that the NCP leader ran an “extortion racket” in Mumbai and had instructed some officers to collect ₹100 crore for him every month from various establishments. Deshmukh had called the allegations false and claimed that Singh levelled the accusations only after he was shunted out from the Mumbai Police chief’s post for his “poor” handling of the Antilia explosives scare and Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-issues-third-summons-to-ex-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101625334778526.html
03-07-2021||Noida||Noida: Three arrested with illegal weapons||Greater Noida: Police on Saturday arrested three persons and recovered a huge cache of illegal weapons and raw materials allegedly from their possession in Greater Noida (West). The suspects had allegedly procured the raw materials and equipment to set up a firearm factory in Meerut, the police said.According to the deputy commissioner of police (crime) of Gautam Budh Nagar, Abhishek, who goes by a single name, the police received intelligence inputs that the suspects would be going to Meerut from Ghaziabad via Gautam Budh Nagar. “A SWAT team, along with the Bisrakh police, were deployed near Shahberi village to check for the suspects. Three suspects reached the spot in a car. The police checked the vehicle and found 10 illegal pistols, 80 cartridges, and other raw materials and equipment on them,” he said.The suspects were identified as Aftab, 40, Shakeel, 36 and Saghir, 35, all residents of Bhatta area in Ghaziabad. Police said Aftab and Saghir’s day job was running a jewellery shop while Shakeel works as a fitter. The suspects allegedly used to manufacture the weapons in Ghaziabad and had recently planned to set up the factory in Meerut, police added. During interrogation, the suspects allegedly revealed that they used to buy the raw materials from a resident of Delhi, and sold the furnished weapons to another suspect, who sold them further.“On Saturday, they were going to meet the suspect to whom they sold furnished weapons, to discuss the modalities of setting up an illegal gun factory in Meerut. This suspect is a seasoned criminal and was arrested under Arms Act in 2010 in Delhi. He was sent to jail and when he was released, he again got involved in illegal activities,” the DCP said.Anita Chauhan, station house officer, Bisrakh police station, said the three arrested suspects allegedly used to copy foreign pistol’s modals and made duplicates. “The suspects sold each pistol for up to ₹1 lakh to people.

03-07-2021||Other||Maharashtra politics heats up ahead of Assembly Speaker poll on July 6||Political developments in Maharashtra over the past few days have led to speculations over the fate of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress. A series of meetings are happening in both the camps – between key leaders from the state’s ruling parties as well as among Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Mumbai and Delhi – fuelling speculations ahead of the monsoon session of the state legislature beginning on Monday, and the crucial election of the Speaker of Legislative Assembly, which is likely on July 6. MVA leaders are also alleging that the BJP-led Centre is trying to destabilise the government through central investigative agencies. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) seems to be closing in on NCP leader and former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s relatives are under scanner of investigating agencies as the purchase of a cooperative sugar unit in an auction is being probed. ED has also taken action against Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills, which is believed to be under control of Pawar’s relatives. It is part of the alleged irregularities in the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank – the apex bank of cooperative banks in the state – which is under the control of NCP and Congress. State BJP has also demanded a CBI probe against Pawar and transport minister Anil Parab – a close aide of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray – to investigate corruption charges levelled against them by former Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze. Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik is facing action by ED in a money laundering case. State BJP leaders are predicting the MVA government to fall in the next few weeks. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis’s frequent visits to Delhi have further fuelled the speculations. The action against the MVA government leaders prompted key leaders from the ruling parties to deliberate on how to handle the current crisis and counter the BJP-led Central government’s offensive against it. MVA leaders are also suspecting that the BJP would try encourage defections in NCP or Sena to pull down the government. The pressure being built by investigation agencies is being seen by them as BJP’s attempts to break MVA to pull down its government. NCP chief Sharad Pawar met Thackeray early this week, followed by several rounds of meeting between top state leaders from the three parties. Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut’s meetings with Pawar and Thackeray are also considered to be significant amid the developments. “The leaders mainly discussed the action against Deshmukh and the threat of similar action against other leaders. A deliberation over combating pressure from the Centre was primarily held. The leaders discussed the counter plan by similar actions against BJP leaders by using the files and cases of corruption that had evolved during their five-year rule,” said a senior Congress leader. A section of the leaders from the three ruling parties also feel that they should aggressively go after BJP leaders to combat the action initiated by the central agencies against their leaders. One of the senior leaders from the ruling parties, during their recent meeting, believably compared the pressure tactics by BJP against West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and expressed the need to go her way. In these backdrops, the Speaker’s election is being seen as a crucial event. The defeat of the MVA candidate would lead to the collapse of Thackeray government. In their meetings, MVA leaders also discussed about the risk of cross-voting and the drop in the support of legislators during the election to the post of speaker. BJP leaders have dared MVA to prove their majority on the floor of the House during the election to the speaker. It would be a Herculean task before the ruling parties to retain the number – 169 – garnered during the confidence vote in November 2019, when the government was formed. Polling fewer votes on the floor of the Assembly than the 2019 trust vote figure would indicate trouble for the ruling coalition. “It would not just be embarrassing for the ruling parties even if the number dropped even by a few votes, but would also lead to an uncertainty among our legislators. BJP will pull out all the stops to orchestrate a split in MVA, especially in the backdrop of the letter by Sarnaik. All the three ruling parties will have put all their strength behind to ensure the victory in the poll,” said an NCP leader. In his letter to CM, Sarnaik had mentioned that Congress and NCP are “trying to weaken the coalition and there seems to be veiled support from the Centre” “The speaker will be from Congress and we will win the election with majority,” state Congress chief Nana Patole said. However, BJP’s Ashish Shelar dared the ruling parties to hold the Speaker’s election and said that they will ensure MVA’s defeat on the floor of the House. Fadnavis said that his party would open the cards at an appropriate time. “It is not clear if the MVA is in position to face the election. Let them announce it first. We will open our cards after it,” he said. Fadnavis’s meetings with BJP’s top leadership, especially with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi this week has led to further speculations. A section of BJP leaders feels that even if political developments in Maharashtra do not happen immediately, they are bound to happen in the near future. “Fadnavis has made it clear that he would not be part of the Union cabinet, which is expected to be expanded in the next few days. It seems that he has convinced the party high command that changes in Maharashtra are possible only if he is camped in the state. Secondly, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections are very crucial for us and they are likely to be fought under Fadnavis. The state leadership feels that BMC is Shiv Sena’s weak point and it could be exploited to come back in power in the state. If pulling the government down is not possible immediately, it could happen in the near future,” a senior BJP leader and former minister said. Raut has rubbished the speculations. “Leaders keep meeting their political bosses from the party. Dialogue between leaders from different parties is also not new to our political culture. There’s nothing more to read from these meetings. MVA government is doing well and will complete its term. We are not going to bow to the pressure by the Centre, which has been using Central agencies against us,” Raut said. Political analyst Hemant Desai said that though BJP is trying to topple the government, it is unlikely to succeed anytime soon. “I don’t think there will be any immediate political development in the state. BJP is trying to use or misuse Central agencies to destabilise the government in Maharashtra. If it cannot topple the government, its aim is to at least defame the ruling parties and capitalise the situation in the next election. BMC elections, scheduled to be held early next year, are crucial for BJP and Shiv Sena, and the political happenings in the run up to the polls are likely to be crucial,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-politics-heats-up-ahead-of-assembly-speaker-poll-on-july-6-101625334537852.html

The Karnal administration had kept details of the CM’s visit a secret.Local BKU (Charuni) functionary Jagdip Singh Aulakh said the farmers will continue to oppose the visit of BJP and JJP leaders till the Centre’s three farm laws are revoked.Speaking to the media, Khattar said that he reviewed the progress report of the organisation members and party workers were told about the achievements of the government.On possibility of talks with farmers, he said, “The government is always ready to hold talks with the farmers, barring repeal of the farm laws.”On a Congress MLA meeting Vivek Bansal in New Delhi, Khattar said that dynasty politics is an old tradition of Congress, which is still on.HAD NO INTENTION TO CALL KHATTAR PAKISTANI: CHARUNIMany farmers from Chandigarh and adjoining regions rushed towards the protest sites near Delhi.At Ambala Cantt’s Mohra Mandi, local farmers gathered to welcome the contingent and a few joined them for Delhi.BKU (Charuni) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said the government should not think that the farmers have returned back in fact the urban population that supports our cause has joined them.On him calling CM Khattar “Pakistani”, Charuni said he had no intention to do so and the statement was intentionally dramatised.“What I had said is - if the CM had migrated from Pakistan, will we call him Pakistani?” Charuni said.“Khattar had said that only residents of Haryana living at Khori village in Faridabad will be rehabilitated. I told them that most of them are from other states and are living here for the last 15-20 years. They were born on this planet and will live here only, not on moon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bku-farmers-oppose-khattar-s-karnal-visit-101625334478493.html

Police said that the speeding MUV was going to Faridabad from Darbhanga in Bihar when the accident took place in the Jewar area. Umesh Bahadur, station house officer, Jewar police station, said that the eight persons were travelling in a Maruti Suzuki Ertiga. “A truck was parked on the roadside.

He couldn’t explain the utilisation of funds that the union had received. Navdeep had even bought a personal mobile phone using the funds,” Gudiyana added.Soon after, the union activists on Saturday started calling for a rollback of the decision which was “taken in a hurry.” No leader is ready to speak on the matter.People familiar with the case said the expulsion should be looked into again as they have contributed equally and faced many cases for standing against the Centre’s farm laws.“While Jai Singh has aggressively led the protests, Navdeep has been a popular face among the youth and their removal could have consequences. They have assisted in many successful campaigns, mostly against the programmes of BJP leaders that were cancelled after the farmers’ resistance,” they said.The duo has been a crowd-puller for the union in the Ambala region since the protests began last year. Navdeep had risen to international fame in November last year, when farmers from Haryana and Punjab were rushing to Delhi on tractor-trailers, breaking police barricades, and he had jumped over a moving tractor after closing a nozzle of a water cannon trying to stop them.Navdeep has refused to comment on the expulsion stating that they are expecting a solution soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bku-expels-water-cannon-boy-navdeep-his-father-for-anti-union-activities-101625334178461.html

03-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man gets 5 years in jail for sexually abusing minors||A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) court has recently convicted a 33-year-old Bhandup resident for sexually abusing minor girls in his neighbourhood, one of whom suffered 75% burn injuries and subsequently died. He has been sentenced to five years in prison along with a fine of ₹1.12 lakh, of which, ₹50,000 would go to the family of the victim. He has, however, been acquitted of the charge of rape.The court has convicted the man for sexually abusing the victim and other girls by showing them pornographic videos.The convict allegedly sexually abused minor girls when they visited his house for preparing school projects and showed them pornographic content. The minors alleged that he would sexually abuse them at times.The incident came out after a girl succumbed to burn injuries. The family subsequently found a suicide note, blaming the accused for her decision to end her life. It was alleged by the prosecution that the girl ended her life after being sexually harassed by the accused.The incident took place on July 1, 2014, when the victim, who was studying in Class 7, suffered 75% burn injuries. On July 3, 2014, the police registered a case of suicide against the accused and arrested him.During the trial, which lasted for almost seven years, the prosecution heavily relied on the suicide note and pornographic content recovered from the mobile phone of the accused. The prosecution also examined other girls who were subjected to abuse by the accused.The girls had deposed before the court that the accused would show them video clips and touch them inappropriately. However, the prosecution could not bring any evidence to show that the minors were sexually assaulted or raped by the accused. The court noted that the prosecution had not examined medical officers and the minors were not sent for medical examination. Defence lawyer Prakash Salsingikar had alleged that the accused was falsely implicated by the parents of the girl. He also argued that the investigation was faulty and the girl died by accident and not by suicide.After considering both the side and suicide note, the court observed, “The deposition of child witnesses established that the accused was using his mobile phone to show obscene, pornographic material to the minor girls with sexual intent. He has outraged the modesty by touching their body while showing them video clips.”The court, however, did not accept the theory of suicide and claimed that the girl died by accident. “There is a possibility that child got burn injuries through a stove as she was not in an attentive state of mind. The child was disturbed due to an obscene video clip. If the child had the intention to attempt suicide, she would have poured kerosene on herself and this is not the case,” the court observed while negating the theory of suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-gets-5-years-in-jail-for-sexually-abusing-minors-101625333997813.html

More than 800 people, including TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty, were duped into taking the fake vaccines. Police had earlier arrested eight persons including Deb.On Saturday, another person was arrested in connection with the racket. Police said that the accused, Indrajit Shaw, was instrumental in organising one of the fake vaccination camps held in a college in north Kolkata.The racket has triggered a political slugfest between the TMC and the BJP. While the BJP has alleged that the mastermind had links with senior TMC leaders, the latter rubbished the charges. TMC, meanwhile, released a picture in which Deb’s security guard could be purportedly seen standing behind West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.The Centre has asked the West Bengal government to file a report by Thursday in the fake Covid-19 vaccination camps busted by the Kolkata Police last week even as the Calcutta high court directed the state to file an affidavit in the matter by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-sleuths-use-3d-scanner-in-fake-vaccination-racket-probe-101625332738483.html

We welcome the chargesheet filing by the CBI, though the investigation is not yet completed. We are hopeful the true facts will be revealed through their investigation,” said BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharjee.“It is an attempt to malign the Left leaders. All the allegations raised against us are baseless,” said Left Front convener Bijan Dhar.The chargesheet was filed in Gomati district and session judge court on Friday against former chairman and director Goutam Kundu, and three directors - Ashok Kumar Saha, Ram Lal Goswami and Shibamoy Dutta.A case was registered by the CBI before, following the Tripura High Court’s order. They had filed the chargesheet followed by a long investigation.Bhattacharjee added that the then chief minister Manik Sarkar attended an event of Rose Valley in 2008. He accused him of promoting such companies to grow in the state. Sarkar had forwarded 37 ponzi scam-related cases to the CBI in 2013 but they took up only five cases then.After coming to power in 2018, chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb handed over 74 ponzi scam-related cases to the CBI that were then investigated by the state’s special investigation teams. Former Left ministers Bijita Nath and Badal Choudhury and CPM leader Goutam Das were interrogated by CBI sleuths over the scam.An amount of Rs. 4,81,19,365 was reportedly siphoned in the scam at Rose Valley’s Amarpur branch in Gomati district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rose-valley-scam-tripura-bjp-welcomes-cbi-chargesheet-alleges-left-leaders-involvement-101625332079665.html

Starting Monday, July 5, we request the authorities to allow such teachers to travel by train,” said a letter signed by Sangve. The letter further mentions time limits within which teachers be allowed to travel starting from morning 7am till evening 5pm.This request comes a day after Gaikwad announced that Maharashtra state education department will also follow the 30:30:40 formula, giving 30% weightage each to class 10 and 11 marks and 40% weightage to Class 12 internals marks and students’ performance in the year. This is similar to the decision of both the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) for their respective Class 12 results.“Since the final result will include marks of Class 10, 11 and the overall performance of students in class 12, it won’t be possible to do this sitting at home. Teachers will have to start visiting respective schools/junior colleges and work with the admin staff to get Class 10 and 11 marks and put all this together,” said a teacher, adding that without permission to travel by trains, it’ll be very difficult for many teachers to reach their respective institutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allow-class-10-and-12-teachers-to-travel-by-train-education-department-tells-maharashtra-govt-101625332077688.html

According to the data sourced from Mumbai airport, the city airport saw over 1,800 medical cargo flights in a year. These included over 350 charters, operated just for vaccine distribution (international and domestic) and over 1,400 flights imported medicines and oxygen concentrators in Mumbai, until June 30.Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) spokesperson said, “Even during the Unlock 3.0, CSMIA helped in the facilitation of over 570 charter flights in August 2020. The airport handled over 67,500 passengers by connecting to 34 international destinations operated by 26 airlines in the same period. As of June 30, 2021, CSMIA processed around 396 charters for vaccine distribution (international and domestic) and 1,473 flights bringing imports of medicines and oxygen concentrators.”As one after another government, including India, placed curbs on visas and travel to contain the pandemic, the move had a direct bearing on the aviation industry with both domestic and international passenger flights getting suspended initially. At this stage, the regular international passenger services which are operated under various air services agreements have still not been allowed by the Indian government. The second wave of the pandemic, which has crashed on the country is expected to prolong this further.According to the credit rating agency, CRISIL, while passenger traffic for the financial year (FY) 2020-21 was only 34% of FY 2019-20 volumes, cargo traffic was at 74% of FY 20 levels due to the rising demand for freight during the first wave of the pandemic led by a rise in e-commerce demand and disrupted global supply chains necessitating quick transport by air.CSMIA facilitated over 17,700 Oxygen concentrators, 319,800 vials of Remdesivir injections and 113,900 vials of Tocilizumab injections approximately in the period between April 26 – May 14, 2021, to cater to the increase in demand for these goods for the treatment of patients in India. Thus, the city airport facilitated the transportation of over 387 tonnes of Covid relief supplies, in the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-sees-over-1-800-medical-cargo-flights-in-a-year-101625331897685.html

The court also directed the MHADA to permit the architect of the landlord and tenants to access the building to draw up the plans for restoration and extend all help required by them to commence work. The heritage committee is expected to consider the proposal too. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the petition by Sadiqali Noorani, the landlord of Esplanade Mansion which was earlier known as Watson Hotel and tenants seeking directions to MHADA to hand over possession of the building for commencing restoration work at their own cost was informed by advocate Chirag Balsara that an amount of ₹20 crore had been arranged for the restoration and conservation work in the building. Balsara submitted that as the amount was arranged they required access to the building which is in possession of the MHADA so that their architect was able to draw up plans and also undertake protective work during the monsoon. He added that the proposal for restoration would thereafter be given to the heritage committee and after receiving a go-ahead from them, further approvals for commencement of work would be sought from MHADA and BMC.Last year in February, the landlord and 140 tenants had undertaken to provide the estimated cost of ₹50 crore for restoration and conservation as the MHADA had declined to foot the bill.

03-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra medical colleges gear up for third Covid wave||As the country is reeling from the second wave of Covid-19 and stares at a third wave in the near future, amplifying medical infrastructure is the need of the hour, and medical colleges in Maharashtra are doing exactly that. From setting up full-fledged oxygen generation units on campus, to training medical staff in paediatrics department in anticipation of the third wave, state undergraduate medical colleges are ensuring they are introducing several new changes to be better prepared for future challenges.“The second wave has taught us all an important lesson and that is to be prepared in advance for challenges. The state started a paediatrics training programme for medical staff and students across the state to ensure that basic treatment is done for patients at the time of admission. All state hospitals are preparing a minimum 100-bed paediatric ward along with special intensive care unit beds as well,” said Dr TP Lahane, who recently retired from his post as the director of the state Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). He added that the state has also started training physicians in rural Maharashtra in paediatrics to ensure no patient is denied help.As hospitals across the country struggled with oxygen shortage amid rising Covid-19 cases during the second wave, the National Medical Commission (NMC) in April this year made draft amendments to their existing rules, making it compulsory for medical college hospitals to set up pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen units in their campuses. NMC revealed that this move was introduced through a draft amendment to the Minimum Requirements for Annual MBBS Admissions Regulations, and the circular clarified that these arrangements have to be made within six months.On Friday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated seven new PSA oxygen units across five civic hospitals including Cooper Hospital, Bhabha Hospital, Kasturba Gandhi Hospital and Rajawadi Hospital. “At least 20 other medical colleges are in the process of setting up PSA units, and others will also follow. We are ensuring that medical infrastructure gets better with every passing day,” added Lahane.The NMC circular from April 2021 also stated that all medical college hospitals should have a dedicated supply of oxygen produced using the PSA technology in addition to the supply from liquid oxygen tanks, which is installed and made operational within six months. “Central oxygen and suction points shall include provision of piped oxygen supply to all patients in critical care from liquid oxygen tanks installed in appropriate place in the hospital complex,” said the circular.“We already have a large oxygen tank on campus and even during the second wave of Covid, we had adequate oxygen supply through the tank as well as extra cylinders. Oxygen generation is now on our agenda and the management is already in talks about it,” said Dr Varsha Phadke, dean of KJ Somaiya Medical College.The move to upgrade the present medical infrastructure is also in tune with the introduction of Pandemic Management as a module for undergraduate medical students which was introduced by NMC in August last year.NMC board of governors (BoG) released the official document with the syllabus in August last year for colleges to implement in the 2020-21 academic year itself. “The pandemic management module is designed to ensure that MBBS students acquire competencies in handling not only the illness but also social, legal and other issues arising from such disease outbreaks,” states the foreward of the module. “The emergence of Covid-19 and its rapid spread across the globe has further underlined the need to develop these skills in our graduates. One of the desirable outcomes of the competency derived education programme is to enable to medical graduate to be able to understand, investigate, treat and prevent new and emerging diseases,” it added.As per details mentioned in the new module, it has been arranged in a phase-based manner and is expected to be covered by an interdisciplinary team under the supervision of the institute-level curriculum committee. The course not only covers disease/epidemic management, intensive care, research and control, but also includes module on communication with media during a pandemic. “All second- and third-year MBBS students have already studied this module. It will be part of the syllabus for good. Hopefully this will help better prepare our future doctors,” said dean of a private medical college in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-medical-colleges-gear-up-for-third-covid-wave-101625331537672.html

A team of the district unit on Friday met Governor Draupadi Murmu in this regard and submitted a memorandum seeking probe against Roy, who fell out of the BJP in 2019 and defeated former chief minister Raghubar Das as a rebel in Assembly polls. The party leaders have alleged corruption in Roy’s department in publication of a journal without following due tendering process. “Financial irregularities were done by minister Saryu Roy and those close to him. We have demanded investigation by an independent agency such as the CBI or vigilance and action against those responsible,” a statement released by the Jamshedpur BJP unit said. Reacting to the charges, Roy said he was open for a CBI probe. “I would suggest three tall leaders of the BJP--Arjun Munda, Deepak Prakash and Babulal Marandi--to probe the issue. I would suggest the state government to provide them all the files and they can see it all. I would also suggest them to ask the Centre to get a CBI probe done in the matter,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-bjp-levels-corruption-charges-against-ex-minister-saryu-seeks-probe-101625329617561.html

Another Araria village resident Baleshwar Mandal said, “Bakra River has forced our family to disintegrate. We are living separately, as our land and houses were devoured by the river.” In Palasi block, low lying areas of three villages has already been flooded. In a bid to minimise damage, anti-erosion work has begun as per guidelines of the district magistrate, Kursakanta circle officer (CO) Birendra Singh said.Several villages of Baisi and Baisa blocks of Purnia district are facing erosion. “This year, Parman river has started rising menacingly and has caused damage to our land and habitation,” said one Md Shah Alam of Mala village under Baisi block.

At a virtual meeting held on Saturday to review the preparations for the flood situations, the minister also asked the officials to arrange a Covid-19 vaccination facility at the flood relief camps. “There’s the need to be extra cautious regarding the relief arrangements for the people in the flood-hit zones. In the last few years, inundation and flood have become a regular phenomenon in the areas located on Indo- Nepal borders. This year also, a similar kind of situation is being witnessed. There’s the need to be prepared to face the challenges of relief measures,” she added. The deputy CM also asked the officials to ensure sensitive handling of the situations. The deputy CM also directed the officials to upload the list of those families on the disaster department portal who will get gratuitous relief. Besides, the officials were asked to update the Bihar State Disaster Response Network and upload on its portal the information related to the relief facilities and resources made available by the government and by some private agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/take-special-care-of-pregnant-women-senior-citizens-during-floods-bihar-dy-cm-to-officials-101625329558110.html

Speaking to HT on Saturday, one such village resident Amal Mandal, 50, said he hardly had the inkling about the fate his family of six had in store. It was late on Thursday night when Mandal and his family members were jolted out of sleep after a part of their house collapsed.“We raised an alarm and many families rushed to a safer place with whatever household items we could lay our hands on,” said Mandal, a resident of Biranchi 3 in Mainatand block, while recalling the harrowing experience.Much to their dismay, Mandal and many other village residents found no traces of their houses in the morning. Sarpanch of Damarapur panchayat Hari Das claimed that residents of Biranchi 3 are facing threat of displacement for many years now, with around 200 families displaced due to floods since 1998 . “While houses of 15 families collapsed on Wednesday night, seven other houses were engulfed by the river the following day. We have been fighting against our destiny all these years, but nothing tangible has been done to save us,” said Das, also a resident of Biranchi 3.Demanding compensation for the displaced families, former MLA from Sikta constituency Dilip Verma announced monetary help of ₹50,000. He also distributed relief material in the form of dry ration and plastic sheets, said some of the displaced village residents.When contacted, Kumar Rajiv Ranjan, circle officer (CO), Mainatand confirmed that 15 houses were engulfed by the river. Dry ration and other relief material has also been distributed, he said, adding that a flood fighting team was carrying out repair works. Sahila Heer, sub divisional magistrate (SDM), Narkatiaganj, said, “The administration is keeping a close tab and is prepared to meet any eventualities. The need for relief material has been necessitated in Biranchi 3 village,” the SDM said, adding that road connectivity in some areas has also been snapped. However, local MLA and CPI (ML) leader Birendra Gupta said about half a dozen villages in Sikta block are totally disconnected from subdivisional headquarters. The villages are Magalahiya, Sonargawa, Mahesara, Kadama, Sonbarsa and Birayith, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/families-rendered-homeless-by-turbulent-river-in-w-champaran-s-mainatand-101625329557564.html
03-07-2021||Patna||Complete confiscation proceedings in liquor cases in 90 days or release ‘things’, says Patna HC||The Patna High Court has directed that all proceedings related to confiscation of property under the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, must positively be initiated/concluded within a period of 90 days from the date of appearance of the parties concerned. The court has further directed that the appeal/revision, if any, be also decided within a period of 30 days from the date of initiation, failing which the “things” (vehicle/property/ etc.) shall be deemed to have been released. Hearing a petition filed by one Abhishek Kumar, who prayed for a direction to release his Swift car seized and kept in the premises of Baikunthpur police station in Gopalganj under open sky, the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar directed the authorities to take appropriate action within the time schedule fixed, failing which the vehicle/property/things liable for confiscation shall be deemed to have been released without any further reference to this court. Citing various HC orders, the bench said litigants were forced to approach the court due to delay in completing the proceedings or on account of non-initiation of such proceedings of confiscation. The order of the court, given on July 1, was uploaded on July 3. The bench said it had already laid down the time schedule for such cases.“It is seen that despite our observations, authorities have not taken any action in initiating the proceedings for confiscation of the property under the Act. The litigants are, thus, forced to approach the Court by way of filing separate petitions. In a large number of cases, the position about concluding the proceedings remains the same,” the bench said. The Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, prohibits manufacture, storage, distribution, transportation, possession, sale, purchase and consumption of any intoxicant or liquor. In addition to the penalty imposed for committing such an offence, Section 56 of the Act lays down the procedure for confiscation of “things” used for in the commission of such an offence. In an earlier order, the court had directed the state to provisionally release vehicle/property, subject to initiation/conclusion/finalisation of the confiscatory proceedings. It even threatened to initiate contempt proceedings and directed the chief secretary to evolve a mechanism to ensure that the provisions of the Act were implemented in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/complete-confiscation-proceedings-in-liquor-cases-in-90-days-or-release-things-says-patna-hc-101625329497531.html

Several state Congress leaders are said to be restive over plans to make Kutuma legislator Rajesh Ram as the state unit chief. AICC in-charge of Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, is said to have suggested Rajesh Ram’s name for the top party post in the state. When contacted, Anil Sharma refused to share details of what was discussed at the meeting. However, one of the leaders present at the meeting said, “More would join hands to refurbish the state unit in a way that catapults the Congress as a force to reckon with in the state instead of being a pillion rider.”Tagging Sharma’s tweet, Das replied, “He was happy to learn that the party seniors have expressed their serious concerns about its affairs of Bihar through this meeting.” Earlier, some senior leaders of the state Congress had met AICC leaders in Delhi to scuttle the move to make Rajesh Ram the next party chief in Bihar.Some other senior leaders, it is reliably learnt, are also planning to visit Delhi to meet AICC leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to rally for a “strong, energetic leader acceptable to all” as the next BPCC chief once the Punjab and Rajasthan issues were favourably resolved. “The party has lost its mass support by playing the second fiddle to regional parties. It’s time Congress focuses its attention on rebuilding the organization,” said a former MLA.AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar, Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh, former governor Nikhil Kumar, former MLA Ashok Kumar, Bihar Pradesh Mahila Congress Committee chief and former MLA Amita Bhushan, former BPCC vice-president Pravin Kushwaha, working president Samir Kumar Singh and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra are said to be potential contenders for the state chief’s post.Meanwhile, BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha said preparations were on for a statewide agitation from July 7 against exorbitant hikes in prices of essential commodities, including petroleum products. He said that the Centre had increased the price of petrol 29 times in a month. “Party workers would beat plates, take out marches and cycle rally as part of the protest against the Central government,” said Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cong-veterans-from-bihar-meet-in-delhi-for-state-unit-reshuffle-101625329438139.html
03-07-2021||Patna||Nitish cabinet divided over Sahni’s resignation threat||The Nitish Kumar cabinet in Bihar seemed divided on Saturday over the impending resignation of social welfare minister Madan Sahni, who had earlier threatened to quit while alleging high-handedness by bureaucracy and had accused officials close to the chief minister of corruption. While several ministers backed Sahni and requested the chief minister to look into the allegations seriously, others advised the minister caution.“The chief minister should take cognizance of what the minister is alleging and see why and where it is happening. In the past too, legislators have raised their voice against the officials’ attitude and demanded respect for public representatives,” said Neeraj Singh Bablu, the minister for environment, forest and climate change. Bablu is from the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), a key constituent of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) headed by Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United).“Officialdom is there,” art and culture minister Alok Ranjan Jha, also from BJP, told a TV channel.However, some other ministers did not find merit in Sahni’s allegations. SC-ST welfare minister Santosh Kumar Manjhi, son of former CM JItan Ram Manjhi, said, “Bureaucrats and officers are all ears to ministers’ advice. I have experienced this. If Sahniji has any grievance, he should have directly approached the chief minister rather than making things public,” said the minister, who is from HAM-S, a party founded by his father.The minister’s views are, however, at variance with his father who had said a few days ago, “There are at least 20 per cent officials who do not listen to ministers or MLAs. This tendency should be curbed.” Tourism minister Jivesh Mishra, of the BJP, asked Sahni to work in harmony. “The department has to work in harmony. There is no such problem in our department,” he said.Meanwhile, suspense over Sahni’s resignation continued on Saturday as he failed to get an audience with chief minister Nitish Kumar.Sahni, however, reiterated he was firm on his resignation and would be meeting the chief minister in the evening to submit his resignation. The minister, who had accused Atul Prasad, the additional chief secretary of his department, of arbitrariness in the recent transfers, had skipped the state cabinet meeting on Friday. Both Sahni and CM Kumar are from the Janata Dal (United). .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-cabinet-divided-over-sahni-s-resignation-threat-101625329437604.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Power purchase pacts signed by Badals under review: Punjab CM||With the Punjab government feeling the heat of public protests on the issue of power shortage, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said power purchase agreements (PPA) signed by the previous SAD-BJP government were already under review and the Congress government would soon announce its legal strategy to counter these agreements that had put an “atrociously unnecessary financial burden” on the state. The chief minister, who chaired a meeting to review the power situation in the state, later said that a carefully charted legal course of action was being formulated to save Punjab from further financial losses due to the ill-conceived PPAs signed by the Badals during their rule. Of the 139 PPAs signed during the SAD-BJP regime, 17 were enough to cater to the state’s full power demand, he pointed out, adding that the remaining 122 for 1,314 MW of expensive power were inexplicably signed, putting unnecessary financial burden on the state. Even as he appealed to the people to use power judiciously and cooperate with the government in overcoming the temporary shortage of power, the CM said against the supply of 13,500 MW, the demand last week touched an unprecedented 16,000 MW. Immediately, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) started purchasing 7,400 MW of power from outside the state, he disclosed, adding that this was 1,000 MW more than what was purchased last year. Had the quantum of purchase not been promptly enhanced, the state would have faced an additional deficit of 1,000 MW of power, further aggravating the crisis, he pointed out. Notice issued to Talwandi Sabo plantCaptain said the present crisis was the result of failure of one unit of the Talwandi Sabo power plant, generating 660 MW of power. While a notice had already been issued to the plant by the PSPCL for imposing a heavy penalty, the state government had, on its part, taken strong measures to address the power shortage, he added. These measures, he said, included three weekly days off for the industry, including rolling mills and induction furnaces, from July 1 to 7. Only essential services and continuous process industries have been exempted from these regulations, he added. Further, the state government offices have also been directed to function from 8am to 2pm till July 10, with use of air conditioners prohibited. The CM said the power distribution system in the state had improved significantly over the past four years. He said that 2 lakh new distribution transformers have been installed, taking the total to 11.5 lakh. Transformers have also been installed at substations to keep the supply stable, he added. Eight-hour supply to agri sector: PSPCLMeanwhile, a spokesperson of PSPCL said that following the measures taken by the state government, eight hours of power is being supplied to all agriculture consumers and there are no scheduled power cuts for domestic, commercial, small and medium supply industrial consumers in the state. The situation has improved considerably, he said. On the availability of power from the power exchange, the spokesperson said the same was highly unpredictable, with even the rates varying, according to the time of the day, from ₹2.32/unit to ₹10/unit. On the closure of Bathinda and Ropar thermal plants, the spokesperson said that the unit cost of power generated by these plants was high since they are of old design and required more manpower for operation. The maintenance cost of these plants was also very high, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-purchase-pacts-signed-by-badals-under-review-punjab-cm-101625329378288.html
03-07-2021||Patna||CM patronising corruption, officials call the shots: Tejashwi||Leader of the opposition Bihar Assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, on Saturday said bureaucrats in the state were enjoying unbridled powers and accused chief minister Nitish Kumar of patronising corruption by not taking action against corrupt officers. Referring to allegations levelled by social welfare minister Madan Sahni that he was ignored by his department’s top official in the matter of transfers, Yadav said it not only raised questions on the work culture of the chief minister but also validated his party RJD’s allegations that corruption was rampant in the present dispensation in all matters related to transfers of officials. Earlier this week, Sahni had threatened to resign, saying he was overlooked by his department’s additional chief secretary in the transfer of officials.“The minister has also demanded that assets of bureaucrats close to the chief minister should be probed. Now, this is a serious matter. It is to be seen now whether the chief minister gets the assets of officials close to him investigated or not,” Yadav said while talking to reporters after inducting former JD(U) MLA Maheshwar Singh into RJD at a function at the official residence of former chief minister Rabri Devi. Yadav said Singh, a two- time former MLA, had worked with RJD chief Lalu Prasad, but ducked queries about Manjit Singh, another former MLA in the chief minister’s party, who had similarly met the RJD leader recently fuelling speculation of his changing sides, but backed down reportedly after receiving a call from Nitish Kumar. Attacking the CM, Yadav said, “We have alleged several scams in various departments, but the chief minister has not taken any action against the corrupt officers. It reflects how corruption in bureaucracy is being patronized.” He said people in the state were frustrated with the rampant corruption in block offices and police stations and wanted the government to go. “It not me alone who is predicting the fall of the government. It is the general sentiment of the people, who had given a mandate for change in the last election by giving their overwhelming support to the grand alliance . But the present dispensation came to power through back door. The present government is already down, and it is obvious, it will fall soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cm-patronising-corruption-officials-call-the-shots-tejashwi-101625329317525.html

The President has given his consent and we would meet him around 2:30 pm on Monday,” said Roy. On Friday, the TMC sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Mehta’s removal while alleging that the senior lawyer met Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Suvendu Adhikari in violation of established norms. Both Mehta and Adhikari have, however, denied that the meeting took place. Mehta said on Friday that Adhikari, the leader of Opposition in West Bengal, came to his residence-cum-office in Delhi at 3 pm on Thursday but left without meeting the SG, who was tied up in previous engagements, and expressed his inability to meet the Nandigram MLA. “Narada accused enters home of SG (who is also Special PP, CBI in Narada case) in vehicle, is checked & waved inside by security guards & exits after 30 mins. They say nothing happened. Yeah, right,” Mahua Moitra, TMC MP, tweeted on Saturday. Adhikari is accused in the 2016 Narada sting operation case, and Mehta - the Union government’s second-highest law officer - is representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Supreme Court and the Calcutta high court in the agency’s probe against senior TMC leaders in the case. The TMC’s letter to PM Modi, signed by party MPs Derek O’Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Mahua Moitra, said that the alleged meeting between Adhikari and Mehta “reeks of impropriety”. BJP’s West Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh attacked the TMC saying that the BJP seeks the removal of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “The TMC is engaged in politics of removal. Earlier they wanted the Governor of West Bengal to be removed. Now, they want the SG to be removed. Mamata Banerjee has lost the elections (she was defeated from Nandigram by Adhikari, even though TMC won the polls) but has become the chief minister through the backdoor. We are seeking her removal,” said Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-to-meet-president-kovind-to-seek-removal-of-solicitor-general-101625328658156.html

Those camps were finally removed by Assam police and a district administration level discussion was also held between Kolasib and Hailakandi.Superintendent of police, Hailakandi district, Ramandeep Kaur told Hindustan Times that in a regular patrol, forest officials found a temporary camp constructed by Indian Reserve Battalion, Mizoram near the state border on Assam’s land.“It was found on June 29 and the forest officials informed us about it. Following the demarcation based on the Survey of India map, we found that it was on Assam’s land so we removed it accordingly,” he said.The next day they held a discussion with the deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police of Kolasib district of Mizoram. Both of them agreed to follow the demarcation based on the Survey of India.Some locals did not want to follow this and tried to create tension again on July 1 and we had to deploy our forces in the area,” he added.According to the locals in Hailakandi, some groups from Mizoram regularly try to construct makeshift bases in the name of Covid-19 testing centres.In this process, they get engaged in a war of words with the people of Assam and the situation often worsens. In the past, several houses were burnt by unknown miscreants along the border area. Local people alleged that it was done by people coming from Mizoram. Many residents moved to other parts of Hailakandi district from the border areas due to these regular incidents.Meanwhile, Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Assam police’s southern range, Debajyoti Mukherjee, said, there is no tension in the area.“Our duty is to protect the common people and keep the law and order situation normal. There have been several attempts in past to encroach Assam’s land from Mizoram’s side. We cannot allow any such attempts. We have a boundary demarcated by the Survey of India and following that, our offices are doing their duty. It’s a forest area and it is the department of forest which has to look at these issues. The police department will definitely support them, our officials are keeping strict vigil”, he said.Similar attempts were made in Lailapur area in Cachar district of Assam on July 2. According to forest officials, some people from Mizoram tried to destroy the forest on Assam’s land. Locals informed the officials and when they reached, Mizoram police personnel got engaged in an argument with them. A team of police led by Superintendent of police, Cachar district, Vaibhav Chandrakant Nimbalkar, rushed to the area and tried to control the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fresh-tension-along-assam-mizoram-border-over-covid-19-testing-center-101625327520936.html
03-07-2021||Mumbai||‘State can’t provide everything to homeless, beggars’: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court on Saturday said that homeless people and beggars should work for the nation as the state cannot provide them with every amenity. The division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni made the observation while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Brijesh Aarya. Aarya’s PIL sought directions to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) asking the civic body to provide three nutritious meals, potable water, shelter and clean public toilets for homeless persons, beggars and poor people in the city.The court told the petitioner that beggars and homeless people should also work for the country and allowing further help is an invitation to refrain from working completely. “They (homeless persons) should also work for the country. Everyone is working. Everything cannot be provided by the state. You (petitioner) are just increasing the population of this section of the society,” the high court told the petitioner. The court however asked the Maharashtra government to consider allowing people belonging to this section to use toilet facilities free of charge.“We direct the state government to look if the homeless persons can use these toilets free of charge,” the court said. It told the petitioner that the petition lacks details of who a homeless person is, population of homeless persons in the city and other details.The civic body informed the court that food packets were being distributed to the people belonging to this section of the society all over Mumbai with help from NGOs. The BMC further said that sanitary napkins are being provided to women belonging to these sections of the society as well. The court accepted this submission. It also said that no further direction is required to augment the distribution.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-can-t-provide-everything-to-homeless-beggars-bombay-hc-101625327021749.html

The duo’s bodies — with bullet injuries in their heads — were found about 1pm. The victims had checked-in, together, about 8.30am and had taken the room for a few hours. Around noon, when the duo did not open their door despite repeated calls from the hotel staff, the police were informed. Rambagh station house officer (SHO) Narayan Singh reached the spot with his team and broke open the hotel room door. “When we broke in, we found the bodies with blood scattered all around. A revolver has been recovered from the spot,” the SHO said. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar said, “The revolver seized from the spot belongs to the boy’s father. Investigation suggests that the boy gunned down the girl, before killing himself with the same revolver. We are registering a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the boy.”“As the girl was minor, the hotel was not supposed to rent them the room. The staff took only the boy’s identity card. A case will be registered against the hotel management. The victims had entered the hotel with their own will,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/boy-girl-found-dead-in-amritsar-hotel-room-101625326918175.html

Over 5,000 convicts and an equal number of undertrials were released to reduce rush in jails, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state’s jails are horrendously overcrowded with a capacity to hold 23,500 inmates. Even after the decongestion, 24,000 still remained in the gallows.Additional director general of police (ADGP), prisons, Praveen Kumar Sinha said, “Around 160 prisoners have, so far, jumped their parole across the state.” Most inmates, who were given the relaxation, were above 65 and suffering from co-morbidities. Those convicted or charged with murder, rape, snatching by theft, acid attack, POCSO Act, UAPA, Explosives Act & foreign nationals were not even considered.In Amritsar, 30 prisoners have failed to returnIn Amritsar Central Jail, 30 prisoners have jumped their parole and interim bail. The jail authorities have written to police stations concerned for registration of cases against all those who have failed to return.Two such cases, under Sections of the Prisons Act, were registered in Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts on Saturday. The first case has been lodged against an accused, Gurjant Singh of Jiobala village, in Tarn Taran, who was facing a case under murder and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Sarwan Singh of Padhri village in Amritsar, is also on trial under attempt to murder charges. These two had to present themselves in a designated Pathankot jail with their negative covid-19 test in April.A spokesperson of the Punjab prisons department, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “Many prisoners are jumping their paroles and interim bails, we have sought data of all such cases.”The prisoners released on special parole and bails have been asked to start surrendering in batches by following the first-out first-in formulae. Amritsar jail superintendent Arshdeep Singh Gill said, “All those who are not returning are being booked in police stations near their residences.”A jail official added some of the prisoners are getting messages late, but they are returning to the designated prisons with an average delay of 5-6 dates from their scheduled dates. “We write to the police stations concerned for the registration of a case, in case the prisoner does not return within ten days of receiving the message,” Gill added. Prisoners released on special parole during Covid-19 pandemic are required to report at designated jails — Barnala and Pathankot for males, and Malerkotla for females — with a negative Covid-19 test report dated within three days before the date of their return. If any prisoner on parole tests positive before returning, he or she has to inform their jail superintendent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-effect-160-prisoners-released-to-reduce-rush-in-jails-jump-parole-101625324758033.html

What these experts suggest is that people will have to learn living with Covid-19. While this may be true for many metro cities that were at the frontline of the pandemic, the experts have commented specifically for Delhi. There might be zero new case reported on a certain day, but it is unlikely for the Capital to have zero number of people with the infection, experts said.Medical director of Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital Dr Suresh Kumar has told PTI that zero is an unlikely figure for Delhi as the virus is mutating and it's difficult to predict its future."This virus is smart and just for the sake of living, it will keep mutating. Covid will be there and may not be affecting all 193 countries but it will be there. Coming down to zero won't be achievable. In hospitals for getting surgeries, one has to get tested for Hepatitis and HIV. Eventually, you will be tested for Covid too," Dr Sanjeev K. Singh, Resident Medical Director, Amrita Hospitals in Faridabad said, as quoted by the news agency.Eradicating the virus is an unrealistic possibility as Covid-19 will gradually become endemic in 12-24 months, Dr Gauri Agarwal has said. It will not remain a figure closely watched daily but will remain there.On Monday, Delhi recorded 59 cases, the lowest single-day rise this year, and two deaths. Since then, daily cases have been hovering around 90. Both in the first and the second wave, the Capital was caught by the deadly blow of the pandemic. During the second wave, oxygen shortage aggravated the severity of the situation if the Capital.What is pandemic, epidemic, endemic?An epidemic is when a disease affects a large number of people and when it affects multiple countries or continents, it becomes a pandemic. Endemic is when a disease is regularly found among a particular people or in a particular area.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/zero-covid-19-case-not-possible-in-delhi-experts-explain-why-101625323018145.html
03-07-2021||Dehradun||5 key challenges before new Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami||45-year-old Pushkar Singh Dhami, the new chief minister of Uttarakhand, has many challenges ahead of him at a time when the assembly elections are less than a year away, political observers say.First, being the youngest CM of the state, who has never held any ministerial position, the question is how will he deal with political veterans in his party, many of whom were in the race for the CM post. Will he be able to assert himself before them and get his orders and vision for the party implemented?SMA Kazmi, Dehradun based political analyst said that BJP seems to have played its biggest gamble ahead of the elections by making a comparatively younger politician who doesn’t have much experience of the governance or party politics, as the new CM of the state. “With very little time left for the elections, I wonder whether he really has to perform or make some difference. He will also have to deal with political mess and issues from the past. Creating rapport with senior party colleagues and cadre will be one of his biggest challenges,” he said.Second, he has little time to perform, with elections scheduled early next year. Political observers say it will take him at least four to five months to get acquainted with the functioning of the government and the secretariat. In such little time, he has a lot on his plate and less experience when compared to the other veteran politicians in his party. Being from US Nagar, he also has little time for creating rapport with the party cadre and people from other regions of the state, especially the Garhwal region.Third, if he will be able to check infighting in the party and different voices coming up from different power centres in the party. Being junior to other veterans, it is to be seen if he will be able to intervene and resolve the differences within the party leaders or the ministers. In the past few months, former CMs Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat were seen indulging in shadow boxing over the alleged Mahakumbh testing scam.Political analyst and professor of political science in Garhwal Central University, MM Semwal said the biggest challenge before him would be “to work in coordination with the senior leaders of BJP who were overlooked for the CM position.”Fourth, Dhami will have to deal with issues and discontent that emerged during the tenures of the two previous CMs. How he deals with that needs to be seen. There has been growing discontent among the people on issues ranging from growing unemployment in the state, hill migration, people from various sectors seeking relief packages for economic losses due to Covid-19, poor health infrastructure in hill districts and improving the health infrastructure in the state. He also will have to make his stand clear on whether Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board will be scrapped or not. The preceding two CMs differed on the same.Also read: ‘Sad his father isn’t with us to see him as CM’ - Pushkar Singh Dhami’s motherFinally, a Thakur by caste, it is to be seen if he will be pitted against veteran Thakur leader from Congress Harish Rawat. Will he be able to have a state-wide sway within his caste and in general among the people as Harish Rawat is yet to be seen. Harish Rawat is one of the most popular political faces in the state, Dhami’s people connecting skills are likely to be pitted against the veteran Congress leader.“By electing Dhami, the BJP leadership did a surgical strike on its own senior state leaders which include the likes of Bansidhar Bhagat, Harak Singh Rawat, Satpal Maharaj, Dhan Singh Rawat, Harak Singh Rawat and Yashpal Arya. Dhami would have a tough time working in coordination with them ahead of next year’s assembly elections,” said Semwal.Semwal also cited Dhami’s lack of administrative experience as another major challenge in his tenure. “Due to his inexperience, he would largely have to rely on the bureaucracy in his short tenure.”The senior political analyst further said that the new CM would also face the challenge of “clearing the mess created by the previous two CMs whether it be the alleged Mahakumbh fake Covid test or the Covid-19 mismanagement in the state.”“Not only this, he would practically have nothing new to take before the public ahead of elections as all the major announcements, including recruitment on 22,000 vacancies and distribution of laptops of school students, were made by previous CM Tirath Singh Rawat before putting down his papers on Friday night,” said Semwal.He also said, “Dhami would also have to take a decision on whether to continue with or abolish the controversial Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board against which the priest community has been protesting for long.”Semwal however, also termed the election as new CM as a golden opportunity for the 45-year-old legislator who would be the state’s youngest CM.“Despite the challenges, he would be the CM which is a golden opportunity for him to leave a mark on the party and the public with his works. In the nutshell, his short tenure would not be smooth but at the same time not too uneven,” he said.Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson, however, said that he is confident that being a young and dynamic leader, Dhami will meet the challenges ahead of him in the election year. “In BJP, we believe in working collectively and facing all challenges collectively. He is not there as an individual but represents our collective approach,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/5-key-challenges-before-new-uttarakhand-cm-pushkar-singh-dhami-101625323978118.html

The quantity of heroin seized has increased to 260kg on further searching of the containers.“The total consignment of heroin that has been seized from the container ordered by Prabhjit Singh, 25, of Chohla Sahib village, is now pegged at 260kg. Prabhjit, who the DRI arrested on Friday, has been taken to the spot where the seizure was made,” said a senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named.“We are assisting the DRI team. Over the past five years, since he entered the import business, the accused has accumulated huge wealth. We have sought detailed record of properties registered in the name of Prabhjit and his family members from the revenue department. He has built a palatial bungalow in his village. Previously, he owned just 4 acre,” the official added. He added that the police had confirmed that Prabhjit was in contact with a family in Dhun Dhaye Wala village, which is notorious for drug smuggling. “We are investigating the accused’s local links. An influential religious leader of Punjab also used to visit the accused’s home, where a special room was designed for his stay. To date, the accused does not appear to have a criminal record,” he added. Tarn Taran SSP Dhruman H Nimbale said they would question the accused, once the DRI completes its questioning. He, however, refused to share information on the DRI’s investigation. Sources added Prabhjit also had links with some leaders of the ruling party. He ran and agriculture implement store and had been importing gypsum and other items from Pakistan and Afghanistan through the Attari-Wagah border. “He had ordered this container of gypsum through sea-route as the Attari-Wagah border has been closed for trade between India and Pakistan since the abrogation od Article 370,” the source added. The DRI team had also rounded up a relative of Prabhjit, but he was released after questioning, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/heroin-haul-at-port-now-260kg-revenue-intelligence-team-takes-tarn-taran-importer-to-navi-mumbai-101625323918111.html

Punjab and Haryana high court lawyer HC Arora had brought the issue to the tribunal notice, stating that no public auction was conducted for the sale of trees, and the trees were suddenly felled in a “hush-hush manner” within two days on June 18 and 19.In the application filed with the NGT, Arora said that the gram panchayat of Roshanpur village had got the price of 176 trees of various species assessed from the divisional forest officer, Patiala. According to the assessment, ₹2.60 lakh was the reserve price, he stated. “However, the joint inspection team of gram panchayat and forest department deliberately did not include about 20 neem trees in its inspection, but those neem trees were also cut down, in a fraudulent manner, thereby misappropriating government funds,” Arora had further alleged.He had also alleged that all fully grown trees standing on the premises of a local government school were axed and sold, without any justification. In its order issued on June 30, the NGT said: “Undoubtedly, cutting of trees can be allowed only for some valid justification after requisite clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Such action adversely affects the environment. Thus, the grievance needs to be looked into and further remedial action taken by principal chief conservator of forests, Punjab, in accordance with law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-orders-inquiry-into-felling-of-176-trees-in-patiala-village-101625322058931.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Man beaten to death on suspicion of sacrilege at Gurdaspur gurdwara||A gurdwara managing committee head is among two people booked for murder after a General Reserve Engineer Force personnel was beaten to death on the suspicion of sacrilege at the shrine situated on the outskirts of Gurdaspur. The victim, identified as Deepak, belonged to Larhi Sharmo village in Pathankot and was posted in Arunachal Pradesh. He had reportedly returned by air and was on his way home from Amritsar, when by mistake he got off the bus at Gurdaspur instead of Pathankot on Thursday night. Seeing the gurdwara, situated on the Tibri road, he had entered it to take rest. It was then that he was brutally beaten up by some locals on the suspicion that he was there to commit sacrilege, said police on the basis of initial probe. Gurjit Singh Saini, who is the chief of the gurdwara managing committee, has been named as the prime accused in the FIR registered in the case, besides Daljit Singh, a local. Both are on the run.“No sacrilege was committed. It’s possible the people who thrashed him mistook him for someone else who was there to commit it. We can attain clarity only after arresting and questioning the prime accused,” said Nanak Singh, senior superintendent of police, Gurdaspur.Semeer Singh, the area station house officer, said that as per the locals, Deepak was drunk when he entered the gurdwara premises. “The postmortem report is awaited to verify it. We are also trying to procure CCTV footage of the incident,” he said.The Gurdaspur police had initially registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, but it was converted to that of murder on Saturday, on demands made by the victim’s family.Meanwhile, local Sikh bodies are backing Daljit and terming him innocent. “As far as Daljit is concerned, he was present on the spot when police reached there and the grieving family named him in the complaint,” said the SSP, while also denying allegations of detaining and harassing his mother. Also dispelling the rumours of custodial death, the SHO said police had rushed Deepak to hospital in a critical condition, and he later succumbed to his injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/man-beaten-to-death-on-suspicion-of-sacrilege-at-gurdaspur-gurdwara-101625322057779.html
03-07-2021||Lucknow||A clean sweep for BJP in UP zila panchayat chairperson polls||Amid leaked videos, visuals and claims of misuse of official machinery, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged victorious in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls on Saturday with candidates backed by the party winning 67 of the 75 seats.The party won 21 of these seats unopposed after the Opposition candidates in many cases joined the ruling BJP overnight and withdrew from the contest. Even before the official results were out, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya declared a win.“Kaho dil se, 2022 pe bhajapa phir se (say with heart, BJP again in 2022 UP polls),” Maurya tweeted.The “kaho dil se, Akhilesh phir se” is the Samajwadi Party’s tagline for UP polls. The BJP, having lost the zila panchayat ward members’ poll in April to the Samajwadi Party (SP), was desperate to make amends in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls.Only the SP and its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) put up any resistance from the Opposition ranks. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) boycotted the elections, citing misuse of official machinery while the Congress lost the only seat it contested in Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha bastion of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.The SP, which won its stronghold Etawah unopposed, registered a one-sided victory in Azamgarh, the Lok Sabha constituency of party chief Akhilesh Yadav. It also surprised the BJP in Etah, Sant Kabir Nagar and Ballia, but faced reverses in bastions like Mainpuri, Rampur, Kannauj and Ferozabad. It also lost Farrukhabad where the BJP got top SP leader Dharmendra Yadav’s ex-wife Monica Yadav to contest.The RLD won the Baghpat seat where the SP-RLD joint candidate had first gone “missing”, then was said to have withdrawn her papers before an official protest by the party ensured a contest.“The public built moral pressure and didn’t let desperate tactics (by the ruling party) succeed,” said RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary.The SP put out a video, alleging that a senior district administration official in Auraiya was caught conspiring against opposition voters.In Chandauli, another video that went viral showed former SP MP Ram Kishan Yadav touching the feet of zila panchayat ward members to secure the party win.“He is known for dramatics,” said local SP leader Chandrashekhar Yadav and alleged former MP Ram Kishan conspired against the party.Such conspiracy theories also circulated in Lucknow where the BJP, with just three zila panchayat ward members, defeated the SP candidate who had claimed more zila panchayat members by its side. In these polls, zila panchayat ward members vote.“The local administration abducted my brother Arun Rawat, a zila panchayat ward member,” Arun’s brother Tarun said in a video put up by the Samajwadi Party.“The SP has forgotten its own past when 36 of its candidates won unopposed in these elections in 2015 when it was in power,” said UP BJP vice president Daya Shankar Singh.The BJP also prevailed over rebels. In Unnao, party candidate Shakun Singh defeated rebel candidate Arun Singh. Here, the SP had expelled its official candidate for siding with the BJP. In Muzaffarnagar, Union minister and local MP Sanjeev Balyan, who was tasked with managing the election, ensured the BJP candidate’s win over his cousin who was the joint opposition candidate.The elections also revealed interesting alliances and withdrawals. In Jaunpur, BJP’s ally Apna Dal withdrew from the race in support of independent candidate Srikala Reddy, wife of former MP Dhananjay Singh, and she won the election.In Ghazipur, two members who had won on the backing of Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), supported the BJP. Owaisi’s party is planning to contest 100 seats in the 2022 UP assembly polls.“AIMIM’s nexus with BJP now lies exposed,” said Congress’ Surendra Rajput.In Amethi, the BJP won against the SP even as the Congress failed to even put up a candidate. The Congress lost Amethi to the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.In Pratapgarh, the BJP “tactfully” boycotted the elections in support of former minister and local heavyweight Raghuraj Pratap Singh, aka Raja Bhaiya, whose candidate Madhuri Patel won as a nominee of the Jansatta Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/a-clean-sweep-for-bjp-in-up-zila-panchayat-chairperson-polls-101625320977930.html

Talking to ANI, Geeta also thanked the people of Khatima, his constituency.Hailing his middle-class background, Geeta further told ANI that Dhami is “aware of the problems of people.”Soon after the announcement of Pushkar Singh Dhami as the new chief minister, celebrations broke out outside his home in Khatima. According to visuals shared by ANI, Geeta was seen feeding sweets to family members while people danced by playing dhols outside Dhami’s house.Addressing the media, the new chief minister said that his party (BJP) has appointed a “common worker, the son of an ex-serviceman, who was born in Pithoragarh to serve the state.”"My party has always kept me under its wings, just like my mother. I consider myself fortunate enough that the party gave me this opportunity. I pledge to serve people even in remote areas of the state," Dhami told ANI, adding that he will discuss the Cabinet changes later.45-year-old Pushkar Singh Dhami became the third chief minister of Uttarakhand, succeeding Tirath Singh Rawat, in nearly four months. On Saturday, about 57 state BJP MLAs met at the party headquarters in the capital city of Dehradun to choose the next CM of the state. Notably, Uttarakhand will go to the polls early next year.Outgoing chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, who was sworn in as the state head on March 10, resigned from the post amid uncertainty over by-polls that was mandatory for him to win to continue as the chief minister.Meanwhile, BJP leader and union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that Pushkar Singh Dhami will take the oath as Uttarakhand’s new chief minister on Sunday, ANI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/sad-his-father-isn-t-with-us-to-see-him-as-cm-pushkar-singh-dhami-s-mother-101625318706702.html
03-07-2021||Bangalore||Ex-serviceman, mother of two set out on 6000-km tandem cycling trip||As pandemic and lockdowns pushed many towards a sedentary lifestyle, two cycling enthusiasts – one from Bengaluru and another Nashik – have embarked on a nearly 6000-kilometre-long journey on a tandem bicycle in a bid to promote cycling.A 44-year-old mother of two and a 48-year-old ex-serviceman on Saturday reached New Delhi after cycling for more than 14 days. Meera Velankar from Bengaluru and Dinkar Patil from Nashik started from Bengaluru on June 19 to cover the entire ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ which would nearly be a 6000-kilometre-long trip.The journey will take them through 12 states and will pass through Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, New Delhi, Lucknow, Calcutta, Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatanam and Chennai before returning to Bengaluru.“I’ve always loved a good challenge and since I had done a cycle ride from Kanyakumari to Kashmir in October last year, I wanted to cover the Golden Quadrilateral on a tandem bicycle. It was doing this time, I heard about Dinkar, and I asked him if he wanted to do this ride. We knew it was difficult, but that was the most exciting part about it,” said Velankar, who holds a PhD in life sciences.Patil, an ex-serviceman, who currently heads security at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited at Nashik in Maharashtra says he was initially reluctant about the offer but Velankar’s enthusiasm convinced him. “A soldier is always up for challenges and I took this one as well,” he said.Tandem cycling is difficult than normal cycling, according to them. “For starters, the tandem bicycles available in India are very basic because touring on them is not popular. At the same time, getting along as a team is very important too. Dinkar rides fast and my pace was different. It could use few days to get the rhythm and once that is done, the teamwork makes you very proud,” she said.The duo covers around 150-200 kilometres every day. The routes they have covered came with their own challenges as well. “It takes a lot of mental and physical effort to cover these distances. Around Bengaluru, the terrain had a lot of elevation, near Mumbai the rain slowed us down and towards Rajasthan, the heat and the traffic were a nightmare,” she said.But Velankar says the support from the people keeps them going. “Of course, there is a lot of curiosity. In some places, since we were wearing riding gear and riding a tandem bicycle, people thought were part of the circus,” she said. “But in most of the places, we find that people could relate to the effort we are putting. They understand how challenging this is and they motivate us,” she added.More than holding or setting records in tandem cycling, Velankar says she wants to chronicle the experience of travelling the country on a tandem bicycle.The lockdowns across the several states posed some problems to their efforts, especially in Rajasthan where they couldn’t ride during the day, but at night. “But the good thing is that the highways were not overcrowded, which made our trip easier,” said Patil.Do they feel like giving at times? Almost, says Velankar. “There are days when a thought why did I start this journey creeps in, but then you keep yourself motivated. And most importantly, if Dinakar or I stop this journey halfway, the other person will be stranded on the road with a cycle that can’t be paddled by one person or transported in a normal vehicle because of this size,” said Velankar.“So, it is also essential not to irritate your riding partner too much either,” she added with a laugh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/exserviceman-mother-of-two-set-out-on-6000-km-tandem-cycling-trip-101625319057903.html
03-07-2021||Pune||Visual storytelling through sounds||Sameer Dhamangaonkar approached me through a friend around eight years back. He was an IT professional with a stable job, and family. He, along with a few of his friends, had started a venture named “Snovel” wherein they would create audio CDs of popular books in Marathi. I had heard about them and also the concept of audio books. It had just started gathering steam in India and “Snovel” was one of the, if not the, first to venture in Marathi. I met with Sameer and he explained that he felt that the practice of reading books has started waning. Apart from the obvious benefits of increasing a person’s ability to visualise, improve the vocabulary, capacity of concentration and widening the reader’s horizons of knowledge, books are a form of entertainment too. The options of entertainment, like radio or television, started cropping up in the last few decades of the previous century and shot up with the advent of computer and internet, finally culminating in mobile devices on the palms of our hands. The habit of reading thus took a beating and affected book sales too. The changes in lifestyle through the decades and the quest for instant gratification has to be mentioned too. Books in regional languages, like Marathi, were especially affected as their reader base is smaller to begin with. So, in an effort to conserve books, Sameer and “Snovel” had purchased the rights to a few books in Marathi and had roped in some big names to read them. They received a positive response from many quarters and they were now planning their first big project – “Raarang Dhaang”. Written by Prabhakar Pendharkar, “Raarang Dhaang” is an immensely popular novel in Marathi. Set in the 70s, it is the story of a principled, young civil engineer named Vishwanath who is doing extremely well in his high-paying corporate job. He leaves that job and joins the Indian Army as a short service commissioned officer for the Border Road Organisation, to build roads in the Himalayan ranges. The book starts with him travelling through the terrain and getting introduced to huge mountains, locally called as “Dhaangs” and finally seeing “Raarang Dhaang”, the highest and most dangerous of the lot, through which he is supposed to build a tunnel. The book explores the difference in working styles of Vishwanath and his seniors, the beautiful but deadly terrain, his interaction with the locals, letter correspondence with his father and the girl he is in love with and his struggle to stay true with his work ethic while following military orders. The book is a page turner and transports the reader to the Himalayas! After I read it, I realised that this was a mammoth task. There were so many characters, locations, descriptions! All this had to be conveyed without boring the listeners. The entire experience can be brought about only by a meticulous sound design, which will make the listeners feel as if they are on the site of a road construction job in the Himalayas during the day and in pin drop silence of the mountains at night. They should not only be on the emotional journey of the characters, but also be able to feel that atmosphere. And all this had to be achieved through sounds only! I had listened to the previous works of “Snovel” and they were mostly short-stories which had been narrated, with different voices for the dialogues of the characters with some sound design and music. While it worked for that format, making an audio book of a novel was going to be a different ball-game. I met with Sameer and pitched my idea – adapting the book into the audio format. I was of the opinion that just like books which were adapted into films, this book will need to be adapted into an audio book. There will have to be modifications, like there are while changing the format and proper scenes will have to be written. Merely reading it out by a celebrity will not do justice to it. Fortunately, even he was onboard, though it was a departure from their earlier works. But we all were excited nonetheless! Then came one of the hardest parts of the entire process – writing the script! I had a go at it right away and made tremendous progress. The entire book was converted into nearly sixty-two large scenes. I trained myself to write detailed sounds to create the world. It is fun to even remember that process! But, when I read it out aloud for the first time, we all agreed that it was missing something. It had all the elements of the book, but nobody could pinpoint what was missing, including me. I went back to the basics – reading the book again. This time, I found the key. It was in the preface! The writer mentions that he had first written the book as a first- person narrative and upon reading its manuscript, had received feedback from an eminent scholar that it might work better if the story was told in the third person. He made that change and found out that it worked beautifully. I thought maybe this was the change I was looking for! Since we were changing the medium of telling the story, maybe we needed to tell it in the first-person format. So, I added a narrator – the aged Vishwanath who was telling the story after thirty odd years. And suddenly, everything fell in place. With the script now working, I began casting for it and working on its music and sound design to bring the audio experience to life!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/visual-storytelling-through-sounds-101625317556996.html
03-07-2021||Kolkata||TMC leader allegedly administers Covid-19 vaccine, draws flak||A Trinamool Congress leader in West Bengal allegedly administered the Covid-19 vaccine to a woman at a government vaccination camp in Asansol on Saturday drawing from the opposition, HT has learnt. The state health department has sought a report from the district's chief medical officer of health on the incident within three days.Tabassum Ara, outgoing deputy mayor of the Asansol Municipal Corporation (AMC), who was at the centre of the controversy, however, said that she never administered the vaccine and just posed with it to raise awareness.“I never pushed the injection. I just posed with the syringe to take a picture so that it could encourage others,” Ara told reporters.The incident allegedly took place at a vaccination camp organised by the AMC at a red-light area in Kulti. While the drive was going on Ara, took a syringe from nursing staff and allegedly gave the vaccine to a woman.“I received the vaccine. The woman who gave me the shot was not a doctor or a nurse,” said the woman who received the vaccine.It triggered a controversy, particularly at a time when the BJP has been attacking the ruling TMC in West Bengal over a fake vaccination racket recently busted by the Kolkata Police.“TMC supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee plays the role of a doctor, engineer and scientist singlehandedly. The party leaders are also like that. She (Ara) has just maintained the tradition of the TMC,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP’s Bengal unit.The TMC, however, tried to downplay the allegations saying that even quacks are now being roped in.“If any such incident has happened, the state and district administration would have to look into it. But in our country, even quacks are being recognised. Do they have any certificate? If they can be roped into the health infrastructure, then I don’t think that hue and cry should be raised if a person, out of enthusiasm, gives the right vaccine shot. But yes, the one who is administering the vaccine should have the knowledge without which it could be dangerous,” said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, TMC MP.The incident has also drawn flak from the doctors who said that the receiver could develop complications if the dose is not injected properly.A senior doctor of the AMC said, “This is beyond the system. Only health workers are supposed to administer the vaccine.”“I don’t know whether she has received any training. But a public figure need not give a dose to raise awareness. Covid-19 vaccination is a deep intra-muscular vaccine. Without training, it may end up in the wrong position. This may trigger complications,” Manas Gumta, state general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors, said.Outgoing mayor Amarnath Chatterjee said that he has sought a report from the AMC chief health officer. Chatterjee has also issued show-cause notice to Ara, a doctor and two nurses present at the vaccination camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-leader-allegedly-administers-covid-19-vaccine-draws-flak-101625317438737.html

His motive is to increase oxygen in the atmosphere, HT has learnt.Abhinab Deb, a Class 3 student at Delhi Public School’s Silchar unit, hails from Borjalenga area under Assam’s Dholai constituency. Being a tree-lover, he never allows the felling of any tree at his house or the neighbouring areas. Since he heard about issues of lack of oxygen among the Covid-19 infected patients, he pledged to increase oxygen in the atmosphere by planting trees. Deb has requested his parents to help him protect the saplings.Talking about his initiative, the nine-year-old said, “I have heard that people are dying because of lack of oxygen. My teachers have said that trees are the only source of oxygen and we can increase oxygen by planting and preserving the trees. I want to protect each and every tree in our area and would also like to plant more and more. I have started planting saplings on my birthday and this will go on still I make my entire area full of valuable trees.”His father, Ajoy Deb, is a businessman and also a social activist. “Abhinab is always conscious about plants and their lives. He creates pressure on us to plant new saplings and never allows felling any tree in our house. He has a lot of queries about how trees generate oxygen and what is the impact of cutting the trees. Even his teachers say that they are a bit scared of his questions. But, at this age, Abhinab is a positive thinker and as a father, it is my responsibility to support him.”Abhinab was planning the plantation drive for several months but it was on his 9th birthday on Friday when the family started with the planting. They are planning to plant saplings along a 2.5-kilometre road which starts from Chotojalenga Part-2 and ends at Nagathal village. Along with the family members, some locals have also joined their forces in fulfilling the little boy’s dream.Bulti Deb, Abhinab’s mother, informed that her son is also against the killing of animals. She said that he doesn’t support the killing of animals for food. He loves fruits and prefers eating vegetarian items.“Initially we used to laugh at him and tried to convince him but now he has started convincing us with his determination. We have learnt that it is not always the seniors who teach the kids about good values. Sometimes the kids also teach us great lessons with their innocent ideas. My husband and I are supporting his initiative of growing more trees in our area. It is just a small step with a big dream,” she said.Borjalenga comes under Assam forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya’s constituency. There are villages where people have started growing available trees with the help of the forest department. There is a tea garden under the Dholai constituency named Jalinga, which is keeping a 225-hectares-long rainforest to preserve valuable trees. The forest is also home to some rare species of birds and animals.Owner of the tea garden, Ketan Patel, said, “We are keeping the forest untouched where we have several valuable trees. Besides, many rare birds and animals are also being protected in the land. There are rare trees like Himalayan Rudraksha and many other. Forest officials visit the rainforest to look after the rare birds and animals living here”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-boy-plants-1-000-saplings-to-boost-oxygen-amid-pandemic-101625316720720.html
03-07-2021||Kolkata||Bengal government’s Covid-19 portal ‘Benvax’ comes under central scanner||The Covid-19 digital portal launched by the West Bengal government has come under the scanner of the Union government, following allegations of irregularities raised by the leader of the opposition (LoP) of the state’s legislative assembly. Senior health officials of the Mamata Banerjee administration, however, said that the portal ‘Benvax’ is integrated with the centre’s CoWIN app, which forms the backbone of the Covid-19 vaccine drive. “LOP, WB Assembly Sh @SuvenduWB Ji visited Delhi yesterday to discuss repercussions of an alternative digital platform, not authorised by GoI, allegedly being used in WB to carry out #VaccinationDrive. The matter is being investigated,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted late on Friday night. The tweet came a day after, BJP legislator Suvendu Adhikari sent a letter to Vardhan alleging that in some vaccination camps in West Bengal the CoWin registration aren’t being sought and people were being given vaccination certificates with the photo of chief minister Mamata Banerjee through Benvax portal. “Such a move shall give wind to distrust regarding #VaccinationDrive, not to mention difficulties people may face in verifying authenticity of inoculation,” tweeted Vardhan. Top health officials of the state health department, however, rubbished the charges and clarified that the Benvax portal was integrated with the CoWin app on a real-time basis, with some additional features. “Benvax, which an initiative of the West Bengal government is integrated on a real-time basis with the centre’s CoWIN. One gets the vaccine certificate from Benvax only after registration with the CoWIN. The recipient gets all the SMS and certificate from CoWIN. Benvax gives them an additional certificate with the chief minister’s photo and has some additional features like sending SMS for the second dose after importing data from CoWIN and also helps to identify some groups like the super spreaders,” said a senior official of the state health department. While the certificate downloaded from CoWIN has a photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the certificate downloaded from Benvax bears a photo of CM Mamata Banerjee. Meanwhile, the Centre has asked the West Bengal government to file a report by Thursday in the fake Covid-19 vaccination camps busted by the Kolkata Police last week even as the Calcutta high court directed the state to file an affidavit in the matter by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-government-s-covid-19-portal-benvax-comes-under-central-scanner-101625315639648.html

03-07-2021||Patna||SEC gears to advance Bihar panchayat poll schedule by holding election from August||The State Election Commission (SEC), mandated to hold the panchayat polls in Bihar, is all set to advance the schedule of holding the election to the three-tier local bodies by starting the poll process from August so that the exercise could be completed by October end, officials said.People privy to the development in the SEC said that the first phase of the panchayat polls would start from the end of August and the rest of the phases of the ten-phased polls would be conducted till October end. “We are going to start the panchayat poll process from August. The poll process would be completed by October. We are working in this direction,” said secretary, SEC, Yogendra Ram.Officials said reports from district magistrates are being sought to finalise the schedule of poll dates and a proposal in this regard would be sent to the state government soon for cabinet approval following which the notification of the poll process would be done.The panchayat polls, scheduled to be held in March and April, were deferred owing to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and litigation over the non-availability of electronic voting machines. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has already given the nod for use of single post EVMs (M2 model) in the forthcoming panchayat polls, the first such exercise to be conducted in local bodies elections in Bihar.The SEC, in last few weeks, has also worked on the strategy of holding polls in flood-prone areas in the last few phases depending on the severity of floods usually experienced in north Bihar districts in July and August, a departure from its previous planning to hold the polls after the rainy season in September.“If in case, there are floods in some districts or blocks, we will hold the polls there in the last few phases. We have already asked the DMs to identify such blocks which are flood-prone or quite remote where accessibility is difficult,” said another SEC official.On Saturday, SEC officials held a video conferencing with all district magistrates to take stock of the ongoing process to requisition electronic voting machines (EVMs) from different states, polling stations and the process of first level checking of EVMs.Sources said the SEC has set the target of completing the process of first level checking of EVMs by mid-July and already tagged nodal officers from districts to get the EVMs from different states in the next couple of weeks.The SEC has assessed that around 8.5 lakh EVMs would be required for multi-phase polls having a total number of 1.15 lakh polling stations and around six crore electorate. A total of 2.58 lakh posts in the three-tier local bodies, including gram kutcheries, would be elected in the polls.At present, all the three-tier local bodies are being run through advisory committees following an ordinance brought to empower such bodies for six months as an arrangement to run the local self-government institutions after their five-year term ended on June 15 this year.Meanwhile, additional chief secretary, panchayati raj department, Amrit Lal Meena, said that a decision on holding the polls and finalization of dates has to be done by the SEC.Vaccination for panchayat members to be voluntary. The SEC will be issuing an advisory to all those participating in the panchayat polls, including candidates, to get Covid-19 vaccines instead of making jabs of the coronavirus disease mandatory for the aspiring candidates or those seeking re-election, as proposed by the panchayat raj department minister Samrat Choudhary.The reason is said to be legal issues as a mandatory provision for those contesting polls would require necessary provisioning of rules in the Bihar panchayat election rules, 2006. Officials said the poll panel also has taken into account the fact that the entire vaccination drive in the country is a voluntary exercise where both state and central government are appealing to people to get the jabs.“We are already asking the DMs and field officers engaged in panchayat polls to create awareness among the rural population to get Covid vaccines so that they are safe and protected when they participate in the polls. We are hopeful the vaccination drive already underway would cover a large section of the population, especially in rural areas ahead of the polls,” said SEC, secretary Yogendra Ram.A few weeks back, panchayati raj department minister Choudhary advocated that the SEC should consider making Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for all those keen on contesting polls reasoning that it would give a fillip to the vaccination drive in rural areas where vaccine hesitancy is rampant, and also help in inoculating a large section of the state’s population in next few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sec-gears-to-advance-bihar-panchayat-poll-schedule-by-holding-election-from-august-101625314257654.html
03-07-2021||Mumbai||P305 barge tragedy: Director of shipping company, 2 others arrested by Mumbai Police||Yellow Gate police in south Mumbai on Friday late night arrested three key management members of Papaa Shipping Company Pvt Ltd, Vile Parle, in connection with accommodation barge Papaa305 (P305) that had capsized in the Arabian Sea during Cyclone Tauktae on May 17, resulting in the loss of 75 lives.Deputy commissioner of police (port zone) Ganesh Shinde confirmed the development.Police officers said that the accused – Prasad Ganpat Rane, Nitin Dinanath Singh and Akhilesh Tiwari – acted irresponsibly, and the lives of many onboard were lost because of their negligent acts, and hence they have been arrested on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, endangering life or personal safety of others and common intention.Rane is the manager of Papaa Shipping, while Singh and Tiwari are director and technical superintendent, respectively. A local court has remanded them in police custody till July 8.Of the 261 people on board, the Indian Navy had rescued 186 in one of the most difficult search and rescue operations of recent times.Afcons Infrastructure Private Limited had hired P305 on a rental basis from Durmast Enterprises Limited for work in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) field. Afcons had sub-contracted the works to various companies and had made accommodation arrangements for their workers in barge P305. There were around 23 crew members of Papaa Shipping on the barge along with other employees of other shipping companies. A service contract to Papaa Shipping was given by Durmast Enterprises Limited.“The arrested men were well-aware of the serious warning issued by the authority concerned in connection with Cyclone Tauktae. Despite this, they neither called back their employees from the barge nor did they ask them to shift to a safer place. They were also aware of the decision taken [on the basis of miscalculated judgement] by the barge’s master [which later proved fatal for everyone on the barge]. They could have still called back their employees to safety. But they failed to do so and all of their crew members lost their lives in the incident. Hence, they have been arrested in the case,” said senior inspector Suhas Hemade of Yellow Gate police station. Another director of Papaa Shipping, Shilpa Kanojiya, is also an accused in the case, but has not been arrested yet, Hemade added.Initially, a first information report (FIR) in the matter was registered on May 21 against the master of the barge Rakesh Ballav and some others on the basis of the statement of Mistafizur Rahman Hussain Shaikh, who was part of the maintenance crew of the vessel.Shaikh had accused Ballav and others of overlooking the weather alerts and for failing to take appropriate care despite knowing that the lapse could result in loss of lives.As per the police complaint, the barge was anchored near an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields. Around 11pm on May 16, the wind speed started to increase. An hour later, the wind speed almost doubled, and the crew could hear the sound of the roaring storm. At 2am, two of the eight anchor cables of the barge gave way and the captain send a distress message to a tug boat, which was supposed to be around. However, the boat was about 16 nautical miles away and expressed its inability to move in the stormy weather.In the statement, Shaikh further alleged that at 4am, two more anchor cables broke and the barge started experiencing huge jerks. Eventually by 8am, all the anchors gave way and the barge started drifting when the wind speed was about 60/70 knots. Later, the barge hit a platform around 9.45am and water started gushing inside, following which the captain finally sent a distress signal to the navy and other authorities.The police have recorded the statements of more than 100 survivors, rescued by the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard from barge P305.Afcons Infrastructure, which led the consortium that had chartered the ill-fated barge along with its marine crew, had earlier said that the master of P305 had chosen to stay in the sea near the platform where it was working despite receiving instructions for returning to Mumbai Harbour in the wake of warnings for Cyclone Tauktae.Yellow Gate police are also investigating another FIR, which was registered on June 24 in connection with tug boat Varaprada, which sank on May 17 during Cyclone Tauktae.In that case, the police have booked the owner of the tug boat – Glory Shipmanagment Pvt Ltd – alleging that it did not carry out the required maintenance and repairing works, and their irresponsible act resulted in a tragic incident in which 11 people died. The complainant, Francis K Simon, who was the second engineer of the boat and one of its only two survivors, told the police that due to poor maintenance, the boat was not seaworthy and had also lost its stability on the fateful night and sank leading to the deaths of 11 people. The owner was well-aware of the boat’s defective conditions, he alleged in the FIR. No arrest has been made in this case yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/p305-barge-tragedy-manager-2-directors-of-shipping-company-arrested-by-mumbai-police-101625313716703.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Police use water cannon to quell AAP protest outside Punjab CM’s farmhouse||Punjab Police on Saturday used water cannons to disperse Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers who had gathered to gherao the farm house of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh at Siswan near Chandigarh to protest against the ongoing power crisis in the state. The protesting AAP workers, led by their Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann, raised slogans against the Congress government over the power shortage and tried to break the barricading following which the police resorted to cane-charge. Police personnel were deployed in strength and multi-layered barricades were put up on the road leading to the chief minister’s farmhouse. As scores of AAP workers carrying party flags forced their way through the first layer of barricades and reached the second, police used water cannons to disperse them. Later, the police booked 23 AAP leaders and 200 unknown supporters for flouting Covid-19 safety norms. The protestors had gathered in large numbers without wearing masks or observing social distancing. Those named in the FIR include Bhagwant Mann, leader of opposition Harpal Cheema and MLAs Meet Hayer, Manjeet Singh Bilaspur, Kulwant Singh Pandori and Master Baldev Singh. They have been booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of Indian Penal Code besides Section 51A of the Disaster Management Act at the Mullanpur police station in Mohali. Capt sleeping in palaces: MannEarlier, addressing the gathering, state unit chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann said: “We have come to express the grief of 2.75 crore people of Punjab to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who is sleeping in palaces and visited Punjab only six times since he became the CM.” He said the people of Punjab were buying the most expensive electricity in the country at ₹10 per unit, but were still not getting electricity. “Instead, they have to leave their homes in the scorching heat for paddy sowing in the fields and hold dharnas on the roads,” said Mann. He said that Captain Amarinder Singh as the Chief Minister should go to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the issues of the farmers and get all the three black laws against farmers repealed. Mann alleged the people of Punjab were suffering the consequences of a collusion between the Akalis and the Congress, because during the Akali rule, the Badal family had entered into deadly deals with the private power companies and now the Congress government has implemented these deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-use-water-cannon-to-quell-aap-protest-outside-punjab-cm-s-farmhouse-101625312517234.html

The former chief minister alleged that the GST regime is aimed at diverting the revenues of states to the Centre.On the fourth anniversary of GST, Kumaraswamy took a dig at the Centre in a series of tweets. "The GST regime has stood like a monster symbol of curtailing the financial autonomy of states in the federal system of governance. The GST regime appears to be a financial system of nurturing the Centre by fleecing the states," he tweeted.Kumaraswamy stated that the Centre was celebrating the fourth anniversary of the GST regime because it has filled its stomach by snatching away the rights and freedom of the states with respect to taxes. "The Centre, which had promised the states of compensating for losses while including them under the GST regime, has now gone back on its words. Should the states too celebrate the GST's fourth anniversary for getting cheated on their tax resources?" Kumaraswamy asked. Noting that Karnataka is yet to get a GST compensation of about ₹9,000 crore, he said the state would have celebrated the occasion if it had got the compensation on this occasion of commemoration.According to Kumaraswamy, compensation would have benefited the state as it has suffered from resource crunch due to the impact of COVID-19. He alleged that instead of compensating for the losses on account of GST, the Centre is celebrating amidst the sufferings of states. "The main intention of the GST regime is to divert the revenues of states to the Centre so that states would have to sheepishly stand before the Centre like slaves to seek financial allocation.This system of slavery was evolved by the Congress and implemented by the BJP," the JD(S) leader said. He added that the GST regime has reduced the states to a position of begging the Centre for financial allocation and the states are also forced to take up a struggle against inclusion of petroleum products under GST.Kumaraswamy claimed that the GST has failed to improve the lives of common people besides not even providing any boost to start-ups. "There is nothing for the states as well as people to celebrate about the GST regime. It is merely a symbol of fascism of Congress and BJP," the former CM alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/kumaraswamy-terms-gst-regime-monster-symbol-that-limits-states-financial-autonomy-101625305669392.html

Accompanied by his brother-in-law and former state revenue minister Bikram Singh Majithia besides supporters and mediapersons, Sukhbir reached the Hajipur block and alleged that illegal mining was taking place in the area under the patronage of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and other Congress leaders. Also read: ED raids 6 locations across Delhi, UP in religious conversion PMLA caseHe dared mining department officials to register a case against him. “The mining mafia is plundering the land but the mining department is looking the other way as Congress bigwigs are involved in the illegal activity,” Sukhbir said. He visited mining sites at Dhamian, Sandhwal and Kulian Lubana villages. As his convoy reached Kulian Lubana, those carrying out mining at the site escaped, abandoning the machinery. Will safeguard interest of Punjabis: Sukhbir “Shocking state of the mining mafia. After the Beas, visited Mukerian & saw first-hand how mafia has extracted sand up to 200 feet. CM @capt_amarinder & minister @SarkariaTeam should tell Pbis (Punjabis) which law allows extraction of sand up to 200 feet? Officially the limit is 10 feet only,” Sukhbir said in a tweet. “2 days back when we exposed illegal mining at Beas, Mining Secretary justified the same. I’m waiting how govt will justify illegal activity at Mukerian. We aren’t afraid of cases. Cong govt can register 10 cases against me but I’ll continue to safeguard interests of Punjabis,” he said in another tweet. Booked in Amritsar for violating norms On June 30, the SAD chief had made similar charges when he made a visit to Beas river bank in Amritsar. Though at that time, the state mining department had trashed Sukhbir’s accusations and asserted that the site visited by the SAD chief near the Beas river was a legal one. On July 1, the Amritsar police had booked Sukhbir and two other Akali leaders under sections, including 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-raids-illegal-sand-mining-sites-in-punjab-s-mukerian-101625305616767.html
03-07-2021||Gurugram||In Gurugram, fake insurance claim unravels racket||It was a meticulously planned insurance fraud built on a foundation of data stolen from insurance companies, potentially earnings for its perpetrators hundreds of crores in life insurance claims on around 10,000 fake deaths -- but it was discovered by chance, after possibly a few hundred claims, because of an insurance policy that was linked to three others.That insurance claim itself was worth only ₹30 lakh, below the threshold requiring a physical verification by insurance surveyors, but the ones it was linked to were worth ₹10.2 crore, something the perpetrators were not aware of. And on June 20 , when the surveyors went visiting, they met the wife of the man believed dead, the chairperson of a private university in Gurugram, who was very much alive.The lady complained to the police, and the fraud came to light.The Gurugram Police said a gang of six is behind the fraud, built around stolen insurance data, forged death certificates, hundreds of bank accounts, and fake claims. They have arrested four of the gang. The police said they are ascertaining details of the number of such claims filed by the gang, and added that they have so far recovered at least 250 insurance claim documents from their possession. They believe the gang may have actually claimed money against 150 policiesBased on the complaint of the lady mentioned above, KK Rao, Gurugram’s commissioner of police, formed teams comprising members of the police’s crime and cyber crime units led by an assistant commissioner of police (crime). The success of the fraud depended on the entire process being digital -- and by checking the online claim process, the teams were able to follow the digital breadcrumbs -- the address of the suspects, the details of the bank accounts into which the claims were paid, and the mobile numbers linked to those accounts.The trail led them to the four gang members -- Rajnikant Kumar, the mastermind who earlier worked with the insurance company; Durgesh Dubey, a call centre employee; Naval Kishore, who helped with the opening of the bank account, and Nitish Saini, a Delhi-based property dealer -- all of whom were arrested from Delhi on Thursday.The other gang members, who arranged for the death certificate, have been identified but are yet to be arrested.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said: “The four suspects are presently on five-day police remand and are tough nuts to crack. They are not sharing any details but we are questioning them and are also contacting families through the insurance claims [recovered] to find out whether they were aware of this fraudulent activity.”Gang members Sangwan said the mastermind, identified as Rajnikant Kumar from Jaipur, moved to Gurugram in 2011. In 2012, he started working with an insurance company where he met Durgesh Dubey, who, at that time, was deployed in the back office of the same company.In 2014, Kumar moved to another insurance company where he worked till August 2019. In 2017, Dubey left the insurance company and started working with a fake call centre in Gururgam. These are centres that specialise in telemarketing, credit card and insurance frauds, sometimes even on people outside the country.Police said that in March 2020, the two men hatched the plan for the fraud to overcome financial difficulties. But they needed more people, including some with specialised skills (or access), Sangwan explained.“Before they could start the process, the first wave of the coronavirus disease hit . They took advantage of the situation, and started making connections with the staff of private hospitals.” The idea was to see if they could get insurance and other details of patients who had combined health and life insurance plans.They also had data on hand. Kumar, the police claim, left the two insurance companies with details of around 10,000 life insurance policies from across the country.The data, Sangwan said, had “details of insurance policies, Aadhaar cards, PAN cards, e-mail IDs and mobile numbers; nominee details were [also] easily accessible through the documents.”First step Meanwhile, Dubey, who lived in Delhi, contacted his school friend, Nitesh Saini, a Delhi-based property dealer whose friend, Naval Kishore, worked in a private bank in Gurugram .The four decided to join hands.According to Sangwan, they also met a few insurance advisers and sought their help to understand the safest way to claim money -- that wasn’t theirs by right. They also needed documents that made them the beneficiaries, and bank accounts. “They wanted someone who was expert in forging documents. Saini and Dubey knew two people who were experts in forgery and so they contacted them and involved them .”How the fraud workedRao said the gang members used to work 14 hours a day, making calls and sending emails for insurance claims.The gang, the police claimed, opened at least 300 bank accounts in different places in Delhi-NCR. They planned to dupe more than 10,000 families of their insurance money, police said.Then came the event that led to their capture.“Kumar got details of a customer whose policy was for ₹30 lakh and they got the forged death certificate made and applied for the claim in the first week of June. They were unaware of the background and details of the victim. They opened a bank account in the nominee’s name with forged documents and were waiting for the insurance claim. They even sent two reminders to check the progress,” Rao added.They did not know that the insurance policy belonged to chairman of a prominent university; nor that it was linked to three other policies of ₹10.20 crore.Physical verification is not mandatory for insurance claims less than ₹40 lakh. The gang was aware of this. However, they were unaware that the policyholder had multiple linked policies with the same company.On June 20, an insurance surveyor reached the house of the man believed dead in South City -1 in Gurugram for verification. They met the wife. Then the man himself. “The family was shocked to know that someone tried to dupe them. The wife went to Sector 29 police station and registered a case against unidentified persons,” said Rao.Sangwan said they are questioning the suspects to get names of the hospitals where staff the details of patients. The Gurugram Police have called a few families whose policies have been misused by the gang and also alerted insurance firms to share details if they receive complaints from customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/in-gurugram-fake-insurance-claim-unravels-racket-101625299321982.html

Under the new rules, trucks ferrying illegally mined sand will be released on payment of ₹4 lakhs in fine and tractors for ₹25,000. This will be in addition to the penalty imposed on the seized sand. Attempts to regulate sand mining trade since 2016 have failed spectacularly despite formation of a new policy and attempt to cancel mining lease of 25 companies owned by powerful people, who are believed to operate in connivance with politicians, police and officials of mines and geology department, said a government official on condition of anonymity.Patna, Saran, Bhojpur, Aurangabad, Kaimur and Rohtas are some of the worst-affected districts. Sand in Bihar is being sold for as much as ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 per truck load. Officials say that Chirand village in Saran district, is the favourite spot for the illegal trade as it is situated on the confluence of Ganga and Saryu rivers and connects to National Highway-19.Sand mined from nearby Sone River in Patna and Bhojpur districts is shipped to Chirand in boats to be smuggled to north Bihar and neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh. According to locals, around 90% of the population in Chirand village are engaged in sand smuggling. Saran range deputy inspector general (DIG) Manu Maharaaj said he has asked police chiefs of Gopalganj and Saran districts to send a detailed report against the culprits so that their properties could be confiscated. Saran SP Santosh Kumar claimed that 35 FIRs against 357 persons were lodged in May for illegal sand mining and 39 were arrested; 576 vehicles were seized apart from collection of ₹4.28 crore in fines. Similarly in Bhojpur district, the police claimed to have seized 324 vehicles, lodged 49 FIRs and arrested 94 persons. Besides this, the station house officer (SHO) of Barhara police station and 5 constables were suspended on May 28 on the charges of collecting money and protecting the vehicles carrying illegally mined sand. An FIR was also lodged against the SHO of Sahar police station and two others for extortion from the sand mafia In adjoining Rohtas district, altogether 1,056 vehicles have been seized since January this year. Rohtas police chief (SP) Ashish Bharti said two additional police camps have been set up to check illegal mining in the district. This year the police has so far lodged 159 FIRs, arrested 116 persons and collected a fine of ₹3.79 crore.

03-07-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP meeting today after Tirath Singh Rawat's resignation||Uttarakhand BJP unit will hold its legislature party meeting on Saturday to decide on a new leader after Tirath Singh Rawat resigned as the hill state's chief minister. Uttarakhand BJP unit president Madan Kaushik said the legislative party will meet at 3pm and Narendra Singh Tomar will be the central observer at the meeting. “The new leader will be an MLA,” Kaushik said. State BJP media in-charge Manveer Singh Chauhan said all party MLAs have been asked to attend the meeting.Tirath Singh Rawat resigned on Friday after just four months in office in the shortest term for a Uttarakhand CM. Rawat, who took over as the chief minister on March 10 this year, resigned days after he met the BJP central leadership, including Union home minister Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda. Rawat's resignation also comes ahead of the Uttarakhand assembly elections scheduled to be held in early 2022.Also watch | Rawat Vs Rawat: Former Uttarakhand CM on ‘mistakes’ made by his successorRawat resigned from his post on Friday night and submitted his resignation to Governor Baby Rani Maurya hours after he addressed a press conference in the state capital of Dehradun. He said that the decision was right amid what he said was a "constitutional crisis" in the state. “I must express my gratitude to the party’s central leadership which has given many responsibilities from time to time. I have been MLC, MLA, MP, party state president and recently chief minister,” he said after submitting his resignation to the governor. "I thank my party president JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the core of my heart,” he added.Also read | A sudden leadership change not new to UttarakhandThe senior BJP leader hinted that he resigned because the Election Commission was unlikely to hold by-elections due to Covid-19. A CM, if not a member of the assembly, needs to be elected within six months of assuming the post. However, a poll official indicated that no request was made to hold a bypoll and suggested there were precedents that may have permitted it.Also read | Speculation about new Uttarakhand CM is throwback to 2012Tirath Singh Rawat's stint was marred by controversy, including his decision to allow the Mahakumbh amid a surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and large-scale fraud in testing during the holy event. His comments on women’s clothing and that the waters of the Ganga could prevent infections also invited criticism.Rawat, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Garhwal in 2019, was appointed Uttarakhand's ninth CM after Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned from the top job post amid infighting in the state unit. The BJP has 56 MLAs in the 70-member house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-bjp-meeting-today-after-tirath-singh-rawat-s-resignation-101625270301482.html
03-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Sattu ghol of Turkman||The Mughal-era Turkman Gate marks the border between New and Old Delhi. It’s been here for centuries; its stony ramparts a symbol of steadfastness in this world of constant shift. Now, it is also becoming a souvenir to the future generations of the greatest public upheaval of our times—the coronavirus pandemic.But look down carefully on one side of this gateway. There’s another monument attached to it like a limpet—far younger, more vulnerable, and extremely modest. It’s Mahinder Singh’s sattu drinks—or sattu ghol—stall. This establishment has been operating from this spot for more than 40 years. Actually, 40 summers. Mr Singh sells sattu drink only in the sweltering season, from April to August; the rest of the year is spent in jaggery production in Punjab and as a carpenter in his UP village. In his 70s, he has survived the two surges. “As soon as the lockdown ended, I came back from my village in Baghpat.”As always, Mr Singh is dressed in a white dhoti kurta. People change over time but he looks just the same as one year ago, or three years ago, or five years earlier—neither any younger nor any older. This evening he is sitting between his two sons, Prem and Krishnapal. The stall consists of a bucket filled with the drink—sattu flour mixed with water and sugar, with chunks of ice, acquired from a “baraf” supplier in nearby Phatak Teliyan.The road that goes into the Old Delhi lanes is teeming, this afternoon, with a great many people. A flautist is sitting close to the stall, playing a tune, indifferent to the indifference to his performance. Rickshaw pullers are stopping frequently to have Mr Singh’s sattu ghol. As well as men on bikes. Now a man approaches, his figure gaunt, his beard long and knotted. He has a blanket on his shoulders, his pants and shirts are torn, and he’s barefoot. Mr Singh wordlessly gives him a glass of ghol for free.The drink is very chilly, very very sweet, and in these sweaty days it infuses the body with an instant rush of utmost calmness. “Thanda le lo (have it cold),” Mr Singh exhorts.He sits from 9am until the evening call for the prayer from nearby mosques. After that, Turkman Gate temporarily loses its most long-lasting human element.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-sattu-ghol-of-turkman-101625262870950.html

A unit of the 210 megawatt (MW) Ropar thermal plant went out of operation after it developed a snag on Friday, forcing the corporation to impose unscheduled cuts in rural and urban areas. The unit was restored late in the evening. Despite having taken load-shedding measures, the gap between demand and supply is still around 1500 MW. Power cuts in both rural and urban areas continue even as their duration has been reduced. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said it was decided in a meeting to extend the compulsory weekly-off imposed on the industry in the central, north and west zones to entire Punjab. Director (distribution) DPS Grewal, director (generation) Parmjeet Singh and Punjab State Transmission Corporation Limited (PSTCL) director (technical) Yogesh Tandon and other senior officials participated in the meeting.Also, the PSPCL has taken up with the northern regional dispatch centre (Delhi) seeking enhancement of transmission capacity to allow more import of power from outside the state immediately, he said.The CMD said to ensure 8-hour supply to farmers and uninterrupted power to other consumers, regulatory measures imposed on industrial consumers recently helped PSPCL improve supply to agriculture sector. “The situation may improve as rains are expected this week,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pspcl-to-extend-power-cuts-on-industry-for-another-week-101625257311773.html

Ironically, it is Sikhs who are indulging in acts that reduce the stature of the Takht.”“Sikhs hold the Akal Takht jathedar in even higher regards than the Prime Minister or the President. But the jathedar is expected to solve people’s trivial issues like a munshi posted in a police station. When abuses are hurled at the jathedar, the dignity and supremacy of the seat become a casualty. This has become a new normal,” said Giani Harpreet Singh.He added, “We ourselves are responsible for reducing respect for our institutions. We are fighting against each other for political reasons.”The acting jathedar hailed the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)’s move to commemorate the 1955 police action at the Golden Temple during the Punjabi Suba movement.SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said the entire Sikh community should treat its great institutions with reverence and beware of propagandists. She appealed to the community members to lead their religious, social and political life following their own traditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akal-takht-being-used-as-football-by-competing-sikh-segments-jathedar-101625257017421.html

Sikh intellectuals associated with the Kendri Singh Sabha said the Jathedar, in a letter to the Jammu and Kashmir Lt governor, had sought the implementation of an inter-faith marriage law. The Sikh body also raised objection over the Jathedar addressing the Lt Governor as “Your Excellency”. As per Sikh religious principles, the Jathedar should not acknowledge any worldly authority as supreme except the all-pervading Akal-Purkh. The statement further read, “Most Sikhs feel their religious sensibilities have been hurt as some self-proclaimed Delhi Sikh leaders aligned with the ruling BJP made the Jathedar write the letter which fits into the Sangh Parivar’s political programme of projecting a certain minority as an ‘aggressor’ and pitting other minorities against that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coversion-issue-kendri-singh-sabha-condemns-jathedar-s-letter-to-j-k-lt-guv-101625257011860.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Private hospitals in Punjab threaten to pull out of Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana over tussle with insurance firm||Private hospitals in Punjab have threatened to pull out of the Ayushman Bharat-Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana (AB-SSBY), alleging harassment at the hands of the insurance company implementing the scheme in the state. The Punjab chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), which represents private hospitals in the state, said it may call for mass de-empanelment from the scheme as the company, Iffco-Tokio, which is settling claims, is unnecessarily imposing hefty penalties on its members. Nearly 200 private and 250 government hospitals in Punjab are empanelled under the scheme. On the recommendations of the company, the state government has already de-empanelled 24 private hospitals from the scheme, citing discrepancies. “There is a strong resentment against the company. In the name of verifying our claims, the firm’s vigilance team checks our infrastructure and then imposes heavy penalties on us. We are planning to pull out of the pact if the state health minister doesn’t intervene immediately,” Dr KD Singh, president of IMA, Punjab chapter, said. An IMA delegation has also sought audience with health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, he added. The AB-SSBY was launched in August 2019 as a flagship health insurance scheme in the state. The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government extended the benefits of the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat which was to cover nearly 14 lakh families as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data. The premium for 14.65 lakh SECC beneficiary families shall be borne by Centre and the state in 60:40 ratio. The premium cost of remaining 16.49 lakh beneficiary families will be completely borne by the state. The Association of Nursing Homes, Jalandhar, in a meeting earlier this week, has also threatened to drop out of the pact signed by private hospitals, the state government and the insurance firm. “As per the MoU, the company’s vigilance team should be headed by a managing director or a retired director-level senior health official. But their teams are headed by BDS or BAMS doctors,” said Dr Dheeraj Gupta of the association. IMA national vice-president Dr Navjot Dahiya said the private company officials have turned inspectors checking established hospitals to tarnish their image. “If there is an issue between a hospital and the insurance firm, the state health agency does not have powers to adjudicate the dispute,” said Dr Dahiya. Iffco-Tokio project head (Punjab) Dhritman denied the allegations, saying it is the right of the company to check infrastructure and audit treatment cost per the MoU. “There is no question of harassment. Whatever action we take is decided by a committee of experts headed by the secretary (health). Moreover, a penalty is imposed only after a couple of hearings for the hospital to clear objections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/private-hospitals-in-punjab-threaten-to-pull-out-of-sarbat-sehat-bima-yojana-over-tussle-with-insurance-firm-101625256952253.html

Uninterrupted power supply,” tweeted chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Earlier, in a tweet, Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain also lauded the power sector’s role.“Delhi successfully met ever-highest [highest in two years, as per government records] electricity peak demand of 7,323 today. Heartiest congratulations to (the) Delhi power sector for this achievement,” he tweeted.The highest peak power demand ever in the Capital was 7,409 MW, which was recorded on July 2, 2019.As the mercury soared, Delhi recorded peak power demands of 6,921 MW on Wednesday and 7,026 MW on Thursday.Friday was also the second time in two years that peak power demand in Delhi crossed the 7,000-mark.On June 29 last year, Delhi’s peak power demand was recorded at 6,314 MW.In 2018, the peak demand was 7,016 MW, which was recorded on July 10 as per government records.The demand this year may further go up to 7,400 MW, if the ongoing heatwave in the city continues, said a senior power department official who did not wish to be identified.The BSES discoms -- BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) -- said they successfully met the peak power demands of 3,079 MW and 1,640 MW in their respective areas on Friday.Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, in a statement, said that they too successfully met the peak power demand of 2,104 MW in their areas on Friday afternoon, “without any network constraint and power outage”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/power-demand-hits-new-peak-for-2021-now-past-7300mw-101625256567345.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab receives ₹235 crore from Centre for paddy stubble management||Punjab government has received a sum of ₹235 crore from the Centre for management of paddy stubble ahead of the harvest season set to begin in October. Burning of stubble by paddy growers of Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Punjab is a cause of environmental and health concern as the entire region, particularly National Capital Delhi, gets covered with smog at the onset of winter due to this menace. The state agriculture department plans to provide crop residue management (CRM) machines to farmers at subsidised rates with the funds received from the Centre. “We had planned to give 40,000 machines on subsidy but there is a dearth of funds, we have cut down the number to 25, 000,” said Manmohan Kalia, the department’s nodal officer for CRM. This is the third consecutive year when the Centre is providing the state funds for CRM. Three years ago, it was decided to sanction funds for CRM after the PMOs intervention. The state has received a sum of ₹810 crore as CRM funds in the last three years (2018 to 2020). The farmers are provided several machines, including super shredder, happy seeder, reverse plough, zero till drill, bailer, super SMS and mulcher, for in-situ management of stubble. This year, the department has received applications for 50,000 machines from individual farmers as well as groups such as cooperative agriculture societies, village panchayats and farmer producer organisations (FPOs). At least 385 applications were received from farmer groups. While the groups will get a subsidy of 80%, individual farmers will get 50% subsidy. “Each group will get subsidy for 10 machines and are on our priority for supplying machines,” added Kalia. Hot spot districts Majority of the stubble burning cases are reported from the villages in Patiala, Mansa, Moga, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Barnala, Tarn Taran, Sangrur and Muktsar, which have been classified as hotspot districts. Out of the total ₹235 crore received from the Centre, ₹10 crore will go for publicity campaigns in these districts. There was a spurt in stubble fires in the kharif season in 2020, with the Punjab remote sensing centre detecting at least 73,833 fires between September 21 to November 14. Other than the shortage of machines, anger amongst the peasantry against the three farm bills passed by the Centre in September is said to be the reason behind the spike last year. In May this year, the Punjab government had sought funds for 70,000 more machines for in-situ management. In an action plan sent to the Centre’s ministry of environment, last week, the state government had submitted a three-year road map, seeking ₹873 crore to distribute one lakh machines to the state’s farmers for in-situ management. Taking the plea that in three years, the machines given on subsidy to farmers could help in crop residue management of only 60 lakh tonne paddy straw, more machines were sought. ‘76,590 machines given in 3 years insufficient’ The number of machines (76,590) given to the farmers in the last three years (2018-2020) are insufficient to deal with stubble burning menace, department officials said. “The window between paddy harvest and wheat sowing is short so stubble can’t be managed with the machines available,” said Kalia, adding that as per estimates, 70,000 more machines are required. A total of 220 lakh tonne of stubble is produced along with the paddy. The biomass power generating plants in the state consume 50 lakh tonnes of stubble. Of the remaining 170 lakh tonne, 100 lakh tonne goes unmanaged, and majority of the farmers prefer to burn it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-receives-rs-235-crore-from-centre-for-paddy-stubble-management-101625256292187.html

The protesters, including women, entered the paddy fields and ‘damaged’ the saplings on around one acre. Union leaders claimed they had only gone to talk to a farmer who had taken Grewal’s land on rent but some angry protesters damaged the saplings. The union leaders had earlier appealed to farmers against working on Grewal’s land as he has been actively speaking in favour of the agricultural reforms.“We had appealed to the farmer to not work on Grewal’s land. However, he transplanted the paddy. When we visited for a talk today, the mob abruptly uprooted the saplings. We have no personal vendetta against the BJP leader but he should not use derogatory language against farmers,” said Balwant Singh Upli, a farmer leader.Jagseer Singh, another member of the union, said, “Farmers have already refused to take around five acres of his land on lease but he offered the land free to one farmer.

Sangrur deputy commissioner (DC) Ramvir had ordered the probe after the matter was raised by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders. As per the report, the building construction was 95 to 96% complete. “The building has a fire hydrant and an alarm system but as the construction is yet to be completed, the fire systems have not been activated. In such a scenario, the system cannot be checked,” the probe report stated. DC Ramvir said that after getting the report, he informed the authorities of PGIMER about the situation. Sources revealed that the former fire officer of Sangrur had issued the NOC in a hurry before his retirement last year. AAP activist Narinder Kaur Bharaj who had raised the issue said, “It was an illegal act. The Congress government is playing with the lives of its people. The responsible officer must be punished.” Amarinder Pal Singh Sandhu, the current fire officer, said that on the directions of the DC, he inspected the construction site twice and submitted his report. “The PGIMER satellite centre has six blocks. Four of these are residential buildings, one is an OPD block while and one is the main hospital building. The OPD and other four buildings have been checked but the hospital building will be checked when its construction work is complete,” he added. Doctors yet to be recruited Sources say the work on the project has been delayed and there have been no recruitment of doctors so far. Punjab school education minister and Sangrur MLA Vijay Inder Singla, however, claimed the work on the 300-bed hospital is on track and the recruitment process will start in a month or so. “We got the project passed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2013. Funds to the tune of ₹500 crore were given to PGIMER, Chandigarh. The OPD services are operational but new doctors will be recruited in a short period for all services,” added Singla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pgimers-satellite-centre-in-sangrur-got-fire-noc-before-construction-was-complete-101625255991781.html

03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Traffic cop slaps Haryana tourists in Shimla||Himachal Pradesh Police are again at the centre of controversy following a traffic cop slapping tourists in Shimla town on Thursday. The incident, which took place near Victory Tunnel on Circular Road, drew criticism from all quarters prompting senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mohit Chawla to take action against the erring cop. In a video of the entire episode, which has been widely shared on social media, a traffic cop is seen slapping a tourist several times. As per the information, the tourists who were from Haryana, didn’t stop their car at Victory Tunnel despite being signalled by the cop. When cops finally stopped them at some distance, they started misbehaving with them. The heated exchange soon turned into a scuffle as the traffic cop slapped one of the tourists several times. Meanwhile, Chawla said the cop in question was immediately removed from duty. The SSP termed the incident unfortunate, but said that the traffic police work in tough conditions and it were the tourists who misbehaved first. He agreed that the response of the police was also not “up to the mark”. “The cop should have reported it to the higher official or taken tourists to the police station,” said Chawla, adding that they haven’t received any complaint from the tourists. They have left the town and their vehicle is being tracked. The police jawan has lodged a complaint against the tourists, he added. The SSP has also urged the tourists to behave properly while they come to visit the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/traffic-cop-slaps-haryana-tourists-in-shimla-101625255816289.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Appoint, rather than elect Panjab University senate members, says panel||Panjab University (PU) must do away with its practice of giving 15 seats in the senate, its supreme decision-making body, to registered graduates constituency through elections and appoint eminent alumni instead, a committee of experts has recommended.RP Tiwari, vice-chancellor of Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, chaired the high-level 11-member panel that the Vice-President of the country and PU chancellor M Venkaiah Naidu had formed in February to recommend governance reforms. This was in light of the National Education Policy (NEP-2020). In November 2020, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had also directed PU to initiate governance reforms. These recommendations have been sent to Naidu, who will take the final call. The committee has also recommended that the senate and syndicate be retained, but with lower number of members for enhanced efficiency. The membership of the senate is proposed to be lowered to 47 against 93 now.The syndicate membership will be reduced to 13 from the present 18 if the committee has its way. The report adds that preference must be given to academicians from the university and its affiliated colleges in appointment to the two bodies. Senate members, however, have opposed this, saying that elections were essential for varsity’s democratic flavour. They have also said that a public debate must be held on these recommendations before implementation. Changes in composition of faculties have also been recommended that include doing away with the bifurcation of faculties as major or minor. The number of faculties will also reduce from 11 to 10 as prescribed by PU regulations.In place of added/co-opted members, nominated members from among the academia have been recommended. The present system of appointment of deans of faculties by election has been recommended to be replaced with appointment from among senior professors on seniority basis, by rotation.Re-alignment of territorial jurisdiction of PU has been advised. The report adds that this will ensure colleges situated in close proximity of PU in Mohali and Ropar may be affiliated to it, while colleges far away can be affiliated to other varsities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/appoint-rather-than-elect-panjab-university-senate-members-says-panel-101625255811720.html

As the consignment was imported on his name, Chohla Sahib-based Prabhjit Singh, who also runs an agriculture store, has been detained by the Ludhiana zonal unit of the DRI from Tarn Taran.Prabhjit imports the gypsum from Pakistan and Afghanistan. DRI sleuths are trying to ascertain where the consignment has come from. A team of the DRI also visited Prabhjit’s house and questioned his family members on Friday.Confirming the development, a senior police official, requesting anonymity, said the Tarn Taran Police are also probing the matter at their own level. He said they have not found any criminal record of the person held in this connection, but his link with a smuggler belonging to Dhun Dhae Wala village has surfaced during investigation.“Besides, it has been found that Prabhjit has amassed many assets within a short span of time. He owns a mansion-like house in the village,” he added. Prior to this, in its biggest ever narcotics haul, the customs department had seized 532kg of heroin worth ₹2,700 crore, which was smuggled into India from Pakistan in a truck through a trade route at the Attari border on June 30, 2019. The heroin was recovered from a consignment, of 600 bags of rock salt, from the integrated check post (ICP) at Attari, which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan.As trade between India and Pakistan through Attari-Wagah check post has been suspended ever since Article 370 that gives autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir was abrogated, this route is closed for narcotics smuggling. Going by the fresh seizure, the heroin smuggling has started coming through Mumbai port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/135kg-heroin-seized-from-mumbai-port-tarn-taran-based-importer-detained-101625255751853.html

03-07-2021||Chandigarh||3 Chandigarh lawyers approach SC against fresh senior advocates’ list||Three city lawyers have approached the Supreme Court against the full court decision of the Punjab and Haryana high court on the designation of 19 as senior advocates.Lawyers Amar Vivek, Krishan Kumar Gupta and Harbhajan Singh Dhandi were among the 112 applicants who have demanded quashing of the notification on designations, directions to produce the complete records of proceedings and stay on implementation of the notification. The plea is likely to be taken up for hearing next week.The permanent panel headed by the chief justice had recommended 27 lawyers’ names including three women for consideration as senior advocates. However, eight names were dropped after full court proceedings.The plea alleges that the HC violated the mandatory and binding directions of the Supreme Court and Rules 9 to 11 framed by the HC pursuant to the Indira Jaising case. The entire result of 112 candidates was never placed before the full court for approval, the plea says.It claims that the full court was convened with a single agenda, to approve 27 shortlisted names, and was not afforded enough time to go through the complete records of the candidates, to enable it to “apply its own independent mind”.“Thus, the full court had no material, whatsoever, to apply its own independent mind on 27 selectees or on the remaining 85 candidates, nor the relative merit by way of scores of the latter vis a vis the ones shortlisted had been placed,” it says, adding that seemingly the objection to this was raised before full court too.The plea says that as per the initial suggestions, the committee drew 41 names with 55 marks cut off. However, on May 23, another list of 24 was reportedly made.“The full court resorted to secret voting, albeit without any exceptional circumstances or recording of reasons in writing... Out of the list of 27 names, 18 names were approved,” the plea says, adding that one of the candidates selected outside the list happened to be the wife of a former HC judge, and the three judges who participated in the proceedings had their relatives as candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-chandigarh-lawyers-approach-sc-against-fresh-senior-advocates-list-101625255331904.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s aging power infra crumbling in the face of rising summer demand||If the heatwave wasn’t exasperating enough, the frequent power supply disruptions have been aggravating summer woes of city residents, particularly those living in the southern sectors.From the demand peaking at 383 megawatts (MW) on Wednesday, when the heatwave first started, it rose to 405MW on Thursday, when the temperature soared to 40.8°C, and further to 409MW on Friday.While the city has adequate power supply to cater to the rising summer demand, it is not backed by a robust transmission system, with upgrades pending for years, causing lines to trip as load increases. Absence of adequate support staff to fix the faults only exacerbates residents’ troubles.The situation has consistently worsened over the last three days. While on Wednesday, only couple of sectors faced long power cuts, as earlier highlighted by Hindustan Times, by Friday, several areas in the southern belt, including Sectors 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 and 47 suffered major power outages. Among these, the power cut was scheduled only in parts of Sector 40, as per UT electricity department officials.“Normally, the power load grows by around 7% every year. This has to be supplemented by upgrade of aging equipment to bolster the transmission system. But since the power privatisation started over the last couple of years, the process has been put on hold. For instance, purchase of more powerful transformers has been delayed and may not be installed this summer,” said an official, requesting anonymity.Worse, the process to recruit support workforce remains on hold. “More than 400 contract workers, including assistant linemen and linemen, are awaiting contract renewal. This affects repair work and response to complaints,” the official said.Busy phone linesReeling under long unscheduled power cuts and voltage fluctuations, city residents termed the electricity department’s response as callous and torturous.“Nearly 99% of the time, the complaint centres’ phone numbers remain busy. Even when someone answers, the response is usually that it’s a back-end problem and the call is simply disconnected,” said Hitesh Puri, chairperson, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED). With their phone calls going unanswered, many residents even rushed to the complaint centres for solution, but contended that the staff remained uncooperative and only gave assurances.On UT’s part, chief engineer CB Ojha said, “There is no shortage of supply even if the demand rises. There was disruption in supply from Punjab side last night. Repairs were going on in Sector 40. Similar outages will not be repeated going forward.”Mohali in the same boatThe situation is no better in Mohali, where, too, infrastructure upgrade has been hanging fire for years.According to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited records, nearly 50% of the 19 grid sub-stations do not have sufficient infrastructure to cater to the burgeoning demand, leading to outages through the day and night.Yet, three months into summer, the corporation has not been able to ramp up the transformers and transmission lines.PSPCL superintending engineer Mohit Sood admitted transformers were getting overloaded with increasing demand. “We are working to sort this out at various sub-stations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-aging-power-infra-crumbling-in-the-face-of-rising-summer-demand-101625254971657.html

The SIT head, additional director general of police (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav, along with other two members, Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal and Faridkot range DIG Surjit Singh, questioned Sikh preacher Panthpreet Singh, a key witness in the case, at the Faridkot camp office and recorded his statement. The SIT also questioned four cops, including then Bajakhana SHO Amarjit Singh Kular, who is an accused in the Behbal Kalan firing case, besides Ajit Singh, on whose complaint an FIR was registered in 2018 in connection with the Kotkapura firing incident. Others include Baba Balkar Singh, Inderjit Singh Sukhanwala, Harjinder Singh Sukhanwala, Pooran Singh Daggo Romana, Kala Singh, Amarjit Singh and Himmat Singh. Head constable (retd) Rashpal Singh, on whose complaint another FIR was registered against protestors on October 14, 2015, after the firing incident and two other cops didn’t appear before the SIT. Panthpreet along with the other preachers, including Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, was leading the protest against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari, when the agitators were cane-charged and gunshots were fired by the police at the Kotkapura chowk, leading to injuries to a number of persons. “I have requested the SIT members to investigate the matter fairly and provide justice to Sikhs. There should be no other SIT. I don’t know why they are also investigating the FIR, which was registered against the protestors. Even the cops had admitted in the court that the then SAD-BJP government had ordered to quash it, but the case has not been cancelled,” Panthpreet said after coming out of the SIT’s Faridkot camp office. The SIT will question Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale at his dera in Patiala on Monday. Officials privy to the development said the decision has been taken due to security reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-sit-questions-sikh-preacher-panthpreet-police-officials-101625254911608.html

Thought the high court has asked police to take steps to protect his life and liberty, but said providing protection does not prevent authorities from registering criminal case against him and take appropriate action under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.The 28-year-old man had married a 17-year-old girl and both had filed a plea seeking protection from the family members of the girl. As it came to be known that the girl is a minor, the high court sent the girl to a care home. According to the plea, they got married against the wishes of the girl’s parents on June 16 at their friend’s residence in Chandigarh as per Hindu rituals and are living together. The state’s counsel had told court that the girl was a minor and case fell within the definition of child under Section 2(a) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act provides punishment for a person who performs child marriage. The groom is not entitled to custody of the girl and her life and liberty has to be protected by sending her to child care institution under the care of Child Welfare Committee.Taking note of submissions, the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi gave custody of the girl to Chandigarh Police as she was residing there and directed to ensure that till further orders, she be kept in Aashiana, Sector 15, Chandigarh, and also to take steps for protection of her life and liberty. All expenses too for the stay are to be borne by the police.As of the man, the court directed Malerkotla police to take steps for his protection of the life and liberty but made it clear that legal action, if any, can be initiated against him as per law. The matter will now come up for hearing on July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/malerkotla-man-in-soup-for-marrying-minor-girl-101625254611509.html

Addressing a press conference, party’s state unit president Bhagwant Mann said that the AAP would gherao chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s farmhouse at Siswan village on Saturday to wake him up from slumber. The people of Punjab would check the meters of the CM’s farmhouse to find out how many hours of power outage was taking place there, he added. The AAP leader said that during the 2017 elections, Capt Amarinder and the Congress had made many promises to the people, but none of them were fulfilled. He said that due to the wrong agreements signed by the Badals with private thermal plants and non-cancellation of agreements by the present Congress government, the power situation in the state had deteriorated. “Like the Badals, Amarinder is also bent upon ruining Punjab economically,” he alleged, accusing the Congress leader of backstabbing the people by not cancelling the wrong power deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-shortage-aap-to-gherao-cm-s-farmhouse-on-saturday-101625254371524.html
03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab power crisis: SAD seeks financial package for farmers||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday held protests outside Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) offices across the state for failing to provide 8-hour power supply to farmers, besides imposing unscheduled cuts and ordering closure of industries two days a week. The SAD demanded an immediate financial package for paddy farmers who were forced to use diesel generators besides demanding an immediate reduction in VAT on diesel. The party said if these corrective measures were not taken along with restoration of regular supply of power to farmers as well as the domestic and industrial consumers, the SAD will gherao the chief minister and ministers in the next phase of its agitation. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal joined protests at Lambi, Fazilka and Ghubaya during the course of which he held the CM solely responsible for the plight of the people. He said the CM has not taken a single review meeting of the power utility to ensure adequate supply to paddy farmers. “This was done deliberately to keep the subsidy bill down. The Congress government does not want to provide free power to farmers,” he said. In Fazilka, Sukhbir said the government did not make any attempt to ensure timely maintenance of thermal plants, which led to the closure of the Lehra Mohabbat plant as well as one unit of the Talwandi Sabo plant. Former minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal participated in dharnas at Bathinda and Sangat Mandi where she disclosed how the erstwhile SAD government had spent more than ₹4,000 crore on upgrading the transmission and distribution system. Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia, who participated in the dharna at Majitha, said instead of resolving the crisis which had engulfed the state in the form of a power emergency, the CM was busy hosting five star luncheon meetings for Congressmen. No shortage of canal water: MinisterReacting to Sukhbir’s statement that paddy crop will be destroyed if water is supplied in next 2 days, state water resources minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said there was no shortage of canal water anywhere in the state and no complaint has been lodged by any farmer in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-power-crisis-sad-seeks-financial-package-for-farmers-101625254191597.html
03-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra announces 30:30:40 formula for HSC evaluation||Nearly two weeks after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) announced an evaluation pattern for Class 12 results, the Maharashtra government on Friday announced they would follow the same 30:30:40 pattern for Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) students. Nearly 1.5 million students take HSC exams in the state every year. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that in HSC results, 30% weightage each will be given to Class 10 and 11 marks and 40% to Class 12 internal test marks and students’ performance in the year. “To ensure that students from different boards are graded at the same level, Maharashtra board will also follow the 30:30:40 formula, giving weightage to Class 10, 11 and 12 performance. For students who feel they want to improve their scores, depending on the Covid situation in the state, we will conduct two round of exams,” said Gaikwad in a press conference held in the city on Friday. In keeping with the decision of the Supreme Court to ensure that all Class 12 results are announced by July 31, Gaikwad requested junior college principals and teachers to work towards the deadline.“It will be difficult but I request all staff, teachers and principals to get together and work this out as soon as possible,” she added. This year, Covid-19 pushed all education boards to rethink their decision of conducting board exams at a time when the country was grappling with a deadly second wave. Scrapping of exams was unanimously accepted by all, and instead, grading students on a formula giving weightage to students’ performance of past three years was unanimously accepted. The approved mechanism for CBSE Class 12 students includes a 30:30:40 formula, which takes into account a student’s performance in the past three examinations (the 12th pre-board, 11th finals, and 10th board) to settle at a score for the theory component of the examination that could not be held. The theory portion accounts for 70% or 80% of a subject score, with the remainder coming from internal practical tests that most schools managed to complete prior to the outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19. In case of CISCE, the formula will take into consideration the students’ Class 10 ICSE Board exam results, project and practical work in subjects, and best marks obtained in school exams in Classes 11 and 12. While the state is positive that the results will be ready by the end of this month, teachers and junior college principals feel this mammoth task is impossible to achieve within the next one month. “As the final result will include marks of Class 10, 11 and overall performance of students in class 12, it won’t be possible to do this sitting at home. Teachers will have to start visiting respective schools/junior colleges and work with the admin staff to get Class 10 and 11 marks and put it together. Since trains are still not accessible for teachers, it’ll be difficult for us to travel to and from the college to work on the results,” said a teacher, on condition of anonymity. Colleges are unhappy with the last minute announcement and demand for quick results. “CBSE and ICSE schools have been working on this same formula for nearly two weeks now and will be in a better position to announce the results by month-end. For us, not only is the time limiting, but we are also catering to larger batches of students, so will need more time,” said the principal of a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-announces-30-30-40-formula-for-hscevaluation-101625252630722.html
03-07-2021||Mumbai||‘Election for Speaker’s post after review of MLAs’ attendance: Maha CM tells Guv||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray replied to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s letter apprising him of the government’s stand on the three topics mentioned by the latter. In his letter, Thackeray said the state government will hold the election to the post of the speaker at the earliest, after reviewing the attendance of members of legislative assembly (MLA) amid the second wave of pandemic.In response to the query over the duration of the session, the CM reminded him that the business advisory committee (BAC) has the right to decide on it. Responding to the governor’s query over the election to the local bodies in the wake of the quashed political reservation to the other backward class, Thackeray said the state has already taken due steps. The CM said the state government has moved a petition in the apex court and also requested the State Election Commission to defer the bypolls to the local bodies.In his letter to the CM on June 24, Koshyari had directed the latter to elaborate on the government’s stand on extending the period of session, election to the post of speaker and deferment of bypolls. The letter was written by the governor after a delegation of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders led by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis called on him at Raj Bhavan. The BJP delegation had requested for the direction by the Governor for the monsoon session of longer duration, holding speaker’s election in the monsoon session and put the bypolls on hold until the OBCs get their political reservation back.Apart from the statement on the three topics raised by Governor, the CM has also requested the former to help the state in getting the empirical data required for the restoration of the OBC reservation. “The reservation has been struck down for want of empirical data on the backwardness of the communities. The central government can avail the data for which we have requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi during our meeting. I would request you to use your good office for the follow-up with the Centre to get the empirical data from 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Survey,” he said.Thackeray has also stated that in the wake of the pandemic situation it would not advisable to hold the two-day monsoon session, beginning from July 5, for long. “BAC has the right to take a decision over the duration of the session. The second wave of the pandemic has not been subsided as yet and there is a possibility of the third wave in the coming months as anticipated by the experts. As far as the election to the post of speaker is concerned, the government wants to hold it at the earliest. However at the same time, we want all MLAs to participate in the poll. The schedule of the election could be finalised only after the results of RT-PCR tests which are mandatory for every member to attend. Currently, deputy speaker Shri Narhari Zirwal has been performing the duties of the speaker and we do not think not holding the election has violated any constitutional provisions,” the letter read.The letter is assumed to have started another tiff between Raj Bhavan and Mantralaya. “The CM has subtly pressed the point that the decision over the duration of the session is the prerogative of the BAC. He has also put the ball in Raj Bhavan’s court to get the empirical data from the Centre for the restoration of the OBC quota in the local body polls by requesting him for a follow-up with the Centre. Ahead of the budget session in March, the governor had written a letter asking the government to hold the speaker’s election. This time, he instead of directing the government had asked for the information, but it was in the response to the demand by the BJP. This has not gone well with the political leadership of the state,” said a senior minister.In October last year, Koshyari and Thackeray engaged in a letter war over reopening of religious places in the state, as part of the unlocking of Covid-enforced curbs. In the acrimonious exchange of letters, the governor, making a case for reopening places of worship, asked the CM if he had “turned secular”. Thackeray shot back, asking if Koshyari does not believe in “secularism as enshrined in the Constitution”, adding that his Hindutva doesn’t need the governor’s certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-cm-tells-governor-election-for-speaker-s-post-after-review-of-mlasattendance-101625252570743.html
03-07-2021||Lucknow||In golden years, veteran doctors play stellar role in fight against Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh||Many elderly doctors chose the call of duty over their own safety and served Covid-19 patients in their own way.They did so at a time when senior citizens were supposed to exercise extra precautions and advised to stay home. The government’s Covid safety protocol guidelines asked all those above the age of 65 years and below 10 years, as well as pregnant women, to stay indoors and venture out only in case of medical need.Dr Arun Chaturvedi, 68, a physician with a successful practice and immense love of his profession, did not stay home when Covid-19 struck Agra, which was among the districts with a large number of cases in the first wave.He continued to run his clinic and a dispensary to give medicines to the poor. Again, when the second and deadlier second wave of the pandemic emerged, he took no time in opting for Covid duties when asked to supervise health services at a 350- bed Covid hospital on the outskirts of Agra. This Covid hospital was made out of a trade centre of Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Council (AFMEC) on the initiative of Pooran Dawar, the president of AFMEC. “It took 15 days to make the hospital operational at the trade centre of AFMEC at Seengna on Agra-Mathura Road, about 20 kilometres from Agra city. Dr Shammi Kalra and I began the OPD,” said Dr Chaturvedi who lives in the heart of Agra. “The need for a hospital was felt given the sharp surge in Covid cases. At AFMEC, we believed that we should lend a helping hand to the government in the pandemic. So, our facility was converted into a Covid hospital,” said Pooran Dawar. “By the time the hospital became operational, the Covid cases began dropping and now the hospital will not be dismantled. It will stay prepared for the possible third wave of the pandemic and I will serve here again. Others and I, all served at the hospital without seeking any remuneration,” Dr Chaturvedi said. Now, he is back to his own small clinic and dispensary.Going online to help patientsDr OP Upadhyaya, senior chief medical officer at Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) Hospital of Banaras Hindu University (BHU), embraced technology to serve people.He said, “I am already 65, so was not expected to attend serious Covid cases. But I started giving online consultations. I gave consultations to more than 300 patients/families for Covid treatment, home isolation and monitored their medication as per their condition.”He referred about 10 patients to L-3 (Level-3) hospitals as their oxygen level had dipped below 60% and more than 95% of the cases he attended online recovered in home isolation.Taught from the hospital bedKanpur-based veteran paediatrician Dr Raj Tilak, 70, was diagnosed with Covid-19 in April, but continued teaching GSVM (Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial) Medical College students and faculty members about the latest research on the pandemic.Along with medicines, lying by his side were journals like Lancet. They kept him engrossed when he was not busy sharing the latest updates with junior doctors and faculty in the neuro Covid ward of Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital, Kanpur where he was admitted after his oxygen saturation (SpO2) level dropped below 90.During his stay in the ward as a Covid patient, he discussed Covid treatment and management or explained to the junior doctors about the double mutant virus, said one of the doctors who had attended on him.Dr Tilak’s recent paper on allergies in children and their pulmonary issues had found a place in Lancet. Apart from being a top paediatrician, Dr Tilak is involved in research on asthma and allergies.“Junior doctors listened to him intently as he continued to share the latest developments,” said Prof Yashwant Rao, one of the senior doctors who attended on Dr Tilak.Dr Tilak said, “I can’t stop teaching, my heart is always in it.” Though Dr Tilak was surprised at contracting Covid-19 despite following all necessary safety protocols, all that’s behind him now. And he is back to his paediatric practice at his private clinic in a busy locality of Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-golden-years-veteran-doctors-play-stellar-role-in-fight-against-covid-19-in-uttar-pradesh-101625252031158.html

ED officers said that the group has diverted funds from project accounts to different entities and individuals, and thus siphoned off huge amounts of money.A local court on Friday remanded Thakur in ED custody till July 8.According to ED, the proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Thakur and the real estate group was initiated on the basis of multiple first information report (FIRs) and charge sheets filed against them at various police stations in Navi Mumbai and Thane. ED has clubbed five FIRs, filed on the basis of complaints by flat buyers and a non-banking finance company, at these police stations. In these FIRs, allegations pertaining to cheating, criminal conspiracy and defrauding of genuine home buyers were levelled on the group. The builder was accused of not registering flats in the names of home buyers despite collecting money from them on the pretext of selling flats.“The Monarch group is owned by Thakur and his brothers Hasmukh and Anand. But as Thakur is the main accused behind the irregularities, he has been arrested. His signatures are also there on all the documents,” an ED officer said.Thakur and Hasmukh were previously arrested by the economic offences wing of Navi Mumbai Police for allegedly duping many flat buyers, but were released on bail. In one of the cases, Kharghar police had booked Thakur based on a complaint by inspector Pramod Bhovate, who was posted with Mumbai Police’s special branch. Bhovate had paid money to the builder for a flat in 2011, but he never received the possession nor was he given the refund.Thakur was also charged under the relevant sections of Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA). ED’s investigations have revealed that the real estate company and its directors sold flats to multiple persons. They also availed loan from non-banking finance companies by mortgaging the sold flats without the knowledge of the buyers, the agency said. “It was also revealed that Monarch Universal Group has diverted funds from the project accounts to different entities, individuals and thus siphoned off the money,” ED stated in a statement.“We are investigating where exactly did the accused divert the funds and if any properties were bought from the ill-gotten money,” the officer added. Once the proceeds of the crime are ascertained, then the relevant assets would be attached by ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-arrests-mumbai-builder-gopal-thakur-in-money-laundering-case-101625251971129.html

In Thane, petrol was priced at ₹105.36 per litre, while diesel was available at ₹96.84 on Friday. Among the metro cities, Mumbai had the costliest petrol. In Delhi, one litre of petrol was priced at ₹99.16, while in Hyderabad, it was available at ₹103.05. In Chennai, a litre of petrol was priced at ₹100.13 on Friday. The price of one litre petrol crossed the ₹100-mark in Mumbai on May 29. Fuel prices in the city have been on an increase since May 3. In Maharashtra, the costliest petrol was in Parbhani, where prices had soared to ₹107.56 per litre. Amravati had the costliest diesel at ₹98.18 per litre, on Friday. Residents have reacted sharply to the constant rise in prices and said that if fuel prices keep on rising, they would be forced to stop using their vehicles. “We travel by our vehicle for everyday activities because local trains are not being operated for all. Prices of all the commodities are increasing rapidly. If the fuel prices keep on increasing, then we will be forced to park our vehicles. The government is doing nothing to relieve the pressure on the citizens,” said Charu Jain, a Mazagaon resident. Transporters’ body had on Monday protested against the constant hike in petrol and diesel prices across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/petrol-crosses-105-per-litre-in-mumbai-101625251912302.html

Rawat, who had refused to respond to questions about his resignation before he went to Raj Bhavan, later explained his decision to resign to what he described as a constitutional crisis.The Election Commission, he said, had decided not to hold a by-election due to the Covid pandemic and it was decided that he should resign. Rawat added that he could not contest the bypoll to the Almorah’s Sult seat in April since he had tested Covid positive.“I must express my gratitude to the party’s central leadership which has given many responsibilities from time to time. I have been MLC, MLA, MP, party state president and recently chief minister. I thank my party president JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister from the core of my heart,” said Rawat, who had just an hour before meeting governor Baby Rani Maurya, refused to respond to swirling rumours of his exit.There has been no statement from the poll panel to indicate if it has taken any decision. People aware of the details said the EC had not received any request from Uttarakhand to hold a by-election on grounds that it was necessary to fulfil constitutional requirements.Uttarakhand BJP chief Madan Kaushik said the party legislative party will meet at 3pm on Saturday to decide on the new leader. This time, he said, “the new leader will be an MLA”.Uttarakhand BJP spokesperson Manvir Singh Chauhan said Union minister and party veteran Narendra Singh Tomar will be the central observer at the MLA meet. “We have been told to come for the urgent legislative party meeting,” a BJP MLA said.The BJP has 56 MLAs in the 70-member house.Tirath Singh Rawat’s successor to be named on Saturday will be the Bharatiya Janata Party’s third chief minister since 2017 when the BJP delivered a stunning performance winning 57 seats in the 70-member assembly. Trivendra Singh Rawat, who became chief minister, was ejected from the seat in March when he was days short of completing four years in office.But this is not the first time that the state has seen a change within a five year term of the government. In 2007, BC Khanduri was elected as chief minister and continued in the seat for 2 years and 111 days; he was replaced by Ramesh Pokhariyal who also stayed in office for 2 years and 75 days between 2009 and 2011. In September 2011, Khanduri made a comeback and served another 184 days in the top job.The only Uttarakhand chief minister to complete the five-year-term is its first chief minister, ND Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/resigned-due-to-constitutional-crisis-says-uttarakhand-cm-tirath-singh-rawat-101625251791147.html
03-07-2021||Mumbai||BMC to rebuild 140-year-old Malabar Hill reservoir in south Mumbai||In a bid to increase the storage capacity for smooth supply of water, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has proposed to reconstruct the Malabar Hill reservoir, built in 1880, to supply drinking water to the Island city.BMC has planned the reconstruction in such a way that there will be no water cut in south Mumbai during the commencement of the work.Shirish Uchagaonkar, chief engineer of BMC’s water supply projects, said, “The plan is to reconstruct the reservoir in a period of five years at an approximate cost of ₹308 crore. There will be no water cut or shortage in the areas where water is supplied from Malabar Hill reservoir, during the work.”According to BMC officials, the decision to reconstruct the around 140-year-old reservoir was taken after a structural audit, done over two years ago, had indicated that the structure needs to be demolished and rebuilt.The Malabar Hill reservoir supplies drinking water to some of the prime areas in the city, including Colaba, Fort, Churchgate, Cuffe Parade, Chowpatty, Malabar Hill, Peddar Road and Altamount Road. The reservoir is located on the hillock and has a filtration bed to supply potable water to the city. The structure was built in masonry arch roof and rubble masonry columns. In 1925, the capacity augmentation of the reservoir had started. Now BMC has proposed to reconstruct the reservoir with necessary improvements including construction of a new pumping station, installation of pumps and piping as well as construction of a new substation structure and its commissioning.According to BMC officials, the current capacity of the reservoir is 146 million litres of water per day, of which around 80 million litres is usable. After the reconstruction of the reservoir, BMC plans to increase the storage to 200 million litres and make around 190 million litres usable.“Currently, there are six compartments in the reservoir, which after the reconstruction will increase to seven for storage of around 200 million litres of drinking water. At a time, only one compartment will be demolished and reconstructed so that there won’t be any impact on the supply of drinking water in the area,” said Uchagaonkar.Meanwhile, out of the seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai, Tansa and Vaitarna provide potable water to the Island city. According to BMC’s data, Mumbai currently has water stock for over 70 days as the level in the seven lakes is 19.36% as compared to 7.91% last year and 10.18% in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bmc-to-rebuild-140-year-old-malabar-hill-reservoir-in-south-mumbai-101625251371128.html

Hence, the CBI action was illegal and arbitrary, Deshmukh’s counsel argued. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing Deshmukh’s petition, was informed by senior counsel Amit Desai along with advocate Kamlesh Ghumre that there were serious procedural lapses on CBI’s part after HC ordered a probe against the then home minister of the state. While commencing his arguments for quashing of the FIR, Desai argued that the Supreme Court in one of its judgments had observed that a constitutional court should exercise caution when ordering a preliminary probe against a public servant if the accusations were uncorroborated and merely based on ‘whispers’. Desai said HC, while passing the April 5 order, should have considered the Apex court’s observations. However, the current bench, during a previous hearing, had clarified that it was only dealing with the petition challenging the FIR and would not review the April 5 order. Thereafter, Desai submitted that even before commencing the inquiry, CBI was bound to inform and get the state’s sanction to commence, it as it was probing Deshmukh’s role in the allegation when he was a public servant, but the central agency had failed to do so. Desai argued that while even 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab got the benefit under the rule of law, none was accorded to Deshmukh, and hence, CBI’s action was arbitrary. He further submitted that as the Maharashtra government had withdrawn the blanket consent to register FIR, CBI had to get the consent of the state prior to registering the case. It also did not take the consent of the state as per the Prevention of Corruption Act to initiate investigation against Deshmukh on the basis of the FIR, said the counsel. Desai will continue arguments on the invalidity of the contents of the FIR filed by CBI on July 5, which will then be countered by CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-failed-to-follow-rule-of-law-acted-arbitrarily-anil-deshmukh-to-bombay-hc-101625251310556.html

LIGO-India is a collaboration between the LIGO Laboratory (operated by Caltech and MIT), and three Institutes in India: the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT, in Indore), the Institute for Plasma Research (IPR in Ahmedabad), and the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA, in Pune).“The process of land acquisition is complete. Due to the pandemic, work has been delayed but talks are ongoing. During the lockdown, the physical work had stopped, but the science was ongoing,” said Raychaudhary.After 48 collisions between black holes, and two collisions between neutron stars, the discovery of a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) is a major breakthrough, the webinar noted. Scientists noted that this was the first confirmed detection of a pair of hybrid, neutron star-black hole collisions.During the webinar, scientists shared that although indirect detections of black holes of stellar mass, which result from collapse of a dead star and supermassive black holes, which are central engines of massive galaxies, were found, it was not known until recently whether intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) can exist.Archana Pai from IIT Bombay said that this was first detected on May 21, 2019 (event GW190521), and announced on September 2, 2020.“This led to a hunt for IMBH binaries in the year-long data run of Advanced LIGO-Virgo detectors. The results were announced by LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration of GW detectors (LVK) on May 31, 2021. In addition to confirmation of the previous results, it led to a revised understanding of how rare such massive mergers are,” said Pai.During the webinar, Dr Anupreeta More from IUCAA said that on May 13, this year, LVK announced the results of the search for lensing of GWs - the bending of GWs by gravity itself. “So far there have been no promising lens candidates which is consistent with our expectations, but even the absence of detectable lensing effects has already improved our knowledge of the compact binary merger rate in the distant universe,” said Dr More.Professor KG Arun from Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), Chennai, said that among the other science we can learn from observations of GWs, are tests for theories of gravity.“High speed collisions of black holes/neutron stars are excellent test-beds for general relativity (GR) and Einstein’s theory of gravity. Results from current observing runs show no hint of GR violation which means Einstein is still right. But, analyses are still ongoing. Significant contributions from several Indian institutes in these efforts, and LIGO-India can play a crucial role in certain tests of GR which use data from multiple detectors,” said Arun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ligo-india-waits-on-central-govt-approvals-iucaa-director-101625250830515.html

Schools located in these villages and water networks have not yet been handed over to the municipal corporation. The Pune Zilla Parishad is not ready to handover buildings in these villages, without a reimbursement from the PMC. Recently, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar held a meeting in Mumbai to discuss the issue. When questioned, ZP officials said, “The Zilla Parishad purchased the lands from private parties to start schools in these villages with loans.”PMC elected member Siddharth Dhende, who present for the meeting, said, “Pawar instructed the PMC that if the ZP borrowed for purchasing of properties, PMC needs to help them before taking ownership of the same. He instructed the Pune municipal commissioner and Zilla Parishad CEO to sort out it. “Even water pipelines in Uttamnagar and Shivane have not been handed over. The Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran, currently running the water network, wants ₹12 crore before the handover. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “Though the 11 villages merged in 2017, PMC has not able to provide enough water. Now 23 villages have been merged. We are capable to handle this vast area, but will require funds from state government for same.”Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal, who was present at the meeting, said, “ZP demanded ₹21 crore and we opposed it. We promised to give money only for those properties which were bought on loans. We have asked them to submit documents for the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zp-not-willing-to-handover-properties-in-merged-villages-for-free-101625250770496.html

03-07-2021||Delhi||Respite for Delhi as 4th day of heatwave ends with showers||After a week of scorching heat, residents of the national capital were treated to some relief on Friday evening, with rain in parts of the city which caused a 12 degree-drop in the temperature, said officials of the India Meteorological Department. However, the high daytime temperature meant that Delhi saw a heatwave for the fourth straight day, with the maximum mercury hitting 41°C at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the Capital.The minimum temperature at the station, recorded in the morning, fell to 27.2°C from 31.7°C the previous day. Experts said the city is likely to see rain in patches on Saturday as well, even as they warned that the temperature will resume its rise next week.IMD declares a heatwave in the plains when the maximum temperature crosses 40°C, and when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5°C. A severe heatwave is declared when there is a departure of 6.5°C or above from normal temperatures.“A thunderstorm with light intensity rain and gusty winds with a speed of 30-40kmph occurred over Delhi and parts of the National Capital Region, including Faridabad, Ballabhgarh and Gurugram,” Met officials said on Friday.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre said that between 2.30pm and 5.30pm on Friday, the Safdarjung observatory received 0.4mm rainfall, Palam received 26mm rain and the Lodhi Road station got 2.5mm rain. Aya Nagar received trace rain during this period.Weather experts said that temperatures reduced significantly after the rain, despite the heatwave conditions during the day.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (climate change and meteorology) at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecaster, said that there was a drop of around 12°C in Delhi’s temperature after the showers.“The temperatures fell from 37°C to around 25°C after the rain. Rain covered most parts of Delhi. Patchy rain is likely to continue on Saturday as well,” said Palawat.Scientists, however, warned that this relief was short-lived and temperatures will rise again in the Capital next week, till the monsoon arrives. IMD on Thursday said that the monsoon is unlikely to advance in the remaining parts of north-west India, including Delhi, till at least July 7.“Current forecast suggests that hot conditions and maximum temperature above 40°C will continue in and around Delhi till July 7. The maximum temperature is expected to reduce marginally on July 3 due to cloud cover and some thundershowers, but it will rise again from July 4,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD student at the University of Reading in England.Met officials also said the high temperatures are likely to be exacerbated by the high humidity levels, which will increase the “discomfort index”. The discomfort index is a metric used to measure the discomfort felt during warm spells, as a result of the combined effects of temperature and humidity of the air.When temperatures are high and the moisture level in the atmosphere also increases, the human body tends to feel greater discomfort. Such a weather phenomenon is usually seen during the end of June in Delhi, when patchy pre-monsoon showers increase moisture in the air, leading up to the arrival of monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/respite-for-delhi-as-4th-day-of-heatwave-ends-with-showers-101625250290603.html

The two patients were admitted in the Covid ward of the district hospital, while the remaining 17 discharged, he said.Nevertheless, the district administration is on alert and Covid desks have been set up at all the entry points on the Bahraich-Nepal border.Along with the district health department, the district police and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) have set up such Covid desks to test the samples of people coming from Nepal. The Nepal government had also set up Covid desks on the border to test the samples of people going from India, he said.During a Covid review meeting on Thursday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed officials to sound an alert in the districts bordering Nepal and maintain vigil on people coming from the Himalayan nation.Maharajganj district magistrate Ujjwal Kumar said the movement of people across the international border was minimal due to restrictions imposed by the Nepal and the Indian governments.Only movement of cargo was permitted between both the countries and the people who entered UP with special permission were screened at Covid desks set up on the border, he said. The district police and SSB were on alert, he said.A state government official said the authorities in seven districts bordering Nepal — Pilibhit, Balrampur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Bahraich, Shravasti, Siddharthnagar and Maharajganj districts — were on alert following directions of the chief minister. The district administration officers were directed to screen all the people coming from Nepal for Covid-19, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/only-two-tested-positive-after-returning-from-nepal-earlier-figure-of-19-was-due-to-technical-error-says-up-official-101625249331039.html

Based on prima facie evidence, police suspect that the senior citizen allegedly killed his wife with a blunt object before committing suicide.Police said the couple’s 16-year-old foster son was studying in an adjacent room when the incident happened.A 61-year-old man allegedly killed his wife with a blunt object and then hanged himself while their 16-year-old foster son was studying in another room in their house in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj on Thursday evening, police said.The police are waiting for the couple’s autopsy report to ascertain the exact cause of their deaths. Police also said that they are yet to find the blunt object used in the attack.Senior police officers said that the couple, who lived in a third floor flat, were having a marital discord for the past seven years.According to police, the 53-year-old woman, who owned the flat, had filed an eviction notice in court against her husband, in addition to cases of dowry harassment and domestic and physical violence against him at the local Vasant Kunj south police station. The dowry harassment case is pending in court.Investigators, quoting statements of the couple’s son and other relatives, further said that the man was arrested a few years ago for allegedly assaulting his wife.“We are waiting for the couple’s autopsy report to ascertain the cause of their deaths. Accordingly, a case will be registered. We are also making efforts to find the weapon that was used in the woman’s killing,” said DCP (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh.Additional DCP (southwest) Amit Goel said that the police control room received a call about the deaths at around 7.30 pm on Thursday.According to Goel, the couple’s son told police that he was studying in his room when he heard a loud sound in the drawing room.

03-07-2021||Other||Happiness curriculum will bring sea change in society: Sisodia||The Delhi government on Friday celebrated ‘Happiness Utsav’ to mark the third anniversary of the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) ambitious Happiness Curriculum which is being taught across public schools in the Capital.To mark the event, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia interacted with students, teachers and parents to learn about the changes it has brought about in their lives. He also interacted with a panel of international experts to discuss Delhi’s experience and the international best practices on social-emotional learning.The AAP government had introduced the happiness curriculum in Delhi government schools on July 2, 2018. Under the curriculum, sessions are held twice a week for nursery and kindergarten students, and daily for students in classes 1 to 8. The sessions include meditation, storytelling, and other activities, followed by question-and-answer sessions.Emphasising on the impact of the Happiness Curriculum, Sisodia said, “It is a great joy to hear that the Happiness Curriculum has brought about a change in the lives of children, their families and also their teachers. If there has been any significant change among the children due to the Happiness Classes in just 2-3 years, in the coming 10 years, the children will adopt happiness in their life fully and it will grow to become an important component of their everyday life. These are the real happiness agents and will bring a sea change in the society.”During the virtual interaction, several students also shared their experiences with their education minister.Sparsh Aggarwal, a Class 7 at a government school in Kalkaji, said that she learned how “one should never give up on their efforts despite persistent challenges”.Another Class 7 student Rakshit, from a government school in Rohini Sector-9, narrated about the changes in his life because of the happiness classes. “Earlier, I was addicted to mobile games, leading to irritability and pain in my eyes. But with the practice of mindfulness and other activities learned in the Happiness class, I now feel stress-free and have started taking more interest in academics,” he said.Prachi, a Class 9 student, said that she has been able to control her anger better.Later in the day, Sisodia also interacted with an international panel of experts on the Happiness Curriculum. Dr Scherto R Gill, chair of G20 Interfaith Forum’s education working group, said, “Education around the world should be about well-being, self-exploration, and co-inquiry. The ecosystem Delhi has managed to create is almost a haven of sorts which allows conversations around well-being, collaboration, happiness and such.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/happiness-curriculum-will-bring-sea-change-in-societysisodia-101625249090867.html
03-07-2021||Delhi||Sports varsity to kick off this year from govt school building in Civil Lines||The upcoming Delhi Sports University will start operations this year in a government school building and sports complex in north Delhi’s Civil Lines area,government officials aware of the matter said on Friday. The University will continue to run out of the Shaheed Amir Chand government Sarvodaya Vidyalaya (SAC GSV) till construction work on the varsity’s Mundka complex ends, officials said, just over a week after the state government appointed as its vice-chancellor Karnam Malleswari, India’s first female Olympic medallist.According to the minutes of a June 23 meeting — attended by Delhi director of education Udit Prakash Rai, Chandni Chowk MLA Parlad Singh Sawhney, and other government officials, apart from members of the School Management Committee — the Civil Lines school and nearby sports complexes will be used as the administrative block and as classes for the sports university.“Augmentation and procurement of infrastructure and other facilities will take about one year at the designated location [in Mundka]. Therefore... it has been decided to use the premises of SAC, GSV, Sham Nath Marg and nearby sports complexes for the purpose of administrative block and classes for the sports university,” said the minutes.Classes for the university will be conducted at the Ludlow Castle Sports Complex in Civil Lines, said the minutes.Some of the students of the Civil Lines government school will be moved to other nearby institutions in the meanwhile, and others will continue at the same school, but in another block, said state government officials aware of the matter.The state cabinet in October 2019 passed an order setting up the university in Mundka. Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal at the time, said the university will offer field-specific degrees that will be at par with those offered in other courses at the graduate, post-graduate and doctoral levels.The government in the same month allocated the university a 90-acre plot in outer Delhi’s Mundka. However, construction work on the university was disrupted because of the pandemic and has not started yet. Weightlifting champion Malleswari was named the varsity’s V-C on June 24.The government is yet to announce either the curriculum or admission criteria for the university.During the meeting, it was decided that while the students of the Civil Lines school in nursery till Class 8 will be shifted to three nearby government schools, those in classes 9 to 12 will continue in another block of the same school.“The 74 girls of the middle section and primary students may be shifted to Sarvodaya Vidyalaya Shankaracharya Marg. The 364 boys of middle sections may be shifted to SBV Gokhle Marg and SV No.1 Mori Gate. The remaining 985 students of classes 9 to 12 will remain in the old block of the same school,” the minutes said, adding that the MLA, parents and SMC members approved the proposal.When contacted, Delhi government officials, SMC members and Sawhney confirmed the decision.A senior Delhi government official said, “The decision has been taken because construction work in Mundka has been delayed due to the pandemic… Some existing students of the school will be shifted to nearby schools without causing any inconvenience to them or their parents.”Some members of the School Management Committee flagged their concerns over shifting students and wrote to the office of Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on June 26 against the move.Shashi Singh, an SMC member, told HT, “The Delhi government should tell us how much time it will take to build the University campus. Whenever that is done, all students should be shifted back to this school. It will be very difficult for students to suddenly switch to another school and adjust with new teachers at a time when classes are being held online.”Sawhney, however, said he has so far been approached by only one parent concerned about the move. “The decision has been taken keeping the interest of students in mind. It will help the university to start functioning at the earliest. Besides, the schools are shut due to Covid-19 and it is expected that they won’t reopen anytime soon,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-sports-university-to-kick-off-this-year-from-govt-school-building-in-civil-lines-101625249031750.html
03-07-2021||Delhi||As crowds pack markets in Delhi, govt tells districts to crack the whip||After the Laxmi Nagar market in east Delhi was ordered shut earlier this week over violations of Covid-19 regulations and another three prominent markets warned of similar action, the Delhi government on Friday directed district administrations to keep a close tab on the attendance and whereabouts of civil defence volunteers deployed in marketplaces to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 regulations.“We are taking all possible steps to ensure that there is no crowding in marketplaces, and that social distancing and other Covid-19 regulations are adhered to. We are doing our best to provide opportunities to traders to revive their businesses, but after taking adequate precautions. There is a possibility of another Covid-19 wave if we let our guards down. Apart from enforcement teams, we have also deployed civil defence volunteers in markets. Directions have been issued to districts and subdivisions to keep a close tab on the attendance of these volunteers,” said revenue minister Kailash Gahlot.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEarlier this week, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) ordered shut for a week the market in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar over alleged violations of Covid-19 protocols. Since June 20, as per documents seen by HT, at least three more prominent markets in the city – Sadar Bazar, Sarojini Nagar and Kamla Nagar – were issued notices either by the police or district authorities warning them of similar action.Markets in the city have a complicated structure, said trader bodies. They comprise traders, employees, porters, labourers, rickshaw pullers, transporters and, finally, customers. “It takes a whole lot of effort to coordinate these many stakeholders and ensure that Covid-19 regulations such as social distancing and mask compliance are adhered to throughout the day. Agencies such as the police and the revenue department are entrusted with enforcement of regulations,” said a senior government official, who asked not to be identified.The official further said, “The civil defence volunteers have an important role in such a scenario. They are primarily entrusted with the coordination between stakeholders and enforcement agencies. They are to interact with traders, customers and officers throughout the day to ensure that regulations are met. However, in the past few days, we received several complaints from traders that volunteers could not be spotted in markets. So, we decided to make the attendance system more stringent. Now, throughout the shift, they will have to report to their respective SDM office and also their location details. WhatsApp groups have been made for the purpose.”The number of volunteers deployed in a market depends on the size and nature of the market. For instance, a weekly market in Najafgarh may have only two volunteers, while a bustling one such as the Lajpat Nagar market will have 20 volunteers at any given time. In markets, they are usually deployed in two shifts between 8am and 10pm.“They are often divided into groups and each group is given a video camera for recording their surroundings. The recordings help us monitor each market and issue prosecution fines; the videos also act as evidence if any case of any penalty dispute,” the official said.Devraj Baweja, president of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Confederation, said, “Covid-19 regulations can be followed in markets only with better coordination between stakeholders and enforcement agencies. Civil defence volunteers can help immensely in scaling up such coordination. Several volunteers have been deployed in the market but we hardly see them. I hope that the new policy to keep a tab on the attendance and whereabouts of volunteers will help in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-crowds-pack-markets-in-delhi-govt-tells-districts-to-crack-the-whip-101625248972002.html

The numbers from the four central government-run hospitals in Delhi were not immediately available.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCases of mucormycosis rose sharply across India during the April-May surge of infections as a secondary infection among patients infected with Covid-19 due to a diabetes complication or the indiscriminate use of steroids. Between the second and third week of May, over 600 patients were being treated for black fungus in Delhi.The state government declared mucormycosis an epidemic and notifiable disease on May 18.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), one of the four central government hospitals, has been treating over 100 cases of the infection at any given time since mid-May. In comparison, the hospital used to see 12 to 14 cases of the rare infection over an entire year.The state government-run--Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals--were treating 157 and 133 patients respectively as on Tuesday, said officials.With 84 patients, Sir Ganga Ram hospital is treating maximum cases of all the private sector facilities.Hospital officials, however, said they are still running short of Amphotericin-B, the only last-line drug that can treat the fungal infection.“The number of new admissions has gone down a bit, but we might have been able to treat the patients better if the medicine was readily and regularly available. The supply of medicine is still not as per demand,” said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital.An AIIMS official said, “We now have around 100 patients with mucormycosis, though the numbers have reduced over the last one week. Earlier, we were treating more patients. The supply has improved but the medicine is not available every day and not always in the required quantity,”Every mucormycosis patient needs 50 vials of Amphotericin-B per week on average, extending to even 100 vials in severe cases, as per officials. So far, Delhi has received over 22,000 doses since the government took control of the distribution of the medicine across the country in May. The Delhi government wrote to the Centre asking for 100,000 doses of the medicine over a period of two months on May 20..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/760-black-fungus-patients-still-being-treated-in-delhi-hospitals-101625248850429.html

The warkaris were isolated and measures were taken to do RT-PCR test of the warkaris which came in their contact. Earlier, the state government had given permission to 100 warkaris to remain present for the ceremony. However, after the request of the Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj temple committee, permission was given to 430 warkaris. Since the last two days, temple management committee was conducting RT-PCR test of all warkaris who have started visiting pilgrimage town of Dehu since June 30. Every year in Alandi, 430 registered dindhis gather for the pilgrimage walk of Pandharpur. Only one representative from each dindhi was allowed this year due to Covid restrictions. “Once their reports were received, all of them were quarantined. All the warkaris did not showed any symptoms of flu or cough during the RT-PCR test. We immediately did the contact tracing of persons who came in their contact. Few reports are yet to come,” said health official from Alandi Municipal Council on request of anonymity. All the warkaris were given lodging facilities in Mumbai Maratha Frutiwala Dharamshala. “All the 37 who tested positive have been sent for isolation and further medication is on. Those warkaris who came in their contact were only given entry on the temple premises after their RT-PCR test came negative,” said Vikas Dhage Patil, trustee, Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Temple, Alandi.

03-07-2021||Pune||Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj “palkhi prasthan” commences with limited warkaris||The “palkhi prasthan” (departure) ceremony of Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj was held with reverence by devotees from the main temple at around 6.15 pm. The number of warkaris allowed inside the temple for the ceremony was limited due to the Covid restrictions. The religious function was streamed online through the Alandi temple trust on their social media platforms. For the prasthan ceremony, Pune district principal judge N P Dhote, state Vidhan Parishad deputy chairperson Neelam Gorhe, MP Bandu Jadhav, Palkhi ceremony head for this year advocate Vikas Dhage Patil and other dignitaries were present. Before the prasthan ceremony, all traditional rituals before the palkhi was solemnly carried out of the temple were performed since morning. As the walking wari tradition is cancelled for this year, from July 3 to July 19, the palkhi will remain in Alandi and on July 19 — Ashadhi Ekadashi — the palkhi will carried in a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus towards Pandharpur. “There was a lot of enthusiasm amongst the selected warkaris and other representatives of each dindi ((group of warkaris) as they gathered from all over the state. Social distancing and other Covid protocols were followed in today’s prasthan ceremony and now the palkhi will be kept in Alandi till July 19,” said advocate Patil. Last year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the historic wari (pilgrimage) tradition in Maharashtra was not carried out. Every year, lakhs of pilgrims walk from Dehu and Alandi to Pandharpur, all devotees of Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshwar. While cancelling the walking tradition of wari, palkhis of both the sants were taken into MSRTC bus to Pandharpur last year with only few selected warkaris in the bus. Before the pandemic, annually more than 3 to 4 lakh warkaris join in several dindis with the Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram Maharaj palkhi which starts from Alandi and Dehu village respectively. There are around 250 registered dindis which follow the palkhi on its way to Pandharpur and lakhs of warkaris walk in the wari. Dindis from across Maharashtra start coming to Alandi and Dehu a week before the starting day and then both the villages are crowded with warkaris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sant-dnyaneshwar-maharaj-palkhi-prasthan-commences-with-limited-warkaris-101625242910297.html
03-07-2021||Pune||Pune civic body audits Covid bills, returns Rs19,51,642 to patients, families in 7 days||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) scrutinised 69 Covid bills between June 24 and June 30 and returned Rs19,51,642 to patients and their families. The civic body initiated the Covid bill audit last year following reports of inflated bills by private hospitals. Though bills above ₹1.5 lakh were audited earlier, post second wave in May, all Covid bills are probed. Dr Ashish Bharti, PMC health chief, said that auditors appointed at 30 private hospitals check pre and post-Covid treatment bills of these hospitals across the city. “We have 30 auditors so far and every bill is scrutinised by them. The intention is no Covid patient should be overcharged,” said Dr Bharti. As per PMC officials, ₹4,84,26,733 was returned to Covid patients and their families by June 26 and 1,469 bills were audited. Rubal Agarwal, PMC assistant commissioner, said PMC covers all major private hospitals for bill audits. “As of now, as there are less cases, we have only covered big private hospitals. As the cases increase, we may rethink of covering more hospitals. If there are any complaints, the patient and their family can reach out to PMC anytime,” said Agarwal. As the second wave of Covid started in March, private hospital bills were audited by the PMC officials as many patients complained about overcharging and inflation of bills by private hospitals. Many private hospitals despite several notices by PMC were seen charging inflated bills to Covid patients. Health activists from the city have urged the civic body to scrutinise bills of non-Covid patients as well. State health minister Rajesh Tope in May instructed PMC to conduct audit of all Covid bills. He stated that earlier only bills above Rs1.5 lakh were audited. However, now, every bill of Covid-19 treatment should be audited as many hospitals break up the bills into multiple parts with small amounts. A separate auditor should be assigned by the administration at each private hospital, said Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-audits-covid-bills-returns-rs19-51-642-to-patients-families-in-7-days-101625242069695.html
03-07-2021||Pune||Ajit Pawar proposes restart of medical colleges offline in Maharashtra||Following the Covid review meeting in Pune, Ajit Pawar proposed the resumption of offline classes in medical colleges across the state. Pawar said that he would suggest to the chief minister and the medical education minister that the classes in medical colleges with fully vaccinated students and professors could be restarted with Covid-appropriate behavior. Pawar said that each year thousands of doctors pass out from these colleges and in the pandemic their services are essential. “On the state level, we are thinking of restarting the classes in medical colleges if students and staff are fully vaccinated. Every year thousands of doctors pass out from these institutions. If medical colleges remain closed then this will get hampered. It would cause scarcity of doctors. I will suggest this to the CM and medical education minister. As a precautionary measure the students and the staff can be tested after 10-15 days of classes,” said Pawar following the weekly Covid review meeting at the divisional commissioner office. Dr Prashant Munde advised the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) wing in BJ Medical college Pune that offline classes could be restarted. “The offline classes with fully vaccinated students and the staff can be resumed. Undergraduate and Postgraduate medical students can be benefitted. Also, by resuming the academic activities, administration will get doctors. According to me, even the NEET should not have been postponed,” said Dr Munde, advisor to MARD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pawar-proposes-restart-of-medical-colleges-offline-in-state-101625240929575.html

After the anti-encroachment action, Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol had alleged that the PMC administration had acted under pressure from a “big” leader without naming Pawar. The affected residents also carried out a protest in front of the PMC building and anti-Pawar slogans were raised in the presence of MP Supriya Sule. “Slogans were raised against me in front of Supriya. Often such issues are politicised to hamper the good work,” he said.

Level 3 restrictions would continue for the coming week. According to officials, the positivity rate in Pune has marginally increased over the last week’s rate.

Pawar said that experts have advised against reopening malls. “As air conditioners on the premises circulate same air so it has been decided to keep malls closed,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/level-3-restrictions-to-continue-in-pune-city-101625239789461.html
03-07-2021||Pune||Sugar mills sold after HC’s orders in 2010: Ajit Pawar||After the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached the properties of Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sugar Karkhana (Jarandeshwar SSK) on Thursday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar claimed that there were no irregularities in the selling procedure of the mill in 2010. Speaking in Pune on Friday, Pawar asserted that the board of directors of Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB) did not sell the sugar mills directly and it was done as per the orders given by the Bombay High Court. He also said that the directors of Jarandeshwar SSK mill will appeal in court against the latest action. “While selling Jarandeshwar sugar mill, MSCB followed all the due procedures. About 12-15 companies had applied in the tendering process. The highest bid was offered by Guru Commodity situated in Mumbai for ₹65.75 crores and the mill was sold at this price. Other mills were also purchased by various companies. Many owners of the mills appealed against this in courts, but the results were not in their favour,” said Pawar. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday said it had attached assets worth ₹65.75 crore belonging to Jarandeshwar SSK situated at Chimangaon-Koregaon in Satara in connection with the money laundering case involving Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank while adding that a firm linked to state deputy chief minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra was involved in the case. Pawar categorically denied any wrongdoing in the matter. He claimed that multiple investigations have already been done by several other agencies, but nothing has come out of it. “An agency has a total right to do the inquiry. During the tenure of the last government, CID had done an inquiry after it received complaints. But nothing came out of it. After that, the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) started an inquiry but nothing came out of that as well. Many PILs have been heard in the high court regarding the matter. A committee of retired judges had also done an inquiry in the selling of these mills. The allegations of me snatching away the sugar mills have been made earlier as well. But the sugar mill was not sold by the board of directors. It was done after the order of Bombay high court,” said Pawar. He said that the current directors of Jarandeshwar SSK would appeal in the courts against the action taken by the agency. “There are no irregularities in the operations of Jarandeshwar sugar mill. When the directors of this mill were called by ED for the inquiry, they showed all the records to them. So, why the ED has started this action regarding Guru Commodity is beyond me. The directors of Jarandeshwar sugar mill will appeal in court for justice. Thousands of farmers and workers are dependent on this mill for their livelihoods,” he said. BJP state president Chandrakant Patil alleged that the wrongdoings came forth related to Jarandeshwar SSK is just a tip of the iceberg of fraudulent selling of the 24 SSKs and all such transactions are now on ED’s radar. “The action on the Jarandeshwar SSK is just the beginning. Inquiries of the sugar mills and cotton mills acquired in peanut amounts through MSCB are on ED’s radar. The fraudulent pattern to take over the property of sugar mills has been unveiled. After the ED’s action on Jarandeshwar SSK, the transaction paperwork has come into public domain,” said Patil. Patil refuted the allegation that the action taken by the central agency is to create political pressure. “Those who complain about the action first should accept that there has been a fraud.

A tiny tile particle penetrated the eye of Yashim Shaikh while playing at his home, leaving his vision defective and eye red. Yashim’s parents rushed him to Dr Agarwal’s Eye Hospital, Aundh that later carried out surgeries. The medical treatment was done in the first week of May this year and the hospital released the information in July as the boy was kept under observation for two months with regular follow-ups.Doctors diagnosed three severe conditions: penetrating eye injury with corneoscleral tear, iris prolapse and pupil disfiguration. A medical team, headed by senior eye surgeon (ophthalmologist) Dr Ashis Ghosh performed corneal tear repair, iris excision, and pupilloplasty — a procedure on the iris to alter the shape of the disfigured pupil, while the patient was under general anesthesia. The boy got back 100 per cent vision of his left eye within 24 hours. Dr Ghosh said that the damages to the boy’s left eye were severe, necessitating immediate surgical intervention and multiple structures. “The interventions were challenging and critical. The procedures involved conjunctival peritomy, to expose the wound; corneoscleral tear repair, and single-pass 4-throw pupilloplasty for the reconstruction of the pupil. Any minor flaw in pupil reconstruction could lead to the patient losing at least 50 per cent of the vision with disturbing glare at daytime. The damage would be lifelong. Fine corneal suturing is also vital to maintain the corneal contour and ocular surface which is significant to reduce high astigmatic spectacle power,” said Dr Ghosh. The boy was under observation for about four hours after the surgeries and discharged. The bandage on the left eye was removed the next day and the boy gained full recovery of his vision, according to the hospital. Dr Ghosh said ocular injuries are one of the leading causes of blindness. It affects mainly younger generations, in the 20-40 year age group. According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report, every year over 55 million eye injuries which restrict activities more than one day occur across the world. The prevalence of ocular trauma is reported to be 2.4 per cent of the urban population in India and 11.4 per cent of those who sustain injuries lose vision. Dr Pankaj Asawa, medical director, Dr Agarwal’s Eye Hospital, said eye injuries can be prevented by teaching children to handle things and play carefully, preventing them from playing with sharp objects, and encouraging teenagers and adult to wear protective eyewear such as goggles and glass in workplace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-docs-save-5-yr-old-s-left-eye-injured-by-tile-particle-101625231148705.html

The unprecedented heatwave began on June 25 and ravaged the continent’s northwest before slowly subsiding.Also Read: Extreme weather blamed, authorities monitoring wildfiresCanada is so far the worst hit of the two nations in terms of the number of fatalities. The heatwave there has claimed as many as 700 lives over the last one week alone, according to officials. Two people were reported to have died due to a raging wildfire triggered by the heat in the village of Lytton in British Columbia, which had sizzled under a record high temperature of 49.6°C earlier in the week.It has been reported that one of well more than 100 wildfires peppering the heatwave-hit western part of Canada, especially British Columbia, has decimated about 90% of Lytton.Numbers could go upBritish Columbia’s chief coroner Lisa Lapointe told reporters that 719 sudden deaths were recorded in the province in the week ending July 1 – which is three times higher than the average tally. The high temperatures are believed to be a significant contributing factor in the jump, and the number is expected to increase as more information is compiled, Lapointe said.The escalating crisis sent Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau into an emergency huddle with the country’s incident response group as they discussed ways to combat it, focusing largely on British Columbia.Across the border, the US state of Washington’s authorities have linked about 30 deaths to the heat, with more reports coming in each day this week.Nearly 100 die in OregonThe death toll in Oregon alone has reached 95, the state medical examiner said on Friday, with most occurring in Multnomah county, which encompasses the hard-hit city of Portland. The deaths include a Guatemalan immigrant who collapsed as he worked at a nursery in an Oregon town amid the heat.“I think, over time, we will understand that the numbers are only going to climb,” feared Steve Mitchell, director of Harborview Medical Center’s emergency medicine department in Seattle. “I know, in my experience, that I’m expecting to see much larger numbers than what we are currently able to report because of talking to colleagues who were experiencing twice as many calls for help that day.”There were 1,792 emergency room visits for suspected heat-related illness since June 25, the Washington state department of health said on Thursday. Of those visits, 21% required people to be admitted to the hospital.Monday had the most emergency room visits, with 702, the health department said. It was the hottest day of the heat wave in many areas, with Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and other cities smashing all-time heat records. It reached 42°C in Seattle, and 47°C in Oregon’s largest city.Over 170 wildfires rageIn Canada, the military was on standby to evacuate towns and fight over 170 wildfires fuelled by the heatwave and tinder-dry conditions as the government in Ottawa warned of a “long and challenging summer” ahead. At least 177 fires were active in the western province of British Columbia, 76 of them sparked in the last two days, officials said.(With inputs from Anirudh Bhattacharyya)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-heatwave-toll-tops-800-101625334250895.html

Experts fear that these attacks can have a multiplying effect as hackers can access and infiltrate the customers of the MSPs.In Sweden, more than 800 stores of grocery chain Coop’s could not open on Saturday after the attack led to a malfunction of its cash registers, Coop spokesperson Therese Knapp told news agency Bloomberg.The recent attack has affected MSPs in 11 countries, according to Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET. The hackers attacked Kaseya Ltd, a Miami-based developer of software used by these MSPs. The attack was orchestrated to attack Kaseya’s customers.“What makes this attack stand out is the trickle-down effect, from the managed service provider to the small business. Kaseya handles large enterprises all the way to small businesses globally, so ultimately, it has the potential to spread to any size or scale business,” Hammond was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.Kaseya said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been notified and it has identified at least 40 customers impacted by the attack. The president of Avtex LLC, one of MSPs affected by the breach, George Demou said that the attack appears to be a global supply chain hack as hundreds of MSPs have been targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-ransomware-group-strikes-again-affects-800-stores-in-sweden-101625330820552.html
03-07-2021||World||Expert calls unvaccinated people ‘variant factories’ as Delta continues to evolve||An infectious diseases expert has said that unvaccinated individuals do not merely risk their own health but are potential ‘factories’ of coronavirus variants, according to CNN. Countries are running against time to vaccinate people against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as highly transmissible variants are rapidly spreading across the world.The lack of vaccine availability in low- and lower-middle-income countries, along with vaccine hesitancy across the world, has been working as an impediment in suppressing the emergence of new virus variants and deadly mutations. Dr William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that the higher the number of unvaccinated people, the more opportunities the virus will have to multiply, reported CNN.While all viruses mutate and some mutations even weaken the virus, mutations like the variants of concern, including the Delta variant, could disrupt the pandemic response. "When it does, it mutates, and it could throw off a variant mutation that is even more serious down the road," Schaffner was quoted by CNN as saying.According to experts, a mutant version has to replicate itself to become a variant and unvaccinated groups provide that opportunity. Since viruses that don’t spread cannot mutate, maximum vaccination coverage is an effective tool to stop mutations from becoming a variant of concern. "The more we allow the virus to spread, the more opportunity the virus has to change," the World Health Organization (WHO) said last month.Also Read | World in ‘very dangerous period’ as Delta variant continues to mutate, warns WHO chiefThe Delta variant has already been reported from nearly 100 countries and the UN health agency on Friday warned that the world is in a “very dangerous period” of this pandemic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing that the Delta variant is continuing to evolve and mutate, suggesting constant evaluation and careful adjustment of the public health response."I have urged leaders across the world to work together to ensure that by this time next year, 70% of all people in every country are vaccinated [against Covid-19]," said the WHO chief.The Delta variant has further mutated to form the Delta plus, characterised by B.1.617.2 variant acquiring another mutation, K417N, also found in the B.1.351 or Beta variant of concern. India has classified it as a "variant of concern", saying the mutation spreads more easily, binds more easily to lung cells and is potentially resistant to monoclonal antibody therapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expert-calls-unvaccinated-people-variant-factories-as-delta-continues-to-evolve-101625328191655.html

The spokesperson of the separatist group Azad Baloch said that it released three men out of the six but continued to detain the rest as they were deemed suspicious by the group.He said that the outfit decided that if the United Nations (UN) or international organisations including representatives of the Red Cross in Geneva act as guarantors for the release of rest of the men and provide assurance that these men will not again work for spy networks of the Pakistani army they will release the rest of the hostages. The BLA said that these men should not return to work in such ‘exploitative projects’.Azad Baloch gave the international bodies 10 days to respond to their demands. The BLa had earlier warned the telecommunication companies against working as ‘facilitators in expansionist ambitions of the imperialist powers.’China set up a communications network in Pakistan using telecom giants Huawei, Netcom, Exeleron and ZTE to spy and trace Balochistan's citizens under the Universal Service Fund programme, the ANI report said. The report also pointed out that these telecom companies set up towers in uninhabited hilly areas to exchange information about the Baloch separatist movement. Balochistan is the focal point of China's $60 billion Belt and Road development programme.Clashes between Baloch separatists and Pakistan army continues as last week five soldiers died in Sangan in Quetta.

One individual has already succumbed to the virus, and two new cases have also been detected. This comes as the country is battling a deadly third wave of coronavirus.Black fungus or mucormycosis, which is caused by exposure to mucor mold, commonly found in soil, air, in the nose and mucus of human beings, was reported in India during the brutal second wave of coronavirus. It spreads through the respiratory tract and erodes facial structures. In severe cases, doctors have to operate on black fungus patients to surgically remove the eye to keep the infection from reaching the brain, and turning deadly.Cases of black fungus have been cropping up in Egypt and Oman since the beginning of June, reported Reuters. Immunocompromised patients who are recovering from coronavirus are more likely to be infected by it. Use of certain over-the-counter medicines like steroids in treating the virus has also caused mucormycosis cases to rise.Also Read: 128 died of black fungus in Mumbai hospitals since FebAfghanistan has been struggling to treat patients as its crumbling healthcare infrastructure is unable to keep up with the rising number of daily cases.

Miranda has alleged he was under "undue pressure" to sign off on the deal with India's Bharat Biotech International Limited for 20 million doses of its anti Covid-19 shot, Covaxin. He also spoke of "irregularities" in the invoices, particularly in a $45 million upfront payment to a Singapore-based company.On its part, Bharat Biotech, headquartered in the southern city of Hyderabad, has denied receiving any advance payment from the Bolsonaro government for Covaxin. Though the vaccine received emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the Latin American nation in early June, negotiations between the two sides were on for the last seven-eight months.Also Read: Bharat Biotech says it received no advance payment from Brazil govt for CovaxinIn their deposition, the Miranda brothers also accused Bolsonaro of assuring them he would report the alleged irregularities to the Federal Police. The police, however, say they never received any request to investigate the deal.Now, prosecutors will probe Bolsonaro, who has denied any wrongdoing, for "prevarication." This is a crime when a public official, for "reasons of personal interest," delays an action, or refrains from carrying out an action, which they are required to perform as a part of their duties.The development comes at a time when Bolsonaro is facing pressure over his government's handling of the pandemic. He is also due to face a presidential election next year.According to Johns Hopkins University, Brazil has thus far recorded 18,687,469 Covid-19 cases, and is only behind the United States and India, respectively, on that count.

The two rockets, scheduled to be launched on separate days, will team up with Nasa’s Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) satellite to advance our understanding of the atmospheric dynamo, said the US space agency.About 80,000 metres above the Earth surface, where the atmosphere blends into space, a pattern of electrical current swirls in continent-sized circuits forming an Earth-sized electric generator. The giant electrical current migrates across the planet in the ionosphere wherever the Sun is directly overhead. In the ionosphere, the Sun's intense radiation separates electrons from their atoms, allowing electricity to flow.While most measurements of the dynamo come from magnetometers, a device on the ground that monitors the way current disturbs Earth’s magnetic field, taking measurements from inside the ionosphere will provide more detail about the phenomenon. Earth’s ionosphere is the dynamic region high in the atmosphere where terrestrial weather from below meets space weather from above.Also Read | 'We're going big': Nasa's Ingenuity copter set to push its limits for next flight on MarsScott England, a space physicist and collaborator for the upcoming Dynamo-2 campaign, said that the measure from inside the ionosphere is a “really tricky part” because the air is much too thin for an aircraft and too dense to fly most spacecraft. “So one way of making these measurements is to fly a rocket through it,” England added.One sounding rocket will launch into “quiet” conditions, while the other will launch into “disturbed” conditions, on two separate days. The launches will be timed so that the ICON satellite, designed to investigate changes in the ionosphere of Earth, will be passing over at the same time to compare data.The sounding rockets will make brief measurements in space before falling back to Earth a few minutes later.“While ground-based methods can provide large-scale, integrated measurements, sounding rockets give us local, fine-scale data on the ionospheric current,” said Takumi Abe, a space physicist at JAXA and collaborator for the Dynamo missions.The Dynamo-2 rockets will launch from Nasa’s Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia on separate days between July 6-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-rockets-satellite-team-up-to-study-earth-sized-electric-generator-101625323095538.html

The investigation was launched two days after Didi Chuxing debuted in the New York Stock Exchange. The news of the investigation knocked off 5% off Beijing-based Didi’s shares on Friday. Didi’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) was the bourse’s second-biggest of the year.The Chinese government’s internet watchdog claims that the investigation is aimed at preventing security-related risks. It has also prevented its application from accepting new users until the investigation is over. Didi Chuxing said that they will cooperate with the relevant government authority. It said that apart from taking in new users its operations are continuing normally.Didi Vice President Li Min said that Didi Global Inc stores all China user and road data at servers in the country and denied all possibilities that the company passed data to the United States. Min also said that it would sue any social media user who claimed that Didi transferred data during its recent IPO process after several such claims were made on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media platform.“Like many overseas-listed Chinese companies, Didi stores all domestic user data at servers in China, it is absolutely not possible to pass data to the United States,” Li said in a post on Weibo, according to news agency Reuters. Didi said that it will conduct a comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks.Several experts however believe that the investigation on Didi is a measure to control the country's fast-growing and freewheeling tech sector. The Wall Street Journal in a report said that China increased its crackdown on tech companies citing anti-competitive practices among Chinese internet giants. It also said that the Chinese government called out tech companies citing alleged offences, including inconsistent pricing, user privacy concerns and difficult working conditions.Earlier in April, the Chinese government slapped a $2.8 billion dollar fine on Alibaba claiming it had abused its dominant market position by engaging in controversial practices.(with inputs from Reuters, ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-alibaba-chinese-govt-cracks-down-on-ride-hailing-company-didi-chuxing-101625322276556.html

Cancer patients experience a higher burden of Covid-19 severity, complications, and mortality than the general population, and little data were available on vaccine efficacy in such high-risk patients.An international team of researchers surveyed 131 patients with cancer to study the immune response to mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. Among them, 94% developed antibodies to the coronavirus while seven high-risk patients did not. The small group of patients who exhibited no response to the mRNA vaccines raised questions about how their protection against the virus will be addressed moving forward."We could not find any antibodies against the virus in those patients," said Dimpy P. Shah, MD, PhD, of the Mays Cancer Center, home to UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson. "That has implications for the future. Should we provide a third dose of vaccine after cancer therapy has completed in certain high-risk patients?"Also Read | Delta symptoms may differ from traditional Covid symptoms, claims studyWhich group is less likely to respond to Covid vaccines?The median age of patients included in the survey was 63 and most of them (106) had solid cancers as against haematological malignancies (25). Pankil K. Shah, a co-lead author of the study, said that patients with haematological malignancies, such as myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma, were less likely to respond to vaccination than those with solid tumours.Among the patients, those receiving Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of haematological cancers and autoimmune diseases, within six months of vaccination developed no antibodies. Patients on chemotherapy developed antibody response but it was muted compared to the general population.“How that relates to protection against Covid-19, we don't know yet," Dr Dimpy Shah said.The study suggests that patients with high-risk cancers should continue taking precautions even after being vaccinated. The findings of the study were published in the journal 'Cancer Cell'.Limitations of the studyThe highly transmissible Delta variant and other mutants were not examined in the study. The team also did not analyze the response of infection-fighting T cells and B cells in patients with cancer. The study population was 80% non-Hispanic white, 18% Hispanic and 2% Black, which means immune response among Black may vary in a bigger sample size."We recommend that future studies be done in Black, Asian and Hispanic patients, as well, to see if there are any differences in vaccination immune response," Dr Ruben Mesa, MD, FACP, executive director of the Mays Cancer Center said.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-immune-response-to-covid-19-vaccines-in-small-group-of-cancer-patients-study-101625318473927.html

In Texas, she set aside an hour to Zoom into a book club meeting back in Virginia with women at the community college where she teaches English.Jill Biden’s pace of travel is on par with the president's.The week before her stops in Texas and Arizona, she pushed vaccinations in Mississippi and Tennessee, and again days later in the Florida cities of Kissimmee and Tampa.Her stop at the Astros game was designed to help showcase a vaccination push by Major League Baseball that features incentives like tickets to future games and a replica World Series ring.“It’s safe. It’s effective. It’s free,” she declared of the Covid-19 vaccines.Jill Biden is spending most of the Fourth of July weekend appearing in Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania at events celebrating progress on fighting the coronavirus.“I think that we knew right from the start that she was going to be a more active first lady,” said Myra Gutin, who studies first ladies at Rider University in New Jersey. “She just personally strikes me as somebody that wants to be busy and somebody that wants to help.”Laura Bush, a former elementary school teacher and librarian, spent her initial months as first lady planning an education summit she hosted at Georgetown University in July 2001 and on supporting the No Child Left Behind education law, the first major domestic policy initiative of the new administration.Michelle Obama used her opening months to visit Cabinet departments and thank federal workers for their service. Melania Trump lived at Trump Tower in Manhattan until son Barron finished the school year and they joined President Donald Trump at the White House in June 2017.Anita McBride, a first lady scholar at American University, said Jill Biden came to the role well-prepared after being in the public eye for most of her adult life. Joe Biden was already a U.S. senator when they got married, and he was in Congress for a total of 36 years, followed by eight years as vice president.Unlike Michelle Obama or Melania Trump, Jill Biden, 70, has no young children to command her attention. The first lady also likes to travel and stay busy.It isn’t lost on the president just how busy his wife of 44 years is these days. He even suggested the stepped-up pace of White House life had cut into their “romantic time.”“She’s been traveling all over the country. And doing major events for me … and for the country,” the president told Vogue magazine for a recent profile of his wife. “And so I’ll find that I’m working on a hell of an important speech and I’m distracted. And then I may not be working on one and I want to go and hang out with her, and she’s working on an important speech! Or grading papers.”“We have to figure out a way, and I mean this sincerely, to be able to steal time for one another,” he said.McBride, who was Laura Bush's chief of staff, said that while it's important for presidents to leave Washington and spend time among the people, they can catch criticism if they're seen as spending too much time traveling and not enough time taking care of the people's business.“It's a balance for presidents to do both and a huge asset when the first lady can help,” McBride said in an email.To that end, Jill Biden has become a top promoter of her husband's policies as well as her own issues and causes, ranging from child tax credits and a proposal for free community college to support for military families and finding a cure for cancer.By Sunday she will have taken 20 solo official plane or car trips outside of Washington, including a handful of overnighters on the West Coast and in the Southwest. The count does not include her local stops in Washington or her trips with the president, such as last week's stop in Surfside, where she laid a large bouquet of white irises on the curb of a makeshift memorial near the site of the collapsed condo building.Meanwhile, the president's trip to Michigan on Saturday will be his 21st aboard Air Force One for official business, including last month's trip to Europe. The count does not include Biden's weekends at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, or at the Camp David presidential retreat. It also does not include Biden's trip to Wilmington for a former staffer's wake, and a midweek getaway in June to his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, for the first lady's birthday.The first lady said she'll keep traveling around the country to encourage people, especially young people, to get vaccinated to help ward off Covid-19.In Texas and Arizona, the first lady tried to cut through misinformation about the vaccines, assuring people that the doses are safe, effective and had been thoroughly tested. She stressed that the jabs are free, that people can get free rides to clinics and that appointments aren't necessary. She also noted that the shot itself is so quick, it doesn't hurt, and that she was vaccinated even though she hates needles.At a clinic in an area of Phoenix where the vaccination rate is lagging, she made small talk with a girl as an alcohol pad was rubbed on her arm in preparation for the Covid-19 shot.Then the vaccinator pushed the needle into the girl's arm, and pulled it out.“It's over,” Biden exclaimed and applauded before she moved on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-s-pace-of-travels-reveals-many-missions-and-emotions-101625315013463.html

Dr Nagpaul further warned that the infections continue to rise “at an alarming rate” due to the Delta variant of Covid-19, which was first found in India last year.Also Read: Johnson rebuffs Covid concerns raised by Merkel due to large crowds at Euro 2020The measures, which the BMA believes should remain in effect even beyond the expected date of the lifting of Covid-19 curbs, include face masks in enclosed places such as public transport, shops and healthcare settings, as well as social distancing messaging for people to gather in well-ventilated places.“The sensible, cautious measures that we are proposing will be vital in maintaining not just the impact of rising case numbers on people’s individual health and the health services, but also in maintaining the wider damage to the economy and the society, caused by even further waves, new variants and lockdowns,” Dr Nagpaul further said.Also Read: Experts want countries to closely watch UK strategy of combating Delta variantOn the Delta variant he said it makes “no sense” to remove the restrictions in their entirety because cases are rising at an alarming rate due to a “rapid transmission” of the said variant. The rise in cases, he said, is also due to an increase in “people mixing with one another.”In a warning for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government, Dr Nagpaul said the ministers must not “simply disregard the most recent, damning numbers by rushing into meeting their July 19 deadline.” According to BMA’s data, weekly Covid-19 cases have risen 74% over the last seven days, while the number of new hospitalisations has increased 55% over the previous week.On Friday, Public Health England (PHE) released its weekly data on variants of concern (VoC). The data showed a further 50,824 Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant, a 46% rise from the previous week.According to Johns Hopkins University, the United Kingdom has thus far seen 4,871,811 cases of the coronavirus disease, of which 128,453 cases have resulted in patients’ deaths.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-doctor-urges-uk-govt-to-keep-in-place-covid-19-safety-measures-postlockdown-101625315057951.html

The US has vaccinated nearly half of its population, giving authorities the confidence to allow outdoor gatherings to celebrate the July 4 weekend.However, facemasks remain mandatory for all passengers, including those fully vaccinated against Covid-19, in transportation hubs as well as on many commercial and public transportation networks. The Transportation Security Administration said on Thursday that air travel to some vacation hotspots within the country is already exceeding pre-pandemic levels, thus putting more pressure on authorities to enforce the mask mandate. Apart from intra-US travel, Americans will be also looking to fly overseas as more countries are now opening up to boost tourism.Here’s the status of some of the coveted destinations for Americans:EuropeThe EU Digital Covid Certificate launched on July 1 has made travel easier for fully vaccinated individuals. Travellers with a recent negative PCR test or those who have recovered from Covid-19 will be able to avail the benefits of the “vaccine passport” that allows people to skip quarantine and move around the bloc more freely.Switzerland and Sweden have joined the list of countries opening their borders this week for travellers from the United States. Spain has even waived vaccination requirements for American tourists, which means unvaccinated travellers will be able to visit the European country without needing to quarantine.Also Read | US likely to miss July 4 Covid-19 vaccination targetAfricaMauritius has launched the first phase of the multiphase reopening plan under which vaccinated individuals will be able to enter the island from July 15. They have to stay at the accommodation of their choice for 14 days and will be able to move freely around the island upon completion of the semi-quarantine.Asia-PacificThe United States has been included in the list of countries from where travellers will be allowed for a quarantine-free trip in Thailand under the ‘Phuket Sandbox’ plan. But instead of quarantining in a hotel or government-approved facilities, the tourists will have to stay within the limits of the popular resort island of Phuket for 14 days in order to access the rest of Thailand.South AmericaGuided tours in Peru's famous Inca Trail, which terminates at Machu Picchu, will resume from July 15. The permits for the adventure tour have gone on sale for the first time since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic last year.

"I think there's the commercial motive there."During the 100th founding anniversary of the CCP, Xi threatened that any nation that gets in the way of China's priorities "will find their heads bashed bloody against a great wall of steel".According to Chang, the mainstream media didn't pick up on an "important message" that was sent to America through the communist leader's rhetoric."What they should have said was that Xi Jinping has territorial designs on other countries. So really what he was saying was that he's going to wage war on the region. And that was not pointed out," Chang said, adding that most American media outlets lack context when covering China and failed to pick up on a key element of the speech.On Thursday, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Chinese President is serious about his 'bashing heads bloody' remark and called on President Joe Biden's administration to strengthen its policies against Beijing.Pompeo urged the Biden administration to take the Chinese threat seriously and that the Chinese President sees America as 'weak'. "We've seen this now for six months with this administration: unprepared to respond to Chinese aggression," he said.Pompeo further remarked: "Xi is serious. He has confidence, he's aggressive. He thinks America is declining. He's wrong about that but it's going to take American leadership to prove him wrong."According to Fox News, China revelled in what it views as the bedrock of the nation's global success. However, they will without a doubt fail to mention that tens of millions of people have been killed at the hands of the CCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-experts-sound-alarm-over-soft-pedal-coverage-of-ccp-s-centenary-101625309109349.html

Yi insisted that a “wall of immunity” will also help deal with political discrimination and bring about a collective global response to the pandemic."The most urgent priority is to expedite the construction of the 'Great Wall of Immunity' to fend off the virus, surpass political discrimination and carry out international anti-pandemic cooperation." Yi said, reported Reuters."We should face the imminent challenges together," he added.China has been facing intense scrutiny from the international community for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is believed to be the epicentre of the virus, has been the subject of intense scrutiny and with President Biden renewing an investigation into the ‘Lab leak theory’ , China has been left to battle the virus at home and abroad.The US has been stringently questioning the lab’s safety and have levelled allegations against its scientists for engaging in a controversial gain of function research that manipulated viruses in a manner making them more dangerous.Chinese President Xi Jinping in a defiant speech from atop Tiananmen Gate during the centenary celebration of the founding of the ruling Communist Party cautioned that anyone who tries to bully China “will face broken heads and bloodshed,". China watchers have suggested that none other than the US is at the receiving end of Xi’s anger, for pushing issues of virus origin, and criticising the Communist Party’s technology policies, military expansion and human rights record.China, which has administered about 19.47 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine domestically, till July 1, as per the national health bureau records, has been busy with vaccine diplomacy, sending shipments of its home grown vaccine to Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Pakistan, South Africa, supplying more than 480 million vaccine doses to other nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-nations-to-construct-a-great-wall-against-covid19-101625310452333.html

Iran has reported more than 3.2 million Covid-19 cases and over 84,000 related deaths, according to official figures, overwhelming the health infrastructure of the Islamic republic."It is feared that we are on the way to a fifth wave throughout the country," Rouhani told a meeting of Iran's anti-virus taskforce.The Iranian health ministry has classified the capital and nine other cities in Tehran province as “red”, the highest category on the country’s coronavirus risk scale. The southern and southeastern provinces of Fars, Hormozgan, Kerman and Sistan-Baluchistan have also been classified as "red".The outgoing president warned the public to be careful as "the Delta variant has spread" in southern provinces. According to the health ministry, only 1.7 million people in Iran have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, leaving the country highly vulnerable to new coronavirus waves driven by more deadly and transmissible variants."God willing, the situation will improve in terms of vaccinations from next week," Rouhani said.Iran is administering two locally produced vaccines under emergency use authorization as the country’s vaccination procurement has been hit by the sanctions imposed by the United States. The US sanctions have made it difficult for Iran, which is struggling to import vaccines for its population, to transfer money to foreign firms.On Friday, World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the world is witnessing a very “dangerous period” as the Delta variant continues to evolve and mutate. The highly transmissible Delta variant, first detected in India, is rapidly spreading in many countries, and the WHO has warned about the scenes of hospitals overflowing with patients in countries with low vaccination coverage.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-iranian-cities-in-red-as-rouhani-fears-fifth-wave-linked-to-delta-variant-101625307382778.html

In a statement, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe said that “increased mixing, travel, gathering and easing of social restrictions” contributed to the rise in cases.He added that the upward trend of cases – which occurred after a 10-week decline in 53 member states of the WHO European region – is happening at a time when infections due to the Delta variant of coronavirus is fast spreading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-suggests-mix-and-match-of-covid-vaccines-for-better-immune-response-101625307202265.html

The WHO chief told a press briefing on Friday that the Delta variant, first identified in India, has been detected in at least 98 countries and is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many of them.“Compounded by more transmissible variants, like Delta, which is quickly becoming the dominant strain in many countries, we are in a very dangerous period of this pandemic,” Ghebreyesus said.Ghebreyesus said that terrible scenes of hospitals overflowing are again becoming the norm in countries with low vaccination coverage, adding that no country is “out of the woods yet”. Terming the Delta variant “dangerous”, the head of the UN health agency warned that the Delta variant is continuing to evolve and mutate. He also advised governments for constant evaluation and careful adjustment of the public health response.The WHO chief underlined that there are essentially two ways for countries to push back against new surges in Covid-19 cases. He stressed that public health and social measures like strong surveillance, strategic testing, early case detection, isolation and clinical care remain critical, adding that masking, physical distance, avoiding crowded places and keeping indoor areas well ventilated are required to keep the surge in check."And second, the world must equitably share protective gear, oxygen, tests, treatments and vaccines," said Ghebreyesus.He also urged Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna to share mRNA technology and know-how to help new manufacturing hubs accelerate the production of Covid-19 vaccines. He lamented that though some sharing of Covid-19 vaccines are happening, “it’s still only a trickle, which is being outpaced by variants.”“The sooner we start building more vaccine hubs and upping global vaccine capacity, the sooner we can diminish deadly surges," Ghebreyesus added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-in-very-dangerous-period-as-delta-variant-continues-to-mutate-warns-who-chief-101625304216229.html

Here’s how they were rescued||Two pilots of a Boeing 737-200 cargo plane were forced to make an emergency landing in the ocean near Honolulu in the early hours of Friday after reporting engine trouble, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said, according to media reports. The US Coast Guard (USCG) rescued both the pilots from a debris field after they made the emergency landing at around 1.30am local time. In a statement, the FAA said that the pilots reported an engine glitch soon after starting their 33-minute intra-transport journey from Honolulu to the regional Kahului Airport on the island of Maui.According to audio from Honolulu's Daniel K Inouye International Airport’s tower, one of the pilots complained of losing “number 1 engine” and that the plane had about “two hours’ worth of fuel,” CNBC reported. The pilot also said that there is a possibility of them losing the other engine as well because “it’s running very hot,” the CNBC report added. Moments later the air traffic controller alerted for low altitude, and the first pilot asked the former to “let the Coast Guard know,” the report further stated.The USCG stated that after receiving a report from the Honolulu Air Traffic Control regarding the Boeing 737 downing offshore, it sent a helicopter, a cutter, a rescue plane and a 45-foot boat to search for the two pilots. “Once on the scene, the Dolphin crew was able to rescue one of the people on board while the Honolulu Fire Department rescue boat recovered the other,” the USCG statement read.Both the pilots were in “good condition,” USCG spokesperson Lieutenant Commander Karin Evelyn said in an email, the New York Times reported. They were later sent to a hospital and are now in stable condition, the USCG said in a statement.Commander Evelyn said that the plane debris remains at the landing site and that the USCG will evaluate the pollution at first light, the New York Times reported.The Boeing 737-200 was built in 1975 and its size is just over 100 feet in length. The plane can be converted to accommodate up to 100 tourist passengers, as per Boeing’s description of the plane. Jet officials of the downed Boeing in question said that it was not a 737 Max plane, which has been banned globally following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, CNBC reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilots-land-boeing-737-in-ocean-near-honolulu-here-s-how-they-were-rescued-101625298306385.html

The flames resembled molten lava and were dubbed “eye of fire” on several social media platforms. Several Mexican journalists and publications shared videos on Twitter of the fire raging in the middle of the ocean as boats sprayed streams of water on it and the clips quickly racked up millions of views.A Reuters report noted that Pemex said it took more than five hours to completely extinguish the fire. A video of the incident showed the blaze having a circular shape, as it emerged a few distances from a Pemex oil platform.🚨 Sobre el incendio registrado en aguas del Golfo de México, en la Sonda de Campeche, a unos metros de la plataforma Ku-Charly (dentro del Activo Integral de Producción Ku Maloob Zaap)Tres barcos han apoyado para sofocar las llamas pic.twitter.com/thIOl8PLQoPemex officials familiar with the matter told Reuters that the fire began in the underwater pipeline which connects to a platform at the firm’s flagship ‘Ku Maloob Zaap’ oil development. This flagship is situated just up from the Gulf of Mexico’s southern rim.Pemex said no injuries were reported in the incident and that oil production from its flagship project remained unhindered following the gas leak that occurred around 5:15am local time. The flames were fully put out by 10:30am local time, Reuters reported. The company said it would probe the cause of the fire, the Reuters report added. Pemex further highlighted it has also shut the 12-inch-diameter pipeline’s valves.The company reportedly said that it used boats to pump water over the flames, although its workers said that nitrogen was also used, Reuters added, citing an incident report.This is not the first time that such an incident has happened at Pemex, which has a long record of industrial accidents at its facilities, Reuters reported.The head of Mexico’s oil safety regulator ASEA, Angel Carrizales, wrote on Twitter that the fire incident on the Gulf of Mexico “did not generate any spill.” However, he refrained from providing an explanation of what was burning on the water’s surface.The flagship project ‘Ku Maloob Zaap’ is Pemex’s biggest crude oil producer, with over 40 per cent of the firm’s nearly 1.7 million barrels of daily output coming from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-of-fire-on-gulf-of-mexico-after-gas-leak-in-underwater-pipeline-101625291884343.html
03-07-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada warns of ‘very rare risk’ of heart issues from mRNA vaccines||Canadian health authorities have issued a public advisory saying those taking mRNA Covid-19 vaccines should be warned of the “very rare risk” of heart inflammation caused by the shots.The advisory effectively concerns two mRNA vaccines – the ones rolled out by Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna – that have emergency-use authorisation in Canada.The National Advisory Council on Immunisation (NACI) recommended on Friday that “informed consent” for those receiving mRNA vaccines should “include a discussion about the very rare risk” of the two conditions - myocarditis or pericarditis - following vaccination.It stated that as a “precaution”, those who experience the two adverse reactions after receiving the first dose should “wait to get the second dose until more information is available”. The NACI continued to strongly recommend that mRNA vaccines be offered to those who are eligible to receive it.“We have been closely monitoring the evolving situation of rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis following mRNA vaccination among younger people. The NACI is encouraged to see that the clinical presentations appear mild, and resolve quickly. The benefits of the Covid-19 immunisation programme continue to outweigh the relatively small risk for all people including adolescents,” NACI chief Shelley Deeks said.Her views were echoed by Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, who said, “There have been a small number of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis reported in Canada after vaccination. Evidence is evolving, and Canadian and international investigations into an association between myocarditis or pericarditis and mRNA vaccines continue. I want to let Canadians know that the benefits of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh their potential risks.”According to data available from Health Canada till June 18, there were 65 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis detected in the country.

Ariana News cited civil society activists in Takhar as saying that the Taliban have also have set dowry regulations for girls. “They urged women in a statement to not leave without a relative (Moharam) and also urged men to have beards,” Merajuddin Sharifi, a civil society activist in Takhar, was quoted as saying by Ariana News. Sharifi also said the “Taliban insist on trials without evidence.”Also read | Afghanistan ripe hunting ground for Taliban as last US troops exit key airbaseThe Taliban have in the past imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule. They included barring girls from school and women from working outside their homes and prohibiting them from being in public without a male relative before they were ousted after the US-led invasion in 2001. Those who violated those rules often suffered humiliation and public beatings by the Taliban's religious police.The Taliban have intensified its offensive against civilians and government defence and security forces and have taken control of several districts across the country as foreign forces are withdrawing from the war-torn country. The group seized Tagab district in Kapisa province on Thursday, Ariana News reported citing people familiar with the developments.Also read | Engaging with the Taliban is necessaryResidents in areas captured by Taliban also have to pay more for food as their risen substantially, members of Takhar provincial council said, according to Ariana News. “People are facing problems there; services are nonexistent, clinics, and schools are closed,” Mohammad Azam Afzali, a member of the provincial council, told Ariana News.Takhar governor Abdullah Qarluq said that government buildings have been destroyed by the Taliban and services have been stopped in areas controlled by Taliban. “They (Taliban) looted everything, and no services exist,” Qarluq said.The Taliban, according to Ariana News, have rejected the claims and called them propaganda against the group.Also read | India alerts its nationals of 'serious threat of kidnapping' in AfghanistanIn May, top US intelligence analysts warned that the Taliban "would roll back much" of the progress made in Afghan women's rights if the Islamist extremists regain national power. "The Taliban remains broadly consistent in its restrictive approach to women's rights and would roll back much of the past two decades of progress if the group regains national power," US National Intelligence Council said.The council's "Sense of the Community Memorandum" also said that women's rights likely would be threatened after the US-led military coalition withdraws. "Progress (in women's rights) probably owes more to external pressure than domestic support, suggesting it would be at risk after coalition withdrawal, even without Taliban efforts to reverse it," the assessment said, according to Reuters.The situation in Afghanistan has been deteriorating for several weeks and fighting has surged since early May when the US military began its final withdrawal of troops. The Taliban have claimed that they have recently captured more than 100 of the over 400 districts across Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-issue-rules-in-captured-afghan-districts-for-women-men-101625289058314.html
03-07-2021||World||Japan: Mudslide sweeps away row of houses near Tokyo, at least 19 missing||Following incessant rainfall in Japan, a heavy mudslide swept away a row of houses in Atami near capital Tokyo, the Associated Press reported on Saturday morning, citing authorities familiar with the development. At least 19 people are missing following the landslide, the news agency quoted the Japanese authorities as saying.Atami, located in Japan's Shizouka Prefecture, is a town known for its hot springs -- the name "Atami" literally meaning "hot ocean". As such, the town at the northern end of the Izu Peninsula sits on the steep slopes of a partially submerged volcanic caldera on the edge of Sagami Bay.According to disaster management officials cited by the Associated Press, the mudslide in Shizuoka prefecture in central Japan occurred on Saturday morning. A "deluge of black water and debris" crashed into the residences in the town, Japanese media networks said.News media captured footage of the black mudslide sliding down the mountainside and crushing residences in its path, as helpless neighbors watched in horror, some recording on their phones.Rescue work is on, officials were quoted as saying, to retrieve the 19 people who are unaccounted for in the incident. "The safety of 19 people is unknown," news agency AFP quoted a Shizuoka prefecture official, who is in charge of disaster management, as saying.Heavy rainfall has been lashing across Japan since earlier this week, causing rivers in the central part of the country and in Tokyo to swell, increasing the risk of landslides.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-mudslide-sweeps-away-row-of-houses-near-tokyo-at-least-19-missing-101625288829563.html
03-07-2021||World||Thailand sees record single-day spike of over 6,200 new Covid-19 cases; concerns mount over ICUs, vaccine supply||Health authorities in Thailand reported over 6,200 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, setting a record for a third straight day, as concerns mounted over shortages of treatment facilities and vaccine supplies.Officials also reported 41 deaths, bringing the total to 2,181.Around 90% of Thailand's over 271,000 reported coronavirus cases and 95% of the deaths have been recorded during a surge that began in early April. There were 992 deaths in June, more than 15 times Thailand’s total for all of 2020.The number of patients in ICUs and on ventilators has risen nationwide over the past two weeks.The government’s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration said 39% of the new cases reported were in Bangkok, 25% in neighboring provinces and 36% in the other 71 provinces. Center deputy spokesperson Apisamai Srirangsan said Bangkok authorities must urgently set up isolation stations to separate infected people in their local communities and add beds for treatment of serious cases.Critics since the beginning of the year have charged that the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has failed to secure timely and adequate vaccine supplies, and efforts to obtain more have proceeded slowly.Experts at a Health Ministry briefing on Friday painted a grim picture of how to prioritize who gets vaccinated.Epidemiologist Kamnuan Ungchoosak said the arrival of the delta variant of the virus, believed to be more contagious, could push the number of deaths up to 1,400 in July and more in coming months.He said 80% of the deaths are among the elderly and people with chronic diseases, and if they are vaccinated it could significantly reduce the death rate while also lowering the demand for ICU beds. Around 10% of elderly and infirm patients die, while the rate for those age 20-40 is less than 0.1%, he said.But at the same time, significant outbreaks are occurring among other groups, including people in construction worker camps and restaurant workers, who also need to be vaccinated, he said.“We currently have closed the camps and businesses, but the number of cases is not declining and the economy is bad. But if we focus on old people and those who have chronic diseases, we might not have to shut down the businesses and the bed demands from these two groups will also decline,” Kamnuan said.Prayuth has targeted mid-October for opening up the country to vaccinated visitors from abroad without quarantines.Sopon Mekthon, chairman of the government’s subcommittee on Covid-19 vaccine management, said only 2 million of about 16 million old and infirm people have received vaccines.Nakorn Premsri, director of the National Vaccine Institute, said a Thai company, Siam BioScience, was supposed to provide the country with 10 million doses a month of the locally produced AstraZeneca vaccine, but that has been cut to 5-6 million doses. The company, owned by Thailand's king, reportedly has had production problems. It also has contracts to provide vaccines to other countries.He said Thailand is trying to negotiate with other producers to fill the gap. So far, Thailand has only used vaccines from AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac and Sinopharm, although the government says it has agreements to also buy from Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-sees-record-single-day-spike-of-over-6-200-new-covid-19-cases-101625275591679.html

This rise in deaths came as Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava news agency AFP on Friday that she signed an order which authorised the demolition of the portion of the building which is still standing.“We’re still evaluating all possible impacts and determining the best timeline to actually begin the demolition,” Cava said, adding the top priority is search and rescue and the building poses a threat to public health and safety.The number of people missing in the June 24 tragedy in South Florida fell from 145 to 126, after duplicate names were striked off and some residents, which were earlier reported missing, were found to be safe. Cava added the figures of missing are expected to keep changing as detectives are constantly reviewing the list and verifying reports.Officials, meanwhile, said detectives have been working round the clock to contact the relatives and acquaintances of the missing residents. However, not a single person has been rescued since the first hours after the condominium building collapsed.Miami-Dade assistant fire chief Raide Jadallah told AP on Friday that only a woman’s voice had been heard during the entire search. “Most of the victims have been deceased in their bedroom indicating they were asleep,” Jadallah said.Amid the possible arrival of Hurricane Elsa, which will bring strong winds to Florida, Jadallah said the rescue operations might be suspended. “We will try to go as long as we can, but you can see from different periods of inclement weather we’ve had, we have stopped,” he said. According to the National Weather Service, the storm could approach Florida as early as Monday.Meanwhile, authorities started evacuating residents of nearby condominium building on Friday in the wake of the June 24 mishap. The city of North Miami Beach said in an official statement the 156-unit Crestview Towers had been deemed structurally and electrically unsafe months ago.“In an abundance of caution, the City ordered the building closed immediately and the residents evacuated for their protection, while a full structural assessment is conducted and next steps are determined,” city manager Arthur H Sorey III said in the statement.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-condo-collapse-toll-rises-to-22-nearby-building-evacuated-101625275753720.html
03-07-2021||World||Lightning strikes in Western Canada increase tenfold, may fuel forest fires||Lightning strikes in Western Canada over the past two days soared nearly tenfold from the same time a year ago, triggered in part by a record-breaking heatwave, meteorologists said, warning of more strikes over the weekend that could further stoke forest fires fanned by high winds.Over 710,000 lightning strikes were recorded in British Columbia and western Alberta between 3 p.m. on Wednesday and 6 a.m. on Thursday, up from an average of 8,300 from the same period over the past five years, said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist with Vaisala, a global environmental measurements company which collects the data.The Pacific province of British Columbia has been recovering from the grip of an unprecedented heatwave, which has so far caused 719 confirmed deaths, triple what would normally occur in the same time period, the province's chief coroner said on Friday.During the heatwave, the town of Lytton broke Canada's 80-plus-year-old heat record with a 49.6°C (121.28°F) temperature. A forest fire that started on Wednesday razed Lytton to the ground, and caused two deaths. The cause of the fire was under investigation.British Columbia usually accounts for about 5% of Canada's total lighting strikes each year, but it has reported its annual number in less than 48 hours, Vagasky said.The figure is comparable to "what you would typically see on some of the bigger lightning days in really lightning-prone regions of the United States, like Texas or Oklahoma," Vagasky said and is unheard of for a region like British Columbia.The high number of lightning strikes was caused in part by the heatwave, which created high levels of moisture in the atmosphere in the form of melting snow and evaporation of water from vegetation, said Jonathan Bau, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.The moisture fueled the unusually fierce thunderstorms."We're not in the middle of summer where everything's dried out," Bau said, adding that more lightning was forecast for the weekend.The strikes caused several forest fires across central British Columbia, with 136 fires burning as of Friday afternoon, B.C. officials said at a briefing.The fires are expected to burn through 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) by the end of the weekend, officials said, a significantly higher figure than by this point in previous years - B.C. does not usually see its forest fire season ramp up until late July.Over 1,300 homes have been ordered evacuated, and it is not known how many people are missing. The Red Cross is running a phone line for family reunification, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lightning-strikes-in-western-canada-increase-tenfold-may-fuel-forest-fires-101625274179561.html

03-07-2021||World||Firefighters make progress in efforts against California forest fires||Firefighters were making progress Friday against Northern California forest fires that burned several homes and forced thousands to flee communities even as authorities prepared for a hot, crowded Fourth of July weekend that could bring the threat of new blazes.Three wildfires near the towering Mount Shasta volcano an hour's drive from the Oregon border have burned around 60 square miles (155 square kilometers) of land.Damage was reported at the Salt Fire, which broke out Wednesday near Interstate 5 and prompted evacuations for some roads in Lakehead, an unincorporated community of around 700 people north of the city of Redding.A reporter for the Redding Record Searchlight saw at least a dozen buildings destroyed south of Lakehead, including homes, garages and outbuildings, the paper reported.Alexis Hohimer and her son, Michael, ended up at a Red Cross shelter in the city of Shasta Lake after authorities ordered their trailer park to evacuate early Thursday.“So all we can do is hope and pray right now. Keep our fingers crossed,” she said.The Salt Fire was slightly larger early Friday, covering nearly 8 square miles (21 square kilometers), and was 5% contained, said Adrienne Freeman, a spokeswoman for Shasta-Trinity National Forest. She said official damage assessments will be made by local authorities.No building damage was reported from two other northern fires, which erupted as California and the rest of the U.S. West is enduring a historic drought tied to climate change.“Fuel conditions this year are looking a lot more like late August than early July,” Freeman said.To the north, the Lava Fire burning partly on the flanks of Mount Shasta covered more than 37 square miles (96 square kilometers) but was 27% contained. Several thousand residents of Lake Shastina were allowed to return home late Thursday.Firefighters were doing mop-up on the western side of the fire and making good progress on the most active eastern portion, fire official Pat Bell said in a morning briefing.To the northeast, the Tennant Fire in the Klamath National Forest grew slightly to more than 15 square miles (40 square kilometers) but progress was also reported there. Mop-up began on the western flank while the east side remained active. Evacuation orders and warnings continued in nearby areas.The blazes erupted during an extreme heat wave in the U.S. West. The heat has since moderated but temperatures in the Mount Shasta area were still expected to reach nearly 100 degrees (38 Celsius) over the weekend.Arizona, New Mexico and Utah have been forced to battle wildfires and California is bracing for what some experts fear will be one of its worst fire seasons yet.Last year, California wildfires scorched more than 6,562 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of land, the most in its recorded history. And just three years ago, a fire in Butte County in Northern California killed 85 people and largely destroyed the town of Paradise.This year, many of California's national parks have restrictions on campfires, cooking and smoking because of fire risks in the hot, dry summer. The parks are bracing for large crowds over the holiday weekend.Fire authorities throughout California also have stepped up campaigns urging people not to use fireworks to celebrate the Fourth of July, citing both the explosive dangers and the threat of wildfires in the withering conditions.“The fuels are bone dry,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. “We are extremely concerned about the use of fireworks of all kinds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firefighters-make-progress-in-efforts-against-california-forest-fires-101625256687281.html

03-07-2021||World||White House says complete US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan by end of August||The United States expects to finish withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by the end of August, officials said Friday, after announcing all American and NATO soldiers had left the conflict-scarred nation's biggest air base.Following 20 years of war, US President Joe Biden had set a September 11 deadline for the final pullout of the few remaining soldiers on the ground.The news Friday that American troops had left Bagram Air Base fueled expectations that the pullout would be completed within days, but White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the troops would be out of the country "by the end of August.""The president has long felt... that the war in Afghanistan was not one that can be won militarily," she told reporters, adding that the United States would continue to provide security systems and humanitarian assistance in the months ahead.Bagram served as the linchpin for US-led operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al-Qaeda allies started in 2001 following the September 11 attacks."The American and coalition forces have completely withdrawn from the base and henceforth the Afghan army forces will protect it and use it to combat terrorism," defense ministry spokesman Fawad Aman tweeted.A US defense official confirmed their departure, while the Taliban said it welcomed the latest phase of the pullout."Their full withdrawal will pave the way for Afghans to decide about their future between themselves," spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.One Afghan official said some local thugs and drug addicts attempted to loot equipment at the base, but were stopped by Afghan troops."There will be no lootings as long as we are here... we will defend and protect our country," said Alifullah, an Afghan soldier guarding one of the base's gates.The US military and NATO are in the final stages of winding up involvement in Afghanistan, bringing home an unspecified number of remaining troops by Biden's deadline.The Taliban have launched relentless offensives across Afghanistan in the past two months, gobbling up dozens of districts as Afghan security forces have largely consolidated their power in the country's major urban areas.The ability of Afghan forces to maintain control of Bagram airfield will likely prove pivotal to maintaining security in Kabul and keeping pressure on the Taliban.The exit of foreign forces from Bagram base "symbolizes that Afghanistan is alone, abandoned, and left to defend itself against the Taliban's onslaught", said Australia-based Afghanistan expert Nishank Motwani."Having reached home, Americans and allied forces will now watch what they fought so hard to build over 20 years burn down from afar and knowing that the Afghan men and women they fought with risk losing everything."'A lot of insecurity'At the White House Friday Biden responded to concerns that the internationally backed Afghan government might quickly crumble to Taliban insurgents once its foreign backers leave, saying they "have the capacity to be able to sustain government down the road."The US military is keeping an "over the horizon capacity" which could bring firepower to help the government, but the "Afghans are going to have to be able to do it themselves."Media reports say the Pentagon will probably retain about 600 US troops in Afghanistan to guard the vast US diplomatic compound in Kabul.Residents of Bagram said security will only deteriorate with the exit of foreign forces."The situation is already chaotic... there is a lot of insecurity and the government does not have (enough) weapons and equipment," Matiullah, who owns a footwear shop in Bagram bazaar, told AFP."Since they started the withdrawal, the situation has got worse. There is no work... there is no business," said Fazal Karim, a bicycle mechanic.Over the years the mini-city has been visited by hundreds of thousands of US and NATO service members and contractors.At one point it boasted swimming pools, cinemas and spas -- and even a boardwalk featuring fast-food outlets such as Burger King and Pizza Hut.The base also housed a prison that held thousands of Taliban and jihadist inmates.Bagram was built by the United States for its Afghan ally during the Cold War in the 1950s as a bulwark against the Soviet Union in the north.Ironically, it became the staging point for the Soviet invasion of the country in 1979, and the Red Army expanded it significantly during its near-decade-long occupation.When Moscow pulled out, Bagram became central to the raging civil war of the 1990s -- it was reported that at one point the Taliban controlled one end of the two-mile (three-kilometer) runway and the opposition Northern Alliance the other.As of May 2021, there were about 9,500 foreign troops in Afghanistan, of which US troops made up the largest contingent of 2,500.So far Germany and Italy have both confirmed the full withdrawal of their contingents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-complete-us-troops-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-by-end-of-august-101625250681719.html
03-07-2021||World||Unfavourable views regarding China on the rise across developed economies, Pew study shows||A study conducted by the Pew Research Center revealed that several developed countries showed a negative attitude towards China due to its treatment of minorities, the Chinese government's restrictions on freedoms and rights of its own people as well as Xi Jinping’s handling of international affairs.The research was conducted by taking the opinions of 18,850 people from the people of Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.Xi Jinping warns foreign foes not to mess with ChinaUnfavourable views of China increased in several of these economically developed countries, according to the study. In Japan, Sweden, Australia, South Korea and the United States unfavourable views of China are currently at near historical highs, the study showed. Countries like Australia, Sweden, the UK and Canada saw an increase in negative attitudes towards China due to the bilateral tensions in 2020.Every four in 10 respondents from the US and Canada held a highly negative view of China. In the US and Canada, 76% and 73% of the respondents had an unfavourable view of China. Among European countries, at least 70% of the respondents from Sweden, Netherlands, Germany and more than 60% of the respondents from Belgium, France, the UK and Italy harboured adverse opinions toward China.Date yet to be fixed for next India-China military commanders’ meetingChina failed to impress in its own neighbourhood as more than 75% respondents from Japan, Australia and South Korea said they have an unfavourable view of China. Notably, 80% of the respondents from Japan harboured unfavourable views on China. At least roughly nine-in-ten surveyed see China negatively in Japan while two-thirds or more respondents in Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand hold similar views.Exceptions were seen in Singapore, where 64% of respondents see China favourably and while in Greece 52% of respondents have a favourable opinion towards China.Personal freedom of Chinese citizensMajority of these respondents believe that China does not respect the personal freedom of its own citizens. Barring Singapore, a large number of respondents feel that China does not respect the personal freedoms of its people. At least nine out of 10 respondents from Sweden, South Korea, Australia, the Netherlands, the US and Japan said that China does not respect the personal freedoms of its people. Singapore remains an outlier here as well but even then 60% of the respondents feel China does not respect the personal freedoms.100 years on, how the communist party dominates ChinaEconomic ties with ChinaPost Covid-19 pandemic, as perceptions against China turned towards the negative, nations could not ignore China’s hold over the global economy. Respondent from Canada, European nations and surveyed countries from the Asia Pacific region said that they would prefer to hold closer economic ties with the US than with China. However, a few respondents from Germany, France and New Zealand feel that ties with both nations are equally important.Xi Jinping’s handling of international affairsAt least 80% of respondents in the US and 78% of the respondents in Canada have little or no confidence in Chinese president Xi Jinping’s handling of global affairs. Eight in 10 residents have expressed concern over Xi’s way of working. European respondents also shared a similar response with at least seven in 10 adults expressing lack of confidence in Xi Jinping. The point worth observing was that the number rose following the Covid-19 pandemic.In the Asia Pacific, Japan, South Korea and Australia all the respondents displayed lack of confidence in Xi’s way of working. Japanese respondents share strongest distrust for Xi Jinping as 80% of the respondents view his handling of international affairs negatively. At least two-thirds or more feel the same in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan.A century later, the Chinese Communist Party is at the crossroadsThe highly negative views regarding the Chinese government comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, its continuous efforts to alter the status quo in eastern Ladakh and the South China Sea and also over suspicions that China tried to meddle with the investigation into the origins of Covid-19.Unfavourable view of China have been fuelled by its worsening bilateral relations with Japan over South China sea and its trade beef with Australia but US’ raising concerns over its treatment of minorities have also led to downgrading of how developed economies view the Asian economic powerhouse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unfavourable-views-regarding-china-on-the-rise-across-world-pew-study-shows-101625248609979.html

And when he goes, Branson would become the first billionaire to do so, as fellow billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has his trip planned only nine days later on July 20.“I’ve always been a dreamer. My mum taught me to never give up and to reach for the stars. On July 11, it’s time to turn that dream into a reality aboard the next @VirginGalactic spaceflight,” Branson announced in a tweet.I’ve always been a dreamer.

Because space belongs to us all,” he further said in his statement.Also read | Thousands sign petition to stop Jeff Bezos from returning to Earth after space tripSpace raceBranson and Bezos are both popular for their interest in space and commercial flights. However, Bezos was the first to announce his trip back in last month.On June 7, 2021, Blue Origin, the company founded by Bezos, announced that Bezos along with his brother Mark would join the winner of the auction for New Shepard’s first human flight on July 20, 2021. He would also be joined by Wally Funk, 82 years old and one of the 13 women who passed Nasa’s astronaut training program in the 1960s.Notably, Branson has himself said that he was not interested in “racing” to space.

After two doses, the neutralising antibodies could not be detected in 16.1% of the samples, the study found. Additionally, the researchers found that a prior infection along with vaccination produced much higher titres of neutralising antibodies. “Not observed is not equivalent to not present. The levels of neutralising antibodies could be significantly low that it did not get detected, but it may still be there and protect the person against infection and severe disease. Also, there would be some cell mediated protective immunity as well that can again protect against infection and severe disease. And, we have seen that even delta is not fatal after two doses of the vaccine,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of microbiology at Christian Medical College-Vellore. The titres of the neutralising antibodies – that specifically target the Sars-CoV-2 virus and kill it or prevent it from entering human cells – were also lower against the delta variant as compared to the B1 variant that led to the first wave of infections in India. As compared to B1, the neutralising antibody titres against the delta variant were 78% less in those who received one shot, 69% in those who received two shots, 66% in those who had the infection and received one shot, and 38% in those who had the infection and received both shots. “This reduction in NAb titres in the sera of participants lends support to increased susceptibility of the population that has been immunised with even both doses of the vaccine with the delta variant,” the study said. The researchers also stated that neutralising antibody titres were significantly higher in those who had the infection prior to vaccination. “(This) highlights the fact that even one dose of vaccine in convalescent (or recovered) patients is enough to provide effective protection against reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 or protection against newly emerging variants,” the study said. What the study means for India’s vaccination drive is that some might require an additional booster shot of Covishield while those who have had the infection may require just one. “Assuming that the serum used for the study was from healthy individuals, the proportion of individuals with unobserved levels of neutralising antibodies will be higher among those who are old, comorbid, have chronic diseases as their immune response is lower. What this means is that men (women produce higher levels of antibodies) over the age of 65 years, those with diabetes, hypertension, chronic heart, lung, kidney diseases, those who have had organ transplant, or are undergoing treatment for cancer should be given a third dose,” said Dr Jacob John. He added, “On the other hand, one dose is more than enough for an immune response in those who have had the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-antibodies-against-delta-variant-in-58-after-first-dose-of-covishield-16-after-second-research-101625336937991.html

Assembly elections in the state are to be held in early 2022.The state unit of the BJP elected Dhami as the legislative party leader, paving the way for his official appointment as chief minister at the swearing-in ceremony in Dehradun on Sunday at 6pm.“My party has appointed a common worker, the son of an ex-serviceman, who was born in the border district of Pithoragarh to serve the people,” Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who attended the meeting in the town as a central observer, told reporters.Tomar added that former CM Tirath Singh Rawat and state BJP chief Madan Kaushik proposed the name of Dhami, and other senior leaders — including ex-chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat — backed the move.“We’ll work on people’s issues with the cooperation of all. I will carry forward the work done by my predecessors,” Dhami told reporters shortly after the meeting at the party headquarters. The CM-designate later visited governor Baby Rani Maurya’s residence to stake claim to the government.The 45-year-old, set to be the state’s 10th chief minister, is also the youngest leader to be appointed to the position in Uttarakhand. It wasn’t known until now that Dhami — who has never held a ministerial position before this, but has links with the RSS and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad — was being considered for the role.Outgoing chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, whose short termwas marred by controversies that included allowing the Mahakumbh to convene with mammoth gatherings despite a raging pandemic, and a Covid-19 testing scam, congratulated Dhami and appeared to present a unified front . “All the 56 members of legislature party elected him unanimously. We are sure that Uttarakhand will attain new heights of development in the coming period under his leadership,” he said.Tirath Singh Rawat resigned as the CM on Friday night, days after the BJP leadership summoned him to Delhi, where he met Union home minister Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda.He suggested he resigned on Friday because the Election Commission (EC) was unlikely to hold by-elections — which were necessary for him to continue in the post — due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rawat was a member of Parliament when he was named the chief minister. He needed to be elected to the state assembly within six months of assuming the post to continue as the CM.Although it is atypical for EC to hold bypolls to an assembly whose remaining tenure is less year, an official of the body indicated to HT on Friday that no request was made by the party.The BJP has 56 lawmakers in the 70-member house. In March this year, Tirath Singh Rawat was appointed as the ninth chief minister of the state after his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned due to infighting in the state unit.Political analysts say the change of guard this year and the controversies over the state government’s handling of the pandemic during the second wave of infections is likely to hit the BJP’s chances of returning to power in the state next year. “By stirring this political episode just a few months before the election, BJP has made the road to victory difficult for itself. The people of Uttarakhand will now think that the BJP is taking them as its laboratory for its political experiments. Secondly, the morale of its workers would also take a dent after this,” said MM Semwal, professor of political science at Garhwal Central University.On Saturday, the Opposition Congress also hit out at the BJP for what it termed was “political instability” and “lust for power”. “Instead of serving the people of Uttarakhand, they tried to distribute power, and PM (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi and JP Nadda are responsible for this,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged.Dhami, however, adopted a defiant tone on concerns over the BJP’s electoral performance, and said that he was ready to take the “challenge” and turn it into an “opportunity”.State leaders said on Saturday that several factors worked in favour of Dhami, who was a relatively lesser known figure than some of the other BJP legislators. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj and education minister Dhan Singh Rawat were tipped to be elevated to the key position.“Dhami ticked several boxes. He is a member of the Thakur community, which helped as state party president Madan Kaushik is a Brahmin, the BJP couldn’t appoint two members of the same community,” an Uttarakhand minister said on the condition of anonymity.It also helped that Dhami has his roots in Kumaon, and will be seen as a representative of the people from the region as Kaushik is from Garhwal, the minister added.Another party MLA said Dhami is believed to be close to Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and former Uttarakhand chief minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is currently the Maharashtra governor. However, state Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni believes that the BJP has only chosen Dhami instead of a big name to keep a “scapegoat” ready as the ruling party knows it is “going to lose”. BJP leaders disagree. “Dhami is a young leader with a significant support base among the youth,” said Ajay Bhatt, a BJP MP from Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhami-to-take-oath-as-new-uttarakhand-cm-today-101625336398571.html
03-07-2021||India||Who are 'highly protected' against Delta variant of Covid? ICMR study reveals||Those who have recovered from Covid and have got either one or two doses of Covid-19 vaccine have the maximum protection against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 Vitus, an Indian study conducted by the scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research, National Institute of Virology, Department of Neurosurgery, Command Hospital (Southern Command), Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, has revealed. The study was only on the impact of Covishield.In the study, the immune response of 5 categories of people was evaluated-1. One dose vaccinated2. Two-dose vaccinated3. Covid recovered plus one dose vaccinated4. Covid recovered plus two doses vaccinated.5. Breakthrough cases, which mean infection after one or two doses of vaccination.The findings suggest that breakthrough cases and the cases where Covid-19 recovered individuals received one of two doses of vaccine have relatively higher protection against Delta variant in comparison with those who have never been infected but got either one or two doses of the vaccine."Prior vaccination results in less severe disease against subsequent infection provide evidence that both humoral and cellular immune response play an important role in protection," the study said. The study also mentions Delta Plus (AY.1), the new variant of Delta, which has been reported from India and many other countries.Explaining how variants might impact the efficacy of vaccines, the study said, "The worldwide endeavour of scientists to create a safe and effective COVID19 vaccine has resulted in the availability of 18 vaccines, which have received Emergency Use Authorization. The vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2, have shown efficacy ranging from 51 % to 94% against the original strain D614G in phase 3 clinical trials. Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection involves innate immune activation and antigen-specific responses of B and T cells. Particularly, the questions about the immune escape of, newly emerging VOCs in vaccinated individuals are still being explored. For example, the efficacy of AZD1222, which was reported to be 70% in the UK and Brazil, only reached 22% in South Africa."Those who have once been infected are supposed to develop natural antibodies, for which the government has suggested that they should delay their vaccination. But the study reveals that the natural protection can be augmented by even one dose of vaccine against the Delta variant."Long-term follow-up of participants could help understand the impact of natural infection and vaccination on long-term protection from SARS-CoV-2 offered by Covishield. It is important to track the breakthrough infections to look for unexpected changes. Monitoring of breakthrough infection would make us understand the impact of new variant or VOC on the escape of vaccine-induced immunity. Data has shown again and again that if the individuals get infected post-vaccination, had been protected from severe disease," the study said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-are-highly-protected-against-delta-variant-icmr-study-reveals-101625331724894.html

All you need to know||As India's vaccination drive against Covid is going on at full throttle, private hospitals too are now vaccinating people. The government has imposed a price cap as well as a dose cap for private hospitals, which has come into effect from July 1. Private hospitals have a quota of 25 per cent vaccine of the total vaccines produced by the manufacturers after the Centre procures the 75% of it.Several cases of fake vaccination have been reported in the recent past from Mumbai and Kolkata. Here is a checklist if you are getting vaccinated at a private hospital.1. Prior registration on Co-Win is not mandatory for private hospitals as the government has allowed private hospitals to accept on-spot registration.2. But registration on Co-Win is mandatory before the administration of the vaccine.3. For vaccination availability in any nearby private hospital, one can check the Co-Win site as private hospitals have to register on Co-Win.4. Beneficiaries will receive a message soon after the administration of the 1st dose. The fake vaccine cases were detected as the beneficiaries did not receive any SMS.5. Private hospitals can't charge more than ₹780 for one dose of Covishield, ₹1,145 for one dose of Sputnik V and ₹1,410 for one dose of Covaxin.6. If you are getting vaccinated at housing societies where the vaccine is to be supplied from a private hospital, check if the private hospital is registered on Co-Win.7. To verify the vaccine certificate, go to verify.cowin.gov.in and scan the QR code of the vaccination certificate on this site. If the certificate is not genuine, a 'certificate invalid' message will be displayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/getting-vaccinated-against-covid-19-at-a-private-hospital-all-you-need-to-know-101625330836373.html

03-07-2021||India||Covid 3rd wave might be a ‘ripple’: IIT scientists project 3 scenarios||As India and 96 other countries are currently dealing with the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus (Covid-19), and a possible advent of a third wave, a recent study by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has projected that the wave will be a “ripple” only if there is no significantly rapidly spreading mutant, news agency ANI reported.According to the ‘Sutra’ model for Covid-19, put together by a team of scientists from the IIT-Kanpur, if a faster-spreading mutant of the SARs-CoV-2 is present, then the magnitude of the probable third wave will be “comparable to the first one.”Maninder Agarwal, professor of IIT Kanpur, who is part of the ‘Sutra’ team, said that they have put forward three scenarios pertaining to the third wave of Covid-19, according to the ANI report.Agarwal told ANI that the team has projected an “optimistic” scenario where people’s lives presumably go “back to normal by August,” without the presence of any further mutant of the virus. The second scenario is the intermediate one where it is assumed that Covid-19 vaccination is “20 per cent less effective in addition to optimistic scenarios.” The third scenario is the pessimistic one, he told ANI, where a new 25 per cent more infectious mutant spreads in August.The ‘Sutra’ analysis put forth that if there is a presence of an immunity escape mutant, all the three scenarios will be nullified.“First, loss of immunity in the recovered population, second vaccination-induced immunity. Each of these two needs to be estimated for the future. And third, how to incorporate the two in the model,” ANI quoted Agarwal as saying while explaining the immunity escape mutant.The study projections come amid the World Health Organisation (WHO) warning on Friday that the world is witnessing a very “dangerous period” owing to the rapidly-spreading Delta variant of coronavirus. Talking to the media at a press briefing, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the Delta variant – first identified in India, is now present in at least 98 nations and is fast becoming the dominant strain in many of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-3rd-wave-might-be-a-ripple-iit-scientists-project-3-scenarios-101625322822664.html

Bharat Biotech, its manufacturer, has announced its phase 3 clinical trials, which is yet to be peer-reviewed.“Efficacy analysis demonstrates Covaxin to be 77.8% effective against symptomatic Covid-19, through evaluation of 130 confirmed cases, with 24 observed in the vaccine group versus 106 in the placebo group. Efficacy analysis demonstrates Covaxin to be 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19,” the manufacturer said in a paper published in open access journal medRxiv.The Phase 3 trials were carried out in 130 symptomatic Covid-19 cases, in 25 sites across the country. Based on the results collected at least two weeks after the administration of the second dose, Bharat Biotech concluded that its jab is offering 63.6% protection against asymptomatic disease, and 65.2% protection against the Sars-Cov-2, B.1.617.2 Delta variant.The NTAGI chairman also said Covaxin’s approval from WHO will bring visibility to India since it is indigenously developed. Covaxin was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), from an isolated viral strain provided by the National Institute of Virology (NIV).Suchitra Ella, joint managing director of Bharat Biotech, tweeted on June 30 that the company is working closely with WHO for emergency listing."We are working closely with the World Health Organisation for inclusion of Covaxin in its Emergency Use Listing. Approval from WHO is not expected to be a long drawn process as the cell line and majority of our facilities have already been audited and approved by WHO for our other vaccines in the past," Ella tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxins-efficacy-result-will-help-in-getting-who-s-approval-says-govt-expert-body-chief-101625319210458.html
03-07-2021||India||BMC to demolish part of Amitabh Bachchan's bungalow Prateeksha: Report||A few years ago, Amitabh Bachchan and seven others, including Rajkumar Hirani, Oberoi Realty, Pankaj Balaji, Sanjay Vyas, Haresh Khandelwal and Haresh Jagtani, were served notice by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for "illegal construction". The issue has now been raked up by Congress councillor advocate Tulip Brian Miranda who has accused the civic body of dragging its feet in taking action against the Bachchan property. The councillor said no appeal is required after service notice for a road-widening project. But the BMC did not take any action.Now, the civic body has started following up on its 2017 notice and will soon demolish a part of Prateeksha, the first bungalow of the Bachchans in Mumbai, news agency ANI reported. The Bachchans have another bungalow in the city named 'Jalsa'.Mumbai’s drinking water stock can last for 65 days: BMC"BMC gave notice to Amitabh Bachchan in 2017 under road widening policy but no action was taken. When the notice is issued, why was that land not taken by BMC? No appeal required for road widening project after notice served," the councillor told news agency ANI.According to reports, Bachchan and others were issued Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices in 2016-2017 as they apparently made changes in the main map."Had it belonged to a common person, the BMC would have taken it immediately. Then why was the land not taken under Section 299 of the Municipal Act notice that says you don't have to wait for a second notice of appeal?" Tulip said.The report said that the civic body has instructed Mumbai suburban collector city survey official to demarcate the exact portion of the bungalow required for the widening of the Sant Dnyaneshwar Marg road, which connects the Chandan Cinema area to Link Roar towards Iskcon temple.The road widening project is crucial to ease traffic congestion in the area, but the work is stuck because of Prateeksha, the councillor alleged. "I wrote to the BMC in Feb 2021. I did not receive a reply so I had a telephonic conversation with the ward officer and wrote to the commissioner but still did not receive a reply. This is a very necessary project because there are two schools, a hospital, an ISKCON temple, and monuments in Mumbai are around. The road winding project has been suddenly stopped just because of Amitabh Bachchan's Bungalow," she added.The councillor mentioned that other plots required for the project were acquired by the civic body. The wall of the plot adjoining Bachchan's bungalow was taken and drainage was created, she said.In 2020 September, the civic body demolished part of actor Kangana Ranaut's office against which the Bombay high court later termed as 'wrongful'.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-to-demolish-part-of-amitabh-bachchan-s-juhu-bungalow-pratiksha-report-101625316026148.html

Google said it has removed 59,350 pieces of content and Instagram is believed to have taken action against about two million content pieces during the same period of time. This is a big step towards transparency, information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Twitter, while the microblogging platform has fallen out of favour with the government."Nice to see significant social media platforms like Google, Facebook and Instagram following the new IT Rules. First compliance report on voluntary removal of offensive posts published by them as per IT Rules is a big step towards transparency," the minister tweeted.Nice to see significant social media platforms like Google, Facebook and Instagram following the new IT Rules. First compliance report on voluntary removal of offensive posts published by them as per IT Rules is a big step towards transparency. pic.twitter.com/FhzUv4pHUpThis removal of content is not prodded by the government or any other constitutional authority. This falls under voluntary removal of offensive posts and the social media intermediaries with over 5 million users, under the new IT rules, are required to publish periodic compliance reports every month.Koo, the home-grown competition of San Francisco-headquartered Twitter, also submitted its report stating it has proactively moderated 54,235 content pieces, while 5,502 posts were reported by its users during June.The new IT rules have become a flashpoint in the ongoing tussle between the government and Twitter as Twitter is still working to comply with the rules beyond the deadline. On Saturday, it informed the Delhi high court that it is finalising the appointment of a new resident grievance office in India. Early in June, Twitter appointed Dharmedra Chatur in the post but he resigned later in the month following which the company appointed Jeremy Kessel. Since Jeremy is a US national, it violates the new IT rules.Apart from the issue of the IT rules, Twitter has recently come under fire for showing an incorrect map of India on the site and for blocking IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's Twitter account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ravi-shankar-prasad-praises-google-facebook-and-instagram-here-s-why-101625313070069.html

03-07-2021||India||NGT seeks inventory of Goa’s coastal structures to identify illegal construction||The National Green Tribunal has asked the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority to get an inventory of all structures falling within the Coastal Regulation Zone prepared based on an independent annual survey.Pulling up the GCZMA for “working only on the basis of complaints against illegal structures” the NGT has sought that the Goa authority set up “an effective monitoring mechanism to advance the rule of law”.“We may add that GCZMA appears to be working only on the basis of complaints against illegal structures and a large number of illegal structures continue to exist in spite of the directions of the High Court… It may be desirable to have an inventory prepared in respect of such structures based on an independent annual survey, to be updated periodically to avoid selective action against the violations of the CRZ,” the NGT bench led by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, said. “An effective monitoring mechanism needs to be set up by GCZMA to advance the rule of law,” the NGT bench added.Back in 2007, the Bombay high court at Goa took suo motu cognizance of the existence of a large number of structures within the CRZ zone that were said to be illegal and asked each village panchayat to submit action taken reports.However, several structures remain standing with no comprehensive list of violators and no action being taken and cases reaching the doors of the NGT only periodically.The GCZMA admitted that absence of a comprehensive list of illegal structures was making it difficult for the authority to act. Authority member secretary Dasharath Redkar said that the NGT’s directions will be placed before the full body and a decision will be taken.Environmental campaigner Judith Almeida said the NGT’s directions were a welcome move but it remained to be seen what action the GCZMA takes concerning the structures.“My experience has been that instead of trying to regulate the coast of illegal structures and protect the environment, the GCZMA has been trying to protect the encroaches instead. The body has been dragging its feet on acting against illegalities.

Congress has made this demand earlier as well.Surjewala described the development as “a scandalous expose of Rafale scam” that has led to “loss to public exchequer”. “The French have ordered an investigation into the Rafale deal for corruption and influence peddling. The sweetheart deal is now exposed. It calls for a thorough JPC probe. Will the PM (Prime Minister) answer to the nation and when will the government submit to a JPC probe?” he asked.Surjewala maintained that it is not a Congress versus Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issue, but a matter related to national security. Mediapart reported the “highly sensitive probe into the inter-governmental deal signed in 2016 was formally opened on June 14”. It said the development was confirmed by the Financial Crimes Branch of the French Public Prosecution Services on Friday.The French website carried a series of reports on alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal in April.In one of the reports, Mediapart claimed that the former head of the Financial Crimes Branch, Éliane Houlette, shelved an investigation into alleged evidence of corruption in the Rafale jet deal despite the objection of colleagues. It said Houlette justified her decision saying it was made to preserve “the interests of France, the workings of institutions.”“Now, her successor as head of the PNF, Jean-François Bohnert, has decided to support the opening of a probe, after the complaint was updated with details from Mediapart’s recent series of investigations,” Mediapart’s latest report said.The criminal investigation, Mediapart said, will “examine questions surrounding the actions” of former French president François Hollande, who was in office when the Rafale deal was inked, his successor, Emmanuel Macron, the then economy and finance minister, and foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who held the defence portfolio then.India ordered Rafale jets in September 2016 as an emergency purchase through a government-to-government deal. The deal became controversial. The Opposition, led by the Congress, has claimed the price at which India was buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.The government has not disclosed details of the price. It has said the deal struck by the UPA in 2012 was not a viable one, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison is moot. The UPA was unable to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to the pricing of items not included in the initial bid.There was no immediate response from the government or the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vindicated-says-congress-over-probe-into-rafale-deal-in-france-101625310177080.html

It's a dig at PM Modi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is ready with his witty jibe at the government after a French judge on Friday was tasked to lead a "highly sensitive" judicial investigation into Rafale fighter jet deal with India. A French investigative website Mediapart said the probe has been ordered to check the alleged "corruption and favouritism" in the ₹59,000 crore deal between France and India.Taking to Twitter, Gandhi shared the Hindi idiom "Chor ki daadhi mein tinka" which translates to a guilty conscience needs no accuser.चोर की दाढ़ी…#RafaleScamIn his previous digs, Gandhi used the term 'thief' to corner the prime minister. After he was pulled up the Supreme Court, the Congress leader said he will stand by his “Chowkidar Chor Hai” jibe as it is a reality and continue using the slogan against PM Modi. However, he apologised to the Supreme Court as he felt he had made a mistake.“There is a process is going on in the Supreme Court and I made a comment attributed to SC so I apologised. I did not apologise to the BJP or Modi ji. ‘Chowkidar Chor Hai’ will remain our slogan,” he said.The Wayanad MP's campaign theme in 2019 Lok Sabha elections focused on the alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal and he coined the “Chowkidar chor hai” slogan directed at PM Modi.The controversy around the acquisition of Rafale fighter jets by India is set to be sparked again with the probe ordered in France as Congress has termed the development a vindication to the charges levelled by Rahul Gandhi.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala urged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come forward and order a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the Rafale deal."Corruption in the Rafale deal has come out clearly now. The stand of the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi has been vindicated today after the French government has ordered a probe," he said addressing the reporters.The Congress has demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the Rafale deal, saying it is the only way forward to find the truth about "corruption" in the purchase of the fighter jets.The Congress' demand came after French investigative website Mediapart reported that a French judge has been appointed to lead a "highly sensitive" judicial investigation into alleged "corruption and favouritism" in the ₹59,000 crore Rafale fighter jet deal with India.The French publication has said that the probe into the inter-governmental deal signed in 2016 was formally opened on June 14."A judicial probe into suspected corruption has been opened in France over the 7.8-billion-euro sale to India in 2016 of 36 Dassault-built Rafale fighter aircraft," the Mediapart reported.Mediapart journalist Yann Philippin, who filed a series of reports on the deal, said a first complaint was "buried" in 2019 by a former PNF chief.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had inked a ₹59,000-crore deal on September 23, 2016, to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-has-a-witty-take-on-rafale-deal-probe-it-s-a-dig-at-pm-modi-101625305522739.html
03-07-2021||India||Who is Pushkar Singh Dhami, Uttarakhand's 3rd chief minister in 4 months?||Pushkar Singh Dhami on Saturday has been chosen as the next chief minister of Uttarakhand by the state BJP legislative party a day after Tirath Singh Rawat resigned from the post. About 57 BJP MLAs of the state met at the party headquarters in Dehradun today to choose the next CM of the state, which is scheduled to go to the elections next year.Born in Pithoragarh in 1975, Dhami's association with the BJP has been long as he started with the RSS and found his way in the RSS, ABVP etc. Though he is the youngest CM of the state, his association with RSS and its organisations is almost of 33 years. According to reports, the 45-year-old MLA from the Khatima constituency of the Udham Singh Nagar district has never held a ministerial position in the state cabinet. The two-time MLA has a strong sway among the youth as he remained the president of the BJP youth wing in the state twice from 2002 to 2008. Pushkar Dhami is also believed to be close to Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the present governor of Maharashtra, who also served as the chief minister of Uttarakhand for a very short stint. Pushkar Singh Dhami served as the officer on special duty when Koshyari was the CM. Dhami is also reportedly close to defence minister Rajnath Singh.खटीमा, उधम सिंह नगर से माननीय विधायक,श्री @pushkardhami जी को उत्तराखंड के विधानमंडल का नेता निर्वाचित होने पर हार्दिक बधाई एवं शुभकामनाएं। pic.twitter.com/ycyOX1F8BmFormer chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat remained the CM with the shortest stint as he did not even get the chance to speak in the Uttarakhand Assembly.Uttarakhand's 3rd CM in 4 monthsTrivendra Singh Rawat resigned in March making way for Tirath Singh Rawat, the Lok Sabha MP from Pauri Garhwal, who resigned on Friday, thus making Pushkar Singh Dhami the 3rd CM in 4 months. While there were complaints against Trivendra Singh Rawat's style of functioning, the resignation of Tirath Singh Rawat came amid uncertainty over by-polls that he was supposed to win to continue in office.Uttarakhand CMs with short stintsThe BJP has the tradition of changing the face of the chief minister in the state every time in the election year.At the time of the formation of the state (2000), Nityanand Swami was made the Chief Minister, but as soon as just before the assembly elections in 2001, Bhagat Singh Koshyari was made the CM and the party lost the election.In 2007, Major General Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri was made the CM but after 2009's Lok Sabha election results, he was replaced by Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank. Before elections, Pokhriyal was again replaced by Khanduri and the BJP lost the election.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-pushkar-singh-dhami-uttarakhand-s-3rd-chief-minister-in-4-months-101625307497342.html

All of this has been badly affected due to power crisis in State. Ruling government is only engaged in factionalism, tussle and conflict. Public needs to take its cognizance," said Mayawati in a tweet.The BSP chief requested people to make sure they form the government with a full majority in Punjab."Therefore, for the better future of Punjab and the well-being of its people, lies in the fact that they get rid of the Congress government and I request to all, that in the upcoming assembly make sure Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BSP alliance form the government with full majority," she added.Amid the infighting with its Punjab unit, Congress has held several meetings over the past few weeks to resolve factionalism and other problems.Meanwhile, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal supported Mayawati's statement and said that the Congress leaders in Punjab are not concerned for the farmers and the common man."Bahenji Mayawati has rightly pointed out that Congress leaders in Punjab are only interested in fighting for the spoils of office and that concerns of people including paddy farmers and common man who are facing power cuts are of no concern to them," Badal said.Earlier on June 12, SAD and BSP formed an alliance to contest the upcoming Punjab Assembly elections together.

As published in The Conversation, Lara Herrero, research leader in virology and infectious diseases of the university, has said the data they have worked with were mostly from the United Kingdom and collected through a self-reporting system. Lara also mentioned that the study did not take into account which participant is infected with which variant but as the Delta variant is at present the predominant one in the UK, it's a "safe bet the symptoms we see here reflect the Delta variant," she wrote.What is the Delta variant?Delta variant, first reported in India in 2020, is an emerging variant of the Covid-19 virus which has now spread to close to 100 countries. It is believed to be stronger and more transmissible than the Alpa variant, first reported from the UK. Among the four variants reported so far -- Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Delta is believed to be more virulent.What are the changes in symptoms?Lara Herrero wrote a runny nose is a new symptom that might be caused by the Delta variant as it was rarely reported as a symptom in earlier data, while loss of smell that was quite common earlier ranks ninth now. According to her, the current top five symptoms of Covid-19 are:1. Headache2,. Sore throat3. Runny nose4. Fever5. Persistent cough.Why have the symptoms changed?The research highlighted several possible reasons behind this change, including that of the evolution of the virus. But she also takes into account that these mild symptoms are possibly reported by younger people as senior citizens in the United Kingdom are now mostly covered by vaccination."Humans are dynamic. With our differences come different immune systems. This means the same virus can produce different signs and symptoms in different ways. A sign is something that’s seen, such as a rash. A symptom is something that’s felt, like a sore throat...So when we talk about the signs and symptoms of a virus, we’re referring to what is most common. To ascertain this, we have to collect information from individual cases," the researcher said.Delta in IndiaThe second wave of the pandemic in India in April-May has been attributed largely to the Delta variant. About 174 districts in 35 states of the country have reported Delta variants. States have now reported a new variant of Delta which is Delta Plus.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-symptoms-may-differ-from-traditional-covid-symptoms-claims-study-101625303823128.html

"Neither was I part of the race earlier, nor today. The legislative party leader will be elected at the meeting today," Trivendra Singh Rawat, a former chief minister, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Tirath Singh Rawat stepped down late on Friday just four months after he was given the post by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The discontent was developing and things gathered pace in February. Earlier this year, 13 legislators wrote to the BJP’s central leadership against Trivendra Singh Rawat’s work style, accusing him of not listening to them.And, his successor Tirath Singh Rawat’s resignation ended a controversial stint that was supposed to help the party revive its popularity in the state. Tirath Singh Rawat drew flak for allowing the Mahakumbh as Covid-19 cases were on the rise and also because of large-scale fraud in testing during the mega fair.On Friday night, 57-year-old Rawat resigned citing that Election Commission (EC) was unlikely to hold by-elections due to Covid-19. But an EC official indicated that no request was made to hold a by-poll and suggested there were precedents that may have permitted it. A chief minister, if not a member of the assembly, needs to be elected within six months of assuming the post.

If the candidates successfully pass the test at these centres, they will be exempted from appearing for driving tests at RTOs at the time of getting a license.What are Accredited Driver Training Centres?> According to the transport ministry, the Accredited Driver Training Centres are equipped with simulators and a dedicated driving test track to provide high-quality training to candidates seeking a license.> Remedial and refresher courses, according to the requirement of the Motor Vehicles Act (MVA), 1988, can be availed at such centres.> Candidates successfully clearing tests at these centres will no longer be required to appear for a driving test at an RTO at the time of getting a license.What are the types of vehicles in which candidates will be trained?> As per the transport ministry’s notification, candidates will be trained in light motor vehicles (LMVs), medium and heavy motor vehicles (HMVs)> The duration for training in LMVs is 29 hours, which will be completed in a time span of a maximum of four weeks from the date of the start of the course.

A large number of road accidents occur due to lack of knowledge of road regulations,” it said in a subsequent tweet.India registers a very high number of accident deaths annually, which experts say are caused because of lack of knowledge of road regulations, underage driving (below 18) and blatant disregard of traffic and speeding rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heres-how-you-can-get-your-driving-license-without-a-test-at-rto-101625296506765.html

Rawat, 57, suggested he resigned because the Election Commission (EC) was unlikely to hold by-elections due to Covid-19. But an EC official indicated that no request was made to hold a by-poll and suggested there were precedents that may have permitted it. A chief minister, if not a member of the assembly, needs to be elected within six months of assuming the post. The EC does not typically hold by-polls to vacant constituencies when an assembly’s remaining term is less than a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-observers-in-dehradun-ahead-of-meeting-to-choose-new-cm-101625296556180.html

03-07-2021||India||Congress hits out at BJP over ‘political instability’ in Uttarakhand||The Congress on Saturday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the “political instability” in Uttarakhand following chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat’s resignation four months after he took over the state’s top post.Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said the state will now get the third chief minister in the fifth year of the government’s tenure. “Uttarakhand is becoming an example for greed for power, political instability and BJP’s incompetence and failure.” he said at a press conference. He added the BJP “is famous for creating political instability” and recalled how it changed chief ministers thrice in Delhi between 1993 and 1998.Former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat referred to Tirath Singh Rawat’s suggestion that he resigned because the Election Commission (EC) was unlikely to hold by-elections due to Covid-19 and called it a lie. “What can be a bigger lie than this that byelections cannot be held in Uttarakhand due to Covid and the chief minister is resigning due to constitutional compulsion. The reality is that by-elections have been held before in the same Covid period,” he said.A chief minister, if not a member of the assembly, needs to be elected within six months of assuming the post. The EC does not typically hold by-polls to vacant constituencies when an assembly’s remaining term is less than a year.Devendra Yadav, another Congress leader, said the change in Uttarakhand is the result “of lack of leadership, carelessness and foolishness” of the top brass of the BJP.“Amidst a deadly pandemic, where the duty of the government should have been ensuring the safety of the people, the only thing BJP has done has play games.” Yadav said the BJP has betrayed the people of Uttarakhand.There was no immediate response from the BJP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-hits-out-at-bjp-over-political-instability-in-uttarakhand-101625295956198.html

Banka Manjhi, 28, son of Suresh Manjhi and a resident of Serwahi Barwa village in Ramnagar block, about 275 km north of state capital Patna, was attacked by the tiger when he was working in his field on the fringe of the village, next to his house. “My husband was working in the field along with two other villagers. While others managed to escape, tiger attacked my husband. But by the time others rushed to his rescue, he was lying in a pool of blood,” said victim’s wife Savita Devi.

This will help crores of our traders get easier finance, various other benefits and also help boost their business. We are committed to empowering our traders."Official sources said the move will have an immediate impact on smaller retailers and wholesalers with businesses up to ₹250 crore of turnover in availing immediate-term finance as part of various schemes announced under "Atmanirbhar Bharat" programme.This landmark decision will have a structural impact for the sector, helping it get formalised by giving better finance options for businesses that want to get structured, they said, adding it will give retail MSMEs the support they need to "survive, revive and thrive".Retail and trade associations have welcomed the move, saying it will enable traders to get access to much-needed capital having been impacted greatly due to the Ccovid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retail-wholesale-trade-included-as-msme-pm-modi-hails-landmark-decision-101625290523570.html
03-07-2021||India||Rawat’s resignation could impact BJP’s poll prospects||Dehradun: Tirath Singh Rawat’s resignation as the Uttarakhand chief minister just four months after he replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat comes months before the elections in the state. Political experts say the fresh change of guard could impact the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prospects in the 2022 assembly polls. The change has also given Congress a fresh handle to attack the BJP over political inability in the state. Tirath Singh Rawat’s resignation ended his short stint that was marred by controversies including over allowing the Mahakumbh during a devastating surge in Covid infections, and large-scale fraud in testing during the mega fair. Rawat, 57, suggested he resigned because the Election Commission (EC) was unlikely to hold by-elections due to Covid-19. But an EC official indicated that no request was made to hold a by-poll and suggested there were precedents that may have permitted it. A chief minister, if not a member of the assembly, needs to be elected within six months of assuming the post. The EC does not typically hold by-polls to vacant constituencies when an assembly’s remaining term is less than a year.The situation for the BJP in Uttarakhand is a throwback to 2011 when Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank resigned ahead of the assembly polls the following year. BC Khanduri, who replaced Nishank, lost the assembly elections as Congress returned to power.SMA Kazmi, a Dehradun-based political analyst, said the change of leadership within four months will increase the political instability in the state and alter various equations between the Kumaon and Garhwal regions as well as Thakurs and Brahmins. “Opposition Congress will again get an opportunity to target the government...(over) growing political instability...” He added there is also brewing discontent over unemployment and issues related to traders.Congress leader Suryakant Dhasmana said the people feel betrayed and can clearly see there is no political stability in the state. “With such instability and infighting, can they provide any relief or succour to people here? They are themselves in crisis.”None of the state’s chief ministers barring Congress’s ND Tiwari have completed their five-year term in the state since it was formed in 2000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rawats-resignation-could-impact-bjp-s-poll-prospects-101625291455631.html

And 738 related fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours, lower than 853 on Friday, pushing India's death toll to 401,050 so far. India's active cases of Covid-19 also dropped further by 14,104 in the last 24 hours and settled at 495,533, accounting for 1.67% of total infections. The country's recovery rate stood at 97.01% on Saturday, as more people were cured of the coronavirus disease and outnumbered the daily new cases for nearly two months.The health ministry data showed that 34,46,11,291 people have been vaccinated in the country so far, out of which 4,399,298 were vaccinated in the last 24 hours.Covid-19 cases in India dipped below 50,000 for the first time on June 21 and have since remained stagnant in the bracket of 30,000-50,000. The country has seen a sharp fall of Covid-19 cases in the second wave after they peaked with 414,188 fresh infections on May 6.However, experts have cautioned people saying they need to follow Covid appropriate norms. NITI Aayog member (health) VK Paul said close monitoring is crucial at this stage and the country “cannot lower its guard”. “As we are seeing in Europe right now, the disease transmission has started growing again, with cases having dropped to 50 per million at one point, which is now almost double... It is in our control to ensure India doesn’t see the third wave,” he said.Officials on Friday said India is vaccinating on average 5 million individuals daily since June 21. This is equivalent to inoculating the entire population of Norway every day and asserted that the process is like a “marathon and not a 100-metre race”.To date, 340 million people or equivalent to the entire population of the US have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine since the nationwide inoculation drive began on January 16, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said on Friday in a press briefing.Responding to the de-acceleration in the rate of inoculation, Agarwal said, "We are in a marathon and not a 100-metre sprint."Even as the second wave has declined to 1/7th of its peak, officials have abstained from announcing its end. "The second wave of Covid-19 is not over yet," Agarwal said.The central government underlined the need for vaccination and following Covid-19 protocols, noting that the second wave of the pandemic is not over yet and people should not lower their guard.Though daily new Covid-19 cases continue to show a declining trend, 71 districts reported a case positivity rate of more than 10% from June 23 to 29, Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-44-111-covid-19-cases-738-deaths-in-last-24-hours-101625280693285.html
03-07-2021||India||'Mind the gap': Rahul Gandhi targets Centre over Covid-19 vaccination rate||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi once again took a shot at the central government on Saturday over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination rate in the country. Sharing a cumulative vaccination tracker graphic, Gandhi pointed out that India's actual Covid-19 vaccination rate is 27% below the government's target rate to avoid a potential third wave of the pandemic.The graphic shared by Rahul Gandhi was sourced from information published by a Delhi-based news organisation. It tracks the actual cumulative vaccination rate in India, said to be 50.8 lakh vaccine doses a day, versus the vaccination rate targetted by the central government to avoid a potential third wave -- 69.5 lakh doses a day. Therefore, the Congress leader said, there is a 27% gap between the actual vaccination rate and the government target."Mind the gap!" Rahul Gandhi remarked, sharing the graphic from his official Twitter handle on Saturday.Mind the gap!#WhereAreVaccines pic.twitter.com/0VNhT6K8fnGandhi has been a harsh critic of the central government's vaccination policy ever since its inception. He has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on numerous counts, to end the 'shortage' of vaccine doses in the country. On Friday, he questioned the government on vaccine availability and said, "It's July already, yet there are no vaccines."At least two Union ministers, including health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan, hit back at the Congress leader over his tweet. The minister, in turn, had asked, "What is Rahul Gandhi's problem? Does he not read? Does he not understand?" The minister added that he had a day ago put out "facts" regarding vaccine availability for the month of July. "There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance," he remarked, adding that Congress must think about a "leadership overhaul".Meanwhile, an acute vaccine shortage has been reported from various parts of the country. The Odisha government halted the vaccination drive in 16 districts due to a "shortage" of Covishield doses. Assam, on Thursday, said it could vaccinate only 16.63 lakh people in the last 10 days, almost 45% less than the target set by state chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, due to a massive shortage of Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mind-the-gap-rahul-gandhi-targets-centre-over-covid-19-vaccination-rate-101625282681951.html

Here's why||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday attached properties of late Congress leader Ahmed Patel's son-in-law, actors Dino Moria and Sanjay Khan, and DJ Aqeel. The development comes in connection with a money laundering case related to bank fraud, news agency PTI reported. The assets of the four people, worth ₹8.79 crore in total, have been seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ED said.The ED informed on Friday that the case pertains to a Gujarat-based pharmaceutical company, Sterling Biotech Group, and its absconding promoters -- brothers Nitin Sandesara and Chetan Sandesara.The money laundering case allegedly involves a sum of ₹14,500 crore in bank-loan frauds. According to the ED, the amount is even greater than the fraud committed by fugitive businessman Nirav Modi, who was the chief beneficiary of the ₹11,400 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam.The ED said that four separate preliminary orders have been issued under the PMLA to attach properties of the four aforementioned persons. The property is valued at ₹8.79 crore. Of this, the value of attachment of assets for Sanjay Khan is ₹3 crore, and for Dino Morea, it is ₹1.4 crore. For Aqeel Abdulkhalil Bachooali -- popularly known as DJ Aqeel -- it is ₹1.98 crore, and for Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui, who is late Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s son-in-law, it is ₹2.41 crore.According to the agency, the assets seized consist of three vehicles, several bank accounts, shares, and mutual funds.It is said that the Sandesara brothers "diverted" proceedings of the bank loan fraud to these four people. Earlier, the central investigating agency had questioned Siddiqui, Morea, and Aqeel in the case. The ED also recorded the statement of Sandesara family employee Sunil Yadav, who said that Siddiqui was in possession of a house in Delhi's Vasant Vihar, which allegedly belonged to Chetan Sandesara.The agency then said that it had enough evidence to claim that Dino Morea and Aqeel were illegally paid by the Gujarat-based pharmaceutical company, back in 2011-12, when they attended a family function organised by the Sandesara brothers.Meanwhile, Nitin Sandesara, Chetan Sandesara, Chetan's wife Dipti Sandesara, and Hitesh Patel have been declared fugitive economic offenders by a special court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-seized-assets-of-actor-dino-morea-and-ahmed-patel-s-son-in-law-in-bank-fraud-case-here-s-why-101625279779388.html

The large-scale final analysis deployed a double-blind, randomised, multi-center clinical trial, using a sponsor-supplied randomisation scheme where volunteers received two intramuscular doses of either the Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo -- four weeks apart. It consisted of 25,800 volunteers from the age group of 18 to 98 years, the report said.The vaccine was approved for emergency use in the Indian population in January, and the Hyderabad-based company had then said it would release phase III data by March. The release was since pushed back on several occasions. It had earlier shared the data with Indian drug regulators, however, the data regarding the multiple analyses had not been released until now.Earlier, Bharat Biotech's US partner Ocugen had reported similar findings regarding Covaxin, adding that adverse events reported in the study were low. Only 12.4% of the subjects experienced commonly known side-effects, it said. Both adverse events and severe adverse events reported in the vaccine group were found at similar rates to the placebo group, the company added.Covaxin, along with the Oxford University-Astrazeneca shot, has been used since the beginning of India's nationwide vaccine drive against the viral disease on January 16. Russia's Sputnik V was given emergency use authorisation (EUA) in April, while US pharmaceutical firm Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine on Tuesday received approval to be used here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-says-completed-final-analysis-for-covaxin-claims-77-8-efficacy-101625276667922.html

Here's the truth||A WhatsApp message claiming that the government is giving ₹4,000 to everyone under a Covid relief scheme is false and there is no such financial assistance being extended, the Press Information Bureau has tweeted. "It is being claimed in a WhatsApp message that the Indian government is, under a Corona Care Fund Scheme, giving a sum of ₹4,000 to everyone. This is a false claim. The government is running no such scheme," PIB's Fact Check handle said in a tweet in Hindi.The tweet comes as Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on June 28 announced eight new schemes, including a ₹1.1 lakh crore loan guarantee scheme for the Covid-affected and an additional ₹1.5 lakh crore under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme launched as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package last year.एक #WhatsApp मैसेज में दावा किया जा रहा है कि भारत सरकार 'कोरोना केयर फंड योजना' के तहत सभी को ₹4000 की सहायता राशि प्रदान कर रही है।#PIBFactCheck: यह दावा #फ़र्ज़ी है। भारत सरकार द्वारा ऐसी कोई योजना नहीं चलाई जा रही है। pic.twitter.com/SSLK6x66HeThe government has announced a slew of measures amid the economic distress during the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictions put in place to curb the rising cases of Covid-19 across the country.Before this, PIB Fact Check rejected claims that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a nationwide lockdown from July 1 till July 31 and also declared the "beginning of the third wave" of the pandemic.

Subject to exigencies of business, the Session is scheduled to conclude on Friday, 13 August 2021," a Rajya Sabha official order said.Both the Houses are going to have 19 sittings, simultaneously. The Parliament sessions will be held amid the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), albeit with necessary protocols. Not unlike the last session, arrangements are being made this time, too, to accommodate the members of the Parliament (MPs) on a social distancing basis.As many as 444 members of the Lok Sabha and 218 members of the Rajya Sabha have so far been vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a PTI report. Some MPs have not been able to take their second jab yet as they were affected by Covid-19, a top functionary told HT on condition of anonymity. “Another 30 MPs have not sent us any communication. We are trying to contact them to know their vaccination status.”The Covid-19 pandemic has affected Parliament sessions since March 2020, forcing early closure of last year’s budget and monsoon sessions and this year’s budget session. The 2020 winter session was skipped altogether due to the public health crisis. The high rate of vaccination among the lawmakers and Parliament staff improves chances of a longer Parliament session and higher productivity.

The report also highlighted the importance of sentinel site-based surveillance and detection of early warning signals with the help of the test positivity ratio (TPR).Also Read | 10 European nations recognise CovishieldThe Lancet report, titled 'Responsive and Agile Vaccination Strategies Against COVID-19 in India' was published in the current issue of its monthly, open-access global health magazine. It explained how even "limited vaccination resources" can be deployed to the best extent when used 'flexibly'. For this purpose, it cited experience past influenza pandemics in 1918 and 2009, as well the current coronavirus pandemic in several other countries, to observe that there might be more than two waves of the infection.“Flexible, agile vaccination strategies could thus play an important part in protecting lives and livelihoods as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold,” the report read.Elaborating on the matter, the Lancet report said that "community-based outreach activities" as well as transport facilities for the older section of the population can help reduce the distance between a vaccination center and its potential beneficiaries in different regions. These outreach activities include -- setting up satellite vaccination centers closer to hamlets in rural settings; resident welfare associations in urban areas arranging vaccination for people in the vicinity; drive-in vaccination using large community halls and parking spaces, etc.The active engagement of community-based organisations for this purpose is key to achieving a flexible Covid-19 vaccination strategy, the report said. “Such measures will help to speed up vaccination while maintaining safety,” it said.Further, the report also noted a few key facts about the protection that even a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccine can provide.Also Read | Health ministry allows Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant womenEarly findings from the UK suggest that the single-dose efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is significantly reduced when considering symptomatic infection of B.1.617.2, the dominant Covid-19 variant in India, as an endpoint. However, the entire scenario offers up a "mixed picture". More recent findings suggest that a single dose of the vaccine can protect against hospitalisation, as has been reported among as many as 71% of the health workers in India, it said.Similarly, a rapid-response vaccination strategy could potentially reduce mortality substantially, even though single-dose vaccine efficacy was reduced to 30%. “It will be important to adjust for population density and other factors to make systematic comparisons of seroprevalence across different regions, but the collection of the necessary evidence will take time. In the immediate term, more rapidly deployable strategies are urgently needed,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lancet-sets-out-flexible-covid-19-vaccination-strategy-for-india-says-outreach-is-key-101625269230931.html

On June 24, all the women escaped by breaking the exhaust fan hole on the third floor of the shelter home. Two of them sustained injuries and 10 of them fled. We have registered a case in this connection and published an advertisement for the purpose of tracing the women,” said the DCP.Investigating officials said they registered a kidnapping case because it is the norm when rescued women go missing while they are under the custody of the government.Till late Friday night, police did not receive any information on their whereabouts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-rescued-women-flee-shelter-home-probe-on-101625262664951.html
03-07-2021||India||French judge to probe alleged corruption in Rafale deal: Report||A French judge has been appointed to head a probe into suspected “corruption and favouritism” in the ₹59,000 crore Rafale deal with India for 36 fighter jets, according to a report in a French online journal, Mediapart.“The highly sensitive probe into the inter-governmental deal signed in 2016 was formally opened on June 14,” Mediapart said. It said the development was confirmed by the financial crimes branch of the French public prosecution services on Friday.The French website carried a series of reports on alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal in April 2021.Also Read: 'No violations in Rafale deal with India', says Dassault AviationIn one of those reports, Mediapart claimed that the former head of the financial crimes branch of France’s public prosecution services, Éliane Houlette, shelved an investigation into alleged evidence of corruption in the Rafale jet deal despite the objection of colleagues. It said Houlette justified her decision to shelve the investigations as preserving “the interests of France, the workings of institutions.”“Now, her successor as head of the PNF, Jean-François Bohnert, has decided to support the opening of a probe, after the complaint was updated with details from Mediapart’s recent series of investigations,” Mediapart’s latest report said.The criminal investigation, Mediapart said, will “examine questions surrounding the actions” of former French president François Hollande, who was in office when the Rafale deal was inked, current French president Emmanuel Macron, who was at the time Hollande’s economy and finance minister, and foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who was then holding the defence portfolio.India ordered the jets in September 2016 as an emergency purchase through a government-to-government deal. The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.The NDA has not disclosed details of the price, but the UPA deal, struck in 2012, was not a viable one, former defence minister Manohar Parrikar has previously said, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison is moot. Indeed, the UPA was not able to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to pricing of items not included in the initial bid.The NDA government has said that it cannot disclose the details of the price on two counts: a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies; however, it said that the current deal also includes customised weaponry.The Supreme Court heard a public interest case on the deal and in November 2019, said it saw nothing wrong in it. In a February 2019 report, the government’s auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India audited the deal and said India had not overpaid for the jets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-judge-to-probe-alleged-corruption-in-rafale-deal-report-101625258923727.html
03-07-2021||India||10% of those who had Covid-19 were reinfected during April wave: Study||More than 10% of the people who had Covid-19 were likely exposed to the virus again during the April wave of infections in Delhi, found researchers from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB).The findings were based on the sequential analysis of samples from 1,000 people across ten locations part of the study, which found that the antibodies in them were mostly declining before they shot up again.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“More than 10% of the people in our study showed declining and then increasing levels of antibodies. The proportion might increase further as we are analysing more data,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, IGIB.The study found that 80% of the participants had antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, in June, after the fourth wave of infections (and the second nationwide) in Delhi.The findings are higher than the estimated 4.5% re-infection established by the Indian Council of Medical Research, although experts said those cannot be compared since they are based on people who test positive through the RT-PCR method. The distinction between the two relates to circumstances in which people may get a test – if they have symptoms or had a confirmed close contact.But re-infections can also be silent, and a more accurate way to catch them could be via antibody tests. The disparity could also be because the IGIB study includes data up to June, whereas the ICMR study is from January to October last year.Also Read | Covid: 2 govt labs to start genome sequencing from July to detect mutations“I think, measuring the antibody levels gives a better picture of re-infections in the population. This is because many may not get tested if they are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. If we have to confirm re-infection through genomic sequencing of the samples from both the infections, there would be just over a handful of cases in India perhaps,” said Dr Agarwal.The researchers have previously shown that the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) which was in circulation during the second wave pandemic is significantly less sensitive to immunity from a previous infection or vaccination.Experts said that a 10% re-infection rate was not sufficient to cause a third wave.“Reinfections is the norm and not the exception, but it is not enough to lead to a third wave. The increase in the antibody levels is sometimes the only way to detect re-infections as the second infection is likely to be less severe and people might not have symptoms or get tested for it,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-of-those-who-had-covid-19-were-reinfected-during-april-wave-study-101625257344070.html
03-07-2021||India||Smuggler held with leopard claws, teeth||The forest department, along with the wildlife crime control bureau (WCCB), arrested one person for illegally smuggling and selling a bag of leopard claws and teeth at Delhi’s Kashmere interstate bus terminus (ISBT) on Friday.Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator of forests (north division), said, acting on a tip-off, the team -- projecting themselves as prospective buyers -- met the man at Kashmere Gate ISBT around 7am on Friday and caught him with a bag of leopard claws and teeth.“The seller has been arrested and the parts have been seized,” said Madanpotra.He said the department is not going to release the price of the animal parts in the illegal market, because the Wildlife (Protection) Act prohibits making such information public.The Indian leopard has been listed as a vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)--an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources-- because of its depleting population. Poaching of the animal for the illegal trade of its skin and other body parts is strictly banned.Forest officials said such illegal trade and transit has increased over the last few years and teams are often on alert to track such criminals. The operation often involves coordination from forest and wildlife departments from other states as well.A senior forest department official explained that even though Delhi is not a hub for wildlife-related crimes, it is an important transit point from where poachers and middlemen transport animals, dead and alive, and their body parts.“After illegally poaching protected animals such as leopards, tigers, crocodiles, and even trading several protected species of birds from the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal among other places, these illegal traders often use Delhi as a transit point to take these items further into north east India and then across border to Nepal, Bhutan or China. The black market value of these goods is quite high,” the official explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smuggler-held-with-leopard-claws-teeth-101625256865347.html

The judges suggested that the state could organise the drive through corporations and municipalities in urban and semi-urban areas. And in rural areas where it may be more difficult, the state was asked to rope in NGOs besides using the panchayat system.“For such purpose, notices be issued immediately,” the court said. The matter has been posted to July 7 for the Tamil Nadu government’s initial response. “It would serve the children well if the State has a road-map ready so that the lack of adequate food and nourishment that children have suffered over the last 15 months or so, particularly among the more vulnerable sections, may be remedied without delay,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hcseeks-plan-to-deliver-nutritious-food-to-kids-under-govt-scheme-in-tn-101625256531799.html

The court said that they will not interfere in such matters unless it finds the actions of the executive being arbitrary citing a similar matter which appeared earlier on Friday which was also disposed of pertaining to bus services and the restricted operation in certain parts of the state.The judges noted that there is no doubt that the state has obtained expert advice and considered relevant factors, including the crowding that occurs at religious places, in continuing the restrictions in areas which were more severely affected by the second surge in the pandemic. “Ordinarily, even a constitutional Court will not interfere in such matters, since it may not possess the expertise in deciding what is appropriate and unless it finds the executive action in such regard being utterly arbitrary and completely without basis,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-practise-faith-subservient-to-right-to-life-says-madras-hc-101625256531240.html

This is a first at the site where there are remnants of ancient civilisation.“We have found evidence of second burials before but this was the first time that we discovered a primary burial,” said site excavation director, M Prabhakaran. “We found the skeleton in a lying down position like the head had been positioned to a side and the legs were folded. The skull was severely damaged so we could only collect pieces.”Two burial urns were opened on Thursday as part of the second phase of excavations which is ongoing at the burial site as well as the habitation site. While one contained the skeleton, the other contained small bones and a red and black bowl. Experts from Madurai Kamaraj University were present when they opened to collect samples for DNA testing. The previous AIADMK regime had signed an MoU with the institution to conduct DNA testing of skeletons found across all excavation sites in Tamil Nadu including in Keeladi.Around 40 burial urns have been found at the site so far which was taken up for excavation by the state archaeology department from 2019. The previous government had sanctioned ₹31 lakh for the project.A history teacher is said to have drawn the state government’s attention to this site having found ancient artefacts here. In 2018, a government appointed expert confirmed that it was an ancient site. They have been able to find burial urns containing teeth, jaws and small bones, antiquities and iron tools. Initial examinations have given a sense to the team that these findings could belong to a period that is more than 3000 years old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-skeleton-found-inside-burial-urn-in-tn-excavation-site-101625256411822.html

The petitioner called the commission a waste of taxpayers money stating that it was defunct since 2019 after Apollo Hospitals which treated Jayalalithaa had obtained a stay from the Supreme Court on the proceedings of the commission.After being re-elected for a second consecutive term in May 2016, Jayalalithaa underwent a long treatment towards the end of year and died on December 5 2016 due to cardiac arrest. The following year, the one-man judicial commission was set up by the previous AIADMK regime on the insistence of O Panneerselvam who officiated in the post during her illness. The commission was meant to independently enquire into her death and the medical treatment given to her.Taking note of the petitioner’s submissions that the commission hasn’t made any progress in the past two years and has had several extensions, the court in its orders said, “The State should indicate why the relevant Commission should not be directed to file its final report and wind up its business within the next three months.” The matter has been posted to August 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-can-t-jayalalithaa-death-probe-panel-submit-report-in-3-months-madras-hc-101625256411244.html
03-07-2021||India||Behind Delhi’s unusual weather this summer||The maximum temperature recorded in Delhi on June 30 was 43.73 degrees Celsius. This is the second highest maximum temperature on this day since 1951, less than a tenth of a degree lower than the 43.76 degrees Celsius recorded on June 30, 1987. That Delhi is experiencing a heatwave when it should have been raining is yet another example of unusual turns in Delhi’s weather. This newspaper has earlier reported that Delhi’s climate created a new record every month since August 2020. An HT analysis of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) gridded database on rainfall and temperature confirms the deviant trends in Delhi’s climate this summer. Here are four charts summarising the break in the patternIt was not hot in Delhi when it was supposed to beDelhi’s maximum temperature, according to IMD’s gridded database, was 43.73 degrees Celsius on June 30, 2021. This is the second highest maximum temperature on this day since 1987. However, what is even more unusual is the fact that June 30, 2021 was the hottest day in Delhi this summer, something which has never happened since 1951, the earliest period for which we have temperature data in the IMD’s gridded database. To be sure, the month of June is one of the hottest in the March-June period, but usually in its first half.In the 71 years from 1951, the hottest day of March-June period has come 38 times in June. On 23 of these 38 times, the hottest day has been on or before June 12, and only 15 times on or after June 16. The last week of June or the June 24-June 30 period, when monsoon generally arrives in Delhi, has recorded the hottest summer day only twice before 2021: in 1987 and in 1991.The gridded database temperature is different from the ones recorded as a particular station because it is based on interpolating data from weather stations that have been working long-term and whose historical data has been checked for quality, while IMD bulletins might include data from newly added stations too. A grid in this dataset is a box bound by two latitudes and longitudes. While the rainfall grids are 0.25 degree apart in IMD’s dataset, the temperature dataset grids are 1 degree apart. Delhi is not captured by the temperature dataset. The temperature statistics for Delhi here therefore also include the seven districts bordering Delhi: Sonipat, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Faridabad, Gurgaon, and Jhajjar.Data also shows that average maximum temperatures in Delhi in the months of April, May and the first half of June this year have been either close to or significantly lower than the 1981-2010 period average. IMD uses the average of temperatures in the 1981-2010 period to check whether temperatures are higher or lower than what is expected for an interval, with a deviation of 1 degree Celsius considered as normal. This proves that Delhi had a far more pleasant summer or at least a normal summer until the last week of June.It rained before it was supposed to rainDelhi received a cumulative rainfall of 111.1mm in May this year. This is 400.4% more than the long period average (LPA) for the month. The LPA of rainfall is defined as the average of rainfall for an interval in the 1961-2010 period. To be sure, bulk of the cumulative rainfall in May was on account of the disturbance created by Cyclone Tauktae. 80.2mm or 72% of the 111.1mm rainfall took place on May 20, which is the highest since 1901 for this day. The LPA figure for rainfall on May 20 is just 0.87mm. May 19, May 21 and May 22 were also high rainfall days, recording the 11th highest, eighth highest and the highest rainfall for these days since 1901.Moreover, small amounts of rainfall took place once every week in May, making sure that temperatures stayed much lower than what they have been historically. Delhi’s maximum temperatures from May 18 to May 20 were ranked lowest for those days since 1951. From May 21 to May 24, the maximum temperatures for the day were ranked second lowest, sixth lowest, third lowest, and seventh lowest since 1951.What followed has been an exceptionally dry monsoonThe period between June 1 and September 30 is officially considered to be the monsoon season in India. According to IMD’s gridded database, Delhi’s cumulative monsoon rainfall as of 8.30am on June 30 was 23.32mm. This is 61% lower than the LPA and the 39th highest deficiency since 1901, the earliest period for which data is available. The deficiency is more acute if we look at cumulative rainfall in just the second half of June. Against an LPA of 44.7mm rainfall from June 16 to June 30, this year’s rainfall is just 6mm or 87% deficient, making it the 22nd highest rainfall deficit since 1901.Monsoon has halted at all-India level tooPart of the reason for a drier monsoon in Delhi could be that the monsoon has weakened before it was scheduled to enter north-western India. Rainfall at all-India level was above the LPA on all days except two from June 1 to June 20. After June 20, it has consistently remained below the LPA. Cumulative rainfall was 83.7% above the LPA on June 1. This surplus dropped to 23.7% of the LPA by June 10, rose again to reach 46.83% on June 20, and has since dropped consistently. The overall 188.9mm rainfall in June is only 15% above the LPA of 164mm for June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-delhi-s-unusual-weather-this-summer-101625255013290.html

03-07-2021||India||K’taka minister’s aide held for ‘cheating’ job aspirants||A close associate of Karnataka’s social welfare minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator, B Sriramulu, was arrested on Thursday night on charges that he cheated government job aspirants. The accused, Rajanna, was picked up by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) and was arrested outside the residence of the minister, following a complaint by chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s son, BY Vijayendra on June 28. People aware of the developments said that Vijayendra was forced to make the complaint as the accused was using the former’s name to extort money from government job aspirants. “Yesterday evening Rajanna was detained for questioning. Team of one ACP Nagraj and 2 police inspectors Hazresh and Prashanth Babu have questioned him in detail. His voice sample has also been taken. It is being sent to FSL for matching with audio clippings available. Further investigation is being done. A notice has been served to him to appear before the Investigating Officer (IO) when summoned again,” Sandeep Patil, the Joint Commissioner of Police (CCB) said in a statement on Friday. The arrest has fueled speculation of a growing rift within the Yediyurappa government and his cabinet, wherein Sriramulu claimed that he got to know about the developments only through media reports. “I heard this news in the media and no one should misuse another’s name,” Sriramulu said on Friday. He added that once the investigation is complete, law will take its own course. The minister said that he would also speak to Vijayendra and the chief minister and added that Vijayendra did not share this information with the former and called it a “miscommunication”. He clarified that Rajanna was his acquaintance but denied that the latter worked in any capacity. “The accused person misused (the) complainant’s name to get a job done by receiving illegal gratification. The complainant also stated that he does not know the said accused nor he has anything to do with him hence the complainant requested to take necessary action against all the persons concerned including the said accused,” stated the FIR lodged with the police by Vijayendra on June 28. Hindustan Times has seen a copy of this FIR. The case has been filed under Section 66 of the Karnataka Information Technology Act 2000 and Section 420 under the IPC. The developments add to the already strained relations with the chief minister and senior ministers in his cabinet who have aired their discontent with the former’s son, who is accused of running a parallel administration under the aegis of his father. “It has come to my knowledge that a person has misused my name on many occasions to cheat people and has received money by luring them with false promises. As soon as it came to my notice, I lodged a police complaint and requested to take appropriate action as per the law,” Vijayendra said in a post on Twitter on Friday. “I request everyone to exercise caution and beware of such fraudulent people and immediately bring to my attention if you come across any such incidents of fraudsters trying to misuse my name by making false promises,” he added. However, the clarification on Twitter still leaves several questions unanswered as to why the BJP’s vice president in Karnataka did not reach out to Sriramulu before filing the complaint. Sriramulu is one of the more influential leaders within the government and is a close associate of former illegal iron-ore mining kingpin, Gali Janardhana Reddy. The minister who hails from a community classified as scheduled caste, was also an aspirant for the post of deputy chief minister when the BJP seized power after Yediyurappa engineered the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress government. In the last two months, at least four BJP legislators have levelled serious charges against Yediyurappa and his son including the “sex-for-job” scandal on Ramesh Jarkiholi, “bribe-for-bed scam” against Satish Reddy, allegations of taking cuts from private hospitals for vaccination against Ravi Subramanya and one (Arvind Bellad) who suspected that his phone was being tapped. One legislator of the BJP said that Yediyurappa would get vindictive against anyone who has tried to criticise the government and even hinted that most of the allegations in recent times against his own partymen, have been at the behest of the chief minister. Yediyurappa is on shaky ground as several legislators from his own party have rallied for his removal that has threatened the stability of the two-year old government, adding to the strained relations in BJP’s only government in southern India. The BJP is yet to act on ministers and other legislators of the party who have openly sought Yediyurappa’s removal and even accused him and his son of corruption. Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal) and AH Vishwanath have alleged that Yediyurappa and his son have indulged in wide-scale corruption, amounting to thousands of crores.

03-07-2021||India||Bengal govt in denial over post-poll violence: HC||The West Bengal government was in “denial mode” on post-poll violence in the state, the Calcutta high court said on Friday, while taking cognisance of an official report on the attacks and ordering the authorities to record statements and provide relief to the victims.The court’s observations are a setback for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) administration that has repeatedly denied large-scale violence after the May 2 assembly election results and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of fabricating charges.A five-judge high court bench took note of a report by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and gave the seven-member team, which was set up on the high court’s orders, till July 13 to visit more districts and meet more complainants.It directed a second autopsy of a BJP leader and issued a show-cause notice to a top Kolkata Police officer over an alleged attack on a member of the NHRC team.“From a perusal of the report prima facie stand taken by the petitioners is established that there had been post- poll violence and the state was found on a wrong foot, where throughout it was on a denial mode,” observed the bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and comprising justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar.The bench said a perusal of the report established the allegations that a number of people were killed and many suffered sexual violence and grievous injuries, including minor girls who were “brutally assaulted sexually”.Violence broke out in various parts of the state hours after the TMC trounced the BJP to secure a third consecutive term on May 2. BJP leaders alleged that they were thrashed and threatened by TMC members, their houses ransacked and offices vandalised.The TMC denied the charges and said the BJP was trying to inflate isolated clashes. “One or two cases may be genuine but the rest are made up by the BJP. These are all fake allegations,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday.On June 18, the high court -- hearing a bunch of public interest litigation -- asked NHRC to probe the violence. Three days later, it rejected the state government’s review petition and said the administration’s conduct didn’t inspire confidence.The NHRC’s preliminary report was submitted to the court on June 30 in a sealed envelope. The court refused to disclose the contents but officials aware of the developments said the panel received complaints about 41 murders and 13 rapes. The preliminary report did not mention the role of the local police but it will be a part of the final report, officials said.The court directed the state government to provide all logistical support to the NHRC panel and ensure no obstruction in this process. “Such obstruction will be viewed seriously, which may entail action under the Contempt of Courts Act besides others,” the bench said in its order.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, Suvendu Adhikari of the BJP, welcomed the court’s decision. “The government said all the violence took place when the Election Commission was in control of the administration and nothing happened after the new government took charge. It was a lie,” said Adhikari.The TMC said the violence took place before Mamata Banerjee was sworn in as CM on May 5. “The government will follow the court’s order. But our contention is that Mamata Banerjee controlled the situation after she was sworn in. The violence took place before that,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.Hearing a bunch of public interest litigations (PIL), the bench issued a slew of orders.It asked the administration to conduct a fresh autopsy of local BJP leader Abhijit Sarkar, who was allegedly strangled to death by a mob in Kolkata on May 2. The body is kept in a city morgue.During the hearing, advocate general Kishore Datta told the bench that the Supreme Court had taken cognisance of Sarkar’s killing. The bench said it was only ordering a second autopsy without giving any direction.The victim’s brother, Biswajit Sarkar, is among the petitioners who moved the Supreme Court in May seeking the formation of a special investigation team to probe the violence.The bench also issued a show-cause notice to Rashid Munir Khan, deputy commissioner of police of the south suburban division of Kolkata Police, for failing to give protection to Atif Rasheed, vice-chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities and a member of the NHRC team, on June 29.Rasheed alleged that he was attacked while visiting Jadavpur, which falls under the south suburban division. The bench asked why the police should not be held guilty of contempt of court.The court also directed the police to register cases of all complainants, get statements of the victims as per law and provide medical relief to them.The NHRC panel includes a member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and a member of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority.The NHRC panel is led by commission member and former Intelligence Bureau chief Rajiv Jain. The other members are National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja, West Bengal State Legal Services Authority member secretary Raju Mukherjee and Rashed are other members.Divided in two groups, the members visited north and south Bengal districts. A camp was also held in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata on Monday where many local residents came to give their statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-in-denial-over-post-poll-violence-hc-101625252510773.html
03-07-2021||India||Bengal governor Dhankhar cuts short speech amid ruckus in House||KolkataWest Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar cut short his speech inaugurating the state assembly’s budget session on Friday after raucous protests by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) members in the House, reading out only a few lines and finishing in around four minutes. Dhankhar, who repeatedly clashed with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and previously expressed reservations about reading out a speech prepared by the state government, started at 2 pm. But he was interrupted after four minutes by BJP legislators who reached the well of the House and started shouting slogans against the government. The BJP members held posters and banners showing images of BJP supporters allegedly killed by TMC workers. They objected to some lines in the speech that said some violence took place before the new government took charge and a “section of people” was carrying out a false campaign using fake photos and videos. Amid the ruckus, Dhankhar ended his speech by reading out a few lines from the last paragraph and left the assembly around 2.15 pm. Leader of Opposition and BJP legislator Suvendu Adhikari said Dhankhar did not read the whole speech to express sympathy for the victims of post-poll violence “We staged the agitation because the speech prepared by the government did not mention post-poll violence although it is now a national issue. We were not protesting against the governor,” said Adhikari.Parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee dismissed the suggestion. “The governor was interrupted by the unruly BJP members but his speech was accepted and placed before the House. In the second half of the session, the speaker passed the motion of thanks as well. So, technically the governor delivered his speech. Those who are denying it do not know parliamentary rules,” said Chatterjee.Dhankhar was not available for comment. This is the first assembly session after Mamata Banerjee-led TMC won the state elections on May 2. The developments came a day after ties between Raj Bhavan and the TMC touched a new low with the ruling party linking the governor to a fake vaccine scam. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who attended the House proceedings on Friday despite not being an MLA, also alleged on June 28 that Dhankhar was an accused in the 1996 Jain hawala case.The same day, the governor denied the charges and told reporters that he was not bound to read out the speech prepared by the state government – contradicting established House norms backed by the Constitution. In February last year, Dhankhar wanted to edit the speech prepared by the state for the budget session. The government rejected his suggestion. Dhankhar finally followed convention and read out the speech critical of the Citizenship Amendment Act. On Friday, however, the acrimony was not visible at the House. The chief minister and speaker Biman Banerjee greeted Dhankhar at the gates when he arrived at 1.48 pm. They walked up to the statue of B R Ambedkar and paid tribute together. Banerjee escorted Dhankhar to the House and also saw him off. The two were seen talking cordially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-dhankhar-cuts-short-speech-amid-ruckus-in-house-101625252451415.html
03-07-2021||India||TMC seeks removal of S-G Tushar Mehta over alleged meeting with Adhikari||Kolkata: The Trinamool Congress sought the removal of solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday and alleged that the senior lawyer met Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Suvendu Adhikari in violation of established norms. Mehta denied the meeting and said Adhikari, the leader of Opposition in West Bengal, came to his residence-cum-office in Delhi at 3pm on Thursday, but left without meeting the SG, who was tied up in previous engagements, and expressed his inability to meet the Nandigram MLA.Adhikari is an accused in the 2016 Narada sting operation case, and Mehta -- the Union government’s second highest law officer -- is representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Supreme Court and Calcutta high court in the agency’s probe against senior TMC leaders in the case. Casual meetings between judges and lawyers or between law officers and political leaders in social gatherings are not per se improper or frowned upon. In 2018, at a social event organised by a newspaper in Delhi, a Supreme Court judge found himself seated next to a prominent politician whose son – also a politician, had a case being argued before a bench which included that judge. However, it may not be in keeping with the conventional mores of independence of investigating agency when the agency’s lawyer meets an accused in an unofficial set up like his residence. It may also raise issues of conflict of interest with the statutory duties of the lawyer for the investigating agency whose primary task is to ensure a just and fair investigation and a trial. Any meeting with an accused in a case may also give rise to questions of impropriety of the lawyer, besides integrity of the office if the lawyer happens to be a law officer. In 2013, the Supreme Court had called the CBI a “caged parrot” on being told that the then Union law minister Ashwani Kumar had made significant changes in the agency’s draft probe report on Coalgate, while top law officers and government officials, including those from the PMO, had suggested amendments. In November 2014, the Supreme Court had ordered then CBI Director Ranjit Sinha to stay out of the 2G case over accusations that he tried to interfere with the probe as purported entry registers at Sinha’s residence showed his meeting the accused in the 2G and Coal scam cases. A lawyer for an investigating agency may meet an accused who wants to turn an approver and strengthen the prosecution’s case but in all these cases, the accused must be somebody against whom chargesheet has been filed or against whom charges have been framed and he/she has been sent up for trial. The TMC letter, signed by party MPs Derek O’Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Mahua Moitra, said the alleged meeting between Adhikari and Mehta “reeks of impropriety”.“Such meeting between an accused in grave offences with the SG, who is advising such agencies by whom the said accused is being investigated, is in direct conflict of interest with the statutory duties of the SG of India,” said the letter, which came a day after Adhikari met Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. The MPs said that the alleged meeting was organised to influence the outcome of cases where Adhikari was an accused. They also said the main accused in the 2013 Saradha chit fund scam had levelled serious allegations against Adhikari, who switched from BJP to TMC in 2020. Notably, Adhikari has not been chargesheeted by CBI despite being initially named as an accused in the case. Hence, at present, there is no question of Adhikari’s trial or his appearance before the special CBI court in the Narada sting case. At the time of filing the chargesheet, the CBI has, however, kept the option of filing a supplementary chargesheet open. “In order to avoid any doubt in the mind of the public at large, as to the integrity and neutrality of the office of the SG, we approach you to initiate necessary steps for removal of Tushar Mehta from the post of the SG of India,” the letter said. A few hours later, Mehta denied the meeting. “Shri Suvendhu Adhikari did come to my residence cum office yesterday at around 3pm, unannounced. Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room of my office building,” the SG said in a written statement.“... When my meeting was over and my staff informed me about his arrival, I requested my staff to convey to Mr Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise as he had to wait. Mr Adhikari thanked my staff and left without insisting on meeting me. The question of my meeting Mr Adhikari, therefore, does not arise,” the statement further said. Adhikari, who attended the assembly session in Kolkata on Friday, claimed he could not meet the SG.The BJP said as leader of the Opposition, Adhikari can meet the SG to discuss legalities. “The TMC is trying to make an issue out of nothing to divert the attention from other important issues such as post-poll violence, deterioration of law and order in the state and the vaccination scam. Is there is Constitutional bar which says that an elected public representative cannot meet the SG even though he may be an accused in a case?” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal. The party’s state unit chief Dilip Ghosh said it was up to the TMC to substantiate its claims. “The question is how many persons the TMC would like to be removed from post. they want the governor to be removed because he is vociferous against the government. Now they want the SG to be removed. In future they may want the PM, home minister and even the President to be removed to survive,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmcseeks-removal-of-s-g-tushar-mehta-over-alleged-meeting-with-adhikari-101625252390664.html
03-07-2021||India||SC refuses to stay TN law on quota for Vanniyars||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to stay Tamil Nadu’s law, passed in February, creating a 10.5% sub-quota for the Vanniyar community within the 20% reservation for Most Backward Classes (MBCs) but later agreed to issue notice to the Tamil Nadu government and keep the petition pending along with others filed against the same law.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat observed that petitions against the law were already being considered by the Madras high court and gave the petitioner, S Sandeep Kumar, the option to approach the high court. Senior lawyer S Nagamuthu, however, urged the court to issue notice to the state government and keep the petition pending in the top court along with other similar petitions.The Tamil Nadu assembly passed the law on February 26, hours before the model code of conduct kicken in with the Election Commission’s announcement of the poll schedule for the state elections. In the assembly, the then chief minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami cited demands for the reservation by Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), a key AIADMK ally that counts the Vanniyar community as its core vote bank.The law provides internal reservation within the 20% MBC quota that benefits the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community most as it allocated 10.5% quota to them. The remaining share of 9.5% is apportioned between so-called Denotified Communities and other MBCs. Denotified Communities are those that once stood notified under the Criminal Tribes Acts during the pre-Independence period but were “denotified” after the government repealed the Acts in 1952.Nagamuthu questioned the validity of the law, arguing that it was passed for political considerations in a hurried manner without any discussion and without waiting for the report of a one-man judicial committee headed by Justice (retd) A Kulasekaran set up on December 21, 2020, to gather quantifiable data on the identified castes and tribes in the state.The petition filed through advocate P Sriram said the law was passed without any quantifiable data relating to social and educational backwardness of the Vanniyakula Kshatriyas . Nagamuthu told the top court that the immediate implication was that reservation benefits have been cornered by one community though 122 communities are classified MBCs, He said the law was passed on the assumption that the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes Commission made a recommendation for a separate quota for Vanniyakula Kshatriya community.The petition said the commission hasn’t made any such recommendation and the outgoing government, which pushed the law through the assembly, merely cited a letter written by Justice (Retd) MS Janardhanan, chairman of the commission in his individual capacity. The commission had seven other members.The petition also questioned the timing and intent of the law. “The bill is politically motivated and to please Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which is a splinter group of Vanniyakula Kshatriya community,” it said.In addition to the 20% MBC reservation, Tamil Nadu has allocated quota benefits to 30% among other backward classes (OBC), 18% to Scheduled Castes and 1% to Scheduled Tribes. The 1993 law, which allowed Tamil Nadu to continue with 69% reservation ( first instituted in 1990; it was 68% since 1980; and 49% before that) , thereby exceeding the 50% cap on reservation fixed by the Supreme Court in 1992, is also under challenge before the top court, which said it would wait till a Constitution bench decides on the Maratha quota issue, the validity of the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act of 2018 that made reservations in the state touch 65%. However, Tamil Nadu’s 1993 law was brought under the Ninth Schedule of Constitution, giving it protection from “any judgement, decree, or order of court...”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-stay-tn-law-on-quota-for-vanniyars-101625252210692.html
03-07-2021||India||Chinese national held at border quizzed in UP||Chinese national Junwei Han, the alleged kingpin of an illegal money transaction racket who was arrested by Border Security Force (BSF) while illegally crossing the India-Bangladesh border on June 10, was brought to Lucknow on Friday for interrogation, said senior UP Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials.The alleged racket involved illegal money transactions after opening online accounts in banks using fraudulently activated SIM cards, the officials said. It was busted by UP ATS in January this year.The officials said the ATS approached the BSF authorities after coming to know about Han’s arrest and brought him to Lucknow on Friday. They said Han’s name surfaced after Chinese national Sun Ji Ying, 35, was arrested from Gurugram, Haryana, in connection with the illegal money transaction racket on January 27. Before that, ATS had arrested two Chinese nationals Xu Xunfu alias Julahi and Pochnli Tengli alias Alice from Gautam Buddh Nagar in the same matter on January 24.A senior ATS official said the ATS sought the custody remand of Han from the ATS court in Lucknow in order to interrogate him. He said the decision about his custody remand was still pending.He also said Han, a resident of Beijing, reached Delhi by illegally entering India through the porous India-Bangladesh border two years ago.He said Han, along with Sun ji Ying who was in the country on a business visa till January, and two other Chinese nationals had procured over 1800 fraudulently activated SIM cards. He said these SIMS were used by different people for illegal online money transactions.The official said the role of Chinese nationals’ involvement had surfaced after the arrest of 14 people, who were allegedly providing pre-activated SIMs illegally, from different parts of the stateon January 17. He said the racket was involved in money-laundering and the possibility of terror funding behind it could not be ruled out. He said the ATS was probing the motive behind illegal money transactions.Another ATS official said the Chinese nationals arrested were in regular touch with another person in China through an instant messaging application for illegal money transactions. He said the racketeers misused relaxations offered in banking services for the common man during the pandemic. In this period, people were allowed to open their online bank accounts through their mobile phone numbers, without visiting the banks.A senior ATS official explained that at least two SIM cards could be issued in a day on one person’s identity proof.

03-07-2021||India||No plea filed to EC for bypoll: U’khand govt official||Tirath Singh Rawat or the Uttarakhand government have not petitioned the Election Commission of India to hold by-elections to allow the chief minister, who is not a member of the state legislature, to become a member of the house, a government official familiar with the matter said on Friday.Rawat resigned late on Friday, suggesting he did so because the EC was unlikely to hold by-elections. “The petition has not been received so far,” the official cited above said on condition of anonymity. A chief minister, who is neither a member of the Legislative Assembly nor the Legislative Council, has to be elected to either house within six months of assuming office, according to the law.Since Uttarakhand does not have a bicameral system, Rawat, who was appointed in March amid fierce dissent against former chief minister Trivendra Rawat, had time till September to be elected to the assembly. According to the official quoted above, either the state or the chief minister has to petition the poll panel to conduct elections that are necessary to meet the constitutional requirements. “The election commission can hold by-elections even if the general elections are less than a year away. There is no rule barring it. But in case there is a situation like Uttarakhand where the chief minister’s continuation in office depends on the bypoll, the state has to petition the poll panel which will then take a call on the elections,” the official said. A similar situation was witnessed in 2020 when Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was required to be elected to either the assembly or the legislative council. Since elections were then put on hold in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was pressure from the state government to relax restrictions to allow the elections. Thackeray, who was eventually elected unopposed, had even sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention in the matter. Earlier, Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari had not acted on the state cabinet’s recommendation that Thackeray be nominated to the legislative council. BJP functionaries could not be reached for a comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plea-filed-to-ec-for-bypoll-u-khand-govt-official-101625251970658.html
03-07-2021||India||A sudden leadership change not new to Uttarakhand||A likely change in leadership in Uttarakhand, following the resignation of chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Friday, is reminiscent of the 2007-2012 period when the state saw a change in the role on three occasions.In 2007, B C Khanduri was elected as the chief minister but continued only for 841 days (more than two years) in office. In 2009, he was replaced by now Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal who stayed in office for 805 days (more than two years) till 2011. In September that year, Khanduri made a comeback to serve for another 184 days in the top job. “The state came into being in 2000, but has had only one chief minister - Congress’s ND Tiwari - who completed a full term. Between 2012 and 2017, Vijay Bahuguna was in the chief minister’s chair for about more than a year. He was replaced by Harish Rawat who completed three stints as chief minister; there was also President’s rule for 25 days in between,” a BJP state functionary said, wishing not to be named.While former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, who was voted to power in February 2017, resigned in March this year amid fierce dissent BJP cadre, Tirath stepped down from the post on Friday. A second party functionary said the frequent changes could affect the party’s performance in the state election.“If the current chief minister is replaced because of a technical reason, it will be difficult to convince the people that he was removed for administrative purposes. It gives the opposition ammunition against the BJP,” the functionary said on condition of anonymity. Incidentally, there is speculation that Pokriyal is also in the list of contenders for the top post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-sudden-leadership-change-not-new-to-uttarakhand-101625251850675.html
03-07-2021||India||Tirath’s tenure as CM ends in just 4 months||Tirath Singh Rawat resigned as chief minister of Uttarakhand on Friday after a four-month stint marred by controversy, including allowing the Mahakumbh during a devastating surge in Covid infections, and large-scale fraud in testing during the holy event.The 57-year-old leader’s resignation came days after he was summoned to Delhi by the BJP leadership and met Union home minister Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda. The hill state goes to the polls in early 2022. Rawat suggested he resigned because the Election Commission was unlikely to hold by-elections due to Covid-19. An EC official, however, indicated that no request was made to hod a bypoll, and suggested there were precedents that may have permitted it.A CM, if not a member of the assembly, needs to be elected within six months of assuming the post – a process that was seen as tough for two reasons: the EC does not typically hold bypolls to vacant constituencies (a possible route he could have taken) when the assembly’s term ends in less than a year, and holding an election amid Covid-19 would be risky.“I must express my gratitude to the party’s central leadership which has given many responsibilities from time to time. I have been MLC, MLA, MP, party state president and recently chief minister. I thank my party president JP Nadda, home minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the core of my heart,” he said after submitting his resignation to the governor. State BJP president Madan Kaushik said the party legislative party will meet at 3pm on Saturday and decide on the new leader. “The new leader will be an MLA”, he said Rawat arrived in Delhi on Wednesday and met Nadda and Shah. On Friday, he met Nadda for a second time before arriving back in Uttarakhand, where he hurriedly called a press conference in the evening. At the briefing, he listed achievements of his short tenure. A little before 11.30pm, he reached the Governor’s residence and submitted his resignation. Rawat’s is the shortest term for an Uttarakhand CM. State BJP president Madan Kaushik said the legislative party will meet at 3pm on Saturday and decide on a new leader. “The new leader will be an MLA”, he said. Separately, in Delhi, functionaries in the central BJP said Narendra Singh Tomar will be the central observer at the meeting. The BJP has 56 MLAs in the 70-member house. Rawat, who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Garhwal in 2019, was elevated as the ninth CM of the hill state in March after his predecessor, Trivendra Singh Rawat, resigned due to infighting in the state unit. In his short term, Rawat quickly courted controversy with his critical views on women’s clothing and saying that the waters of the Ganga could prevent infections. He also allowed the Mahakumbh to go ahead in Haridwar without any restrictions in April despite doctors warning that lack of social distancing and violation of Covid norms could trigger a surge in cases across the country.In all, 9.1 million people took the holy dip – at least six million of them in April, coinciding with the peak of the second wave – and officials in many other north Indian states traced local infection surges to Kumbh returnees. The Uttarakhand high court sharply criticised the government for green-lighting the event. A month later, a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests, and cast a shadow on the role of the mela authorities and local administration. Facing mounting pressure from Opposition and some members of his party, Rawat said the irregularities occurred before his tenure, prompting a sharp denial from Trivendra Rawat. The controversies were likely to hurt the BJP’s prospects of securing a second consecutive term in assembly elections just months away. “Because of the vested interest of leaders of BJP, the future of Uttarakhand has become uncertain and people of the state are suffering. BJP doesn’t care about the development of state but only for how to grab the power by any means,” said Congress state general secretary Vijay Saraswat. According to an EC official who asked not to be named, either the state or the chief minister has to petition the poll panel to conduct elections that are necessary to meet the constitutional requirements. “The election commission can hold by-elections even if the general elections are less than a year away. There is no rule barring it. But in case there is a situation like Uttarakhand where the chief minister’s continuation in office depends on the bypoll, the state has to petition the poll panel which will then take a call on the elections,” the official said. Political commentators said the change of a CM for the second time in a year could dent BJP’s electoral prospects when polls take place next year. SMA Kazmi, a Dehradun-based political analyst, said the resignation could further increase political instability and various equations between Kumaon and Garhwal regions would have to be reset on the basis of region and Thakur-Brahmin axis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiraths-tenure-as-cm-ends-in-just-4-months-101625251791652.html
03-07-2021||India||Armed forces must keep their guard up in Ladakh: Bipin Rawat||Chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Friday said the Indian armed forces should stay prepared for any misadventure by the Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh and respond as needed.“We have to keep our guard up, remain prepared and not take things lightly. We must also be prepared for any misadventure and respond accordingly. We have responded in the past and will do so in the future,” Rawat said.His comments came during a seminar organised by the Global Counter Terrorism Council. Rawat said negotiations were on with China at the political, diplomatic and military levels to resolve the border row.“This will take time and in a gradual manner we should be able to achieve status quo because if you do not achieve status quo and remain in this kind of position it could lead to misadventure at some time. Both nations understand that returning status quo is in the best interest of peace and tranquillity,” Rawat said.The Indian and Chinese armies began negotiations to resolve the border row in eastern Ladakh exactly a year ago, but the two sides have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers deployed at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6, 2020 to reduce tensions along the disputed border.The only significant outcome of the military dialogue has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry in the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February after the ninth round of talks.“There is suspicion on both sides because while the other side has deployed their forces and created infrastructure, we are not lagging behind. We have also moved a large number of troops and resources. So some kind of suspicion is there on both sides as to what can happen. This will take time and in a gradual manner we should be able to achieve status quo,” Rawat said.He said China had realised that Indian armed forces can’t be taken lightly.“They are no longer the armed forces of 1962. This is a strong armed force and not a pushover. They will stand up to what they are worth. That is what has been realised. They (China) also have to create capacities and capabilities to deal with a strong military,” Rawat said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said nothing had changed at the LAC after the February disengagement. He said China was building infrastructure on its side.“We are aware what kind of Chinese assets are based where...They have spent a lot of energy in building infrastructure at many of their airfields and it is defensive in nature as they have analysed as to what all can be hit by us quickly in case the situation requires. They are looking at covering deficiencies and bringing in more efficiency in their air operations,” he said.Bhadauria said the IAF was also building its capabilities in the sector.“We are doing our own upgrades in exercises, sensors, weapons, new integrations…We are much more capable than what we were one year back. We have not maintained status quo on our capability,” the IAF chief added.Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.The Indian Army’s focus is on resolving outstanding problems with the PLA at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang, but the disengagement process has hit a wall as a result of the PLA’s reluctance to pull back its forward deployed troops and restore the status quo ante of April 2020, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-must-keep-their-guard-up-in-ladakh-rawat-101625251550584.html
03-07-2021||India||Probe into Agra hospital case not over: Deputy CM||Agra: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister and minister of higher education, Dinesh Sharma, assured on Friday that strict action would be taken against Sri Paras Hospital if it were found guilty in the final report. According to him, the FIR has been lodged against the owner doctor and license of the hospital has been suspended. To note, Sri Paras hospital hit the headlines recently after a video went viral, In which the owner doctor admitted to allegedly conducting a ‘mock drill’ on patients to check their oxygen dependence, after which 22 patients turned ‘blue’ and were ‘eliminated’. “The probe against the hospital has not ended and only a preliminary report has surfaced. Still, action has been taken against the hospital and it has been sealed. FIR has been lodged against the owner doctor and license of the hospital has been suspended. Further action will be taken if the hospital is found at fault in the final report,” Sharma said. On Sri Paras Hospital being given Covid hospital status in the second wave despite being sealed for anomalies in the first wave, the deputy chief minister said that as the second wave was more intense, the priority was to have more hospitals to save corona patients. Regarding vaccine shortage affecting pace of inoculation in the state, Sharma stated that sufficient number of vaccines were being made available. “Yet, in case there is some shortage, it would be fulfilled in a day or two wherever it occurs. For Agra district also, sufficient quota of vaccines has been sanctioned like other districts,” he said. “ Some political leaders made efforts to spread confusion about vaccines but fortunately the people of Uttar Pradesh did not fall for false propaganda and are now turning up for vaccination in smart numbers, even in rural areas,” he said. “Screening committees are moving in 97,000 revenue villages in the state and are even making medicines available to villagers at home. The emphasis on ‘’Triple T’ i.e. Tracing, Testing and Treatment continues and there is positive outcome in villages after these initiatives,” Sharma said. “In apprehension of a third wave, pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are being prepared. Oxygen plants are coming up at community health centres and primary health centres are being strengthened by making medicines available for the common man,” he said. In reply to another question, the deputy CM said no groups or alliances had succeeded against the BJP and even in the past, such combinations failed to stop the party which had done a lot under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath.

03-07-2021||India||Sidhu takes dig at Punjab CM over power cuts||Chandigarh: Former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu attacked his rival, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on Friday over widespread power shortages in the state, indicating that infighting was rife in the Congress state unit despite two months of troubleshooting by the party leadership. Sidhu said Punjab was buying electricity at higher than national average prices, alleged mismanagement by state authorities, and called for contracts signed by the previous Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government to be cancelled. His criticism of Singh and his own party’s government came amid protests by Opposition parties, farmers and consumer groups over hours-long power cuts and high tariffs. “There is no need for power cuts in Punjab or for the chief minister to regulate office timings or AC use of the common people ... If we act in the right direction,” said Sidhu, Facing spiralling protests, Singh on Thursday announced emergency measures, including reducing government work hours, curtailing supply to industries, and appealing to people to limit the use of air-conditioners. The attack by Sidhu came two days after he met former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. In interviews last week, he called Singh a “liar” and “corrupt”, prompting a three-member Congress panel, set up to resolve differences in the state unit, to say that they will talk to the cricketer-turned-politician. Punjab goes to the polls in early 2022, and power supply is likely to be a major poll issue. On June 28, Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised free electricity up to 300 units to each household and round-the-clock power supply in Punjab, if his party wins the state polls.Capt Amarinder, who holds the power portfolio, did not respond to Sidhu’s remarks. However, senior party leader Raj Kumar Verka said that power shortage was caused by sudden surge in demand due to delayed monsoon and record heatwave, and would not last more than two-three days. “A number of steps have been taken and things are already improving,” the three-time MLA said.Sidhu, the Amritsar East MLA, quit the Punjab cabinet in 2019 after his portfolio was changed from local bodies to power and new and renewable energy. In a series of tweets, Sidhu said he was sharing the truth of power costs, cuts, power purchase agreements and how to give free and 24-hour power to the people of the state. Sidhu said that Punjab was buying power at an average cost of ₹4.54 per unit whereas the national average was ₹3.85 per unit. He alleged the state was overly dependent on three private thermal plants. “The (previous) Badal Govt signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with 3 private thermal power plants in Punjab. Till 2020, Punjab has already paid 5,400 crore due to faulty clauses in these agreements and is expected to pay 65,000 crore. People’s money is just fixed charges,” he tweeted. Advising the state to purchase power from the national grid at much cheaper rates, he said the PPAs are acting against Punjab’s interest. “Punjab may not be able to renegotiate these PPAs due to them having legal protection from hon’ble courts. But there is a way forward. Punjab Vidhan Sabha can bring in new legislation with retrospective effect to cap power purchase costs to prices available on the National Power Exchange at any given time. Thus, by amending the law, these agreements will become null & void (sic),” he wrote. The legislator further stated that Punjab’s revenue per unit of consumption is one of the lowest in India, due to gross mismanagement of the complete power purchase and supply system. “Punjab State Power Corporation Limited pays Rs. 0.18 per unit extra on every unit supplied, even after receiving over 9,000 crore in subsidy from the state,” he tweeted, advising the state to harness renewable energy which is becoming cheaper and also environment friendly. Criticising Kejriwal’s promise to give 300 units of free electricity to every household, Sidhu said, “Punjab already gives 9,000 crore power subsidy but Delhi gives only 1699 crore. If Punjab copies Delhi model, we will get merely ₹1600-2000 crore as subsidy… Punjab needs an orignal Punjab Model, Not a copied model.” He added: “Punjab model for power - money spent on giving unreasonable & exuberant profits to private thermal plants should be utilised for welfare of people i.e giving power subsidy for free [ower for domestic use (upto 300 units), 24 hours supply & to invest in education & healthcare!”Tensions between Singh and Sidhu have simmered since 2019. But the bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book. The three-member panel submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi on June 10 and said she will take the final decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-takes-dig-at-punjab-cm-over-power-cuts-101625251430569.html
03-07-2021||India||Treat vaccinated Indians on par with those given jabs in E.U.: Govt||New Delhi India on Friday said it expects its vaccinated citizens to be treated on a par with those inoculated in European Union (EU) states, and the recognition of its digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates by the 27-member bloc on a reciprocal basis. The remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at a weekly news briefing came against the backdrop of 10 European countries, including eight EU members, recognising the Covishield vaccine for proof of Covid-19 vaccination for travel. Referring to the EU Digital Covid Certificate or “green pass” introduced on July 1 for exempting vaccinated people from restrictions on movement, Bagchi said: “Our expectation is that Indians who have been vaccinated through our domestic vaccination programme would be treated at par with those vaccinated in the EU and the CoWIN vaccination certificate would be recognised by the EU on a reciprocal basis.” Bagchi said India’s digital vaccination certificates can be authenticated on the CoWIN website. “We are in touch with EU member states in this regard for reciprocal acceptance. I understand that a number of EU countries have already taken positive steps in this direction,” he added. A large number of Indian students who have gained admission to educational institutions in Europe and professionals are keen to travel so that they can join classes or resume work. Questions have arisen about their ability to travel as Covishield hasn’t been approved as yet by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Covaxin is yet to be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). EU member states, however, have the option of accepting vaccines that have been approved by WHO or national authorities. Currently, EU members Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain, and Iceland and Switzerland, which aren’t in the bloc but are part of the Schengen visa regime, recognise Covishield for travel purposes. Of the EU members, only Estonia recognises both Covishield and Covaxin, the two main jabs used for India’s vaccination programme. The Indian side has informed EU member states it will follow a policy of reciprocity in recognising Covid-19 vaccines for travel, and exempt EU nationals possessing the green pass from mandatory quarantine only if the bloc recognises Covishield and Covaxin. Travel between India and Europe continues to be tightly restricted. For example, India is on the Netherlands’ list of “very high risk” areas from where travel is barred. Of the 10 European countries that recognise Covishield, India has an air bubble arrangement only with Germany, which has emerged as a key transit hub for Indian nationals. In response to other questions at the briefing, Bagchi said the government is making all efforts to augment the availability of vaccines across the country through domestic production and imports. The status of imports of specific vaccines depends on the regulatory authorities, he added. Bagchi also ruled out any immediate resumption of vaccine exports, saying, “Let me reiterate that currently, our priority remains on purposing domestic production to our domestic vaccination programme, which as you know is progressing rapidly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treat-vaccinated-indians-on-par-with-those-given-jabs-in-e-u-govt-101625251370579.html
03-07-2021||India||Covid infection spike in Kerala a cause of worry||In the seven days ending Thursday, India recorded an average of 46,243 new Covid-19 cases every day, according to the HT dashboard. Of this, 11,815 (or 26%) came from Kerala.The southern state ended Thursday with 102,523 active cases, around 20% of the total active cases in the country.And over the same seven-day period ending Thursday, Kerala’s positivity rate was 10.3%, nearly five times the national average of 2.1%.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs the number of cases in the state increases, neighbouring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have mandated fresh restrictions on people travelling from Kerala.The reasons for the virus’ trajectory in the state are not clear, and experts have called for deeper scientific study.One reason could be low community immunity: according to a sero-survey (a blood test of antibodies) conducted by the Indian Council for Medical Research in February only 11% of the state’s population had antibodies, as compared to 21% across India.Another could be variants of the original virus. The detection of a few people infected with the Delta Plus variant have added to the state’s woes. Three villages in Pathanamthitta and Palakkad have been under a so-called triple-lockdown for two weeks after the detection of Delta Plus.And still another could be carelessness. “Many flout home isolation protocols infecting family members. In rural Kerala it is quite rampant,” said Devika Rani, a health worker dealing with home quarantine patients.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan admitted on Tuesday that the progression of the second wave in the state is a matter of serious concern. “First wave we managed it well but second wave progression is very slow and it is a real concern and challenge.”To be sure, the fatality rate is still one-third the national average, but it is mired in controversy after increasing complaints about deaths not being attributed to Covid-19; the state is now auditing its death records. Hospitals and local government offices are flooded with applications to certify Covid deaths after the Supreme Court mandated some financial relief for families of the deceased.Some experts blame continued obsession with cheap antigen tests despite having a relatively high testing rate (cumulatively, the state has conducted 660,457 tests per million population, as compared to the national average of 310,790), and the recent assembly elections for the cases. They also believe the state has been lax in restrictions.“We have to be very careful while easing restrictions. We have to be cautious about the new Delta Plus variant also,” said Dr N M Arun, a public health expert from Palakkad. He was the first to point out massive underreporting of Covid deaths in the state.“No serious scientific studies are taking place. Since we have to live with the virus for some more time we have to explore it,” he added.With a high density of population (859 people per sq km) and a large number of elderly population (at least 15% are above 60 years of age) and high incidence of lifestyle diseases the state should be extra cautious, they warn.“When we point out pitfalls we are branded as those working against the interest of the state. The government should heed experts and conduct more studies on different variants of the virus,” said Dr S S Lal, another public health expert. The government will have to conduct a sero-surveillance study to identify susceptible populations and also sequence viral genomes in real time to avoid a possible third wave, he added.Opposition leader V D Satheesan added: “For everything the government cites WHO or ICMR standards but in most cases including death certification norms are against recommendations of these bodies.”And if there is a bright spot, it is the state’s record of vaccines. Kerala has thus far fully vaccinated 3.5 million people and partially vaccinated, 7.6 million. This means that the state has vaccinated 31% of its eligible population with at least one dose, compared to the national figure of 21%.There are also no signs of overcrowding or panic in hospitals. Some of the temporary first line treatment centres were closed down for want of patients and there is no shortage of oxygen. Doctors say many patients prefer home isolation and it was another reason for the rise in cases.New health minister Veena George put up a brave face saying things were moving on expected lines and there was no need for any panic. She also denied reports of deaths being underreported. “The state fatality rate is 0. 4 in the second wave also. The government has nothing to hide and those affected can file complaints of non-inclusion of Covid deaths to the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-infection-spike-in-kerala-a-cause-of-worry-101625251311083.html
03-07-2021||India||Pregnant women can now get vaccinated||Women who are pregnant can now take the coronavirus vaccine, the Union ministry of health and family welfare announced on Friday, joining the list of countries that have expanded the eligibility criteria to help protect expecting mothers and their unborn child from the viral illness. The health ministry said it made the decision on the recommendations of two expert panels: the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC). “Based on recommendations from National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), the Union Ministry of Health and family Welfare (MoHFW) today approved the vaccination of pregnant women against Covid-19… The decision has been communicated to all the States/ UTs to implement it under the ongoing National Covid Vaccination Program,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that the NEGVAG too unanimously backed the decision.The move was also declared at a ministry briefing on Friday. “The vaccine is useful for the pregnant woman and it should be given,” said Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director-general Dr Balram Bhargava.Countries such as the US, the UK, Canada and Israel have already opened up their vaccine drive to include pregnant women. The US’s Centres of Disease Control and Prevention also encourages pregnant women to get the jab, saying that the group is at a higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19 and initial studies have not identified any concerns about the safety of the shots so far. The Union health ministry also said on Friday that pregnant women, who get infected with Covid-19 and have co-morbidies, have higher chances of pre-term delivery and birth complications. Women who are expecting a child can take the vaccine at any period during their pregnancy, Dr NK Arora who heads NTAGI, said in another statement issued by the ministry. “It does not matter whether the vaccine is being given in the first, second or third trimester,” he said. Dr Arora said that every woman who is administered the jab and the foetus will be monitored for any signs of discomfort. “Foetal outcomes, that is, growth of the child in mother’s womb, will also be monitored,” he added.Earlier this week, the health ministry also released a fact-sheet advising pregnant women to take the jab and said the risks outweighed the benefits of vaccination.Dr Arora said, “One in 10 lakh (1 million) women have experienced bleeding or formation of clots. The symptoms that manifest are severe headache, vomiting along with headache, stomachache along with vomiting tendency or also breathing problems. By and large, this sort of three or four symptoms may happen and generally it happens within a period of three to four weeks after vaccination. In such cases, family members should quickly take the pregnant woman to a hospital where vaccination is done. The reason for illness can be investigated at the hospital and required treatment can be provided to her.”Previous studies have shown that mothers who were inoculated with the mRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNtech’s shots) during their pregnancy passed on the antibodies against Covid-19 to their child as well.Doctors agree that the decision has merit but said the government will have to tackle vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women. “There is great reluctance in pregnant women to take the Covid-19 vaccine... Pregnant women will be worried about the side-effects on their baby and the issues related to blood clots, etc. This needs to be addressed well,” said Dr Shivani Sachdev Gour, a Delhi-based gynaecologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-women-can-now-get-vaccinated-101625251250666.html

The operation soon turned into an encounter when the terrorists opened fire on the security personnel, killing one soldier and injuring another, the official added. After hours of gunfight, five terrorists were killed, said the official. The slain soldier has been identified asHavildar Kashi Rao of the 44 Rashtriya Rifles. A resident of Vijaypura district in Karnataka, Rao succumbed to his gunshot injuries in the chest early on Friday, the official added. The injured soldier is currently undergoing treatment. Soon after the encounter, internet services were suspended in Pulwama.This is the third encounter in Kashmir in the last four days. On June 30, three local terrorists were killed, while two soldiers sustained injuries during an encounter in Chimmer village in Kulgam district. On June 29, a Pakistani terrorist and LeT commander Nadeem Abrar Bhat were also killed in an encounter at Maloora, a day after he was arrested.The LeT commander, police said, was arrested from a checkpost in Parimpora in connection with the attack on a CRPF patrol party at Lawaypora in March this year, in which three jawans were killed. Police said Bhat was killed when he was taken to a house in Maloora by security forces to recover an AK-47 rifle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-jawan-five-let-terrorists-killed-during-pulwama-gunfight-101625251190603.html
03-07-2021||India||Centre rushes teams to 6 states with 36% cases||The Union government has rushed expert teams to six states showing an increase in Covid-19 cases of late, the health ministry said on Friday, and top officials reiterated warnings that the second wave has not receded fully and that states must bring back restrictions if infection or hospitalisation trends cross certain thresholds.The warnings come at a time when cities have recorded increased rush at markets and places of business as lockdowns are lifted. Friday’s announcements identified six states where “localised” pockets are causing concern: Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur.The six states together accounted for, on average, 36% of the daily cases seen across the country over the seven days to Thursday, with Kerala alone accounting for 26%, or 11,815new infections a day. The seven-day daily case numbers of the other five states are: Arunachal (279 cases a day), Tripura (389), Odisha (3,184), Chhattisgarh (357), and Manipur (590). As of Thursday night, these six states also accounted for 29% of the 516,378 active cases in the country. “There are 71 districts that are showing a test positivity rate of over 10%... The second wave is still not over,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, at the government’s press briefing on Covid-19 on Friday. The official added that states have been asked to identify locations where the test positivity rate is above 10% or hospital occupancy is higher than 60%, and implement strict restrictions which should be in place for at least two weeks.Aggarwal’s caution was echoed by Niti Aayog member (Health) VK Paul, who said that outbreaks must now be nipped as soon as possible. “There still are certain problematic districts that are being closely monitored. Expert teams of the health ministry have been deployed in some of these states such as Kerala, Odisha, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, etc. The pockets of outbreak that are currently visible, those need to be nipped right there as these are in localised pockets at the moment. We do not allow it to spread further,” he said.The teams sent to each state comprise two members – a clinician and a public health expert. They will assess the overall management of Covid-19, particularly testing, surveillance and containment operations, and monitor the enforcement of Covid-safe behaviour among the public. The teams will also take stock of availability of hospital beds, and of logistics such as ambulances, ventilators, and medical oxygen. They will assess the Covid-19 vaccination speed and as a whole, suggest remedial actions, the health ministry said in a statement.An analysis of case numbers from the six states identified by the government suggest that as a whole, most of these regions are not particularly logging a resurgence, but that the problem may be in particular districts. According to the University of Michigan-led COV-IND-19 Study Group, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland (not identified as one of the six states), have an effective reproduction number (R) of more than 1 – which suggests the outbreak in these regions is growing. No other state reported an R number above 1. Kerala and Maharashtra have an effective R number of 0.97 and 0.96, but the latter has recorded a consistently high test positivity rate of around 10% -- this proportion should be below 5% for an outbreak to be considered under control.Officials said that of particular concern were some pockets in the northeastern states. “Certain north-eastern states are showing increase in case load and containment is important in these states as there are many hard to reach areas in these states where health care delivery system is not as strong. Therefore, it is important to stop the spread before it grows beyond control,” said a senior central government official, who asked not to be named. Paul said close monitoring is crucial at this stage and the country “cannot lower its guard”. “As we are seeing in Europe right now, the disease transmission has started growing again, with cases having dropped to 50 per million at one point, which is now almost double,” he said. “It is in our control to ensure India doesn’t see the third wave. Even though we are fully prepared for the third wave— in rural areas, for children, overall facilities such as beds, ICUs, ventilators, oxygen, medicines, containment strategies, testing, all these preparations are in place -- our disciplined behavior will eventually decide whether a third wave will come or not,” said Paul.Experts said that along with vaccination, the behavior of people will be the key to stop the virus in its tracks. “Covid appropriate behavioural changes are required to be made in a big way; it will be crucial. Vaccination is important but since vaccinating everyone will take a lot of time, people will need to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behavior to stop the outbreak,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rushes-teams-to-6-states-with-36-cases-101625251130586.html
03-07-2021||India||Lull in monsoon may affect kharif crops, says IMD||The June-September monsoon, which is currently stalled as part of its natural stop-and-start cycles, is taking longer to revive, a delay that is “something to worry about”, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the chief of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The top meteorologist said he expected the showers to be active again by the third week of this month.The monsoon is the lifeblood of Asia’s third-largest economy, as nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area doesn’t have irrigation access and half of all Indians depend on a farm-based livelihood.“The delay (in the revival of the monsoon) is something to worry [about] because crops like paddy, which are at the transplantation stage, at this time need to be soaking in water,” said Mohapatra. He said the lull in monsoon activity stretched longer than expected.The rain-bearing system also replenishes more than 80 nationally important reservoirs, critical for drinking, power supply, and irrigation.The country is counting on farm output to cushion some of the economic impacts of a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections. In 2020-21, when India faced a recession due to the pandemic, agriculture was the only sector to record positive growth of about 3.1%. This helped to prop up the rural economy.“In the first week of July, monsoon will remain weak, it will pick up in the second week of July and return to normal by the third week of July,” Mohapatra said. The rains started on a promising note, arriving in Kerala, their first port of call in the Indian mainland, on June 3.According to agriculture ministry data reviewed by HT, the progress in kharif sowing till June 26 lags last year’s levels. On June 26, 2021, the total summer-sown area stood at 20.2 million hectares. This is 21% lower than last year’s 25.8 million hectare sown during the corresponding period. The sowing area is sure to pick pace soon, an agriculture ministry official said, requesting anonymity. From an agriculture point of view, July rainfall is the most critical, said Jeet Singh Sandhu, vice-chancellor of the SKN Agricultural University, Jaipur. “This is the prime time of sowing. Most Kharif crops have to be sown by July 15-20. We have another 15 days. So, at present, I don’t think there’s worry. But in areas where irrigation is not available, there will be an impact,” Sandhu added.The Met department has forecast a normal monsoon for the country as a whole for the third straight year, saying rainfall would be 98% of the 50-year average. According to the IMD’s classification, rains are considered normal if they are between 96% and 104%.The Met chief said the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a global weather pattern that influences India’s monsoon, had not been favourable for a while. He added there were strong westerlies, or winds blowing in from the west, and a decrease in low-pressure formations, factors that lengthened the monsoon pause.The agriculture ministry official said there was no reason for any concern at this stage. “Pre-monsoon showers were good, so moisture levels (in soil) are good. Rains will revive soon. There is nothing to worry about,” the official said.Farmers in the food bowl states of Punjab and Haryana have come under pressure due to a lack of rain. Electricity demand has soared, resulting in long outages, forcing farmers to depend on costlier diesel to irrigate lands. “The main impact so far has been that farmers’ cost of cultivation has gone up,” said Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Punjab’s agriculture commissioner.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered government officials to curtail office timings and curb supply to certain industries with high power consumption to save crops, an official statement said.Millions of farmers rely on the monsoon to plant crops such as rice, cane, corn, soybeans, cotton, nuts, and lentils.The dry spell has triggered a heatwave across much of north India, with Punjab facing a power crisis.Nearly 32 farm unions protesting three new farm laws have asked the Punjab government to ensure farms get at least eight hours of supply by July 5, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farm union leader.According to official data, power demand shot up to a new high on June 30, touching 191.24 gigawatts (GW), higher than the previous peak demand of 189.64 GW on January 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lull-in-monsoon-may-affect-kharif-crops-says-imd-101625251070551.html
03-07-2021||India||IAF spells out concerns on theaterisation; CDS differs||Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Friday flagged concerns about the military theaterisation model, arguing that it was critical to first get the structure right, even as chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat gave out details of the plan to achieve jointness and brushed aside the reservations.Bhadauria also differed with Rawat’s assessment that IAF was “a supporting arm to the armed forces” and countered the CDS’s statement saying air power has “a huge role to play” in any integrated battle area.The differences on the military’s theaterisation plan surfaced during a seminar organised by the Global Counter Terrorism Council -- both Rawat and Bhadauria addressed separate sessions of the seminar.While the IAF’s specific reservations about the current theaterisation model were reported by HT last month, this is the first time that the two four-star officers addressed the issue publicly.Bhadauria stressed that IAF wasn’t against theaterisation, but it was critical to get it right.“We must understand that appointing CDS was a big reform. The next biggest reform is the integrated theatre commands. And it is much more complex. We are for the establishment of integrated theatre commands, but have raised issues in our internal discussions and it is about how we should do it. We must get it right,” the IAF chief said.The air force also has reservations about the division of its air assets, nomenclature of commands, leadership of theatre commands and dilution of the powers of chiefs, as reported by HT on June 21.Rawat, who spoke before Bhadauria during the seminar, said the theaterisation plan included the setting up of an integrated Air Defence Command to be led by IAF for the management of the country’s entire airspace.“The AD command will be responsible for all the things that use the airspace – aircraft, helicopters, drones, artillery shells and missiles. There is a need to coordinate anything that uses airspace because you cannot afford to have fratricide,” Rawat said.The CDS said the land-centric Western and Eastern Theatre commanders would be advised by Air Component commanders.“We are creating land-based theatres for the western and northern adversary. The IAF is not just responsible for air defence, it also has the charter of providing close air support to land forces when they undertake operations and for offensive air support in case you go into the adversary’s territory…There will be air component commanders who will be advisers to the western theatre and the northern theatre while air defence will be done by one entity as is being done today,” Rawat said.The CDS said IAF is required to provide “support” to the ground forces. “Do not forget that IAF continues to remain a supporting arm to the armed forces just as the artillery support, or engineers support the combatant arms in the army. They will be a supporting arm but they have an air defence charter and supporting the ground forces in times of operations. This is the basic charter which they have to understand,” Rawat said.The IAF chief did not agree. The air force has concerns about being treated as an adjunct rather than a joint partner in war-fighting.“It is not a supporting role. Airpower has a huge role to play. In any of the integrated battle area, it’s not an issue of support alone. And a whole lot of things go into any airpower plan that is made. Those are the issues that are under discussion,” Bhadauria said.Experts said this is unusual that military commanders are expressing their differences in public.Former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said, “We know there are some differences in how theaterisation should be carried out. It would be better if these issues are resolved behind closed doors. Airing of opinions in media glare by senior functionaries is unwarranted in such crucial matters. It will only harden positions.”The military’s theaterisation drive is aimed at integrating the capabilities of the three services and optimally utilising their resources for future wars and operations. The current plan is to have two land-centric theatre commands (Western and Eastern Theatres), one Air Defence Command, a Maritime Theatre Command and a logistics command.The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country. The Indian Army and the Indian Air Force have seven commands each, while the Indian Navy has three. Creating theatres would involve merging the existing commands (except the Northern Command).Theaterisation refers to merging specific commands of the army, navy and air force, and placing them under a theatre commander. Such theatre commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.The government expects CDS Rawat to bring about jointness among the three services by January 2023. The defence ministry and the armed forces are refining the military’s theaterisation plans through internal consultations and detailed discussions with other ministries involved before seeking the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to implement the military reform.The government has formed an eight-member panel under Rawat to fine-tune the plans and bring all stakeholders on board, especially IAF, for speedy roll-out of new joint structures.The issues under the panel’s consideration include the executing authority for theatre commands, the geographies they will control, command and control structures, budgeting, appointment of senior three-star officers who will take over as theatre commanders and placing some paramilitary forces under the commands.The CDS on Friday addressed concerns about the dilution of the powers of the chiefs and distribution of assets.“Even today the entire resources of IAF are not controlled by one agency. They have five operational commands where the entire resources of IAF are distributed. The case is the same with the army and the navy,” Rawat said.“Depending on how threat develops, reallocation of resources takes place. What we are saying is when the theatre command come ups, in the peacetime you will have to allocate resources to them and as the threat evolves, depending on where the primary threat is and where the secondary threat is, you will accordingly reallocate resources,” the CDS said.He explained how the existing system and the role of the service chiefs.“This happens even in the army. Today all the army’s resources have been distributed to the army commands. The army chief has nothing at his disposal, same thing happens in the navy. There is nothing that lies in the control of CNS. Yet all the assets belong to the three service chiefs. They are at liberty to redistribute their resources. And now in the future this will be done by the chiefs of staff committee headed by the CDS with the three service chiefs giving him advice. So it will be a collective effort where redistribution of resources will be based on threats,” Rawat said.“Now instead of three heads doing the thinking, you have four heads doing the thinking. That is all that has happened. There is no change otherwise. As far operational planning goes, that process is not undergoing a change. It is the same,” the CDS said.Rawat also said Northern Command would stay intact, as reported by HT on Friday.“We have terrorism and insurgency which is going on there. The Northern Command is one command that looks after both the fronts, the China front in Ladakh and the northern front in the Kargil sector. This is one area which will actually witness a two-front war... We have to be careful and not let our guard down. We do not want to disrupt the existing organisational structure of the Northern Command,” Rawat said.The IAF chief said with the setting up of theatre commands, the Indian military should reach the next level to project the country’s military power. “We should be able to synergise and have more flexibility. We cannot have more boundaries. So there are issues in some of the options that are being discussed and we are discussing those internally. I would not like to go to the media and describe what my concerns are,” Bhadauria said.He said the IAF was totally committed to theatre commands. “But we must get it right. And that is the focus area of all our deliberations. Issues are being looked at and there are deliberations between the three services. And that process is continuing,” the IAF chief added. .“We are of course for it (theaterisation). Wrong to say we are against it. But every service has its own doctrine, has the best knowledge of how to employ the capabilities and capacities to get the desired results. And whenever we have a system that is integrated we must look at the entire doctrine and the ability of the services must be brought in. It must be a synergised result. We are discussing. There is no need to get concerned that we will not have a solution. When you sit and talk there will always be a result,” he added.The perceived role of air forces changed after the Gulf War in 1991, and established their reputation as leading partners in warfighting. And that’s what the IAF believes itself to be. It feels the current theaterisation model will reduce its role to a secondary one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-spells-out-concerns-on-theaterisation-cds-differs-101625250950567.html
03-07-2021||India||Kerala HC refuses to quash sedition case against Lakshadweep activist||KOCHI The Kerala high court on Friday refused to quash the sedition case registered against activist-filmmaker Aisha Sultana over her remarks against Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel. Sultana moved the high court, which has jurisdiction over Lakshadweep, with a fresh plea to quash the case after she was granted anticipatory bail last week. She has also appeared before the police in Lakshadweep for questioning. A single-judge bench of justice Ashok Menon said the case cannot be quashed or stayed without hearing all parties concerned. The court has asked the Union government and the Lakshadweep administration to file detailed replies. It will hear the case next after two weeks.Police on June 11 registered the case against Sultana for an alleged remark against Patel during a TV debate.Lakshadweep’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief C Abdul Khadar Haji filed the case against her, saying the remark was in a bad taste. Sultana regretted her use of words.The Lakshadweep administration and the Centre have said Sultana’s comments were “used by many foreign journals” to show the country in a poor light.Sultana’s comments came amid protests in Lakshadweep over new rules and proposals introduced in the region. Opponents of the measures say they are “anti-people” and threaten their livelihoods. Some of the measures provide for the removal or relocation of islanders from their property for town planning and detentions without trial for up to a year. Other proposals include a ban on cow slaughter.The opponents say the measures “will affect the unique culture and tradition” of the island. They allege they will destroy the region’s character and identity as 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belongs to the protected scheduled tribe category.The administration has justified the norms saying they will boost tourism in Lakshadweep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-refuses-to-quash-sedition-case-against-lakshadweep-activist-101625215307703.html
03-07-2021||India||Drone spotted over Indian mission in Islamabad, New Delhi lodges formal protest||New Delhi A drone was spotted over the Indian high commission complex in the Pakistani capital on June 26, prompting New Delhi to formally protest to Islamabad over the security breach and to seek an investigation. The drone was seen within the complex at a time when an event was being held at the mission, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Friday. India lodged a formal protest over the incident through a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence, the people cited above said. “A drone was spotted over the premises of the Indian high commission in Islamabad on June 26 this year. This has been taken up officially with the government of Pakistan,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing. “We expect Pakistan to investigate the incident and prevent recurrence of such breach of security,” he added. Pakistan’s foreign ministry described the Indian statement about the drone being spotted over the Indian mission as a “preposterous” claim and said “no proof whatsoever has been shared with Pakistan to substantiate these allegations”. Foreign ministry spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri contended this was part of a “propaganda campaign by India” at a time when evidence collected regarding a blast in Lahore on June 23 was “increasingly pointing to external forces with a history of perpetrating state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan”. Chaudhri was referring to a car bombing near the residence of Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed that killed three people. The Indian mission is located within the fortified diplomatic enclave in Islamabad, across a key road that runs in front of Pakistan’s Foreign Office. A residential complex for staffers of the mission is located a short distance from the high commission. The entire diplomatic enclave is heavily guarded by Pakistani security forces and there is another layer of security near the Indian mission. The incident in Islamabad occurred hours before a drone attack on an Indian Air Force base at Jammu on June 27 – the first-ever offensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles to target an Indian military facility. While the IAF has officially confirmed that two low-intensity explosions took place in the technical area of Jammu air force station, senior officials and experts said the attack appeared to have been carried out using drones and marked a new chapter in Pakistan’s proxy war against India in Jammu and Kashmir. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval had raised the issue of drones being used by terrorists at the recent meeting of NSAs of the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Doval had specifically referred to the need to monitor new technologies used by terrorists including drones for smuggling of weapons. Responding to several questions on Pakistan’s possible involvement in the drone attack in Jammu and the neighbouring country’s efforts to tackle terrorism and terror financing, Bagchi noted that an investigation was in progress into the Jammu air force station case and said New Delhi expects Islamabad to take credible and irreversible action against terror networks and proxies. “As far as terrorism and terror financing are concerned, we have a zero tolerance policy. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. All countries must take credible action against terrorism, including by putting an end to cross-border movement of terrorists, [and] ending terrorist safe havens and infrastructure and their financing channels,” he said. India wants Pakistan to take “credible, verifiable and irreversible action against terrorist networks and proxies operating from territories under its control” and to bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2016 attack on Pathankot air force station, Bagchi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drone-spotted-over-indian-mission-in-islamabad-new-delhi-lodges-formal-protest-101625214287530.html
