However, there is a catch. Advanced countries will now grow at 5.6% instead of the 5.1% projection of April 2021. As is obvious, this means that the countries outside the advanced world will now grow at a lower-than-expected pace. This is yet another evidence of the pandemic’s disproportionate burden on the poor. In fact, it can now be argued that the Covid-19 pandemic has fed off existing inequalities in the world to generate more inequality.Advanced countries have further closed their growth gap with the rest of the world Between 2001 and 2010, advanced countries saw an average economic growth of 1.7%. This number was 6.2% for developing economies and emerging markets. The latter kept losing their growth advantage vis-à-vis the advanced world and the difference between GDP growth for these two groups came down to just 2 percentage points in 2015. This is a reflection of the hangover of the 2008 crisis on the world outside advanced economies, part of which was a result of slowdown in export demand from the developed world.Also Read | Cognitive bias explains the inconsistent citizen response to Covid-19While these numbers did not improve significantly thereafter, at least there was no deterioration. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic. Advanced economies suffered a bigger contraction (4.6%) than those of developing countries and emerging markets (2.1%) in 2020. However, the former have seen a relatively stronger recovery. As a result, the GDP growth gap between these two groups is now much narrower levels than it was before the pandemic. The latest WEO projections suggest that GDP growth in developing countries and emerging markets will exceed that of advanced countries by just 0.7 and 0.8 percentage points in 2021 and 2022. Advanced economies have significantly higher per capita incomes than their developing economy and emerging markets counterparts. The fact that the latter will witness a relatively slower economic growth means that inter-country inequalities have increased after the pandemic.A bigger, but also cheaper, fiscal stimulus is what drove the growth recovery in advanced economies The stronger growth rebound in advanced economies is a direct function of fiscal support by governments. Fiscal deficit numbers are a testimony to this. Fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP was 2.5% in 2018 and 3% in 2019 in advanced economies. These numbers were 3.8% and 4.7% in emerging market economies and 3.4% and 3.8% in low-income developing economies. The situation changed completely when the pandemic hit. In 2020, advanced economies ran the biggest fiscal deficit at 10.9% of GDP, a more than three-fold increase compared to the 2019 level. Emerging market economies and low-income developing economies increased their fiscal support by a much smaller margin: their deficit rose to 9.7% for the former and 5.5% for the latter group in 2020. Advanced countries are likely to enjoy a higher fiscal support in 2021 as well.One of the reasons advanced countries could run higher fiscal deficits, financed from borrowing, is that they have lower borrowing costs than their emerging market and low-income peers. For example, the interest rate on 10-year US government bonds is less than 2%. This number is more than 6% for India and more than 12% for Nigeria. When countries are borrowing to fund fiscal deficits, debt sustainability, which is also a function of borrowing costs, is always a big determinant of the fiscal stimulus a country can provide.Lag in vaccination in poorer countries will continue to generate headwinds for growth The reason Covid-19 pandemic is different from any other economic crisis is that economic recovery is also contingent on there being no fresh outbreak of infections. India’s growth forecast for 2021-22 has been cut by IMF from 12.5% to 9.5% after the second wave of infections. There was a level playing field on this count as long as vaccines for Covid were not available. This is not the situation anymore. There is a huge difference between the pace of vaccination in rich and poor countries as the later struggle with sourcing and affordability issues. Countries that placed bulk orders even before the vaccines were proven successful -- a function of resources, research ability, a well developed pharma sector, and the presence of local vaccine manufacturers -- have had an advantage over others in sourcing vaccines.According to the July WEO update of IMF, 34.7% of the population of advanced countries have been administered vaccines so far, compared to just 9.8% and 1.1% in emerging markets and low-income countries.A blog by IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath has identified vaccination progress as the critical factor behind growth upgrades and downgrades compared to the April projections. “Faster-than-expected vaccination rates and return to normalcy have led to upgrades, while lack of access to vaccines and renewed waves of COVID-19 cases in some countries, notably India, have led to downgrades”, Gopinath wrote. As of July 29, 10.4% of India’s adult population had received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, while another 26.9% had received their first dose.Employment loss has been bigger for the poor workers and poor countries An inequality in growth recovery is not the only fallout of the pandemic. In India, there has been ample evidence of what has been termed as a profit-led as opposed to a wage-led recovery. As the fear of infections and new waves persists, blue collar workers, especially in contact-intensive industries continue to suffer more than their white-collar counterparts. The latter have the luxury of working remotely.The IMF update has also underlined this fact. “Moreover, the employment recovery is highly uneven, with youth and low-skilled workers across economies and women in emerging market and developing economies remaining harder hit”, it said. “A combination of factors may explain why employment rates remain subdued. They include a continuation of the health crisis, which still prevents a full reopening, workers’ concerns about health risks in the workplace, and firms’ reluctance to hire new workers, given lingering uncertainties about the recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-covid-19-pandemic-has-fed-on-existing-inequality-to-generate-more-inequality-101627555675157.html
29-07-2021||News||The battle for UP: Assertive Yogi vs a fragmented Opposition||The battle lines for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls have been clearly drawn and defined: It’s an assertive chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath versus a divided Opposition.And while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), after months of dissent and disagreement, has closed ranks, the Opposition remains fragmented, damaging each other’s electoral prospects rather than defeating the mighty BJP.Though politics is all about imponderables, it’s getting clearer by the day that the Opposition space is becoming overcrowded with political parties making the electoral battle easier for the ruling BJP and allies, which swept the state by winning 325 of the 403 seats in 2017. The BJP had then independently polled 39.67% of votes and won 312 seats.The trust deficit in the Opposition The three prominent Opposition parties – the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress — partly share a common vote base. For instance, minorities and Dalits have been supporters of the Congress in the past and are now divided between the SP and the BSP.Also Read | Akhilesh Yadav resumes his state tour ahead of next year’s UP assembly pollsAs of now, the SP, along with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), is the front-runner in the Opposition camp, followed by the BSP and the Congress, somewhat a repeat of the 2017 tally, albeit with a difference. The SP had an ally in Congress then. The asap had contested 298 seats and the Congress, 105, of which they won 47 (21.82% votes) and seven (6.25%) seats, respectively. The BSP had won 19 of the 403 seats contested.Although the Congress has started making some feeble noises about its search for a poll partner, severe mistrust prevails between the three prominent groups and it stems from their bitter experience of recent alliances.In the 2017 elections, the SP and the Congress’s tie-up was touted as the coming together of two young leaders – Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi. The alliance miserably failed as their camaraderie before the camera did not reflect in the field.Similarly, in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati’s decision to sink their decades-old differences to form a mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) took the political world by storm. But it did not translate into votes with SP leaders accusing the BSP of betraying their trust. While the BSP gained, the SP felt it had suffered huge losses. For its part, the BSP felt that the alliance had electorally helped the SP but SP’s votes didn’t transfer to BSP candidates.Besides, there are smaller parties, with pockets of caste or regional influence, threatening to taking away a chunk of Opposition votes if there is no deal with either the SP or the BSP.Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha includes nine smaller parties. These are the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) of Om Prakash Rajbhar, Jan Adhikar Party led by Babu Singh Kushwaha, Rashtriya Uday Party of Babu Rampal, Rashtriya Upekshit Samaj Party of Premchanda Prajapati and Janata Kranti Party of Anil Singh Chauhan. Om Prakash Rajbhar, chief of SBSP, made an effort to rope in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also, but was rebuffed.Opposition’s base, on the groundMaulana Zulfiqar Ali of All India Imam Association, Muzaffarnagar, is a worried man because of the religious divide. He contends that though Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra fought for the minorities, who were allegedly subjected to atrocities during the five-year BJP rule, the Congress remains a weak party.According to him, the fight will narrow down between the BJP and the SP, as the Muslims have seen Owaisi’s role in Bihar and West Bengal. His statement comes in the background of the speculations about Owaisi’s growing influence over younger Muslims.Also Read | Success of Brahmin conferences has left oppn worried: MayaAli says Tejashwi Yadav lost Bihar because of Owaisi, who — Ali claims — defeated Yadav in 25 seats and won five. But in West Bengal, Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee formed the government as Muslims, according to Ali, could see through Owaisi’s game.Om Prakash Rajbhar twice met Akhilesh Yadav for an alliance for the 2017 polls. However, the talks ran into trouble because of Owaisi, who is also a member of their front. He said the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha is open to an alliance with SP or BSP. But Mayawati has already ruled out an alliance with smaller parties, though she also faces challenges from Bhim Army in West UP.SK Dwivedi, former head of the political science department at Lucknow University, told HT that the major political parties cannot ignore the role of smaller parties in garnering votes.Rajesh Singh from Gorakhpur feels that people are on the lookout for a viable political alternative, the question is the presence of the Opposition. According to him, a divided Opposition is not a matter of concern as people do pick their best option. Akhilesh Yadav will have to assert himself and be that alternative.Nonetheless, the battle will be ugly, with mudslinging campaigns from both sides, much of which will be fought on social media and have a communal and political subtext. SP workers in Agra were booked for allegedly raising Pakistan Zindabad slogans during their statewide protest against the misuse of official machinery in the block pramukh elections. And a day after Priyanka Gandhi Vadra arrived in the state capital and staged a dharna, Lucknow police lodged cases against state Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and 600 workers for violating Covid-19 protocols and police restrictions.State Congress President Lallu told HT that as many as 100 cases have been slapped against him in the last year and a half. Besides about 20,000 party workers have been jailed for three months in this short period. But, he said, “We will continue to strengthen our organisation and raise voice against oppression of any kind.”The BJP’s script The electoral battle has already started with Prime Minister Narendra Modi blowing the bugle from his constituency of Varanasi, where he also gave a clear message by endorsing the CM’s performance and governance of the state. A few days later, the BJP’s national president JP Nadda did the same, in a way silencing the CM’s detractors within the party who, till then, were insisting that, like the 2017 assembly polls, Modi will be the face of the party in the elections.It may be recalled here that barring Modi, the BJP hoardings did not carry any other face – in some constituencies, not even of the candidate. It was the party symbol and Modi. Thus, the election was fought without a CM face.June 2021 saw a lot of drama with senior BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders holding brainstorming sessions in the party office amid rising voices against the government’s handling of the Covid-19 second wave. Many lawmakers also protested against the CM’s purported style of functioning.But those who were hoping for a change of leadership were snubbed by the prime minister, who while condemning “mafia raj” and “bhai bhatija vaad” of earlier regimes, lauded the CM for following the policy of vikasvaad (development), changing the political discourse in his party from the change of leadership to certifying Adityanath and his performance.Till the PM-CM meeting in Delhi on July 9, speculation was rife about Delhi’s plan to clip the CM’s wings by inducting Modi’s close aide AK Sharma, former bureaucrat-turned-politician, in the state cabinet or moving the CM to the Centre as then the Union Cabinet expansion exercise was on.What transpired between the PM and the CM is not known, but many feel that the CM might have presented his report card and asserted his ability to win UP for the party or could have even offered to resign instead of shifting his base from Lucknow to Delhi.The fact remains that the BJP cannot afford to have a sulking Adityanath who has not only emerged as an icon of Hindutva, but has cultivated a strong base amongst Rajputs and Hindu hardliners. And now he is the party’s face in the elections.However, the party high command is concerned about the caste calculus which they tried to set right by inducting backward castes in the Cabinet. Yet, some castes such as Brahmins and Nishads are still feeling neglected. Adityanath may go for a Cabinet expansion even though the new ministers will get the position for a few months with the huge responsibility of mobilising their respective castes in the polls than governing the state.As political analyst SK Srivastava told HT, the BJP won the 2017 assembly elections with the support of the non-Yadav backward castes, non-Jatav Dalits, as well as upper-caste Brahmins and Rajputs. The BJP leaders were now working to retain the support of these caste groups by wooing their leaders, he said.As the UP battle intensifies, the current landscape is marked by this contest between an emboldened Yogi Adityanath and a fragmented Opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-battle-for-up-assertive-yogi-vs-a-fragmented-opposition-101627547034615.html
29-07-2021||News||Bommai Senior and the legal foundations of a historic verdict||As Basavaraj Bommai takes charge of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) government in Karnataka, his anointment has also achieved a rare feat. This is the second time in Karnataka’s political history that a father-son duo have held the chief minister (CM)’s post. Basavaraj’s father SR Bommai became the CM in 1988 in the wake of then CM Ramakrishna Hedge resigning over snooping charges. The other father-son duo to have achieved this feat are Janata Dal (Secular) supremo and former Prime Minister, HD Deve Gowda, and his son, HD Kumaraswamy. Apart from the political feat, Basavaraj’s appointment also brings the focus back on a legacy in law that has been associated with his father, SR Bommai for almost three decades now. Senior Bommai’s name is synonymous with one of the most important cases in the judicial history of the country when it comes to polity and governance, Centre-State relationship and imposition of President’s Rule. Also Read | As Basavaraj Bommai rises, how his father changed the course of Indian politics“Awesome” is not a word routinely used in Supreme Court judgments. But when the nine-judge Constitution Bench sat down to deliver the historic verdict in Bommai’s case, it called the authority under the Constitution for imposing President’s Rule an “awesome power indeed”. It is the apex court’s judgment in SR Bommai Vs Union of India, delivered in March 1994, that defined the contours of Article 356 of the Constitution, which allows for President’s Rule in states, and acknowledged various perplexing issues in the realm of Centre-State relations. It laid down legal principles for a lawful and valid exercise of the power under Article 356, while underscoring the federal structure and roles of the President and Governor. Who was SR Bommai? In 1985, the Janata Party won the assembly elections in Karnataka and Ramakrishna Hegde became the CM. Hegde had to leave the throne following the snooping charges and he was replaced by SR Bommai, also of the Janata Party, in 1988. A few months later that year, Janata Party merged with Lok Dal, forming the Janata Dal, and 13 new ministers were inducted into Bommai’s cabinet. However, some legislators defected from the party and presented a letter to Governor P Venkatasubbaiah stating their decision to withdraw support to the Bommai government. In April 1989, the Governor sent a report to the Centre recommending President’s Rule citing breakdown of constitutional machinery, as provided under Article 356. This report was sent despite the Governor receiving 19 letters from Bommai asking for an opportunity to prove his party’s majority in the assembly. Bommai had also the presented him with a copy of the resolution passed by the Janata Dal legislature party in his support but the Governor chose not to pay heed to the demand of a floor test. Later that month, the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the Centre dismissed Bommai’s government using Article 356, without giving Bommai a chance to prove his majority, and imposed President’s Rule. Bommai challenged the proclamation of President’s Rule and the Governor’s report in this regard before the Karnataka high court but to no avail. He subsequently challenged this before the Supreme Court that noted substantial constitutional issues were involved in the matter, warranting interpretation of legal provisions and issuance of pertinent guidelines. What were other instances before the Supreme Court in Bommai’s case? When the nine-judge bench set about to examine the validity of proclamation for the state of Karnataka, it also scrutinised similar proclamations for some other states too. In 1988, the Nagaland government was dismissed on the basis of a report sent by the Governor to the President. The Governor had cited horse-trading and relationship of some legislators with the insurgents as chief reason for imposition of the President’s Rule. In October 1991, the President issued a proclamation dismissing the Meghalaya government on grounds of unconstitutional governance. The assembly was dissolved immediately after. After the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992, the Centre dismissed not just the government of Uttar Pradesh, but also the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh. In Bommai’s case, the top court highlighted frequency of using Article 356 to dismiss governments in states and Union territories. Up to 1991, President’s Rule in states had been imposed on 82 occasions by invoking or resorting to Article 356, and on 13 occasions, President’s Rule had been imposed in union territories. On 23 of a total of these 95 occasions, assemblies were dissolved on the advice of the CMs or due to their resignations. Issues in Bommai’s case and the six judgmentsThe nine-judge bench ruled on three chief issues.One, is the Proclamation issued by the President under Article 356 amenable to judicial review? Two, if yes, what is the scope of judicial review in this respect? And three, what is the meaning of the expression “A situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution” used in Article 356(1)? Of the nine judges on the Supreme Court Bench that heard the matter, six authored separate judgments, adjudicating on various aspects of the issues raised. But all were unanimous that the use of Article 356 was not untouchable for the constitutional courts and was indeed amenable to judicial review. Justice P B Sawant, writing for himself and Justice Kuldip Singh, rejected the argument that the President had unrestricted power to issue proclamation under Article 356: “If… pluralist democracy and the unity and integrity of the country are to be preserved, judiciary… is the only institution which can act as the saviour of the system and of the nation,” they held. Describing democracy and federalism to be parts of the basic structure of the Constitution, the judges maintained that the power vested de jure in the President but de facto in the Council of Ministers under Article 356 has all the latent capacity to emasculate the two basic features of the Constitution. “Hence, it is necessary to scrutinise the material on the basis of which the advice is given and the President forms his satisfaction more closely and circumspectly… Such scrutiny will also be within the judicially discoverable and manageable standards,” they ruled. The judges further asserted that the federal principle, social pluralism and pluralist democracy, which form the basic structure of our Constitution, demand that the judicial review of the proclamation issued under Article 356 is not only an imperative necessity but is a stringent duty and the exercise of power under the said provision is confined strictly for the purpose and to the circumstances mentioned therein and for none else. “It also requires that the material on the basis of which the power is exercised is scrutinised circumspectly...any situation short of (total constitutional breakdown) does not empower the issuance of the proclamation,” the judges said. Justice SR Pandian wrote that Article 356 should be used very sparingly and only when President is fully satisfied that a situation has arisen where the government of a state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. “Otherwise, the frequent use of this power and its exercise are likely to disturb the constitutional balance. Further if the Proclamation is freely made, then the Chief Minister of every State who has to discharge his constitutional functions will be in perpetual fear of the axe of Proclamation falling on him...,” held justice Pandian. On his part, Justice K Ramaswamy cautioned that Article 356 should never be used for political gain or to get rid of an inconvenient state government. Frequent elections would belie people’s faith in the parliamentary system, he said, and warned that loss of belief in the democratic process would sound the death-knell for the parliamentary system. Justice JS Verma, authoring a separate judgment for himself and Justice Yogeshwar Dayal, said: “The facts which attract the legal fiction that the constitutional machinery has failed are specified and their existence is capable of objective determination. It is, therefore, reasonable to hold that the cases falling under Article 365 are justiciable.” Justice AM Ahmadi, in his judgment, held: “To exercise power under the said provision and to dissolve the State Assemblies solely on the ground of a new political party having come to power at the Centre with a sweeping majority would, to say the least, betray intolerance on the part of the Central Government clearly basing the exercise of power under Article 356(1) on considerations extraneous to the said provision and, therefore, legally mala fide.” He added that the power conferred by Article 356 is of an extraordinary nature that must be exercised in grave emergencies. The judge clarified that that a proclamation for emergency can be challenged on the limited ground that the action is mala fide or ultra vires of Article 356 itself. Justice BP Reddy, writing for himself and Justice SC Agrawal, proceeded to hold that not only a constitutional court had the power to examine a proclamation for emergency but it would also be open to the court to restore a state government to its office in case it strikes down the proclamation as unconstitutional. “If this power were not conceded to the court, the very power of judicial review would be rendered nugatory and the entire exercise meaningless,” they said. The two judges further noted that when a proclamation is challenged by making out a prima facie case with regard to its invalidity, the burden would be on the Union government to satisfy that there existed sufficient material to impose President’s Rule. In appropriate cases, the court will have power to restrain the holding of fresh elections to the Assembly as an interim measure to ensure a legal challenge to a proclamation is not defeated through an election. Floor test to prove majorityBommai’s judgment unequivocally laid down the supremacy of the floor test in determining the support enjoyed by the party in power. Justices Reddy and Agrawal held that in cases where a government is alleged to have lost majority, a floor test is the valid method of proving majority. The judges said: “Wherever a doubt arises whether the council of ministers has lost the confidence of the House, the only way of testing it is on the floor of the House except in an extraordinary situation where because of all-pervasive violence, the Governor comes to the conclusion and records the same in his report that for the reasons mentioned by him, a free vote is not possible in the House.” The two judges wrote extensively on the necessity of a floor test before the Governor makes any recommendation under Article 356. “If only one keeps in mind the democratic principle underlying the Constitution and the fact that it is the legislative assembly that represents the will of the people and not the Governor the position would be clear beyond any doubt,” said the judges, holding that the floor test is obligatory. The judgment ruled in favour of Bommai and the proclamation was struck down for being malafide and unconstitutional. However, by the time the judgment came, elections had since been held to the legislative assembly of Karnataka and a new House had come into being. The judgment still resonates Bommai’s ruling prescribes important constitutional guarantees against the abuse of Article 356 and for the maintenance of the federal structure. Bommai’s judgment has earned the distinction of being the most quoted verdict in the country’s political history, and continues to resonate in contemporary times. Take just a few recent instances. This judgment was relied upon by the Supreme Court in 2016 while restoring the Nabam Tuki Government in Arunachal Pradesh and criticising the Governor for “humiliating the elected Government of the day”.In the same year, the central Government imposed President’s Rule in Uttarakhand just a day before chief minister Harish Rawat was to take a trust vote to prove his majority. The Centre justified its actions on the basis of a sting operation showing Rawat allegedly indulging in bribery with some of the legislators. But the Supreme Court, citing Bommai’s case, ordered a floor test, which ultimately led the dismissed government being reinstated. In May 2018, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) approached the Supreme Court against the order of Karnataka Governor to allow BJP’s BS Yeddyurappa to form the government in the state. Lending credence to Bommai’s judgment, the court, after a pre-dawn hearing, ordered an immediate floor test. Yeddyurappa later resigned on the floor of the House without facing the floor test. Similarly, in November 2019, the top court ordered a floor test on a petition by Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-Congress alliance which complained against the manner in which Devendra Fadnavis took power, in a secretive oath ceremony. Fadnavis resigned hours later and the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance formed government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/bommai-senior-and-the-legal-foundations-of-a-historic-verdict-101627539473703.html
29-07-2021||News||As Basavaraj Bommai rises, how his father changed the course of Indian politics||The elevation of Basavaraj Bommai as the Bharatiya Janata Party’s chief minister (CM) in Karnataka is an occasion to commemorate his late father and predecessor in the office, SR Bommai, who was ousted in 1989 on being denied a fair chance to prove his majority in the assembly.President’s rule was imposed in the state when governor P Venkatasubbaiah refused the senior Bommai a floor test. Pressing home the discretion then available to the Centre’s agent, the governor also rejected a resolution of the Janata Dal legislature party in the CM’s support. To claim a majority, the party communiqué accounted for the return of several legislators who had earlier defected.Justice was delivered five years later, not as much to Bommai, who couldn’t be retrospectively rehabilitated to the position from which he was ejected, but for succeeding generations of democratically elected CMs and their dispensations. The law enumerated by a nine-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court (SC) has since stood in the name of the new Karnataka CM’s father.Also Read | Bommai remains tight lipped on new cabinet, says decision after Delhi visitOften referred to as the (SR) Bommai case, it makes floor tests mandatory in disputes over numbers commanded by an existing regime; the process is as much applicable when elections throw up a hung House. The court’s simultaneous decree that the President’s powers in the matter weren’t absolute, made proclamations under Article 356 justiciable.The loss of a majority or the numbers flaunted by rival claimants to power couldn’t be decided any more in the confines of Raj Bhawans. The proof of the pudding, so to speak, was in democracy’s kitchen, which is the legislature. It was that judicial recipe which had Basavaraj’s benefactor and the outgoing CM, BS Yediyurappa first lose, and then wrest power, vis a vis the post-poll Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress alliance on May 19, 2018 and July 24, 2019 respectively.In the first instance, the SC intervened when a friendly governor, Vajubhai Vala gave Yediyurappa a partisan 15-day window to prove his majority despite clear signs of the numbers stacked against him in the House with an effective strength of 221. Asked to prove his majority the next day, the CM resigned rather than take the trust vote, leading to the fall of his three-day-old BJP government.The roles were reversed a year later when a clutch of legislators from the JD (S) and the Congress switched loyalty to the Lingayat strongman.Senior Bommai was twice unluckyForever a gentleman politician, the senior Bommai was a follower of MN Roy. He had strong views on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideology.A couple of years after winning the historic court battle, he was close to becoming the prime minister when the Congress withdrew support in 1997 to the United Front regime of a fellow Kannadiga, HD Deve Gowda. Amid the search for a substitute, Bihar’s Lalu Prasad Yadav acked Bommai’s candidature when the influential Marxist leader, HS Surjeet, pitched for Uttar Pradesh’s Mualayam Singh Yadav. In the end, the Yadav chieftains cancelled each other out, paving the way for Inder Gujral. Bommai for his part continued as human resource development minister in both short-lived United Front governments.It was some happy coincidence for Bommai and Lalu Prasad when the Rabri Devi government of Rashtriya Janata Dal was reinstated on March 8, 1999 after being dismissed in February the same year by the AB Vajpayee-led Centre. The salvation lay in the SC’s Bommai case judgement which, while holding that the President’s powers weren’t absolute, made a regime’s dismissal contingent on its approval by both Houses of Parliament. As the ruling National Democratic Alliance lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress stepped in to revive the Rabri regime in Bihar.Judgement put Centre-State relations on even keel That Rabri government’s resurrection was the first proof, if one was required, of the judgement being a milestone in Centre-State relations that constitute the core of the Constitution’s federal features.The March 11, 1994 Bommai verdict had laid down a framework of restrictions for sending a state government packing. The judgment counted the number of times regime-dismissals were triggered between 1950-91 through proclamations under article 356 of the constitution and section 51 of the government of union territories act, 1963.The 41 years of the Republic, it noted, saw President’s rule being imposed on 95 occasions in states and UTs. Out of these, the assemblies were dissolved 23 times on the CM’s advice/resignation and, on 18 occasions, the suspended houses were revived.“We may hasten to add that the proclamations were made on different occasions on the advice of the council of ministers of the central government belonging to different political complexions,” wrote Justice Ratnavel Pandian in a separate but concurring judgement. He said some of the states (where assemblies were) dissolved “valiantly fought, honourably bled and pathetically lost their legal battle”.The case thus made out was that powers under 356 should be used “very sparingly” and only when the President was “fully satisfied” that a situation has arisen when a state cannot be run in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. “Otherwise, the frequent use of this power and its exercise are likely to disturb the constitutional balance leaving the CM of every state in the perpetual fear of the axe of proclamation falling on him.”In a separate judgment, Justice AM Ahmadi referred to the Constituent Assembly debates in which parallels were drawn between the emergency powers of the British governor General and governors under the colonial era Government of India Act, 1935 and those vested in the Republic’s President under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution.BR Ambedkar’s response to these apprehensions was that while he shared the sentiments, the “proper thing we ought to expect is that such articles will never be called into operation and that they would remain a dead letter. I hope the President who is endowed with all these powers, will take proper precaution before actually suspending the administration of the provinces.“Against this backdrop and the fact of Article 356 having been invoked over 90 times, Justice Ahmadi concluded that Ambedkar’s hope (that in rarest of rare cases only there will be an occasion to invoke the emergency provisions) stood belied. “What was therefore expected to be a dead letter has in fact become an oft-invoked provision,” he wrote while desisting from inquiring into the circumstance that led to frequent resort to the use of emergency powers by the President.The law was interpreted therefore to suit a polity divided on party lines. It has broadly served the purpose but a lot more needs to be done, by way of political consensus or judicial diktat, to keep the sanctity of popular mandates. The Constitution’s unitary plinth must not cloud its federal visage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/as-basavaraj-bommai-rises-how-his-father-changed-the-course-of-indian-politics-101627534313130.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Wardha saw 11 ‘no Covid vaccination’ days in July||While the state is being appreciated nation-wide for administering over 47 million vaccine doses, the highest in the nation, a few districts are lagging behind in vaccination, with Wardha topping the list. Data from the state shows Wardha is the only district to record zero immunisation on 11 days in July. The public health department has attributed it to unavailability of vials. An analysis of the data shows the district is recording severe inconsistency in vaccination since July 9. This has turned into a nightmare for residents who either have to return without vaccination as the centres remain closed or wait for hours in a queue to get inoculated due to overcrowding. On July 1, 1,481 vaccinations were recorded, which dropped to 177 on July 3. It increased to 1,483 on July 4 and jumped to 5,464 on July 5. The next day, 3,206 vaccines were administered, which dropped to 34 on July 7. On July 8, as many as 11,970 people were inoculated. But for the next three days, the district registered zero vaccination. On July 12, 13,454 inoculations were done— the highest recorded so far in July. The next two days, the district had zero vaccination. Again, on July 15, 9,944 were administered vaccine doses, which was followed by zero vaccination on July 16. In the following days, between July 18 and 26, 200, 20, 0, 11,019, 0, 14,267, 0, 11,860 vaccine doses were administered, respectively. In the past two days, the district again recorded zero vaccination. The district health officer (DHO) of Wardha has blamed shortage of doses. Every week, they receive 2-3 consignments – on an average, with 9,000 and 15,000 vials per delivery. “We don’t stock the vials. As soon as we get the vials, we vaccinate people the next day. At present, I have 18,000 vials, which will be used up in a day. I will then have to wait for another two days to get the vaccines,” said Dr Ajay Davale, DHO, Wardha. “This also helps us to save wastage.” As per Census 2011, the district has a population of 1.3 million with 71% residing in tribal areas. This month, till July 28, the district has administered 104,699 vaccine doses. Other districts with similar or lower population have performed better in the mass immunisation programmes. For instance, Bhandara, with a population of 1.2 million, has administered 107,481 vaccine doses between July 1 and July 28. Similarly, Gondia with the same population as Wardha has recorded 148,274 vaccinations during the period. A senior public health officer talking about the discrepancy in the distribution of vaccines said their priority is districts with higher positivity rate like Beed, Sangli, Kolhapur. “The vaccines come from the central government, so we have no control on it. We have to use it reasonably. At present, on an average, the district is getting 10-12 new Covid-19 patients. The positivity rate is below 1%. So, we are diverting the vials to districts with higher infection rate,” said the officer. In the district, around 370,000 have taken the shots, of which 114,000 have been administered both the doses. Health activists said stock shortage discourages people from taking the jab. “There is so much confusion among people about where and when to get inoculated. The beneficiaries have to keep checking availability of vials daily. Also, on days of vaccination, most centres get overcrowded which not only makes them vulnerable to contracting the infection, but is also physically straining,” said Subodh Mahire, a local activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-wardha-saw-11-no-covid-vaccination-days-in-july-101627582617782.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 23% drop in Covid vaccinations in July compared to June||The city has reported a 23% drop in the number of vaccinations conducted in the first 28 days of July (1,499,125) compared to June (1,949,878), according to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The data reveals that vaccination at public centres has increased marginally in July compared to June, but the vaccination at private hospitals has seen a significant fall of around 50%. In total, there are 425 vaccination centres in the city, of which 293 are civic-run centres, 20 of state government and 112 are private hospitals. In 28 days of June, private hospitals vaccinated 1,244,822 citizens that went down to 669,814 in July. Public vaccination centres include centres run by the BMC and state. Further, in 28 days of June, 705,056 citizens were vaccinated in public vaccination centres that went up to 829,311 in July. Overall, in June, more than 2 million doses were administered, a jump from 0.8 million doses in May 2021.Private hospitals said one of the reasons is because vaccination became free by the last week of June, while many attributed it to shortage of stock. Behram Khodaiji, joint chief executive officer at Masina Hospital, said, “The number of people turning up at Masina hospital dropped by 20%-30 % in the past 30 days. According to BMC data, more people are getting vaccinated at civic-run hospitals. As citizens will have to pay for their vaccination at private centres, most choose government centres. Also, as per the guidelines, people who have taken their first dose have to mandatorily wait for 84 days before they can take their second one which results in a drop in numbers.”Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “Our vaccination has increased, but our potential is much more and if we are having more stock, we can vaccinate more citizens. Our capacity is to vaccinate 100,000 citizens on a daily basis. In private hospitals, those willing to pay have taken it already. Also, there is a shift as vaccination has become free in public centres. I do not feel there is any issue of shortage of vaccine doses in private hospitals.”As 53,076 citizens were vaccinated on Thursday, the city crossed the seven million mark, with 7,020,006 doses administered since January 16. A total of 1,694,895 citizens are fully vaccinated in the city. Meanwhile, as of July 29, of the total 7,020,006 vaccine doses administered in the city, 2,552,299 are in the 18-45 age group, 2,133,666 in 45-60 age group, 1,597,377 senior citizens, and 713,324 frontline and health care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-23-drop-in-covid-vaccinations-in-july-compared-to-june-101627582378808.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shilpa Shetty’s mother duped of ₹1.6 crore in a land deal||Juhu police booked a Karjat resident for cheating Sunanda Shetty, mother of actor Shilpa Shetty, to the tune of ₹1.6 crore.Juhu police on Wednesday registered a first information report (FIR) for cheating and forgery following an order by a metropolitan magistrate court. Shetty alleged that the man, Sudhakar Ghare, sold her a plot at Karjat in Raigad district for ₹1.6 crore by lying to her that the land belonged to him.According to police, Ghare came in contact with Shetty in 2109 and showed her a plot at Karjat saying it was his and he wanted to sell it. The complainant bought the land last year.Later, when she found out that the land belonged to someone else, she confronted Ghare. He told her that he had political contacts and threatened her. Shetty then approached the court following which an order was issued to Juhu police to register an FIR against Ghare.Shashikant Mane, senior inspector of Juhu police station, said they have booked Ghare under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by agent), 420 (cheating), 462 (punishment for same offence when committed by person entrusted with custody), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (fraudulent or dishonest use as genuine any document or electronic record which is forged), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.“We have registered the FIR and are now tracing Ghare who is absconding at present. We are also verifying the purchase documents submitted by Sunanda Shetty before the court,” said Mane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-shilpa-shetty-s-mother-duped-of-1-6-crore-in-a-land-deal-101627582377754.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Mangrove cell sets September 30 deadline for mangroves handover in Maharashtra||All mangrove lands currently in the possession of various government agencies, such as the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and various municipal corporations, among others, will be handed over to the state forest department within the two months, by September 30, the mangrove cell submitted to the Bombay high court (HC).The deadline was set during a July 13 meeting of an independent state-level committee constituted to ensure compliance with the HC’s final judgement of September 2018, instructing that all mangrove lands in the state be handed over to the forest department for protection under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The minutes of the meeting, released on July 26, were submitted to the HC in an affidavit Wednesday. The matter is set to be heard on Thursday.HT had, on July 25, reported that a total of 519 hectares (ha) of mangroves have already been committed for handover by Cidco (219ha) and MMRDA (200ha). However, the Committee of Secretaries, in their July 13 meeting, noted that Cidco has over 1,000ha of mangroves in their possession. “Cidco is directed to identify remaining mangrove forest with the help of MRSAC maps and ground-truthing,” the committee noted, issuing similar directions applicable to JNPT, Mhada, MIDC, and the municipal corporations of Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli.The date, September 30, has also been set as the deadline to resolve 58 pending complaints received since 2018 by the HC-appointed mangrove monitoring and protection committee headed by the Konkan divisional commissioner. The committee has received 146 complaints related to destruction of mangroves in three years, of which 88 have been resolved. The date is also the deadline for civic bodies to assign sites for dumping of debris and construction waste and to clear up all illegally dumped construction and demolition waste from not only recognised mangrove areas but also a 50-metre buffer zone around them, shows the minutes of the meeting.However, a member of the monitoring committee said this deadline is unlikely to be met. “The official stance of the municipalities is that cleaning up the mangroves is too expensive and that the process will be a lengthy one, involving taking out tenders and so on. It does not make financial sense for them. In all cases of illegal dumping on mangroves, there has not been any instance where the waste has actually been cleaned up. We will have to see what the court says about this,” the member said. Another significant milestone that the forest department hopes to achieve in the next two months is the settlement of claims on 3,700ha of mangroves which are awaiting final declaration as “reserve forest” under section 20 of the Indian Forest Act with appointed forest settlement officers or sub-divisional officers. Konkan divisional commissioner has been asked to ensure that none of these areas are deleted on account of the lack of mangroves on site. “The status of mangroves in the year 2005 shall be considered for the purpose of final notification,” the committee observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mangrove-cell-sets-september-30-deadline-for-mangroves-handover-in-maharashtra-101627582077826.html
29-07-2021||Gurugram||After Khori, demolition of illegal structures in other parts of Aravallis to start next week||Officials of the Gurugram and Faridabad forest departments said that preparations are underway to raze all illegal structures in the Aravallis and that the groundwork is likely to start next week.The action comes a week after the Supreme Court, while hearing a case about demolition of Khori village in Faridabad, observed that “the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on the forest land applies to all such structures without any exception”. In Gurugram, there are over 400 illegal farmhouses, among other structures, on Aravalli land, officials said. Rajeev Tejyan, the divisional forest officer for Gurugram, said, “We are identifying all the illegal structures and notices will be sent (to the owners). We will follow all the directives of the Supreme Court and take action within four weeks.”Raj Kumar, the divisional forest officer for Faridabad, said that the orders of the Supreme Court will be followed on priority and action on the ground action will start next week. “By Friday, notices will be sent about all these properties and four days will be given to them (property owners) to file a response. After that, from next week, a drone survey and ground verification will be carried out by the forest and district administration staff to understand the exact area before starting the demolition work,” said Kumar. In Faridabad, officials have estimated that around 120-130 illegal structures are currently standing on land notified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA). According to directives of the Supreme Court, the PLPA attracts protection under the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which states that “no state government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the central government, any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.” On Thursday, 11 illegal structures were also demolished by the Sohna Municipal Council in the Raisina Aravallis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/after-khori-demolition-of-illegal-structures-in-other-parts-of-aravallis-to-start-next-week-101627581958992.html

The woman is a Delhi resident and was on her way back home on Wednesday night when the incident took place. Subhash Boken, the spokesperson for Gurugram police, said that she flagged down a cab on MG Road, near a bus stop, and the driver asked her to board the front seat. “The driver asked her to leave the rear seats for other passengers. He parked the car on an isolated stretch and raped her in the cab,” he said. The police said that the cab driver left her at the Aya Nagar border. The woman approached the police on Thursday and lodged a complaint at the DLF Phase-2 police station. The woman, in her complaint, said that the driver molested her and when she tried to raise the alarm, he threatened her life. Boken said the woman had left her workplace around 8pm and boarded the cab around 8.15pm. Before leaving, the driver returned her purse and mobile phone, which she used to call her husband.

29-07-2021||Gurugram||Highly venomous common krait snake rescued from residence near Aravallis||A four-foot-long common krait — a highly venomous snake native to the Aravallis — was rescued by officials of the wildlife department from a house in Gadoli Khurd village in Sector 9 on Pataudi Road, early on Thursday.Officials said that the male snake, weighing around one kilogram, was kept under observation for three hours before it was released in the Aravallis, under the supervision of the wildlife department.A 10-year-old girl was the first to notice the snake, after feeling the reptile move across her chest.Anil Gandas, a wildlife expert who led the rescue operation, said he received a call from 34-year-old Jai Kishan, an executive of a multinational company who lived in the village around 2.30am on Thursday. According to Gandas, he was told that the snake seemed to be asleep on the sofa but it started slithering towards a bedroom when the light was switched on. The residence is on the periphery of a dense jungle.Gandas, who lives in the same village, reached the spot within 10 minutes. “There was a huge crowd when I got there. The snake was on the bed in the bedroom at the residence,” he said. Ten-year-old Avantika, a class 5 student of a private school, said that she was sleeping on a sofa, adjacent to her father’s bed. “Around 2.30am, I woke up after I felt something was moving across me. I tried to throw it away but the movement continued over and over. I thought that a frog had jumped on my sofa but after a few minutes, I realised that it was a snake,” she said. This is the eleventh snake to be rescued this month from a residence in Gurugram. Snake sightings in Gurugram’s residential areas, particularly inside houses, have become commonplace over the past few years, according to the district wildlife department. In the last 10 years, there have been 1,027 instances of snake rescue, on average, every year. According to wildlife experts, 20 species of snakes are native to the Aravallis and four of those, the monocled cobra, spectacled cobra, black cobra and the common krait, are highly venomous. Wildlife officials said that the common krait was released in the Aravallis in the morning. Members of the household, where the snake was found, raised the alarm as soon as they spotted the snake.“My wife and I were in panic. We all came out of the house and stood outside until Gandas reached. Even after the rescue, we were unable to enter the room. Except for my daughter, all of us were scared. We were lucky enough that the snake did not bite any of us. I was scared and worried about the safety of my family till the rescue team took it away. It was the first time I saw a snake, this big, up close. It was huge,” said Kishan. The 10-year-old who found the snake said that she watches wildlife shows on television frequently but having a first-hand encounter was a different experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/highly-venomous-common-krait-snake-rescued-from-residence-near-aravallis-101627581898365.html
29-07-2021||Other||More awareness needed to increase vax among lactating, pregnant women||PUNE As lactating women and pregnant women have begun taking the Covid vaccine, experts suggest hesitancy among these beneficiaries can be reduced as awareness increases. Speaking about the issue, Dr Meenakshi Deshpande, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, and president-elect, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune chapter, said that many lactating women and pregnant women are still hesitant about taking the vaccine.“Since the central government gave permission to vaccinate pregnant women, 300 beneficiaries have received the vaccination. Any side-effects, post vaccination, are similar to those from other age groups. Dizziness, fever and pain at the site of vaccination are common symptoms post- vaccination,” said Dr Deshpande.She added that so far only one patient has reported fever and fatigue, post vaccination, for more than one day.“The effect of vaccination on children who breastfeed and on the foetus are not seen. The vaccines are safe for the child and the mother,” said Dr Deshpande.She added that in other countries, vaccines for pregnant and lactating women started early.“Due to this, many women are inoculated. As inoculation started just a month ago, many women are hesitant to take the vaccine. Doctors are suggesting pregnant and lactating women take their dose as soon as possible to keep themselves and their babies safe,” said Dr Deshpande.Dr Dnyaneshwar Mote, member of the Pune city Covid task force for social action, said that on the ground level, many women and families are hesitant about taking the vaccine.“So far, the scientific evidence suggests that Vaccines are safe for pregnant and lactating women. In such a scenario, more awareness campaigns should be taken up by the government,” said Dr Mote.He added that women who are not educated should be counselled about the benefits of the vaccine.“During the second wave, we saw a lot of new mothers infected with Covid. Whereas, young infants were safe and many later tested negative with no post-Covid complications. For this to not repeat itself, it is important to vaccinate pregnant women and lactating women. Their vaccination will ensure the safety of the child too,” said Dr Mote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/more-awareness-needed-to-increase-vax-among-lactating-pregnant-women-101627581896990.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Arrested Raj Kundra, Thorpe to prevent further destruction of evidence: Police to Bombay HC||The Mumbai Police responded to the petition filed by arrested businessman Raj Kundra on Thursday and informed the Bombay high court (HC) there was nothing illegal in the arrest of Kundra and co-accused Ryan Thorpe who were nabbed when they were taken to the crime branch office at Byculla. The police said the arrests were made to prevent Kundra and Thorpe from further destroying or tampering with evidence crucial to the pornographic film racket case. Kundra, however, argued that as proper Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was not followed by the police during his arrest, making it illegal. He added that new charges including section 201 (punishment for causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code, which were not pressed when he was first arrested, were added as an afterthought. Kundra argued that as he was not informed about the same, his arrest was illegal. A single judge bench of justice AS Gadkari, while hearing the petitions filed by Kundra and Thorpe, was informed by senior counsel Aabad Ponda that the police had acted vengefully as Kundra had refused to acknowledge the notice they had served him under section 41A of CrPC which mandated his appearance before a police officer to avoid unnecessary arrest.Kundra’s petition stated that though he had not acknowledged the notice issued by the police based on the FIR registered under various sections of IPC and laws on indecent portrayal of women, he had been present in his office when it was searched and also went to the crime branch. However, he was arrested there without being served a notice, which was a violation of his rights as well as laws which safeguarded a person from arrest when the offence calls for less than seven years of imprisonment.On July 27, the bench had asked the police to respond to the petition and said it would not grant ex-parte ad-interim relief without hearing the respondents.On Thursday, the affidavit filed by police inspector Kiran Bidve from property cell, district crime branch, criminal investigation department-Mumbai, said Kundra and his IT technician Thorpe were served a notice under section 41 (A) of CrPC, and while Thorpe accepted the same, Kundra refused to accept the notice during the July 19 search of his office.Public prosecutor Aruna Pai, for the police, said due procedure was followed by the prosecution and that Kundra was given due notice under section 41A of CrPC.“The fact that the petitioner refused to accept the said notice implies that he refused to cooperate in the investigation. Apart from this, petitioner and his IT technician Ryan Thorpe also started deleting from the WhatsApp group and chat, thereby causing evidence of the offence to disappear and tamper with such evidence. Hence, in order to prevent them, accused Kundra and Thorpe were brought to property cell, crime branch for probe, and thereby they were arrested,” stated the affidavit.In view of this submissions, the police in the affidavit sought dismissal of Kundra’s petition.Ponda, however, argued that under the said section of IPC, if the Investigating officer wanted to arrest Kundra for non-compliance of the notice, he was required to avail an order from magistrate to arrest the petitioner and the same was not followed which led to an arbitrary arrest.He further said while the police had not made any allegation of destruction of evidence or deletion of WhatsApp messages by the petitioner at the time of arrest or even during the first remand, it was added as an “afterthought”. “The police are trying to show the compliance of the section 41A of CrPC, however, they have committed mockery of the criminal procedure,” Ponda said and sought interim relief to the petitioner.Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud, for Thorpe, said while his client had complied with the notice issued by police, his arrest was illegal and sought relief from the court. Shilpa Shetty moves HC seeking restraint on media from publishing defamatory content Actor Shilpa Shetty filed an interim application in a defamation suit in the Bombay HC seeking restraining orders on various media organisations which, according to the application, are indulging in publishing incorrect, false, malicious and defamatory content against her through various media platforms in connection with the arrest of her husband Raj Kundra in the pornography film racket case.The interim application stated that the respondents were causing irreparable harm and damage to her reputation with the aim of sensationalising news and attracting viewership. The application seeks an injunction against further publication of completely false, erroneous, derogatory and defamatory information and to remove the objectionable content already uploaded on their websites and portals and issue an unconditional apology for the same. The respondents include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube which are among the 29 entities named in the application. HC will hear the petition on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/arrested-raj-kundra-thorpe-to-prevent-further-destruction-of-evidence-police-to-bombay-hc-101627581777644.html
29-07-2021||Gurugram||MCG wants to reclaim amenities from GMDA||Councillors of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said that they are considering reclaiming all amenities — master roads, green belts and CCTV cameras, among others — that were transferred to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) in 2018, over concerns of deterioration and slow progress of work. The MCG’s councillors floated an agenda in this regard and the same will be put forward for discussion during MCG’s House meeting on Saturday, said officials. Mayor Madhu Azad said that the issue of transferring amenities back to the MCG was raised by councillors during a civic body meeting on July 20, after severe waterlogging in the city.“All councillors approached me with this issue and we unanimously agreed that bringing back the amenities to the MCG is of utmost importance. The GMDA is not taking care of the amenities properly. We will be content even if GMDA just monitors the amenities and MCG carries out all the execution work,” said Azad.Sudhir Rajpal, the chief executive officer of GMDA, declined to comment on the matter. A senior official of the GMDA, wishing not to be named, said, “It (the transferring of amenities) is a policy decision. This was taken by the Haryana government three years ago. Continuing with GMDA, giving it back to MCG or making them work together is their decision. Such decisions take time, as it has to go through multiple levels. We will continue with our services, unless directed otherwise.” In Gurugram, the MCG looks after all arterial roads, colony roads and internal drains, while the GMDA looks after master (major) roads, green belts, CCTV cameras and master drains. In its agenda, the MCG stated that under the GMDA’s care, the amenities are either deteriorating or work on projects is progressing slowly, and hence, they want them transferred to the MCG. The GMDA has been facing a fund crunch and four years since its formation, it is yet to work out its financial model and relies on other public bodies for its revenue. On the other hand, the MCG is the richest civic body in Haryana. In its 2021-22 budget, the GMDA has set an estimated expenditure of ₹1,848 crore, against an estimated revenue of ₹1,200 crore. On the other hand, for this fiscal year, the MCG has set an estimated expenditure of ₹2,583 crore and estimated revenue of ₹4,899 crore, with an estimated profit of ₹2,316 crore. Azad said that due to disparity in the work carried out by MCG and GMDA, the city’s development is getting lopsided. “There is a huge gap in the city’s amenities. The streets and internal roads are properly built while most major roads are either pothole-ridden or nearing degradation. For citizens, the discrepancy is difficult to comprehend. All master services are in dire need of an upgrade as well as upkeep,” said Azad. On Thursday, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja also held an internal meeting with officials at the MCG’s Sector 34 office regarding Saturday’s House meeting, in which the agenda was also discussed.“The matter was deliberated upon in the meeting. Even if the agenda gets approval in the House, it would be forwarded to the Haryana government for final approval. As the Haryana government had decided to transfer the amenities from MCG to GMDA, they are the ones holding the power for transferring them back,” a senior MCG official, wishing not to be named, said.The MCG House meeting is scheduled to take place at 11am on Saturday at the Haryana Institute of Public Administration’s office in Sector 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-wants-to-reclaim-amenities-from-gmda-101627581719834.html
29-07-2021||Gurugram||Juveniles who robbed cab for vacation in Himachal Pradesh apprehended||Two juvenile teenagers were apprehended on Wednesday night for allegedly robbing a cab driver at gunpoint, after booking a trip on a cab aggregator service, to get a vehicle to travel to a hill station, the police said.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the younger of the two is a resident of Gurugram and is a class 11 student of a private school in the city, while the other juvenile is a Delhi resident who was awaiting results of his class 12 board exams. They are childhood friends as they had attended the same primary school in Jhajjar.They booked a cab from Hero Honda Chowk to Haridwar in Uttarakhand, and were planning to vacation in Himachal Pradesh, the police said. The juveniles, according to the police, are just a few months from turning 18. The police said that when the cab reached Garhi Hasaru, they allegedly took the driver at gunpoint, robbed him of cash, mobile phone and car, and pushed him out of the car on an isolated stretch. They were caught when they were trying to rob commuters to fund their vacation, the police said.The cab, mobile phones, cash and a countrymade pistol was recovered from their possession. “They were looking for a personal car for the trip and despite attempts, they could not arrange one through friends and relatives, following which they planned to commit a robbery. The juveniles were on the lookout for another target to rob money when they landed in the police net,” Sangwan said. Sangwan said that they booked the cab on July 26. “Within a few minutes of the trip, one of them pulled out the pistol and asked the driver to pull up, but when the driver resisted, the other juvenile placed a broken beer bottle on the driver’s neck and threatened to kill him. Fearing for his life, the driver stopped the car and the duo dragged him out of the car near Sector 10,” he said. Based on a complaint from the cab driver, Rafiq (30), a case was registered under sections 379B (snatching using force) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. After scanning footage of multiple CCTV cameras, the police tracked the suspects and caught them on Wednesday. Sangwan said that one of them has a previous criminal record. “The older juvenile was apprehended for snatching a car in Jhajjar and sent to an observation home.

The success rate of semester-10 students stands at 97.36% while that of semester 6 students is 98.62%, MU stated in a press release.“Of the 1,563 students who appeared for semester-10 exams, 1,331 passed with first class and above scores and only 25 students have failed.

These exams were held virtually by colleges in May this year.While students had every reason to rejoice, colleges once again attributed the high success rate to exams being held in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) format. “Last year, the success rate of law students was 96% and this year it is 98%. Students are scoring 100 out of 100 in subjects which was otherwise unheard of earlier.

These trains stopped only at 11 of the 29-km line’s 21 stations, skipping stations at sectors 50, 101, 81, 83, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147 and 148 due to low ridership.NMRC managing director Ritu Maheshwari said that the change has been made keeping in view the popular public demand. “The fast trains will stop at Sector 81 station from August 2, 2021 during peak hours – 8am to 11am and 5pm to 11pm,” she said.At present, the trains ply every 10 to 15 minutes during peak and non-peak hours at the stations. The metro service is available from 6 am – 10 pm from Monday to Friday. The Aqua Line metro trains do not operate on Saturday and Sunday due to weekend curfew brought on by the second wave of Covid infections.Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2, Sector 78, said that there are some residential sectors near Sector 101 metro station. “We had asked NMRC to make stoppage of fast trains at Sector 101 too.

29-07-2021||Noida||Girders launched at DME’s rail overbridge for six additional lanes||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has launched girders for the under-construction rail overbridge (ROB) at Chipiyana near Crossings Republik Township in Ghaziabad. The development is significant as it will enable the construction of six more lanes of the ROB for traffic on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME). With only four lanes of the ROB currently open, the structure is a major bottleneck for over 60,000 passenger car units (or PCU, which measures traffic taking into consideration the different vehicles that ply on a road) that use it. Once complete, the bridge will have 16 lanes in total.“The girders over which the six lanes will be constructed were launched om Wednesday after shutting down rail movement, on the busy Delhi-Howrah route, for about one to four hours daily for over 12 days. We should be able to construct and open the six additional lanes by the end of August,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. “We plan to open two more lanes by November and the rest by the end of the year.”The two lanes scheduled for opening in November will only be for heavy vehicles that the NHAI will employ to finish the project, another official said, asking not to be named. The ROB is part of Phase 2 of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, from UP Gate to Dasna, which was opened to traddic this April. Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday tweeted several pictures of the launching of the girders, which are 74 metres long and 66 metres wide. The construction of the six lanes was to be finished by June but Covid-induced curfew affected work and overshot the deadline, the officials said. Commuters were happy to see the girders go up as during peak hours, traffic slows down considerably on the ROB.“It is a hassle to cross the ROB as the traffic barely moves an inch, especially during the evening hours. If one happens to travel between 7pm and 8pm, one is bound to take an hour to cross the ROB,” said Kamiya Arora, a resident of Crossings Republik. The section is mainly used by short distance commuters between Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Noida and Delhi, while also serving as a link for long distance travellers to Moradabad, Bareilly and Meerut. “Long distance travellers to parts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand over the weekends are also hassled by the congestion on the ROB. The DME connects Delhi to Meerut within an hour, but time almost doubles when commuters get stuck in jam on the ROB,” said Nitin Kumar, a resident of Vijay Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/girders-launched-at-dme-s-rail-overbridge-for-six-additional-lanes-101627581176919.html

The district magistrate claimed that it was the first such gym for females in the state and that six more gram panchayats of the district have sent him requests to establish similar facilities in their areas. The gym has been established in the panchayat ghar of Bijrol, which is a historic village with a population of over 20,000. The great revolutionary Baba Shahmal of Bijrol fought against the British during the First War of Independence in 1857 and made the supreme sacrifice for the motherland. As many as 32 other villagers were also hanged to death for supporting Baba Shahmal. The gym has six machines for multiple exercises. Yadav shared that over ₹6 lakh had been spent to set up the gym. The amount was sourced from the account of the Gram Nidhi. “We can extend it further after seeing the response,” said Yadav, adding that villagers, especially women and girls, were quite excited during its inauguration. “A few of them even assured to add more machines by spending their own money and to take care of its maintenance too,” said a visibly overwhelmed DM. The district administration had a plan to establish the gym in the last week of March this year but it was delayed due to the second wave of the pandemic. “The project was delayed due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and we started it again only after the corona cases subsided,” said Yadav. Fitness freak Priyanka Sharma of the village has been deputed as the trainer in the gym. Priyanka’s association with the gym has an interesting story behind it. In the second week of March, divisional commissioner of Meerut, Surendra Singh, visited the village and held a ‘Jan Chaupal’ to address the grievances of the people. Singh was taken aback when Priyanka asked him to set up a gym for females in the village. “It was for the first time in my career that a village girl demanded a gym,” said Singh who immediately approved it and directed district magistrate Rajkamal Yadav to work on it. “We announced to set up the gym in 15 days,” said the DM. An overjoyed Priyanka said, “What I dreamt of and demanded has transformed into a reality now”. She said village girls and women were happy and excited and have started using the gym. The gym is being run in two shifts - 5 am to 11 am and 4 pm to 6 pm. Priyanka is the mother of three children but has a passion for fitness and sports, like weightlifting. “I have a dream to bring a medal for the country like Mirabai Chanu,” said Priyanka who teaches village girls and women how to use machines at the gym and do multiple exercises. The gym will also be a boon for such girls and women who aim for recruitment in police and armed forces. Priyanka shared that many girls of Bijrol and neighbouring villages aspired for police and other similar jobs. These girls and women needed to maintain their physical fitness to qualify for the medical tests during recruitment. They used to attend a gym in the neighbouring town of Baraut, which is six kilometres away from Bijrol, but now they will not have to travel that far. She said many village women have joined the gym to reduce their weight and become fitter. “We seldom get the opportunity to attend a gym because of the hectic routine at home but the availability of a gym in the village would help us access it for fitness,” said Rekha and Anita of the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttar-pradesh-village-gets-women-only-gym-dm-calls-it-state-s-first-101627580279331.html

Soon after the legislative council assembled for the question hour, Mishra moved an adjournment motion and urged the state and central government to reduce taxes on petroleum products to offer some relief to the people from burgeoning inflation. The motion, however, was rejected by the working chairman Awadhesh Narayan Singh, the issue saw verbal dual between Mishra and JDU minister and former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Ashok Choudhary in presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Mishra pressed for reducing the state’s share of tax in petrol and diesel citing CM Kumar’s statement at a recent Janata Darbar. The CM watched the proceedings in the council but declined to intervene in the war of words between Choudhary and Mishra. Later, the council chair announced Madan Mohan Jha being granted the status as leader of Congress party in the upper house, on the recommendation of Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajit Sharma. The post of Congress legislature party leader in the council remained vacant since the superannuation of the previous term of Jha. Earlier in the day, hundreds of Youth Congress workers gathered under the leadership of Bihar Pradesh Youth Congress (BPYC) chief Gujan Patel and former legislator Amit Kumar Tunna took out a march from Sadaqat Ashram to gherao the state legislature on the issue of spiralling prices of petroleum products, essential commodities and government-sponsored phone hacking of top political leaders, social activists and journalists. The protesters were, however, not allowed to move towards the state legislature and stopped near Rajapur. A minor scuffle between the police personnel and the Youth Congress activists erupted near Rajapur when the former refused to proceed. Addressing the gathering, Tunna accused the government of leaving the people to fend for themselves in its lust for taxes and said that their protests would continue at different levels across the state. Patel said that the wing activists would go to New Delhi to participate in the Indian Youth Congress called Parliament march on the same issue on August 5. The police later arrested the Youth Congress leaders and detained them at Patliputra police station. BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha and Mishra met the detained leaders at the police station and managed their release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/congress-raises-price-rise-in-bihar-assembly-101627578777325.html

First and foremost, the three black agricultural laws, these are illegal, anti-constitutional and are against the federal structure. The state government should take a stand on these, just like it did in the Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal issue, and categorically reject amendments to these laws. The government should tell the Centre that it won’t let these laws be implemented,” Sidhu said, talking about one of the five points among the priority areas.The other four issues raised by the Punjab Congress chief were punishing the main culprits behind sacrilege and police firing incidents at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan, arrest and exemplary punishment to “big fish” behind trafficking, cancellation of the “faulty” power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with no loss to the state exchequer, and opening talks with more than 20 unions protesting across Punjab over various issues.Thursday’s meeting was also attended by party workers from Phagwara, Bholath, Sultanpur Lodhi and Kapurthala.

There were 110 votes against the Opposition proposal to replace “CM” with “Chancellor” in the Bill, while there were just 89 votes in favour.The bill proposes to bring all the government and private engineering colleges in the state under one umbrella, with CM as the Chancellor. The Opposition wanted that Chancellor should remain the Chancellor, as was the case with other state universities.Earlier in 2008, all the technical institutions, including those of engineering and medical, were brought under the Aryabhatt Knowledge University, but the government decided to come up with a university exclusively for engineering colleges due to rapid increase in their numbers in the last one decade and development of modern and allied fields. Now, all 38 districts in the state have an engineering college.Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds the finance portfolio, moved the Bihar Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) (amendment) Bill, 2021 to provide amendments in fiscal targets for 2021-22, as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission and the government of India.The third bill passed was the Bihar Goods and Services Tax (amendment) Bill, 2021, necessitated due to change in the central legislation following the recommendation of the GST Council, as both the central and legislation’s need to be in consonance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/opp-forces-counting-of-votes-on-bill-in-bihar-assembly-loses-101627577996633.html

The last caste census in India was conducted in 1931.In New Delhi, RJD chief Lalu Prasad, in his first media interaction after being granted bail in fodder scam cases in April this year, also pushed for caste census and said he and his party had long struggled for this and would continue to do so. The ailing RJD chief, who is recuperating at the residence of his eldest daughter and MP Misa Bharti, was talking to reporters after taking his first shot of Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday. He said he would return to Patna in next one or two months.In Patna, Tejashwi Yadav said he would meet the chief minister to push for a caste census. “The CM himself is in favour caste census. The Bihar state Assembly had passed resolutions twice in the past for caste census,” he told reporters outside the state Assembly. “I had moved an adjournment motion today for debate on caste census in the state Assembly. But it was not accepted. The BJP government at the Centre has rejected caste census and it is apparent the NDA government here does not want a debate on it,” Yadav said.Yadav said if the CM does not lead a delegation to meet the Prime Minister, he should order a caste census in Bihar as done by Karnataka in 2018 by the then government led by chief minister Siddaramaiah.The demand for caste census is once again in the centre stage of Bihar politics following the Bhartiya Janata Party-led union government’s recent announcement in Parliament that there will be no enumeration of people belonging to various castes other than scheduled caste and scheduled tribes during the census 2021. Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai had made the announcement on July 20.

Although this came as a relief to parents, private school managements are worried. Schools have been closed since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, with all classes online. Rajendra Singh, president, Independent English Schools Association (IESA) said, “As the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011 is in place, any decision about fees is between EPTA and schools. So we are surprised; on what basis such an ordinance has been passed? There cannot be a blanket order for all schools. At some schools fees have been reduced by 50 per cent, and from that now there will be a further 15 per cent reduction. These schools will close down. This order has been passed for popularity and because of inappropriate public pressure.”“If you are reducing fees, then parents must pay all outstanding fees in full. Already schools are facing a challenge to get fees from parents,” he added.When asked about legal measures that could be taken against this decision, Singh said, “Once our legal teams go through the detailed order, we will take the appropriate measures.”Sanjay Shendge, principal, Seth Dagaduram Katariya High School said, “It is the collective responsibility of both schools and parents to keep the learning of students going on, and school fees is an important factor. The state government decision has given relief to parents, but at the same time it is necessary to think about private schools which are closing down due to a financial crisis or not getting fees from parents.”Another prominent school principal speaking on condition of anonymity said, “The decision declared by state government has shocked us. We are already struggling for the last one year to pay salaries. Half salaries have been paid to teachers, many of them have left the job and now in such a situation running a school will be difficult. We would rather take a final call and close down the school.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/principals-fear-latest-fee-cut-by-state-govt-will-result-in-closure-of-pvt-schools-101627577096623.html

PMC tried to fill up potholes on some stretches of road on Wednesday, though it had to abandon plans due to the rains. While these potholes have posed a risk to to-wheelers in the city, it has also embarrassed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which controls PMC. The BJP’s Sandeep Khardekar issued a letter to commissioner Vikram Kumar on Thursday, with the threat of a PIL within. The letter also demanded that potholes be filled-up and roads repaired within 10 days.Khardekar said, “Due to development and cable-laying works many roads got dug-up. Ideally, after finishing the work, it is expected that the road surfacing is done immediately. In places where work finished three months ago, the contractor has still not resurfaced the road; and the municipal officers are not bothered about it.”Prashant Inamdar, convenor, Pedestrian First, also criticised the municipal corporation on the pothole issue. Inamdar said, “I was a member of the technical committee formed by the PMC. We prepared a detail report about road maintenance, but the administration is not following it. For any urban area, road connectivity is important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjps-khardekar-threatens-to-file-pil-over-potholes-on-city-roads-101627576856589.html

However, the Pune district administration clarified that the Covid situation in its three administrative units - Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), and Pune Rural would be considered separately as per earlier guidelines issued by the state government. In Pune district, the weekly positivity rate in the PMC limits is 3.37%, below the state average of 3.8%. Whereas the positivity rate in rural Pune is higher than the state average, at 6.79% on Wednesday. According to district officials, details of a possibility of relaxations would be discussed at the weekly Covid review meeting to be held on Friday. “As per earlier state guidelines we consider the three separate administrative units in Pune district for the decision-making process related to Covid containment measures. The detailed guidelines of the recent developments are awaited. Further decisions could be made based on those,” said Rajesh Deshmukh, collector, Pune district. Earlier, when the state government had announced its five-level restriction plan, the three administrative units in the district had different levels of restrictions based on the positivity rate and oxygen-bed occupancy rate. Initially, PMC and PCMC were under level 3 restrictions and level 4 was imposed in the rural parts. As the positivity rate in rural areas did not drop below 5%, the level 4 restrictions have not been lifted in these parts. The caseload in the rural parts has remained higher than the urban areas for the last few weeks. As of Wednesday, there were 9,265 active Covid cases in the district and 5,918 of these are in rural areas. The weekly positivity rate in PCMC was recorded at 4.31% on Wednesday, slightly higher than the state average. Health minister Rajesh Tope said on Thursday, that even if 25 districts are set to see relaxations, local administrations of the remaining 11 districts can impose extra restrictions to contain the spread of the infection. “A report on suggestions and recommendations related to relaxations has been submitted to the chief minister. He will take a final call and a detailed order will be issued in the next two days. Eleven districts in the state remain a matter of concern,” said Rajesh Tope in Mumbai. Last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had hinted at relaxations in Pune city. Following his announcement, traders, hoteliers, and other business operators are eagerly awaiting a decision. The final decision on the relaxations in Pune was expected on Monday, but no announcement was made. Business operators are hoping for a definitive decision at this week’s Covid review meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rural-pune-caseload-keeps-district-under-covid-norms-as-is-for-now-101627576436539.html

BJP legislators later walked out of the assembly, demanding that the government roll back the bill cleared by the assembly moments earlier.Health minister TS Singh Deo, who piloted the bill in the assembly, said the acquisition of the college was a step towards providing health facilities to the poor and common people.“This is the best option to start a government medical college in the state with limited resources,” Singhdeo told the assembly that it will annually cost the exchequer only ₹140 crore to run the college. He also countered claims by the BJP that the medical education regulator, the Medical Council of India, has cancelled the college’s recognition, and said the MCI has sanctioned 150 seats.The medical college was set up in 2013 in memory of the veteran Congress leader Chandulal Chandrakar. The acquisition, however, turned controversial after it emerged that among those on the board of the medical college is a member of the joint family into which chief minister Bhupesh Baghel’s daughter is married.During the two-hour-long debate on the bill, Congress leaders emphasised that the bill will not transfer the liabilities of the college but only provide for the acquisition of its assets.The BJP, however, questioned section 8 of the bill that specified that the government would get an assessment of the college’s movable and immovable assets and then pay the owners, twice the assessed value.The leader of the opposition in the assembly Dharamlal Kaushik said this did not stand to reason. “When the government is facing a financial crisis and has a debt of around ₹76,000 crores, an additional government expense of ₹140 crore is not logical. Secondly, why is the government is paying twice the amount of the valuation of the medical college through acquisition? This could lead to corruption which is also not logical,” Kaushik said.Former chief minister Raman Singh said the government should have upgraded an existing 600-bed government hospital in Durg rather than acquiring a loss-making private medical college if the government wanted to expand health facilities. Singh said there was an attempt to sell the college in the past and litigation was still on to recover ₹35 crore paid to the owners in advance.“The bill has been brought to ensure relief to directors from debts,” Singh.Senior BJP MLA Brijmohan Agrawal said the bill is aimed at benefitting only some people. It is even against the interest of people who lent crores of rupees to the college and its employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-govt-passes-controversial-bill-to-take-over-private-medical-college-101627575297981.html

A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was hearing the application of Jenny Rowena, the wife of Babu seeking his transfer to a private hospital to treat an eye infection, which he had suffered while he was at Taloja jail. Babu had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to GT Hospital.

29-07-2021||Mumbai||234 pregnant women vaccinated; one adverse event recorded in Mumbai||As many as 234 pregnant women in the city have taken the Covid-19 vaccine shots over the last two weeks. Of these, two women have taken the second dose, while the rest are partially vaccinated. Only one case of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) has been reported so far, according to the civic body. According to Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), AEFI was reported in a 24-year-old woman who was in her fourth month of pregnancy. The woman had taken the second dose of the vaccine (Covaxin) at Parel’s KEM Hospital on July 16. Next day, she complained of fever, around 10-20 episodes of vomiting, cough and headache. She also had swelling in the gums on the left side. She was admitted to the KEM Hospital on July 19 and discharged after four days. Mumbai began vaccinations for pregnant women from July 15, a few days after the ministry of health and family welfare granted approval stating that the benefits of vaccination outweigh their potential risks. The ministry said pregnant women should be informed about the risks of exposure to Covid-19 along with the risks and benefits associated with the three vaccines — Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V — that are available in India. “We follow the procedure laid out by the Centre about explaining the possible side effects of the vaccine when pregnant women come for taking the shots,” said Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of civic-run Rajawadi Hospital, Ghatkopar, which is one of the 35 centres where pregnant women can get vaccinated. “We also explain to them about the risks of the infection,” she said adding that their centre has vaccinated only about 10 pregnant women so far and no one presently with any AEFI. “The response is very low. We have told resident doctors to inform pregnant women about the vaccination when they come to OPD’s for checkup and antenatal follow ups. Hopefully, more women will be motivated in the coming days,” said Thakur. Several gynaecologists HT spoke to said that pregnant women complained of very mild aftereffects of vaccinations like feeling feverish, mild fever, and body ache. “No one has returned with any major complaints,” said gynaecologist Dr Suruchi Desai from Vile Parle’s Nanavati Hospital. According to Desai, there is need of spreading awareness among the pregnant women about the importance of vaccination. “The message has to spread by the government, medical experts and each one of us,” said Desai, adding that vaccinations have played a crucial role in averting so many deaths across the country. “Everyone has to play their part in spreading this message,” Dr Desai said. The Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI) has been pushing for vaccinations for pregnant and lactating women for a long time. “Covid-19 during pregnancy can be very risky for the mother-to-be as well as the baby in some cases,” said Dr Bipin Pandit, gynaecologist, who is also the vice president of FOGSI. “Vaccination can bring down these risks drastically. We have been strongly advocating vaccinations for a while now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/234-pregnant-women-vaccinated-one-adverse-event-recorded-in-mumbai-101627572717165.html

Earlier in the day, citing the need to await the decision of the HC administration committee on whether physical hearings can be started, the court had adjourned hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought directions to the state and civic authorities to relax travel restrictions for fully vaccinated persons and to allow them to travel by all public transport modes including suburban local trains. According to the statement released by the Bombay Bar Association whose representatives participated in the committee meeting, the committee has decided to start physical hearings of cases – a demand which was being made by lawyers also. Physical hearings will be restricted to half days only and not be starting full-fledgedly in 11 districts namely Raigad, Sindhudurg, Ratnagairi, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Pune, Nagar, Beed, Nashik and Palghar. However, the three-day physical hearing schedule will also be applied in Nagpur, Aurangabad and Goa. The committee also decided to continue the hybrid system during physical hearings as well to enable advocates and litigants to appear virtually, if they so chose, and to permit litigants inside court rooms only if their presence is required. The decision will come into effect from Monday, August 2. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the PIL filed by Mohan Bhide, a chartered accountant and resident of Vile Parle was informed that in light of increase in the number of people getting double jabs, the authorities should be directed to permit such persons having valid Co-Win certificates to use all modes of public transport including local trains. The bench was also informed that another PIL filed on behalf of lawyers also sought similar directions. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state government informed the bench that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would be meeting the state Covid Task Force to review of the pandemic situation in Maharashtra and was likely to decide in this regard before evening. In light of this as the HC administrative committee meeting was scheduled for Thursday evening, the bench adjourned hearing of both petitions and stated that it would pass orders after the committee took a decision. “We hope they (state government) also decide on train travel. There are media reports that the government is thinking of permitting those who have got two doses of vaccinations to travel. We need someone to give us details on that meeting, as our (HC Administrative Committee) notice has to go out today. Let a decision be taken (by the government), then we will consider,” the bench had noted in the morning. The PILs will now be heard on Monday, August 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-to-start-physical-hearings-from-august-2-101627572356977.html

The regulator is believed to have made no tariff hike in view of the situation arising from the Covid-19 pandemic as well as assembly elections that are due early next year in UP. But the UPERC has issued some important directions to the UP Power Corporation Ltd/discoms (licencees). “The commission, taking into consideration the consolidated gap /(surplus) position of all the five state discoms, approves the existing rate schedule of FY 2020-21 (previous year) to continue to operate in FY 2021-22. Accordingly, no change in any slab and no tariff hike in any category/subcategory has been effected in FY 2021-22,” the commission said in its order. Welcoming the tariff order, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman and state advisory committee member Avdhesh Kumar Verma said: “The commission not only made no revision in the tariff, but also rejected the UPPCL’s proposal for changes in the tariff slabs and levy of regulatory surcharge. The order will give much relief to consumers in the Covid year.” UPERC chairman RP Singh said apart from retaining the old tariff, the commission had also not allowed any billing and collection inefficiency as doing so would amount to punishing honest bill payers and reward the bad behaviour of delinquents. “We have also not allowed any expenditure towards smart meters as claimed by the licensees since the rollout plan approved by the Commission earlier clearly stated that this was to be funded through efficiency gains by the licencee in terms of reduction of commercial losses,” he pointed out. For FY 2021-22 (the current year), the commission approved distribution loss at 11.08% as per the approved losses in Business Plan Order dated 27.10.2020 against the claim of 16.64%. “In addition to this, the commission has issued directions to the UPPCL for following up peer to peer energy exchange using Blockchain technology pilot forward to its next phase i.e. integrating it with the existing billing system (ERP)/ financial settlement etc so that P2P rooftop solar energy may become operational for the prosumers and consumers of the state,” Singh said. He said petitioners had been directed to expedite completion of the smart meter rollout and also submit the technical/financial impact of such rollout on their system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/consumers-in-up-spared-power-tariff-hike-for-second-consecutive-year-101627572177417.html

She will take on China’s former world champion and Olympic bronze medallist Li Qian on August 31.Before reaching the international podium, Pooja’s initial days of boxing were full of struggle. Her coach Sanjay Singh Sheoran, who runs Captain Hawa Singh Boxing Academy in Bhiwani, said she was first spotted by his wife Mukesh Rani, a lecturer at Adarsh Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Bhiwani when she got admission in bachelor’s degree in 2009.“Pooja’s father Rajbir Singh Bohra, who is a retired Haryana Police SI, did not want her to pursue boxing as he thought she might get injured. She used to stay at our home with my wife when she got some punches on her face. Later, we told her father about her potential and then he agreed. She used to train for six hours a day,” Sheoran said.“Her competitors are good and well-prepared boxers. A single mistake can take the game away from her. I have asked her to focus on her strengths. We are hoping that she will bring laurels to the nation,” he added.Her father said he was pushing her to get married for nearly five years but it was deferred after she requested the family to give her some time.“We were looking for a groom for Pooja, but she requested for a couple more years so that she can perform better at international levels. Now, we are hoping that she will clinch gold,” her father added.Sharing challenges faced by Pooja, he said she battled a career-threatening shoulder injury, a burnt hand and lack of financial support before making it this far.Hailing from Nimriwali, 9km from Bhiwani, Pooja used to cycle to Captain Hawa Singh Academy in the initial days. She is presently posted as an income tax officer in Delhi. In 2012, she had joined the Indian Railways as a clerk.“Before pursuing boxing, she used to play basketball and football. I asked her to quit the team game and start single-event game. When she defeated a Haryana Police boxer in 2010 in an event in Bhiwani, hundreds of people from our village had gone in tractor-trolleys to cheer for her,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pooja-defeated-career-threatening-injuries-financial-issues-to-reach-olympics-says-bhiwani-boxer-s-father-101627571637142.html

Former Vasai MLA Vivek Pandit, president of Shramjeevi Sanghatana, who is supporting the agitation said the workers were on the forefront, battling the Covid pandemic, and now since March, they have been denied their salaries. “The contractual workers were doing duty through a private labour contractor. The agent has blamed the Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC) for the pending payments,” said Pandit.The Centre had ordered all states and union territories to remit the salaries of Covid warriors on time. “The MBMC is not following the said order. Hence, the workers have started this agitation, by marching out of the civic hospital with begging bowls in their hands since Wednesday,” said Pandit.Sultan Patel, a frontline worker, said, “We risked our lives and in return, we are denied payment. There was no option left but to protest.”Dr Ashok Gite, chief medical officer, MBMC confirmed that the 156 contractual workers have not been paid since March. “We will release the amount within this week as soon as we receive the funds,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/156-mira-bhayander-covid-warriors-not-paid-since-march-stage-protest-101627570856968.html

A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pratapsing Chopadar, a retired principal from Miraj in Sangli district was informed by advocate Manoj Shirsat that the PIL was filed as the state had cancelled the Class 10 and 12 board exams, which are conducted by the MSBSHSE through government resolutions dated May 12 and June 9 respectively. Shirsat submitted that the MSBSHSE had recovered fees of ₹415 from the 17,65,829 students who registered for the Class 10 board exams and ₹520 from the 15,07,314 Class 12 students for the board exams to be held in 2020. As the statistics for the number of students registered for the exams for 2021 were not available, he was assuming the figures for last year and said that the board had collected ₹80 crore and ₹70 crore from the Class 10 and 12 students, respectively, but as the exams were cancelled based on the two GR’s, the state was bound to refund the fees. Chopadar’s petition further states that he had made a representation to the chairman of the MSBSHSE at Pune but as there was no response he had no option but to approach the HC through the PIL. After perusing the PIL and hearing the submissions by Shirsat, the court directed the chairman MSBSHSE to decide on the representation made by Chopadar expeditiously, preferably within four weeks and also decide on the quantum of the amount to be refunded and disposed of the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/decide-on-plea-over-class-10-12-exam-fees-refund-hc-tells-maharashtra-board-101627570556849.html

Maharashtra has vaccinated at least more than 1 crore people with one dose of the vaccine, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.Tope earlier on Thursday said that the rise in infections in the UK and some countries of the European Union has made the state government cautious regarding reopening at a faster pace. “Several nations have reintroduced lockdown to curb the chain of transmission and stop the spreading of Covid-19. The same challenges are before us well,” he said.Maharashtra reported a marginal rise in the number of new cases on Wednesday as it reported 6,857 new cases, reporting 599 more cases.

This is my first visit (as CM), this will be to greet them and take their blessings,” news agency PTI quoted the chief minister as saying.“When I go to Delhi to meet the party leadership, I will also try to meet our Members of Parliament and central ministers from Karnataka on the pending projects and issues concerning the state,” he added.Bommai also said that he would seek the leadership’s time to discuss the cabinet expansion in the state and it might be finalised during the visit.

He took oath as the CM on Wednesday.Earlier on Wednesday, Bommai said that Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and G Kishan Reddy, who were BJP’s central observers for Karnataka, wanted to discuss the cabinet expansion after they go to Delhi. “I had met central observers Dharmendra Pradhan, Kishan Reddy and general secretary (Arun) Singh (in the morning), they said let's not discuss it today, once they go back to Delhi let's see,” he said.Meanwhile, Jagadish Shettar, former Karnataka chief minister and a minister in Yediyurappa’s cabinet, said that he had decided to not be a part of the new cabinet. “As I am a former chief minister and have seniority, I have decided not to be a part of the new cabinet.

29-07-2021||Patna||Rebuked by parents for online game addiction, Bihar teens attempt suicide||Two teenagers from Bihar’s Gopalganj district attempted suicide in separate incidents after their parents scolded them for playing online games on Wednesday evening, officials said. The incident occurred at Uchkagaon and Manjhagarh police station areas of the district.Police claimed that the two minor boys aged between 12 and 14 years and were addicted to online games. The Gopalganj police said, in the first incident, the 12-year-old schoolboy, a resident of Arna Bazar village under Uchkagaon police station, used a towel to hang himself in a room at his home, while his mother was cooking in another room. According to the boy’s parents, he was addicted to playing a game called Free Fire, for which he was reprimanded. His father, Balister Shah, who is a small-time farmer, confiscated the phone on Wednesday evening in an attempt to stop his son from playing the game. He was brought to Sadar Hospital in an unconscious state while the doctor referred him to Gorakhpur for further treatment. In the second incident, a 14-year-old hung himself from the ceiling fan at his house at Nawkatola village under Manjhagarh police station but was rushed in time to a nearby primary health centre where the doctor referred him to Sadar Hospital in critical condition.The boy’s father Lotan Choudhary said that immediately after his mother scolded him, the boy, extremely upset, went into the room. When he did not come out for a long time, the family members broke the bathroom door and found him hanging from the ceiling, though alive. Meanwhile, the boy’s father appealed that the government should ban such games.“My child got depressed whenever we stopped him from playing the game. I don’t want such an incident to happen again. I request the government to ban such games,” Choudhary said.Professor Ranbijay Sinha from the psychology department of Magadh University, said, internet gaming disorder is like an addiction. “Because of this, a person doesn’t show interest in other works and gets addicted to gaming only,” he said. He said parents need to keep an eye on children’s online behaviours early to prevent possible addiction. “Mobile use of children should be regulated by the parents. They should evaluate their internet and mobile use regularly,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rebuked-by-parents-for-online-game-addiction-bihar-teens-attempt-suicide-101627565996319.html

The police on Thursday also formed a 14-member special investigation team (SIT) headed by additional director general of police Sanjay Anand Lathkar to investigate the matter after the Jharkhand high court on Thursday took suo motu cognizance of the incident. Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana too spoke to the chief justice of the Jharkand high court Ravi Ranjan on the issue. Director general of police Neeraj Sinha and Dhanbad senior superintendent of police Sanjeev Kumar attended the hearing in the high court in person and provided details of the investigation to the bench of the chief justice. Also Read | Dhanbad judge dies in ‘road accident’, SIT to probe“Prima facie it appears that the additional district judge has been killed deliberately. The police took immediate action and arrested the two persons who were riding the vehicle and recovered the auto rickshaw. Their interrogation is on. A 14-member SIT has also been constituted to investigate the incident. It is a very sensitive matter and we will ensure that probe is completed and conduct a speedy trial and punish the guilty,” said Jharkhand advocate general Rajiv Ranjan, who appeared on behalf of the government before the high court. Responding to the bench’s remark that it would transfer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation if the investigation was not done professionally, the AG said while it was prerogative of the court to do this, the progress in investigation after the incident has been satisfactory.The police have filed a murder case in the incident after CCTV camera footage of the incident showed a vehicle deliberately swerving on an empty road to knock down the judge. Uttam Anand was killed on Wednesday morning after he was hit by an unidentified vehicle near the magistrate colony when he was out for his daily morning walk. The auto rickshaw used in the incident, which was allegedly stolen from Dhanbad, was later recovered from the neighbouring Giridh district on Wednesday night itself. “Based on facts that came up during investigation and the CCTV camera footage, two people and the auto involved in the crime were identified. Two persons, identified as Lakhan Kumar Verma and Rahul Verma have been arrested and the auto was seized from their possession. They have confessed to the crime. Further investigation will be done carefully,” said Amol V Homkar, inspector general (operations). While the police are yet to reveal the motive of the alleged killers, the family of the judge, who was cremated in his hometown Hazaribag, demanded a CBI probe. “The CCTV camera footage makes it very clear that it has been done as part of conspiracy. We demand an impartial probe headed by a judge or the CBI,” Subham Sambhu, younger brother of Anand told reporters. Judge Anand was reportedly hearing some high profile criminal cases. He recently rejected the bail plea of a gangster from Uttar Pradesh who is in jail in connection with a high profile murder case of Dhanbad.In Delhi, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president and senior advocate Vikas Singh made a demand for an independent probe by CBI into the death of Anand.Mentioning the matter before the Supreme Court, initially before a bench headed by Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and later before CJI NV Ramana, Singh said: “This is an attack on judicial independence. If judiciary has to remain independent, judges have to be safe. An ADJ cannot be killed in this manner. This matter should be probed by CBI as local police can be complicit.” CJI Ramana who specially took up the case told the SCBA President that he has spoken to chief justice Ravi Ranjan of Jharkhand high court, who assured him that the matter will be taken up by the high court on the judicial side. “The chief justice f the high court has spoken to Senior Superintendent of Police, Dhanbad. Even the secretary general (of the Supreme Court) spoke to registrar general of the high court this morning. If there is any need for us to be involved, we will take it up.”The CJI appreciated the concern shown by the Bar saying, “We are overwhelmed at the initiative shown by SCBA. We appreciate the steps taken but let us not jump into conclusions.”Suspecting it to be a murder, Singh said that the ADJ recently rejected the bail of a notorious gangster and the matter needed probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/dhanbad-judge-death-2-held-vehicle-seized-adg-heads-sit-probe-101627563897134.html

Tope's comment on Mumbai locals came as he announced further relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions in 25 districts of the state.Mumbai suburban trains are open for a limited number of passengers. Passengers' woes have now snowballed into a political issue and the BJP is threatening the government that its party workers will travel by local trains from August 2, if travel restrictions are not relaxed. Pressure to reopen Mumbai locals to fully vaccinated people has been mounting on the government from MNS too as Raj Thackeray wrote to Uddhav Thackeray stating that this restriction is not coming to any use as Mumbai local passengers are now crowding buses. The BJP has also demanded that the state government should pay ₹5,000 per person if it does not reopen suburban railway services.Mumbai's guardian minister Aslam Shaik on Wednesday said that personally, he was of the opinion that people who have got both the doses of their Covid-19 vaccine should be allowed to travel by local trains. The minister said that a detailed discussion on this issue took place in one of the recent Cabinet meetings.Local trains, which are now only carrying essential staff, were suspended last year during the nationwide lockdown and then the services were restored in several phases for the specific essential categories of travellers, including lawyers, people travelling for treatment etc. Women passengers were also allowed for a specific timing.

The admission process is set to start on August 1 in the state and around 1.17 million students are expected to apply for admissions to higher educational institutes. Students seeking admissions will have to submit declarations that there are no pending cases against them to get admissions.“College principals have been asked to take an undertaking from every student while giving admission that he or she is not facing any criminal charges in any state of India,” said a college principal, who did not want to be named.Students found guilty of misbehaving with faculty, staff, or other students and vandalising property will also not get admissions.A 48-page new rule book for admissions was notified on July 15 and made available to colleges earlier this week.Student leaders have taken exception to the rules saying they could be misused for targeting students on an ideological basis and for participating in protests against the government or colleges.“First they banned direct student union elections and now this rule is to stop students from participating in the protests against the government,” said Ajay Tiwari, state secretary of the Students Federation of India. He pointed out that students across the state have participated in protests against inflation, three farm laws, and corruption. Tiwari added in some instances, the protesting students were even booked for rioting.“So, many of these students will be denied their constitutional right to education because they expressed their constitutional right to protest and dissent,” Tiwari said.Gopil Kotwal of the National Students Union of India said the rules would prevent student leaders from emerging from colleges. “Most of the leaders, who did not come from political families, rose as a result of active participation in student politics. Now the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)-led state government does not want colleges to produce good leaders,” he said.The Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh’s students wing, Akhil Bhartiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP), called the rules bizarre and unacceptable.“This will definitely end student politics and is against one’s right to education,” said ABVP’s state secretary Praveen Sharma. He added the rules deny a chance to an accused to improve and live a better life. “How can college authorities decide the future of a student even before the court passes its order?” he asked.Congress lawmaker Kunal Chaudhary said he will raise the issue in assembly as the rules violate the right to education and are discriminatory. “We will not allow this autocratic rule. We will raise this issue in the assembly,” he said.Ruling BJP leader Rajneesh Agrawal backed the rules saying they will not suppress student politics. “Students can raise the issues through peaceful protests as they can learn discipline and respect for the Constitution.”Former high court judge AK Gohil said the Constitution has made education till higher secondary level a fundamental right and the rules punish someone even before a court has taken a view. He called the rules discriminatory.“I think the government should give provisional or conditional admission to students with criminal charges to save their future. If proved guilty, their admission should be cancelled.”Higher education department principal secretary Anupam Rajan said they will ensure more clarity in the rules so that genuine students do not suffer. “We will come with a clarification soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/no-admission-for-students-facing-criminal-charges-new-madhya-pradesh-rules-101627563238352.html

The cops registered a case of kidnapping against the groom and began investigations, said officials.A video purportedly showing the commotion created by the Karni Sena activists surfaced online on Thursday in which the Dalit woman could be heard saying she was marrying the Muslim man willingly.One Dilshad Ahmed, 23, along with a 19-year-old burqa-clad woman, reached the office of marriage registrar on the tehsil premises in Ballia on Thursday. Some Karni Sena members, who were present there, stopped the duo from entering the office of the registrar, alleging that the woman was being forced to embrace Islam to marry Dilshad.The police intervened in the matter and the woman’s father was called. He alleged that Dilshad had kidnapped his daughter on Wednesday and also submitted a police complaint in this regard at Ubhaon police station, on the basis of which an FIR of kidnapping was lodged against Dilshad.SP (Ballia) Vipin Tada said, “The woman has been handed over to the district women and child welfare committee and the man has been detained. The woman will be presented before a magistrate to record her statement on Friday and further action in the case will be taken on the basis of her statements.”He said no ‘love jihad’ angle, as alleged by the Karni Sena activists, had come to fore so far. He did not respond to questions on the alleged ruckus created by the Karni Sena activists.While Karni Sena members and the woman’s father alleged that she was kidnapped and forced to convert, Dilshad’s family members refuted this claim.“Dilshad and the woman know each other for the last couple of years. They both wanted to marry, but their families were against it. The woman was forcefully married to a man in Shahjahanpur last year, but she returned home after a few months. I think Dilshad and the woman got married secretly and went to court to register their marriage,” informed Dilshad’s cousin Akram Ahmad.“Now, some politically connected people have influenced the woman’s father and they are trying to make it look like a case of forceful conversion,” he added.

In the test check districts, less than one per cent (146 out of 22,678 willing landless households) were issued job cards and survey work was discontinued. Specific plans, as required, for providing employment opportunity to the vulnerable group of households were not prepared,” stated the report which was tabled in the Bihar legislative assembly on Thursday.The audit observed that only 9%-14% of the registered disabled persons and 5%-9% of senior citizens (60 years and above) were provided employment under the scheme during the 2014-19 period in the state. “Overall, during the lean period (July to November), against the work demanded by 26%-36%, only 2%-9% of households were provided employment during 2014-19. Besides, only 14% of total works taken up were completed in respect of works for the creation of durable assets despite directions from the ministry of rural development, while 65% work remained incomplete for one to five years and 61% did not even start,” said the report, which focused on the implementation of MNREGS.It underlines a very low achievement against the target of focus area and poor convergences of MNREGS work with the schemes of other departments, viz. forests, agriculture, rural development, panchayati raj etc. “Overall, households that availed 100 days employment ranged between less than 1% and 3% of the demand in the state and only 14% work taken up during 2014-19 were completed,” the report added.According to the report, during the 2014-19 period, the state utilised schemes funds to the tune of ₹10,960.52 crore (98%) out of available funds of 11,181.72 crore. Wage employment was provided to 99.44 lakh households. On average, households earned wages amounting to ₹33,642 in the state during the period, lower than the national average of ₹37,639. Bihar was ranked 21st in the country in terms of average wage generation.The report has pointed out deficiencies, with respect to non-reporting of social audit finding/quality of report, non-maintenance of complaint register, vacancy in the office of ombudsman and lack of 10-member vigilance and monitoring committee at the level of gram panchayat as per scheme guidelines, non-immunisation of wage slip to workers, irregularity in payment of wages through E-Shakti programme and improper maintenance of records and registers.“Institutional arrangements and measures taken for capacity building for implementation of the scheme need to be further strengthened. There was an acute shortage of manpower in test-checked districts (37%) and at the state level (42%) in various cadres of posts. Financial management was deficient as observed through huge liabilities in respect of pending wages and cost of materials, diversion of scheme funds, pending adjustment of advanced since long, non-closure of inoperative bank accounts, etc. There was low employment generation in the state,” the report said, stressing the need for a “bottom-up approach of planning”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cag-report-flags-low-job-generation-under-mgnrega-in-bihar-101627561916117.html

Among the leaders present at the procession was party leader Madan Mitra, who walked blindfoldedTMC supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already directed the formation of a commission to probe into the Pegasus issue, which has kept the Opposition and the NDA-led Centre at loggerheads since its disclosure on July 18. West Bengal became the first Indian state to officially initiate a probe into the matter.Banerjee is currently on a five-day visit to the national capital. Addressing the media at Nabanna, the state secretariat, before leaving for Delhi, Banerjee said, “The cabinet has approved the appointment of a commission of inquiry…in the matter of widely reported illegal hacking, monitoring, putting under surveillance, tracking, recording, etc. of mobile phones of various persons in the state of West Bengal.”The West Bengal chief minister has, on several occasions in the past, alleged that her phone was being tapped. Last week, she hinted that a high-level TMC meeting attended by her along with political strategist Prashant Kishor, TMC leader (and Banerjee’s nephew) Abhishek Banerjee, and party’s West Bengal president Subrata Bakshi, ahead of the conclusion of the recent assembly polls, was snooped into using surveillance tools.“The mobile phones were with us, even though we were not talking on the phone. The entire meeting was recorded. We came to know after PK (Prashant Kishor) got his phone audited. Can you imagine how dangerous it is?” she added.Notably, both Kishor – who played a prominent role in TMC’s landslide victory in 2021 assembly polls — and Abhishek were named in the list of potential targets.Banerjee further stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must summon an all-party meeting to discuss the Pegasus issue.“When I talk to Prashant Kishore, [and] Abhishek Banerjee, my phone is hacked. Please remember that,” she added on Wednesday.The chief minister has already met several significant Opposition leaders on her Delhi visit, including Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi, party leader Rahul Gandhi, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, among others.With focus on strengthening the central Opposition’s presence, Banerjee said that she hopes the entire opposition can come together and “create history” in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Also Read | 'Poore desh me khela hobe': Mamata on Opposition’s unity ahead of 2024 electionsMeanwhile, the Opposition’s uproar over Pegasus snooping row saw both Houses of the Parliament get adjourned yet again on Thursday.

Additional district and sessions judge Uttam Anand died after being hit from behind by an "unidentified vehicle" while out on a routine morning walk in what initially appeared as a "routine" accident. However, the emergence of a CCTV footage, in which the three-wheeler can be seen swerving from its path, hitting the judge, and fleeing from the spot, has led to a theory that the accident could, in fact, be "pre-planned."A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was constituted to probe the incident. Two people have been arrested till now, and the three-wheeler, an auto, has been seized from them, according to ANI.Based on facts that came up during investigation & CCTV footage, 2 people & auto involved in the crime were identified.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said that the dispute can be resolved by talks.""It feels like the Mizo people wish to settle the dispute via arms and ammunitions. If it is so, then, this approach itself is wrong.

29-07-2021||Delhi||Covid no bar: Weddings become big, fat again?||The pandemic may have shrunk the grandeur of a big fat Indian wedding but tying the knot still doesn’t mean dull celebrations. To keep up with the city’s ‘showshaa’ culture, couples-to-be are again hiring celebs such as popular TV actors and singers to perform at wedding festivities. Entertainment specialists say there was a sharp decline at the beginning of the pandemic but the demand has again gone up, especially at destination weddings, as restrictions eased.Pawan Chawla, celebrity manager says, “Pehle bilkul dead ho chuka tha. Now it’s coming back to normal. Moreover, ours is celebrity-obsessed nation so couples are now keen to hire artists. The demand is up for destination weddings in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan due to relaxed restrictions as compared to Delhi.” Gaurav Sharma, AGM operations, Rashi Entertainment, says, “Chote scale ki wedding hai toh we get chote artistes – it all depends on the budget.”Hosts are ready to spend between ₹5-50 lakh for a 60-90 minute performance, vendors say. The purpose to get artists perform at an intimate wedding is for an added entertainment factor. Couples believe that a singer or a well-known DJ can deliver more than an actor and keep the crowd grooving. Chawla adds, “Actor ko bulane wale kam hote hai. Logo ki demand singers ke prati jyada hai, kyunki choti wedding mein bhi thoda entertainment chaiye.” However, Sharma opines that even with the reduced guest list, adhering to the restricted numbers and following all Covid protocols is the top priority. Similarly, to continue to take all precautions measures in the current times, wedding vendors are given a lowdown before hand. A photographer who was at a destination wedding in Kolkata where a renowned rapper and singer performed last week says, “We were given clear instructions about social distancing. Non-vaccinated staff of our group or even family members weren’t allowed to be near the performer. Moreover, to avoid coming under scrutiny, guests were also clearly instructed to not post about the performances on social media or ‘tag’ the artists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-no-bar-weddings-become-big-fat-again-101627559155878.html

29-07-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Revolution on the menu at Pune Bhojangruha||The opening of “Pune Bhojangruha” in June 1881 heralded a new beginning for Pune city. Even though the first “native” restaurant in erstwhile Maharashtra shut down within four years, it paved the way for others.“Pune Bhojanagruha” was started by Narayan Ramchandra & Co and actively supported by Vishnushastri Chiplunkar and Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, as is evident from advertisements and articles that appeared in “Kesari”. Who was Narayan Ramchandra? Why did he start a restaurant in conservative Pune? Why did one of the most popular leaders of the time, Chiplunkar, his friends, and associates take an active interest in the “Bhojanagruha”?Since the “Bhojanagruha” served only Brahmins, it was clear that Narayan Ramchandra would have been one. It was most likely that he was a Chitpavan Konknastha Brahmin, because the economy of erstwhile Pune was dominated by this caste. He lived in Pune between 1881 and 1885.Looking for Narayan Ramchandra without a surname was cumbersome. It was customary in Maharashtra to not use surnames till the end of the 19th century. Surnames appeared in the public sphere after the British established universities and schools and made the usage of surnames compulsory. Still, many preferred not using their surnames. Like, Narayan Ramchandra. He might also have not used his surname because of the stigma associated with public dining. Several Narayan Ramchandras appeared in newspapers like “Kesari” between 1880 and 1920, and were likely to have the capital to start a restaurant. There was Narayan Ramchandra Kelkar who was known for his wooden toys and had a workshop in Sawantwadi. Another NR Kelkar owned a perfumery in Kannauj. NR Sowani owned a printing press in Bombay, while NR Oak was a renowned paper merchant. NR Gogate exported arrowroot powder and biscuits to the UK and was based in Dapoli. NR Gokhale was an actor. Both Gogate and Gokhale were associates of BG Tilak at some point in time.However, none of them were the proprietor of the “Bhojanagruha”. I was able to trace the families of most of these men and found that they had no association with “Bhojanagruha”. “Kulavruttantas” (documentation of clans bearing the same surnames) corroborate this conclusion.The reports of Poona Municipality published between 1881 and 1920 do not mention “Pune Bhojanagruha” at all. They do, however, mention a few Narayan Ramchandras. NR Dikshit had a feud with the municipality because the latter seized some of his lands for widening a lane. NR Alawani had supported a candidate in the municipality elections held in 1895. Dikshit had passed away in 1882, and Alawani was a priest who spent his entire life at the Modi Ganpati temple.There were several other Narayan Ramchandras in the kulavruttantas, both Narayan and Ramchandra being fairly common names. None of them seemed to have anything to do with the “Bhojanagruha”. It was easy to rule them out because they did not live in Pune in the early 1880s.On January 25 and February 22 in 1881, “Kesari” published lists of donors and subscribers. These included the Royals from Baroda and Indore, “noble” families like Kibe, Natu, Mujumdar, and Paranjape, and social leaders like Mahadev Govind Ranade and Moreshwar Mahadev Kunte. There were several distinguished gentlemen from other parts of Maharashtra. However, one name in the list caught my attention - Narayan Ramchandra Pongashe. He had visited the “Kesari” office himself and had subscribed to the newspaper for Re. 1.According to the “Ponkshe Kulavruttanta”, born in 1849, Narayan Ramchandra Ponkshe (also spelled as Pongashe) worked in a government office for a few months after passing his matriculation exam. But, craving for independence and not wanting to work for the British, he resigned and opened a grocery shop in Budhwar peth which he ran dedicatedly for 35 years. He passed away in 1919. The entry in the kulavruttanta does not mention any restaurant.I was able to trace his family which unfortunately did not know about the “Bhojanagruha”. However, some events in Pokshe’s life point towards his likely association with Chiplunkar and “Pune Bhojanagruha”. Ponkshe and Chiplunkar were born a year apart. They were neighbours while growing up in Pune. Ponkshe was one of the few outside the royalty and nobility to have subscribed to “Kesari” during the first month of its inception.During the first year of its publication, “Kesari” published only a few ads. Those came from Dr Garde, who was one of the owners of the newspaper, Nuserwanjee Nowrojee, the owner of Napier Hotel and an ice factory, Rawji Shridhar Gondhalekar, the publisher, and “Pune Bhojanagruha”. Nowrojee and Gondhalekar were subscribers of the newspaper. So was Ponkshe, a fact that points towards the possible ownership of the restaurant.However, a series of reports published in the newspaper “Native Opinion” from June 1879 bolster the claim that Ponkshe ran “Bhojanagruha”. On the night of May 13, 1879, both Visrambaugwada and Budhwarwada caught fire. Vishrambaugwada housed the Government English School and the office of the Education Inspector. Budhwarwada had the Government Treasury, Magistrate Courts, a temporary jail, post office, Government Marathi School, Poona Native General Library and the government book depot. Vishrambaugwada survived the fire, but Budhwarwada burned down to ashes. The police initially suspected that Vasudeo Balwant Phadke, the freedom fighter, was behind the arson. After a week of investigations, they arrested Krishnarao Ranade, the keeper of the book depot in Budhwarwada, his son Keshav and the manager Shyamrao Ballal. It was revealed that Ranade and Ballal had forged receipts for many years and had committed fraud. After realising that they would be caught, they set the wada on fire, in the hope that the financial records would be destroyed, and the act would be blamed on Phadke. . Narayan Ramchandra Ponkshe was mentioned by Keshav as a friend of Phadke. According to the report in “Native Opinion”, Ponkshe, Moro Balwant Khare, Chinto Bhikaji Vaidya, Vishnu Balwant Khare, Govind Bhikaji Date, and Ganesh Deodhar would often spend time at the Khunya Murlidhar Temple. They were educated, but unemployed and wanted to fight against the British. They had requested Phadke to teach them warfare techniques. The request was turned down because Phadke was not willing to teach them for free. All the men were interrogated and were found to have no role in the arson.This incident, however, establishes Ponkshe as a staunch nationalist, and someone Chiplunkar would be fond of. Ponkshe was educated, hated the British, and did not want to serve them. Chiplunkar encouraged youngsters who harboured nationalist thoughts and encouraged them to start “native” institutions and businesses. Chiplunkar and Ponkshe might have come together to start a restaurant, which they felt was necessary for the development of the city and the country.Narayan Ramchandra Ponkshe’s name did not appear in print after the fire. The ads stopped after 1882 and the restaurant shut down in 1884. Ponkshe’s immense contribution to the hospitality industry in Maharashtra has unfortunately never been acknowledged. Gopal Ganesh Agarkar’s monumental efforts to encourage men and women to start restaurants have been forgotten too. More about this next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-revolution-on-the-menu-at-pune-bhojangruha-101627556815713.html

Despite a heavy case load being reported from villages, the administration has lowered its RT-PCR testing numbers, in comparison with the rapid antigen tests (RAT). The ratio of RTPCR and RAT tests, which has to be maintained at 70:30, is now at 50:50, or even 60:40, with RAT tests dominating in Pune rural. RAT tests have been known to give false negatives and RTPCR tests are considered to be the gold standard for testing. As per the district information office, on Tuesday, while the district reported 960 new Covid-19 cases, of which 544 cases came from Pune rural. On Monday, Pune district reported 718 new cases, of which councils and villages reported 417 cases. On Sunday, Pune reported 1,100 new Covid-19 cases, of which 673 cases came from the villages and councils. The share of RAT tests among the overall covid testing has been much higher. With the a higher number of RAT tests, the positivity rate may appear lower, as it may also include false negatives. This is why the state government has made it mandatory to consider only RTPCR positives before announcing any relaxations or lower the restrictions in any district.However, the district administration has defended the use of RAT tests for mass testing and super spreaders testing. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Zilla Parishad, said, “This is because of the mass testing that we conduct at market places and among super spreaders for early detection and isolation. During the survey conducted in June and July, among super spreaders in rural areas we found the positivity rate to be lower than 3% and sometimes when we get a positive patient, there is demand from the relatives to get their results earlier. However if someone is symptomatic, or is a high-risk contact of a Covid-19 positive person we go for RTPCR test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zp-defends-use-of-rat-tests-in-pune-rural-despite-high-case-load-101627552734315.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||A memorable swansong to the tunes of pure emotions||The stage of our school was majestically bedecked to mark a grand celebration. This wasn’t the first time I was sitting on a stately couch meant for dignitaries nevertheless I was nervous like never and overcautious to check my formal gestures lest my inner edginess should get into public sphere. The announcement of my name by the chief compère sent ripples of excitement among the audience, awaiting my address. Amid the applause, my fidgeting hands rechecked the list in the flap-pocket, feeling the accentuated heartbeats beneath the garlands weighing down my neck. Standing at the podium, my gaze swept rapidly around, scanning the audience of all ages, including my family and friends, who had gathered to observe my retirement day. My entire professional life seemed to have condensed into a hall, thanks to the pure-hearted participation from those in attendance. Many of them had already taken turns at the microphone to express their genuine feelings about me, ranging from anecdotes to heart-warming poetry to amusing sher-o-shayari on peculiarities of my fundamental traits. A few subordinates even tapped the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take a satirical jab at my well-known gung-ho approach to getting work done in the stipulated time. With my clumsy hands, I fished out the list consisting of names of all those who deserved my sincerest gratitude for standing by me through thick and thin. On top of the list shone the names of my parents who’d sacrificed their basic needs to ensure quality education to their eldest child with the hope that he would help the family rise from poverty. Eventually, an emotionally stirring moment came requiring me to spell the contribution of my late wife whose name literally stuck on my lips, converting the longstanding lump in my throat into a downpour of tears, belying my commanding disposition; same was the case with my three children in the front row. However, my new abbreviation for the term GPF, usually attributed to General Provident Fund, lightened up the emotional heaviness in the air. I pointed at my peers and announced that they were indeed my GPF or Gift of Priceless Friends, who would never let me run bankrupt. A self-written verse with which I concluded the speech drew cheers and claps: Har kisi ko apne aaghosh mein leta hai, yeh waqt hai bada balwaan, Jissne meri bhi ‘jawaani’ budhi karr di, aur ‘budhaapa’ karr diya jawaan! (Time takes everything in its powerful fold so is my youth, now my old age is taking a ‘young’ lead). Just as I was about to sit in the car to leave, the emotional clerk of our school held my hand, urging me not to leave. Silence for half a minute and he let out the secret of how I’d helped him financially. Bidding adieu, I announced on purpose in my signature sonorous voice that their retired headmaster, now with a new word ‘ex’ prefixed to his designation, would visit his old peers frequently. A theatrical declaration coated with formalism from my side led to reluctant and unbelieving smiles on the faces of the staff, quite understandably. ak.bhardwaj3103@gmail.com The writer is a Mukerian-based retired headmaster of a government school||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-memorable-swansong-to-the-tunes-of-pure-emotions-101627551894903.html

On Wednesday, the ministry announced the first stage results in which 11 cities were awarded India’s cycling pioneers and 14 others cities, including New Delhi, were recognised for their initiatives. These 25 were selected out of 107 cities that had participated in the event.While 11 cities, including Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Rajkot, etc. were adjudged top cities for their initiatives, New Delhi finds mention in the list of 10 “cycling pioneers” cities.Also Read | Bommai remains tight lipped on new cabinet, says decision after Delhi visitWhile announcing the list of awardees on Wednesday, Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary HUA ministry, said, “2020 ignited India’s cycling revolution.

The results have been resounding: more people are cyclin,g; city officials and public representatives are leading by example—cycling to work—and we are backing the city’s efforts with investments.”In New Delhi, the NDMC roped in the artist community in creating a vibrant cycling plaza. As part of the challenge, the NDMC conducted a week-long pilot to demonstrate and test a 6km-long corridor from India Gate to Lodhi Colony. The civic body roped in artists to paint the streets in a neighbourhood, Lodhi Colony, to create a vibrant cycling plaza.Last year, while the coronavirus disease brought cities to a halt, there was a surge in the number of people cycling in cities when the lockdown restrictions were relaxed. Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) is the knowledge partner with the ministry in its Cycle4Change challenge.In the next phase of the challenge, these 25 cities will take the idea of a cycling-friendly city by adopting policies, setting up dedicated departments and creating city-wide plans.“Create streets for cycling and cyclists will come. We saw clear signs of this in cities across India in the past year. But this is just the beginning. Cities must now scale up these interventions to make cycling safe and fun for everyone,” Shreya Gadepalli, South East Asia Programme Lead, ITDP.“NDMC’s collaboration with local designers and artists to make Lodhi Estate attractive to cycle around was lauded by citizens. It must now scale up the Cycles4Change initiative to make every corner of New Delhi safe and fun for everyone to cycle, and become a model for every Indian city to emulate,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-delhi-among-25-smart-cities-with-cycle-friendly-infrastructure-101627535813305.html

Minister says decision in 2-3 days||Maharashtra may soon allow people who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to travel on its local trains unrestricted. State cabinet minister Aslam Shaik said on Wednesday that a decision can be taken in two or three days."As a minister, I am also of the view that person whose two doses are completed should be allowed to travel in Mumbai local, we have also informed Chief Minister about this. After studying the report by the task force, a decision on Mumbai local will be taken in next two to three days," Shaikh, who is the guardian minister of Mumbai, said while speaking to mediapersons.He added that a detailed discussion took place in one of the cabinet meetings recently about allowing fully vaccinated people to travel in suburban trains and BrihanMumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses.The Maharashtra government started easing the Covid-19 curbs in the state as cases of the disease showed a decline. But, in view of the second wave of Covid-19 and delta plus variant spreading fast, some of the curbs were brought back. The state imposed stricter norms by reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three after cases of delta plus variants were found last month.The local trains, considered lifeline of Mumbai, were allowed to run but never completely opened for public. They are currently operational for just essential service employees.The demand for resumption of suburban train services for the general public has been gaining steam. Many citizen groups and political leaders have urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to allow general public to travel on these trains.To check travellers to board the trains using fake ID cards, the Maharashtra government introduced a QR code based universal travel pass.The fresh set of instructions to allow local trains to resume service, but only for specific category of people, were issued in June by the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The notification stated that local trains will remain available for "medical, few essentials", and authorised the civic administrations to put additional restrictions they deem fit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-to-allow-those-fully-vaccinated-minister-says-decision-in-2-3-days-101627527041262.html

The court had on Tuesday refused to give any relief to Kundra, husband of actor Shila Shetty, and adjourned the hearing on his bail plea to July 29.The court has asked the investigating officer to remain present during the hearing in the pornography racket case.Kundra was arrested on July 19 along with 11 others on charges related to alleged creation of pornographic films. Kundra and his associate Ryan Thorpe are currently under judicial custody. They were sent to the judicial remand for 14 days by a magistrate's court on Tuesday.He moved the magistrate's court for bail, which rejected his petition on Wednesday.During the hearing on Kundra's bail plea in the high court on Tuesday, his lawyers Aabad Ponda and Subhash Jadhav argued that the police failed to follow the procedure laid down in law and ought to have first issued a notice under section 41A of the CrPC instead of arresting the businessman directly. Public prosecutor Aruna Kamat Pai refuted the claim and said a notice was indeed issued to Kundra before he was placed under arrest.The high court then directed Pai to file an affidavit on July 29 in response to the petition.Kundra also said in his plea that the material which the police claimed to be pornographic did not depict direct or explicit sexual acts. His petition claimed that the short movies appeal to the prurient interest of persons at best.But the high court refused to grant any relief to Kundra without giving a chance to the prosecution to respond to the petition. “No ex-parte ad-interim relief,” the bench said.Kundra has been named as the key conspirator in the pornography racket case by the Mumbai Police, which has slapped charges against him under Sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention), 292, and 293 (related to obscene and indecent advertisements and displays) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) besides relevant sections of the IT Act and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-to-hear-raj-kundra-s-bail-plea-today-in-pornography-case-101627516540997.html

The rainfall on Wednesday exposed the chinks in the civic body’s planning as the road became waterlogged as usual despite the installation of sewer lines in the area. Around ₹38 crore is being spent on developing the Malhar Road into a smart road, and the Sarabha Nagar market retrofitting project. The deadline of the project is September-end. During an inspection, mayor Balkar Sandhu, municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and councillor Mamta Ashu pointed out that the interlocking tiles were not level, and there were depressions in the interlocking at a few places, which was causing the upcoming smart road to become waterlogged. A shopkeeper in the area pointed out that carving out a walking area outside commercial units had left little space for parking. The mayor said,” Action will be taken against officials as well if they fail to monitor the quality of work. We carried out the inspection when it was raining heavily to identify the problem areas. While we are working to eliminate the persisting waterlogging issues across the city, the problem should be nipped in the bid in projects that are still underway.” The smart road project at Malhar Road includes establishment of a storm-water sewer, 24/7 water supply, underground wiring, cycle tracks, and beautification among other components.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mayor-pulls-up-officials-for-dropping-the-ball-on-smart-road-project-101627504551182.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana roads waterlogged again after incessant rain||The monsoons are here and so is waterlogging. With the city receiving incessant rain on Wednesday, both motorists and pedestrians had a tough time negotiating the waterlogged roads.  Even in areas that received moderate rain, the water accumulated on the roads. Waterlogging was witnessed at Chandigarh Road, Jamalpur, Gill Road, Miller Ganj, and the Jalandhar Bypass among other areas. The slick roads also caused traffic snarls at several points. Slamming the civic body for failing to find a solution to this long-pending issue, Premjit Singh, a resident of Sector-39, said, “Every monsoon we file complaints about waterlogged roads and overflowing sewer lines. However, nothing is done to rectify the issue. The foul smell of the sewer makes it difficult to leave our houses.” A shopkeeper at Gill Road, who requested anonymity, however, holds a bleak view and says there is no point holding one’s breath hoping for a resolution “as the MC has not even been able to resolve the waterlogging issue outside its Zone C office!”A cycle parts manufacturer in the Miller Ganj area, Namandeep Singh said,”It is difficult to cross Gill Road if the city receives heavy rainfall. One cannot even step out of their vehicle due to waterlogging. Tall claims have been made by the authorities to resolve the problem, but no concrete steps have been taken.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that the MC is working to resolve waterlogging at chronic points. “The issue has already been resolved at old GT Road near the Clock Tower, Rani Jhansi Road, Panj Peer Road, and Dholewal Chowk among other areas. The problem at Gill Road, Chandigarh Road and other areas will also be resolved soon. Sewer lines have been cleaned due to which the accumulated water drains out quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-roads-waterlogged-again-after-incessant-rain-101627504311696.html

29-07-2021||Chandigarh||HT interview: Political thought process behind farmers’ agitation, says INLD supremo OP Chautala||Out of jail after serving 10-year imprisonment in a job recruitment scandal, former Haryana chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal supremo Om Prakash Chautala, 86, faces the daunting challenge of reviving his party’s dwindling political graph hit as much by a string of electoral reverses since 2004 as by a cleavage in the once-formidable Chaudhary Devi Lal clan. Though still barred from contesting elections, the Jat chieftan has lost no time in throwing his lot behind the ongoing farmers’ stir against three central farm laws – seen as a part of his gameplan to regain the lost ground in the Jatland. In a freewheeling interview to Hindustan Times on Wednesday, Chautala spoke about the current political landscape and the road ahead while exuding confidence in his organising skills to bounce back before the 2024 Lok Sabha and state assembly elections. Edited excerpts: How much the split within the INLD has dented your long-term political goals? Politics is not about profit or loss. It is true that some selfish individuals deserted us. They are repentant now. Many such individuals are joining us back. But your vote share went down significantly after the split in INLD and formation of Dushyant Chautala’s JJP. How do you plan to repair the damage? The INLD workers did not let us down. Their efforts strengthened the party. My job is now to visit each and every village to reinvigorate the organization. The INLD has been out of power since 2004. Why has the party’s base shrunk? Everything can’t be judged from poll point of view. Our party in fact has strengthened. We are not worried about ups and downs. We were on the course to form the government in 2019 but were hampered by the betrayal (of Dushyant) and the subsequent split in the INLD. Your grandson Dushyant Chautala claims to be the flag bearers of Chaudhary Devi Lal’s legacy. What’s your take?There is no dispute over the legacy of Chaudhary Devi Lal. Certain selfish individuals used his name to serve their own political ends. People will never forgive such individuals. Those who used to swear by Devi Lal’s name and considered him as their grandfather adopted a new grandfather, Ram Kumar Gautam (JJP MLA from Narnaund). But the new fake grandfather has deserted them. Are you still hurt over the way Dushyant, and his father split your party? Have you forgiven them? Ups and downs are a part of politics. We are not hostile against anyone if they are willing to accept their mistakes. Is there a possibility that the Chautala family can reunite? My party is my family and its united. If anyone wants to join us with nation’s interest in mind, they are welcome. Would you make a Ghar Wapsi call to INLD deserters who left you for JJP or any other outfit? In fact, lot of such deserters are coming back in our fold. They have realised their follies and want to make amends. What’s your take on the BJPs post-poll alliance with Dushyant Chautala’s outfit? This is an unprincipled alliance and symbolises politics of opportunism. It has been forged just to fulfil selfish political ends. It will collapse the day it fails to serve the self-interests of the two allies. How do you view the political situation in the state particularly in light of the farmers’ protest? It’s not merely farmers’ agitation. It’s a mass movement involving farmers, workers, employees and all castes and communities. The agitation has acted as a bond for all communities. This agitation will bring a big change in the political scene. What’s the way to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation? This agitation has bonded communities together. Forces propagating caste politics will get defeated. What will be the outcome of this struggle is something which future beholds. Farmer organisations have given limited access to politicians during the agitation by not allowing them to share the dais. How do you view it? Do you really think this agitation is progressing without the support of political parties? There is massive support from all quarters. For instance, INLD workers have set up two hospitals for providing free of cost treatment to the protestors. There is a political thought process behind this agitation. The INLD had been a BJP ally and formed government in coalition. How different was the BJP then? Like-minded people come together in politics. If you can recall, the INLD had given unconditional support to the BJP led government at the Centre. We did so because we were impressed by Atal Behari Vajpayee’s thought process and personality. He was an incomparable person. You have been talking about forming a third front at the national level. Do you think it is realistic in current circumstances? Nothing is impossible in politics. People are fed up with this regime and are ready to make a change. But there is no alternative. I am planning nationwide visits to meet leaders of likeminded political parties for the formation of a third front. How do you view the rise of the BJP, once a marginal player, in state politics? People trusted the BJP and overwhelmingly voted for them. But they have broken that trust. It’s a worthless regime. Since the ruling BJP-JJP MLAs and MPs are unable to venture out anywhere in the state due to constant opposition from farmers, they blame the opposition parties for fuelling this. What’s your reaction? The alliance has failed to live up to the expectations of the people. There is widespread discontentment amongst the villagers. How do you view the polarisation of non-Jat communities in the state which powered the BJP to poll victories? Has there been a decline in the influence of Jat community? There is no such polarisation of non-Jats or Jats. We are a secular nation. It’s only the people’s power and influence which decide poll outcomes. My party counts on the Jan Shakti, not Jat Shakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ht-interview-political-thought-process-behind-farmers-agitation-says-inld-supremo-op-chautala-101627503652816.html

However, sources said, the health minister had returned the file to the CM with objections. Vij is learnt to have written that if Dr Kaur is reinstated, it will be difficult for him to enforce discipline in the department. In response, the CM seems to have put his foot down by reiterating his orders. Dr Kaur was placed under suspension on July 6 on the order of the health minister, even though as per the Rules of Business of the state government, only the CM is the competent authority to place a Class-1 officer under suspension and also revoke such orders.While an ex post facto (done after an action has been taken) approval was accorded on file by the CM, questions were raised about the tearing hurry shown by the health minister in ordering Dr Kaur’s suspension without sending the file to the competent authority. Haryana speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta had confirmed the suspension was a fallout of personal reasons, as the civil surgeon had apparently “not followed” some directions given by the health minister.Two days later, Dr Kaur had written a letter to the additional chief secretary, health, requesting reinstatement. Despite repeated attempts, Vij did not revert for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/reinstate-panchkula-civil-surgeon-haryana-cm-reiterates-following-vij-s-objection-101627502990487.html

Is the 44- year-old woman who was tortured by the MLA not a rape victim? Police must act or we will continue our agitation,” said Grewal, adding that he did not think that the police were working under pressure.Lauding the victim’s bravery, Dhanda said, “Not only did Bains subject the victim to rape and exploitation, but also threatened and intimidated her. We will not rest till justice is delivered.”Dhillon said at a time when the state machinery is denying justice to a victim, it is the court of law that comes to the rescue and restored the faith of the people in the system. However, despite the court’s orders the police is yet to act.The Akali leaders had recently staged a dharna in front of the police commissioner’s office and also gheraoed the residence of food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.Allegations a conspiracy to tarnish my image: BainsMeanwhile, Bains called the allegations “a political conspiracy by the SAD” to tarnish his image. He said he had full faith in the judicial system.On the SAD’s call for his arrest, Bains said,”No court ordered my arrest. The police have been directed to register a case and investigate the matter. Meanwhile, I will continue to work in my office as usual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rape-allegation-akali-delegation-meets-top-cop-demands-bains-arrest-101627502153326.html

Mann, who moved an adjournment motion in Parliament for the seventh consecutive time, later said the ongoing farmers’ agitation for repeal of the contentious laws was creating a huge awareness among the people of the country. “It is imperative to oust the Modi government to create India as envisioned by Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar and Sir Chottu Ram. The Modi government was appalled by the nationwide success of the farmers’ movement and its agencies are trying to divide the farmer leaders,” he said in the press release. He appealed to the farmer leaders to be aware of the divide and rule policy, saying their unity was essential to the repeal of the “black” laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/modi-govt-has-surpassed-british-in-divide-and-rule-policy-says-aap-101627502149999.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Tell Punjabis why you whittled down 18-point agenda: SAD to Sidhu||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday said newly appointed Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Navjot Singh Sidhu should tell Punjabis as why he has whittled down the 18-point agenda handed over by the party high command to 5 points to provide relief to the sand and liquor mafia in the state. Talking to mediapersons, SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said it was intriguing that Sidhu had a change of heart after the Congress ministers linked with sand and liquor mafia switched over to his camp and he has given up his supposed fight against illegal activities. “This is the reason why this demand disappeared from Sidhu’s agenda put up before the chief minister yesterday. Sidhu may have sold off his conscience to secure the support of tainted Congress legislators but Punjabis will not forget all the wrongs done to them. The state witnessed one of the worst hooch tragedies in recent times wherein 130 persons died due to spurious liquor. Demanding justice for the victims who died due to the spurious liquor distributed by Congress leaders does not seem to be on Sidhu’s agenda,” Cheema added. Also, Sidhu seems to have forgotten that the Congress MLAs who were behind the illegal distilleries at Ghanaur and Khanna are among his biggest supporters and that is why he is not demanding action against the liquor mafia, the SAD leader said. “Same is the case with regards to the sand mafia as one of its kingpins, who has even occupied forest land to establish a stone crusher, not in Sidhu’s line of attack any longer. It seems all their sins have been washed away after they joined the new PPCC president’s camp,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tell-punjabis-why-you-whittled-down-18-point-agenda-sad-to-sidhu-101627502090615.html

The ceremony was suspended in March last year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak with the neighbouring country following the suit on the Wagah side. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), which is carrying out beautification and plantation work outside the Swarna Jayanti Dwar of the joint check-post (JCP) in Attari near the zero line, has written to the Union home ministry seeking nod for increasing the height of the national flag.The present 360-foot-high flag was installed in March 2017 at a cost of ₹3.5-crore. In a tit-for-tat move, Pakistan hoisted a taller flag (400 feet) adjacent to the Wagah check-post on the opposite side in August that year. A senior NHAI official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “We have written to the MHA for increasing the flag height from 360 to 410 feet as development work is undergoing near the international border.” Earlier, the NHAI had written to the Amritsar Improvement Trust managing the present flag for no-objection certificate.A trust official said they had asked the NHAI and the Border Security Force (BSF) to approach the district administration for shifting or increasing the flag height. The NHAI has already set up a raised rounded platform opposite the Swarna Jayanti Dwar for shifting the present flag. A BSF official, privy to the development, said, “A taller flag with compatibility to high-velocity winds is likely to be installed at the raised platform before the re-opening of the Beating Retreat ceremony. It has been the demand of thousands of tourists visiting the border.”It will be the country’s tallest national flag if the MHA gives the go-ahead to increase its height. Currently, the tallest Tricolour (365 feet) is installed at Belagavi in Karnataka.The Pakistan government reopened its side for spectators two months ago, but India is yet to take a decision on it. The NHAI has constructed two selfie points for spectators who will be able to watch the military drill on both sides. Also, the ground outside the JCP is being covered with grass and colourful tiles.NHAI’s Amritsar project director Sunil Yadav said, “Our development project is likely to be completed in a month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/flag-war-with-pak-on-cards-as-india-likely-to-increase-height-of-tricolour-at-attari-101627502034855.html

The ED is also looking into the role of government officials and politicians in the scam, it is learnt. ED officials said the investigation was underway and other movable and immovable assets of Gurinder are under scrutiny. In 2018, the agency had lodged an ECIR (enforcement case information report) and initiated a probe in the case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) charges. As per the VB investigations, irrigation works worth ₹1, 000 crore were awarded to Gurinder through “tailor-made tenders”. The VB started a probe in April 2017 after the change of government and an FIR was registered four months later. Gurinder was arrested by VB in December that year and he accused ministers and bureaucrats of helping him bag the tenders.As per the VB, senior irrigation department officials drafted the tenders for contracts of repair of drainages worth over ₹3000 crore from 2012 to 2017 in a way that the terms and conditions suited Gurinder the most. The names of two former ministers in the then Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government with irrigation portfolio, their personal assistants and three IAS officers had also surfaced. On July 16 this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court directed the state government to look into the allegations of a “shoddy probe” in the case.Executive engineers Gulshan Nagpal, Bajrang Lal Singla, chief engineers Paramjit Singh Ghuman, Harvinder Singh and Gurdev Singh Sian were named as co-accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-attaches-multi-crore-punjab-irrigation-scam-kingpin-s-assets-101627502030150.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Climate change behind frequent cloudbursts: Experts||While detailed studies on cloudbursts and flashfloods in the trans-Himalayan region are yet to be conducted, weather experts in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh attribute the increase in their frequency to climate change. Cloudbursts and heavy rains have now become an annual feature during monsoons, not only in the Himalayan states but also in the plains, which leave a trail of death and destruction. IMD director Sonam Lotus said, “There’s no record of cloudbursts, but instances of thunderstorms and severe weather conditions have certainly increased.” “It has been observed by climate experts that severe weather events have increased due to the accelerated pace of global warming,” he said. Another expert, Prof Shakil Romshoo, dean for research at University of Kashmir, said, “There is no such data on cloudbursts in the entire Himalayan region in India because it is very difficult to record them.” He cited ‘very few’ observation stations in J&K and Ladakh as one of the reasons behind insufficient studies on such phenomena. “Cloudbursts basically is a phenomenon that happens for a short time, usually in small valleys. For its formation, a small valley is a prerequisite,” he said. “It is one of the climate extremes and has been reported all over the world. The incidents have increased because of climate change,” he added. He said that Europe and North America have had sufficient instruments for a long time and their studies have shown that the frequency of climate extremes has increased. He, however, added that with the advent of internet and communication technology, people get to know about such incidents in real time. “Had Kishtwar cloudburst happened 30 to 40 years ago, the people in Jammu would have come to know about it a month later. However, having said so, we cannot deny the fact that climate extremes have increased due to climate change. These are loud and clear indicators of climate change,” he said. Recent studies have shown that temperature in Ladakh has increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the past four decades, thus impacting the region’s snow and rain cycles, he added.

Seerat Kaur, wife of the victim, Aikom Singh Dhillon, 40, is the main accused in the case. She is facing the charges of shooting Aikom dead on the intervening night of March 18 and 19, 2017. His body, stuffed in a suitcase, was found in their BMW car outside their rented house in Phase 3B1 the next day. Her defence counsel, NPS Waraich, has maintained that Aikom died by suicide at his father’s house in Phase 3B1. During the resumed hearing in the case on Wednesday, the couple’s 14-year-old son recorded his statement and also went through cross-examination in the court of district and sessions judge Rajinder Singh Rai. Seerat was also present in the court room. In his statement in court, the minor boy stated that a day before the incident, he accompanied his parents, along with his sister, to Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara in Sohana where his father asked his mother to pledge not to meet her friend, but she refused to do so. After returning home, he, his sister and their pet dog were in their bedroom, when he heard his parents quarrelling outside. Thereafter he heard shrieks of his father and immediately also heard the sound of a gunshot. As his bedroom door was locked from the outside, he could not step out. But when his mother came to his room, he enquired about the sound and she asked him to go to sleep. The next morning he saw his mother’s maternal aunt and uncle at their house, and Seerat handed over something in a pouch and a mobile phone.Counsel for the complainant, Darshan Singh, who is Aikom’s brother, said the boy narrated the incident in sequence. Before recording his statement, he took the permission of the court to meet his mother. He identified her in court and submitted that she was present at their house in Phase 3B1 on the night of the crime. As per evidence, a day later, an auto-rickshaw driver had seen Seerat trying to load a suitcase into a BMW car, with blood oozing out of it. Aikom’s body was later recovered from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2017-aikom-murder-case-minor-son-tells-court-he-heard-gunshot-in-their-mohali-house-101627501730017.html

Waterlogging was reported in some sectors as well, particularly in Industrial Area, in the morning hours.Located on the banks of Patiala Ki Rao rivulet, several houses in Khuda Lahora Colony 1 were inundated with rainwater. Residents were left panicked as the muddy water entered their homes early in the morning.“Within half an hour, water was knee-high inside the houses and on the streets. It receded by 6am, but again entered the houses around 11.30 am. It finally cleared out by 1pm,” said Rohit Thakur, a local.Residents complained that a bridge over the rivulet, connecting to the botanical garden, caused floods in the areas. PC Rana, general secretary of the Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA), said, “The rivulet bed has risen because of silting over the last 15 years. Desilting of the rivulet and the bridge’s removal is urgently required. The authorities had the bridge removed partially, but still water gets blocked and overflows into the colony.”Water from overflowing Patiala Ki Rao rivulet also entered houses in Nayagaon and New Chandigarh in Mohali.Several housing societies, roads and markets in Zirakpur were inundated following the morning downpour. The worst-affected were some housing societies in Dhakoli, including Sushma Square, Golden Sand Society and Maple Apartment, where knee-high water was standing through most of the day.The boundary wall of Highland Society in Baltana collapsed due to the rain.Zirakpur MC’s executive officer Sandeep Tewari said teams were on duty since morning. “Most of the rainwater comes from Panchkula side and since Zirakpur is a low-lying area, it is affected the most. At most places, we drained out the water with the help of pumps,” he added.Similar scenes were also witnessed in Panchkula, where residents complained of damage to furniture and vehicles as rainwater entered their houses.Naresh Saini, vice-president of the Sector 19 RWA, said nearly 200 houses in the sector were impacted: “People could not sleep at night due to the rainwater on their floors. Their electronics and furniture were damaged.”“The Citizens’ Welfare Association has been requesting the municipal corporation to clean and repair road gullies in the city before monsoon. But even this year, MC failed to act,” said SK Nayar, president of the association.Sukhna Lake’s water level three feet below danger markWith constant rain upstream, the water level in Sukhna Lake rose by nearly four feet in the last 48 hours.It touched 1,159.90 feet on Wednesday, only three feet below the danger mark of 1,163, when the flood gates of the lake have to be opened.Last year, the opening of the flood gates had led to flash floods in Baltana area of Zirakpur.“We were keeping a close watch and have already alerted the authorities in Mohali. The water level in the lake rose in the morning hours and then stabilised. The level increase or decrease will depend on intensity of rainfall in the hilly catchment area,” said CB Ojha, UT chief engineer, said.Ghaggar reaches danger markThe Ghaggar river in Dera Bassi reached the danger mark of seven feet, prompting Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan to review the necessary arrangements in low-lying areas near the river.The Dera Bassi sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) was directed to sound alert in downstream areas of the river, chalk out an evacuation plan in case of flooding and be ready with evacuation centres.Dayalan also reviewed the arrangements made by food and supply, irrigation, power and drainage departments, besides municipal corporation and police for tackling flooding.In Panchkula, the administration has imposed Section 144 of the CrPC near rivers to prevent accidents.Mercury plunges to 26.8°CDue to the showers, the maximum temperature dropped from 31.2°C on Tuesday to 26.8°C on Wednesday, six degrees below normal. At 25.6°C, the minimum temperature was two degrees above normal.An IMD official said monsoon activity will intensify over the next 48 hours due to which the temperatures will remain on the lower side.Since monsoon’s onset on June 13, Chandigarh has received 241mm rainfall, against the normal of 385.5mm, a 38% shortfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/30mm-monsoon-showers-spell-trouble-for-chandigarh-s-periphery-101627501491023.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: NGT adjourns compliance in waste management case till Aug 10||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday adjourned hearing in the solid waste management compliance case till August 10. The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC), along with other local bodies in the country, was given a deadline of April 4, 2020, to comply with waste management rules, 2016. On February 28, the NGT had ordered, “Compliance with the rules requires taking several steps mentioned in Rule 22 from Serial No 1 to 10. Any such continued failure will result in compensation at the rate of ₹10 lakh a month per local body for a population of 10 lakh and above.” During the last case hearing on December 14, 2020, the NGT observed that a consolidated monitoring report has to be presented before this tribunal every six months. The first such report was to be filed by June 30. In its hearing scheduled for July 28, this report was to be taken up. “Most of the statutory timelines have expired and directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and (NGT) to comply with solid waste management Rules, 2016 remain unexecuted in Chandigarh,” said, Vinod Vashisht, convener, CFORWO (City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations). The compliance of waste management rules requires taking several steps such as identification, procurement and setting up of sites for solid waste processing, sanitary landfill, ensuring door-to-door waste segregation/collection/transportation, construction and demolition waste management and bioremediation or capping of old and abandoned dump sites. “While Chandigarh is on track on eight steps as prescribed under Rule 22, on solid waste processing and bioremediation/capping of legacy waste, it is still completely off-track. In a nutshell, the city’s waste chain end-processing is still in a big mess,” said Vashisht Chandigarh MC has been struggling to process city’s legacy waste of around five lakh metric tonnes (MT). The city generates around 550-600 MT of solid waste daily. But hardly 60-70 MT of it is being processed currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-ngt-adjourns-compliance-in-waste-management-case-till-aug-10-101627500590164.html

The loss caused will find that the actual loss is ₹300 crore,” he claimed, adding that the CBI must conduct a time-bound inquiry into the matter under the supervision of the high court. Cheema added that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) does not trust the committee of tainted bureaucrats and the Punjab vigilance department. Cheema had raised the matter related to irregularities in industrial plot allotment by the PSIEC and the JCT Electronics land matter in the state assembly. “Such embezzlements and scams cannot be perpetrated by the officials, MLAs or ministers without the patronage of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, under whom all sorts of mafias are flourishing in the state,” he said.

I got a call from someone who said that he has died in a bus accident. I don’t know how to react to it,” said the father over the phone.Like Mahto, the other 140 passengers of the bus were labourers who worked in farms or industrial units in Punjab and Haryana. Most of them were returning home to Bihar after several months. They paid ₹1500 to 2500 to the travel agents who arranged the bus.Dinesh Mandal, relative of a passenger, said that his uncle Balram Mandal ,55, worked as a farm labourer in Ludhiana, Punjab. Balram was killed in the mishap. His body was found near the front wheels of the bus.“My uncle called home on Tuesday and said that he is returning home. He was planning to marry off his youngest daughter in September,” said Dinesh.Like Mahto and Mandal, most of the passengers alighted from the overcrowded bus when it broke down in Barabanki. While some walked to an eatery nearby, others, tired from the journey, lay down on the road, under or in front of the bus.Sunil Mahto, one of the passengers who sustained minor injuries, said, “The bus was so crowded that over 30 people were travelling while standing in the corridor. The people standing in the corridor alighted first and many of them lay on the road. There was a cool breeze, so they closed their eyes and slept. The conductor of the bus even suggested to us to rest by the roadside,” Mahto recalled.Within an hour of the bus breaking down, most of the passengers found a place either inside, outside , on or under the bus, waiting for the mechanic to arrive and fix the bus. But a truck hit the bus from behind. Santosh Kumar Pandit, 22, who was seated right behind the bus driver, said, “There was a loud noise and I was jolted to one side of my seat. I heard glass shatter and then people inside the bus started crying. I first thought that it was a bad dream, but when I opened my eyes, I found myself under three passengers who were sharing the seat with me.”According to the police, most of the people died on the spot after being crushed under the bus.Passengers at the back of the bus or resting on top of it sustained injuries. Pradeep Sahni, 21, another passenger, was resting on the roadside when the accident happened.“I saw the tyres of the bus rolling over people sleeping on the ground. I froze for a moment. It looked like a movie scene only the people who were killed or injured were all real,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/barabanki-accident-journey-home-ends-in-tragedy-survivors-recall-nightmare-101627499809950.html

29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana to work for uniform liquor rates in tricity||Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on Wednesday once again decided to work for uniform liquor rates across the tricity.During the meeting of the apex committee of tricity – the inter-state coordination committee, chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore,harmonising of excise duty was discussed.“No road map or timelines were fixed during the meeting, but there was a discussion regarding bringing liquor rates at par in the three cities. But, it is yet to be worked out whether Chandigarh will increase excise duty or Haryana and Punjab will decrease theirs,” said a UT official.Currently, liquor in Chandigarh is cheaper than Mohali and Panchkula. Both Haryana and Punjab governments along with liquor vendors in the twin satellites cities consider it as a cause of revenue loss for them.“The UT administration has traditionally kept excise duties comparatively lower than Mohali and Panchkula. This may be considered as one of the causes of smuggling of liquor from city to neighbouring cities and towns. If the duties are harmonised, then it is expected to bring down smuggling,” the official added. On the lines of excise duty, harmonisation of motor vehicle taxes and fuel prices in the tricity were also discussed.The meeting was attended by Haryana chief secretary Vijay Vardhan, Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan, UT adviser Dharam Pal, DGP Punjab, ADGP Haryana and other senior officials of the three administrations.The issue of beggary was also highlighted, wherein it was decided that proper schooling should be provided to children and their mapping exercise should be carried out to ensure that they continue to have education.Law-and-order discussedThe coordination committee also discussed various law and order issues like participation of both neighbouring states in tackling the crimes committed by interstate gangsters, snatchings and thefts in the tricity. It was also suggested to encourage the use of emergency response support system (control room number 112).Citing the example of recent protests in the city, Badnore directed to ensure compliance with the decision to prohibit entry of tractors within the tricity. It was also agreed that protestors from Punjab and Haryana need to be stopped at the respective borders with Chandigarh, with support of state governments. Peaceful agitations with prior permission need to be allowed to be held, but only at dedicated and earmarked areas in Chandigarh.The administrator exhorted that all levels of official hierarchies, right up to the beat level, should hold meetings at regular intervals and follow up action should be taken up accordingly.Haryana to present alternative route to airport: BadnoreOn the Haryana suggestion for an alternative shorter route to Chandigarh International Airport through Sector 48, Jagatpura, it was decided that town and country planning departments of three administrations will examine it.A UT official, said, “Many issues related to land acquisition have to be sorted. But first, we need concrete plans on the alternative route. Haryana was asked to present a concrete plan on the issue.” Badnore emphasised that all the three governments need to work in coordination to work on the direct approach road for connectivity with airport as well as on the ring roads around tricity.Earlier, the distance from Tribune Chowk to the airport was 2.71 km. Now, the existing route from Tribune Chowk to the airport is 14.52 km through Punjab (Mohali), which was causing difficulty to the residents of Chandigarh as they have to cover more distance and spend more time to reach the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/interstate-coordination-committee-meeting-chandigarh-punjab-and-hry-to-work-for-uniform-liquor-rates-in-tricity-101627499753353.html

He reiterated that his party just had a pact with the people of the state instead of a political party. Mishra was in Prayagraj on Tuesday to attend the “Prabudh Varg Sammellan” before moving to Pratapgarh on Wednesday, Mishra said that his party was not going to enter into any agreement with Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and said that everyone knows on whose insistence his party was coming to UP to contest polls. Conceding that the BSP’s experience of poll alliances had been very poor, Mishra said the party does not want to even remember the pact that it had once entered with Samajwadi Party. He said that the party had contested the 2007 polls alone and succeeded in forming the government, and this time too, the party was determined to do it alone. He came down hard on the ruling BJP’s government of the state terming it as ‘jungleraj’ and claimed that every section of the society including the Brahmins, labourers, farmers and traders were unhappy under the present regime. Mishra said that the entire Brahmin community was now backing the BSP and it was sure to succeed in the 2022 assembly elections of UP. Accusing the BJP leadership of only using the name of Lord Ram to gain political benefits and not actually interested in constructing the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Mishra claimed that if the “neglected Brahmin community” comes with BSP they would have the key to power in the state after the 2022. In response to reports suggesting the AIMIM would be joining hands with the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the upcoming UP Assembly polls in 2022, AIMIM UP Pradesh president Shaukat Ali had recently said that no such statement had been made by his party leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-assembly-polls-2022-no-alliance-with-any-party-except-with-people-of-up-bsp-101627499569283.html

In UP, there are 58,000 village panchayats, while the number of universities, colleges and private colleges in the state is 60,000.” “If these educational institutes can adopt one village each, and implement the schemes of the Centre and the state government in the right manner for five years, then the picture of UP can change in five years,” she said.Speaking on the occasion, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said anganwadi centres were the foundation of the education system and efforts made by Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj University (CSJMU) and Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) to strengthen these centres were commendable. “Children in the 3 to 5 years age group coming to anganwadi centres require both nutrition and education. And cooperation by the affiliated institutions of these two universities for providing necessary material to anganwadi centres is a commendable step. This work will act as an inspiration in fulfilling the goal of Antyodaya,” he said during a programme organised at CSJMU in Kanpur. During the Covid-19 pandemic, anganwadi workers did a good job by associating themselves with monitoring committees, he added.The CM said the state government was working on a plan to develop anganwadi centres as pre-primary institutions, but the plan could not materialise at that time due to the Covid pandemic. But efforts made by these varsities helped in the rehabilitation of anganwadi centres. He said the process of adoption of TB-affected children was being carried out by the teachers and officials of CSJM University, which was also associated with social work.Seven affiliated institutions of AKTU were awarded certificates by UP governor and CSJMU chancellor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath for their cooperation in strengthening anganwadi centres. These seven institutes included Axis Institute of Technology and Management, PSIT; Kanpur Institute of Technology; Maharana Pratap Group of Institutions, Narayana Vidyapeeth Group of Institutions; Allen House Institute of Technology, and Kanpur Institute of Management Studies. “If social change is to be brought, then everyone has to be a participant. AKTU has done a commendable job of adopting anganwadi centres in different districts of UP,” said the governor. Earlier, CSJMU vice-chancellor Vinay Kumar Pathak welcomed everyone in the programme. He informed that the university and AKTU’s Kanpur based 40 affiliated institutions had provided assistance to make 75 anganwadi centres full of facilities. Industrial development minister Satish Mahana, minister of state for higher education Nilima Katiyar, Kanpur mayor Pramila Pandey and other public representatives, district administration officials among others were present in the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-governor-cm-distribute-essentials-to-anganwadi-centres-in-kanpur-101627499389221.html
29-07-2021||Other||Maintenance tribunal has no power to pass eviction order of children: HC||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizen Act, 2007, the tribunal as well as appellate authority put in place by respective states, have no power to pass eviction of children from the property of a senior citizen parent. “The only power with the Tribunal and the Appellate Authority is to grant maintenance by taking into consideration the facts of each and every case and also to set aside the transfer of property in case the senior citizen is able to prove that a fraud was played by the children while executing the said transfer of the property,” the high court bench of justice Harsimran Singh Sethi said. The court was dealing with the plea of an Ambala senior citizen, who had appealed against the order of tribunal and appellate authority passed earlier this year. The petitioner father was living in a separate house in the same village, where the son and his wife lived. He wanted to shift to that house on the grounds that the present house, which initially belonged to his father, is being occupied by him now and is in a depleted form and needed renovation. He filed an application under the 2007 law, seeking the eviction of his son and daughter-in-law from the house they were residing in, which was dismissed. In the high court, he had argued that merely having another accommodation cannot be a ground to deny the benefit to the petitioner regarding eviction of his son and daughter-in-law. He also maintained that the tribunal was bound to pass the order of eviction once the application has been made under the 2007 Act. The court noted that petitioner and his son’s family are living in separate accommodation. The petitioner is a pensioner and also has agriculture land from where he is earning sufficient to lead a “dignified life”. “In the whole of the petition, there is not even a single averment that in order to live a dignified life as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner needs assistance of his children,” the court noted. “ A bare perusal of the above (judgments discussed) would show that neither by the Tribunal as envisaged under 2007, Act nor the Appellate Authority on an appeal preferred under Section 16 of the 2007, Act have jurisdiction to pass an order of eviction,” the bench said, upholding the tribunal’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maintenance-tribunal-has-no-power-to-pass-eviction-order-of-children-hc-101627499330771.html
29-07-2021||Bangalore||An unlikely link between Karnataka’s Basavaraj Bommai, Siddaramaiah||Bengaluru: Unlike BS Yediyurappa, who worked for more than 40 years to build the BJP in Karnataka, Basavaraj Bommai, joined the saffron party in 2008. Bommai who comes from the Janata Dal (United), is the second politician in the last two decades to have migrated from the Janata Party and get the chief ministerial post in the new party. Siddaramaiah, who migrated to Congress from Janata Dal (Secular) in 2006, went to become the chief minister after the Congress party swept the election in 2013.Son of former chief minister SR Bommai, Basavaraj started his political career with the Janata Dal and worked with senior leaders including HD Deve Gowda and Ramakrishna Hegde. Bommai was a strong leader from the Janata Parivar. Bommai Junior left the Janata Dal (United) and joined the BJP in February 2008.According to politicians and analysis in the state, the disintegration of the Janata Party into insignificant factions and the Gowda family dominating the only prominent faction, the JD(S); several leaders migrated to other parties.“The most important thing to understand is that Janata Party came as an opposition to the Congress and because of this, several leaders rooted among the people came to the forefront. The work at the grassroots levels in the state made them strong leaders. Many of the big leaders like HD Deve Gowda, SR Bommai and Ramakrishna Hegde came from the Janata background. But the Janata Party also produced junior leaders who are coming to prominence now,” said senior Congress leader, who didn’t want to be named.He said that the leaders with the Janata Party backgrounds are the backbone of both the Congress and the BJP. “If you look at the assembly, you will see who are strongly defending their parties. In the Congress Siddaramaiah, RV Deshpande and even someone young like Krishna Byre Gowda, are all from the Janata Parivar. If you look at BJP also the strong leaders like Bommai, (JC) Madhuswamy and V Somanna, they are all from the Janata Parivar,” he said.A Narayana, a political analysist and faculty at the Azim Premji University said that it is important to understand why good leaders emerged from the erstwhile Janata Party. “People with a liberal and progressive approach are against the BJP , a similar situation prevailed against the Congress in the 1970s. At that time, those who were well-read and progressive stood against the Congress party, this resulted in the Janata Party became an incubator for good leaders,” said Narayana.Even though Bommai and Siddaramaiah come from the Janata Parivar, they can’t be compared or be judged on the same platform, said another Head of Department of Political Science in a prominent institute in Bengaluru, who didn’t want to be named. “Their ideologies are certainly different now, so it is not fair to put them in the same bracket now. However, because of their background in Janata Party, they are certainly less communal. Even within the BJP, leaders who have come from the Janata Party or for that matter someone like Yediyurappa, who is a farmer leader, is way less communal in their politics compared to the RSS faction of the BJP,” said the professor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/an-unlikely-link-between-new-cm-siddaramaiah-101627499329134.html

They are highly mistaken. The CM and I are good friends. Officials playing this dirty game will suffer heavily,” Vij, who is in-charge of seven cabinet portfolios and prides calling himself ‘Gabbar of Sholay’, dropped this bombshell via a WhatsApp message.During the day, Vij, 68, who represents Ambala Cantt assembly segment in the Vidhan Sabha refused to speak on the issue.While Wednesday’s utterances of Vij will be music to the ears of the Opposition, his move to publically admonish the bureaucracy for playing dirty games to please the CM is a testament of fault lines widening between the chief minister’s office (CMO) and six-time legislator Vij.According to people close to Vij, he has been ‘upset’ over the manner in which the CMO has been taking decisions pertaining to health and home departments that Vij holds.“The impression is also gaining ground that every key decision related to home and health is taken by the CMO. Vij appears to have been sidelined and slighted as well. For instance, during the second wave of Covid-19, the CMO was calling the shots and taking every important decision, while Vij was playing the second fiddle,” sources said, refusing to be identified.The turf war between Vij and the CMO is not new. Recently, the difference between Vij and Khattar had come to fore over continuation of director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava.Vij wanted the government to shunt Yadava as the Haryana DGP, but Khattar firmly backed Yadava’s extended tenure.DGP Manoj Yadava, the 1988 batch Haryana cadre IPS officer, had joined as the state police chief in February 2019, for two years.After Vij stoked the controversy, DGP Yadava had sought premature repatriation to the Intelligence Bureau (IB) after which the state government set into motion the process to select his successor. Now, Yadava is set to join the IB and the state government is expected to name the new DGP by this month.Vij was miffed with DGP Yadava and off late has been displeased with additional chief secretary (health and home) Rajeev Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/officials-playing-dirty-games-to-please-cm-vij-101627499210492.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A working man’s comfort food||A dish as beloved as only comfort food can be, kadhi’s primary ingredient is dahi (yoghurt) and besan (chickpea flour). But that’s not true for Dharmender and Vinod. In their mid-30s, the two labourers are making kadhi without dahi. “Each of us earns ₹400 everyday,” explains Dharmender. “Half of that is spent on the daily expenses… so we are skipping dahi.”Both, however, concede the central role of dahi. That’s how kadhi is made in their family homes in Raebareli, UP. “Kadhi tastes good when dahi is khatti (soury)… we use lemon instead.”This evening, the two men are preparing kadhi in their home. Having no fixed address, their living quarter consists of whatever building site they happen to be working on at the moment. They have been in south Delhi’s Green Park for one month. A bungalow has been demolished and an apartment complex will be raised on its place. The plot is screened off by a tin wall. It is in this setting that Dharmender and Vinod are cooking on a makeshift chulha—the wood for fuel has been obtained from the discarded furniture of the demolished bungalow. They agree to share the recipe.IngredientsFor kadhi2 cups water2 large spoons of besan2 lemonsturmeric powder, quantity “andaz se” (by intuition)Red chili powder, “andaz se”Garam masala, “andaz se”Garlic, 5-6 clovesSalt, “andaz se”Mustard oil, 2 small spoonsFor pakodis (dumplings)2 large spoons of besan1 sliced onionSalt “andaz se”Garam masala “andaz se”2 cups waterMustard oil (for frying)Kadhi:Pour 2 cups of water in a bowl. Add spices (excluding turmeric) and mix.Pour besan in a separate bowl. Add the water mixture, mix well.Squeeze a lemon into the mixture.Heat oil in a pan over the flame. When hot, drop the garlic cloves. When they darken, add turmeric followed by the besan and water mixture.Add salt, and simmer for 20 minutes.Pakodi:Prepare them first if you have a single burner.Add besan for the pakodis in a bowl. Add spices and sliced onion. Mix. Add water, mix and beat well.Pour oil into a pan. Heat the oil. When hot, lift up a blob of paste and release it into the oil. Make all the pakodis in this way, dropping them into the oil in quick successions. Turn the pakodis around and fry until browned. Now add them into the kadhi.Serve with steamed rice. Squeeze the remaining lemon into the kadhi just before eating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-working-man-s-comfort-food-101627498940984.html

We are looking for 400 acre land. After getting it, we will start the work,” he said.“We hope the medical college under construction at Koreyawas village will be completed by end of the year and start operations from 2023 session,” the CM added.On farmers’ stir against Centre’s three farm laws, Khattar said some people are doing politics in the name of farmers.“Farm leaders are misleading farmers regarding the minimum support price. Haryana is the only state in country that is procuring nine crops on MSP. The new laws were brought to give option to farmers to sell their crop outside mandis if the prices are high in the open market,” he added.In Rewari, Khattar said his government will act strongly against those trying to disrupt law and order in the name of farmers’ protest. He said his government had earlier adopted a soft nature against these people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-act-strongly-against-those-trying-to-disrupt-law-and-order-khattar-101627499151538.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Maternity benefit law has supremacy over service regulations: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, will have supremacy over service regulations of a financial institution, if the same are in conflict with each other.“Section 27(1) specifically provides that the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act will have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law or in the terms of any award, agreement or contract of service whether made before or after the coming into force of this Act,” the court said, referring to the provisions of law and adding that the bank regulations being inconsistent with the provisions of the law, the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act would have an overriding effect.The HC was dealing with the plea of Bank of India, which has challanged labour commissioner order vide which the bank was told to allow maternity leave in place of sick leave for a period of 58 days availed by a woman working in the Gurugram branch of the bank.The woman had her second child in 2019 and had availed maternity leave. However, of total leaves availed, 58 days were converted into sick leave by the bank citing banking regulations.The woman had challenged the same before the labour commissioner, which had ruled in her favour.It was against this order that the bank had approached the HC arguing that banks are governed by the Bank of India (Officers’) Service Regulations, 1979 and that these regulations have been made in exercise of the powers under Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 by the board of directors in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with the previous sanction of the central government and have the force of law.The service regulations will have precedence over the provisions of the maternity law, the bank had argued.“It is a social welfare legislation under which every woman employee is entitled to and her employer is liable to pay the maternity benefits... the bank has not been able to show as to how… (it) is not applicable to the petitioner bank,” the bench of justice Alka Sarin said, adding that the regulations may have been framed in consultation with the RBI, but a statutory regulation, is subject to the provisions of a Parliamentary Act. A subordinate legislation must be made in conformity with the Parliamentary Act, the court said, adding that the bank regulations do not provide the same maternity leave and other benefits to which a woman employee would be entitled to in terms of the law.To the argument that the bank is not covered under the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1958, the court said the definition of commercial establishment in the 1958 law specifically includes banking, making it clear that it is covered by the Establishment Act.“Once the petitioner bank is covered within the definition of commercial establishment, the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act will clearly apply to the petitioner bank as well,” the court said, dismissing the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/maternity-benefit-law-has-supremacy-over-service-regulations-hc-101627499030710.html

Earlier, last month the state government had extended the scheme for traders, cable operators and other dealers for three months more in view of the continuing Covid-19 pandemic in the state.

The health department had, on July 13, started vaccinating pregnant and lactating women following the central government’s directions. “On an average, 40 to 50 pregnant women get inoculated every day at government vaccination centres. The average, however, increases to over 100 on Tuesdays when the women visit antenatal clinics for routine check-up. However, being extra cautious during their pregnancy, the women are hesitating to take the jab. But regular counselling sessions are proving fruitful as more women are now showing up to take the jab,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh. Dr Kang added that the vaccination numbers are satisfactory. “Besides, the health care staff is visiting maternity wards of government hospitals and counselling women post their deliveries. The vaccines are safe for lactating and pregnant women,” said Dr Kang. On July 27, when the previous antenatal check-up session was held, as many as 154 pregnant women were inoculated. The week before, on July 20, a total of 133 women had turned up for vaccination. However, during other days of the week, the vaccination centres do not witness a rush of pregnant women. On Wednesday, only 36 pregnant women were vaccinated. So far, no case of adverse effect following the immunisation of pregnant women has been reported in Chandigarh, the data with the health department showed. “Women usually are concerned about the side effects of vaccine. We give them counselling about the importance of the vaccination and how they can consult health experts in case of emergency. Also, we are giving training to health staff so that they can also counsel the women and give them proper training,” said a doctor, who counsels pregnant women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/24-pregnant-women-registered-at-chandigarh-s-antenatal-clinics-vaccinated-101627498493993.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Capt asks PSPCL to cancel, revisit PPAs with pvt firms||Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday ordered Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to cancel or revisit all one-sided power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private companies that are not contractually obligated to supply sufficient power to meet the state’s peak demand during the paddy sowing and summer season. The CM also directed the PSPCL to revoke the PPA of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL), Mansa, one of the largest private thermal plants in the state, stating that the facility failed to perform in the current paddy season. The CM said the plant’s PPA is biased in favour of the company. He asked the PSPCL to examine all the PPAs signed by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government with the independent power producers (IPPs), which were established basically to meet the power demands of the state, especially during paddy sowing and summer season. “Terminate/revisit all the lopsided PPAs that are not beneficial to the state,” he said. As reviewing the PPAs signed by the previous Badal government was one of the poll-promise as well, the government has faced lot of heat on the issue as those opposing these PPAs has claimed that the agreements have been signed to favour the private companies running plants and is the main reason behind costly power in Punjab. A section of the Congress, including newly appointed PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, had repeatedly criticised the state government on the issue. The issue was also one of the five demands being raised by Sidhu and three working presidents of the Congress, during their meeting with the CM on Tuesday. The CM noted that the PSPCL had signed 14 PPAs with thermal/hydro power plants and 122 long term PPAs with solar/biomass Plants after 2007, to make the state power surplus with generation capacity of around 13,800 MW. However, in this current paddy season, all three units of TSPL failed to generate power for a few days during the peak paddy season. One unit of the TSPL failed completely to operate from March, and two units remained out of power generation for the last one month, he said. At present, only one unit of the TSPL is operational, he said, adding that these factors have caused huge power shortage in the state. The PSPCL has already issued a notice to the TSPL by imposing the penalty, but as the PPAs are one-sided, the penalty imposed will be meagre in comparison to the losses caused by the failure of these thermal plants. Further, according to the provisions of the PPAs, it is not compulsory for the IPPs to supply power during peak summer/paddy period. Hence, taking advantage of the loopholes in PPAs, the IPPs are claiming full fixed charges from PSPCL by supplying power in the off-season when the state requires it the least. The CM said to meet the deficit resulting from the failure of the TSPL, with a capacity of 3x660MW (1,980MW), the PSPCL had to purchase short-term power on exchange. The PSPCL had procured 271 crore units of power in June and July by spending ₹886 crore, he said. The CM said the PSPCL was also forced to utilise full power from the central sector generating stations so the crops of farmers could be saved, adding that the state was also compelled to enforce power regulatory measures from July 1 to July 11 on large supply (LS) industry of to meet the rising demand of farmers. This has not only resulted in inconvenience to consumers of the state but also imposed additional financial burden on the financially crunched PSPCL, the CM added. Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa said: “The announcement by the CM directing the PSPCL to cancel or revisit all one-sided PPAs signed under the SAD-BJP regime should have been the first action taken in 2017. I hope that the PSPCL will act quickly to ensure these unfair agreements are handled at the earliest.“I recommend that any and all agreements signed by the Punjab Energy Development Agency under the SAD-BJP dispensation should be investigated for irregularities immediately.” ”. Bajwa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-asks-pspcl-to-cancel-revisit-ppas-with-pvt-firms-101627498429800.html
29-07-2021||Lucknow||Mission 2022: BJP MPs to take out jan ashirwad yatras ahead of campaign blitz in Uttar Pradesh||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda has tasked party MPs from the state with launching yatras across rural Uttar Pradesh. The move comes ahead of the campaign blitzkrieg that the ruling BJP plans to launch in UP, where assembly elections are due early next year. The decision was conveyed to the MPs at a dinner meeting in Delhi on Wednesday. Termed “jan ashirwad yatras”, as party MPs would seeking blessings from the public ahead of the 2022 UP polls, they could be rolled out after the monsoon session of Parliament ends on August 13. Seven Union ministers from UP who have found a place in Narendra Modi government too have been directed to tour UP, party leaders said, adding that the new union ministers from the state could be visiting UP from August 16 onwards. Nadda, who chaired the meeting, asserted that the state government is fulfilling the party’s development agenda. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who arrived in Delhi on Wednesday evening, spoke about the development work undertaken by his government. “All party MPs have been asked to visit rural UP, take out a campaign, mingle with the masses and popularise the schemes of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and Yogi Adityanath government in UP,” a party MP said after the dinner meeting held the Delhi’s Constitution Club. Before the yatras, Anna Mahotsav would be organised in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi could be virtually interacting with about 80,000 ration card holders from the state who benefitted from the Centre’s free ration scheme launched to provide relief to the poor hit hard by Covid. The virtual interaction may happen on August 5, BJP leaders indicated. The first batch of 40 party MPs from the state, including Rajya Sabha members, attended Wednesday’s meeting. These BJP MPs were from western, Braj and Kanpur regions of the state. Party MPs from three other regions, Awadh, Kashi and Gorakhpur, are scheduled to be part of a similar meeting on Thursday. The second batch would have as many MPs as the first, party leaders said. The BJP top leadership having decided to back chief minister Yogi Adityanath ahead of the assembly polls, continued to build ‘Brand Yogi’ praising his governance, party leaders said. In line with the party decision, Yogi Adityanath government has also prepared a booklet on the development initiatives undertaken by the government. The booklet titled ‘Iradey nek, kaam anek (good intentions, several initiatives)’ has a picture of Lord Ram. The Ayodhya temple issue also finds mention in the booklet. The party MPs would have a variety of tasks, including creating awareness among the poor about the need to take both the jabs as safeguard against Covid-19. A BJP leader said the party’s decision to task its MPs with ‘Mission UP 2022’ was in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan who has already asked MPs to venture out in their regions to rebut the Opposition claim on a variety of issues, from farmers agitation to the Pegasus issue. Nadda, who is set to arrive in Lucknow to plan strategies for the 2022 UP polls tentatively from August 7, is expected to meet district panchayat chairpersons and block pramukhs. The BJP swept these rural polls earlier this month. “Now that we have so many rural representatives, they too would be a key part of BJP strategy,” a party leader said. Union home minister Amit Shah is expected in Lucknow on August 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too is expected in the state at least twice in August for launching some big ticket projects like the Jewar international airport, to be developed as Asia’s biggest airport. Modi is also expected to launch the Purvanchal Expressway in August, a dream project of the Yogi Adityanath government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mission-2022-bjp-mps-to-take-out-jan-ashirwad-yatras-ahead-of-campaign-blitz-in-uttar-pradesh-101627498249702.html

29-07-2021||Mumbai||Stars can experience midlife crisis: Study by Indian, Nepalese astrophysicists explain why||Stars can experience a midlife crisis and transition into an inactive phase, according to a research paper by astrophysicists from Nepal and India. The study, published in the peer-reviewed Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters on Wednesday, provides a new theoretical explanation for the stellar mid-life crisis of stars that are approximately as old as the Sun in our solar system.The study was authored by Bindesh Tripathi, Dibyendu Nandy and Soumitro Banerjee at the Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India (CESSI) and Department of Physical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Kolkata. While Tripathi is from Nepal, Nandy and Banerjee are from India. “Observations of sun-like stars show a sudden transition to an inactive phase. Stellar activity such as sunspots, flares, plasma wind output reduce for middle aged stars that are about 4.6 billion years old,” said Nandy, professor at CESSI. In their work, the scientists used simulations of magnetic field generation in stars and found that around the age of the Sun, the magnetic field generation mechanism can suddenly become sub-critical or less efficient. This allows stars to exist in two distinct activity states – a low activity mode and an active mode. This is the first work that can explain a variety of peculiar behavior observed in middle aged stars.Stars often experience magnetic braking due to a steady stream of magnetised plasma or charged particles, known as the solar wind, escaping from the star. This wind carries away angular momentum over time. Over billions of years, this outflow of plasma can slow down the rotation of the star. The slower rotation leads to less efficient generation of magnetic fields and less stellar activity. This means a reduction in the numbers of stellar spots, magnetic storms, and similar phenomena in the atmospheres of stars, which are intrinsically linked to the strengths of their magnetic fields, and the breakdown of the widely used technique of stellar gyrochronology. Gyrochronology is used by astrophysicists across the world to estimate the age of a star based on a measurement of their rotational periods. However, since the relationship between the rotational period of a star and its age breaks down when the star becomes middle-aged, gyrochronology no longer works for stars older than the sun, computational models by the IISER Kolkata scientists indicate. “Our dynamo simulations show that a middle aged star like the Sun can often switch to a low activity mode, resulting in drastically reduced angular momentum losses by magnetised stellar winds and the breakdown of gyrochronology relations,” said professor Nandy.Divya Oberoi, associate professor at the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Pune, who was not a part of the study said, “This study finds that the solar dynamo, which is responsible for continuously generating the magnetic field on the Sun, exists in two states - its normal state where the Sun shows its usual 11-year solar cycle of appearance and disappearance of sun (or rather star) spots, and a sub-critical state where for all outwardly appearances, the dynamo cycle seems to have switched off and there is an extended period of subdued activity on the star. For our Sun, the most famous of these extended minima goes by the name ‘Maunder Minimum’ which lasted from about 1645 to 1715. It also suggests a very interesting explanation for how observing other middle aged stars like the Sun during one of these periods of low activity can lead to inconsistent answers for a commonly used technique to estimate the age of a star. If true, this represents a significant advance in our understanding of the observed variations in solar cycles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stars-can-experience-midlife-crisis-study-by-indian-nepalese-astrophysicists-explain-why-101627497829029.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra flood-relief package: Decision likely next week||The state deferred its decision on the relief package to the flood-affected people in Konkan and western Maharashtra. Although the state announced compensation at higher rates, an actual decision is expected early next week once assessment of losses is done.According to preliminary estimates, the losses due to the floods is estimated to be around ₹4,000 crore. Meanwhile, the toll in flood-ravaged districts rose to 213. Eight people are still missing in six districts. A total of 435,879 people have been evacuated from low-lying and vulnerable areas.The state cabinet took stock of the preliminary losses due to floods and heavy rain since last Thursday that ravaged Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Thane in Konkan; Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara in western Maharashtra. Crops across 3.38 lakh hectares have been damaged, while the damages to the electricity infrastructure is more than Rs1,200 crore. The estimated losses to the roads and bridges in the flood-affected districts is more than Rs1,500 crore.“The assessment of the losses to crops, livestock, housing structure is still at the preliminary stages as many villages in western Maharashtra are under water. More than 400,000 people are still living either in shelters or at their relatives. In such a scenario, it is difficult to arrive at the exact figures of the losses. In the past, the figures of the crop losses were found to be inflated. It was pointed out by the Centre, while granting the relief package for the losses. This time, we want to avoid such discrepancies,” said an official from Mantralaya.Urban development department minister Eknath Shinde said that the package will be announced once the assessment was completed. “Till then we have decided to give the preliminary assistance as per the NDRF norms,” he said.The state government has decided on increase the relief amount from the set NDRF norms. The compensation for the partial loss of the house is expected to be increased to Rs5,000 from Rs6,000 to Rs15,000, while the proposed compensation for the fully collapsed houses will be Rs1,50,000 from existing Rs95,100. Similarly, the immediate relief for the losses of household utilities and cash assistance has been increased to Rs10,000 from the existing Rs5,000. The disbursement of the immediate assistance of Rs10,000 has already begun in affected districts, said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.The state government has already written to the central government for the revision in the financial assistance given to the calamity-affected people as the norms set are five years old. The demand was raised during a meeting between prime minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last month. The water level of the rivers in flood-affected districts came below their danger level. Panchaganga, which has been flowing over its danger level since Thursday, dipped near to its 43 feet danger level as its level at 5pm on Wednesday to 43.2ft. Still 47 weirs are in Kolhapur are submerged, while discharge from the rivers in the district is high.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to visit flood-affected areas in Kolhapur on Thursday. His tour of flood-affected Satara district in western Maharashtra had to be called off on Monday after his helicopter could not land due to the bad weather. State government has allocated 2.57 hectares at Mahad in Raigad for the permanent base camp of NDRF. The land owned by the dairy commissioner of the state government has been handed over for the camp. The decision was taken after the NDRF companies took longer time to reach the flood ravaged Chiplun, Mahad due to the land slides and flooding on their way from their Pune base camp last week.“In current scenario, the rescue and rehabilitation teams take about 8 hours, which are crucial for operations to reach to spot from Pune or Thane. The coastal districts have witnessed three cyclones in five years and several other natural calamities. In this backdrop, we have moved the proposal in November 2020 for base camp of NDRF in Mahad. The proposal is pending with the Central government, but we have requested the state government to at least set up SDRF base camp at Mahad, which is at the centre point of three coastal districts. We expect the base camp to come up in next six months. It will be set up following the set norms,” said minister of state and Raigad’s guardian minister Aditi Tatkare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-flood-relief-package-decision-likely-next-week-101627497410201.html
29-07-2021||Chandigarh||2 Punjab tourism board officials booked for ₹90 lakh embezzlement||Two officials of the Punjab Heritage and Tourism Promotion Board (PHTPB) have been booked for embezzlement of funds to the tune of ₹90 lakh. The misappropriated amount is expected to be higher as the board officials have checked just one account so far. The accused have been identified as Rajni Pandey, the former senior accountant of PHTPB and SP Singh Dhindsa, who was working as a project coordinator-cum-manager, finance and account. Punjab tourism and cultural affairs’ department director Kanwalpreet Brar, who is the complainant in the case, said Pandey had been working as a senior accountant in PHTPB since April 2009 while Dhindsa was the project coordinator-cum-manager of finance and accounts. On March 23, 2021, Pandey tendered her resignation and left without settling her accounts or handing over the records. Later during scrutiny, some discrepancies were found in the board’s account in SBI bank.The account showed cash withdrawals of ₹50,000 and ₹90,000 made by Pandey but the same were not accounted for or entered in the cash book. With regards to ₹50,000, a cheque was shown as cancelled in the cheque register but the account showed that it had been encashed by Pandey. For the amount of ₹90,000, Pandey had, in a reply on March 15, denied embezzlement and claimed that it was an inadvertent mistake on her part and sought pardon. The complainant said that there were no proper records of the advance issued and there was an unexplained difference of ₹70 lakh. Even the lease amount of ₹1.50 lakh received on April 11, 2014, was not deposited in the bank. Also, a cash receipt book was missing. “The bare scrutiny of the bank statement of 2019 pointed out a number of suspicious and bogus transactions to the tune of ₹90 lakh,” the complainant alleged while adding that the amount is expected to be higher. A case under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using a genuine) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the two accused at the Sector 39 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-punjab-tourism-board-officials-booked-for-rs-90-lakh-embezzlement-101627497349500.html
29-07-2021||Other||Meeting the challenge to decode a 400-yr-old DNA||LUCKNOW: Addressing the nation through a radio programme ‘Mann ki Baat’ on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared how Indian researchers uncovered the relics of a 16th-century Georgian queen, Ketevan the Martyr, from St Augustine Church in Goa in 2005 and how external affairs minister S Jaishankar permanently handed over the relic to the government of Georgia and its people in a recent programme. Sunday’s ‘Mann ki Baat’, however, acted as no less than a time machine for Neeraj Rai, a senior scientist and group head at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow. He was the man who unravelled the mystery of the 400-year-old relic (in the form of a bone) lying buried in the ruins of St Augustine church in Goa and confirmed that it was of Ketevan, the queen of Kakheti, Georgia, who was murdered at Shiraz in Iran in 1624 and earned the title of ‘martyr’ because it is believed she gave up her life defending the Christian faith and refused to convert to Islam, even after prolonged torture. However, after her death, Ketevan was canonised as a saint by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Neeraj Rai, the BSIP scientist, said Sunday’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ took him almost 22 years back when the mystery of the Georgian queen’s relic came under international spotlight and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) began its excavation in the ruins of St Augustine church in Goa. “I remember the time when I heard that the ASI had started excavation work to find the queen’s relic. It was fascinating and I always wanted to be a part of the discovery. At that time, I never thought that I would be the one to carry out its DNA analysis,” said Neeraj. However, after years of excavation work, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) eventually found the relic that was in the form of a bone. But the problem was that instead of one, they found three bones and now the question arose as to which one was of the queen. “We made the discovery in 2004-05. While excavating at around 8 to 10 metres deep in the ruins of St Augustine church, Goa, mentioned in literary evidence, we found three bones. Now the question was which one belonged to the queen,” said Dr Abhijit Ambekar, one of the archaeologists in the excavation team. BSIP scientist Neeraj Rai, who was a PhD student at the time with the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), took the subject as his PhD topic. “I started working on the relic in 2012 and started with DNA analysis,” said Neeraj. Prior to Rai, a few more researchers and scientists tried to decode the mystery but failed to extract the DNA from the holy relic. “The biggest challenge before me was to find out which was the queen’s bone. Initially, we tried to match the DNA samples with around 22,000 samples of the people of India that are in our data base. It was found that two bones matched with samples, but one didn’t match at all,” recollected Neeraj. However, he and his team then got 30 samples from Georgia and found the match. “Of the 30 samples which we brought from Georgia, two DNA samples from the people of Georgia matched with one of the three bones. Not only this, but we also tried to find out the gender of the person to whom the bone belonged. And it was found that this bone belonged to a woman, while the other two were of men. Hence, going by literary evidence and DNA analysis, we confirmed that the relic belonged to queen Ketevan,” Neeraj added. Along with Neeraj Rai, Dr Thangraj, director, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnosis (CDFD) and professor Gyaneshwar Chaube, professor, zoology, BHU were also a part of the DNA analysis team. How did the bone come to Goa from Iran? According to literary evidence, in 1613 the emperor of Persia Shah Abbas I led an army to conquer the Georgian kingdom of Kakheti. King of Kakheti Teimouraz paid tribute to the emperor but maintained autonomy and the Christian orthodox religion. Since the emperor’s army was immense, the Georgians sued for peace. They sent the king’s mother, Queen Ketevan and her two sons to negotiate for peace. The emperor sent them back to the Georgian camp but half way, he had them arrested and taken in chains to Shiraz, the then Persian capital. Ketevan was told to convert to Islam but on resisting she was tortured and finally strangled to death on September 22, 1624. Four months later, a Friar named Ambrosio dos Anjos unearthed her body amid great secrecy and sent it to the Augustinian convent in Aspaan, further south in Persia.Around February, another Friar Manuel Madre de Deus came to Goa with the right hand and part of the right arm of the Queen. This is how the bone came to Goa. Ambrosio dos Anjos took the main share of her relics to Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/meeting-the-challenge-to-decode-a-400-yr-old-dna-101627497350018.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to relax curbs in 25 districts||Maharashtra is likely to provide relaxations in 25 districts, including Mumbai, with low positivity and growth rate than the state average. The state is also considering the proposal to open suburban train travel in city for those who have taken both the shots of the Covid-19 vaccine.The state may allow shops to open for the entire day, except Sundays. The decision on relaxations is likely to be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the state task force meeting to be held on Thursday afternoon. It may also allow opening of hotels and cinema halls for those who are fully vaccinated. No relaxations will be given to 11 districts that have more than average positivity and growth rate. “The positivity rate and growth rate of 11 districts are still more than the state average, where the state government will not be able to give any relaxations. There is a need to provide relaxations in the rest of the 25 districts, having minimal positivity rate and growth rate. A joint proposal from the state health and relief and rehabilitation departments has been submitted to the chief minister, who is likely to take a final decision on Thursday,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope. Restaurants and gyms may also be allowed with stricter norms. “We have also proposed to allow people to travel in local trains if they have taken both the vaccines,” Tope said. Districts having growth rate more than the state average are — Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Beed, Raigad Pune and Osmanabad. Currently, the state’s average weekly growth rate is 0.11%. The state imposed stricter norms by reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three after cases of Delta-plus variants were found last month. The first two levels having maximum relaxations were removed till further order. As of now, malls and theatres have been completely shut across the state. Section 144 is applicable and not more than five people can gather at a public place while movements should be minimal post 5pm. Shops selling essentials are allowed to stay open till 4pm on a daily basis and those related to non-essentials are allowed to operate only on weekdays. Gyms and saloons are operational only till 4pm, with appointments and without air-conditioners. Restaurants can open till 4 pm only on weekdays, after which, only takeaways will be allowed. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal raised the issue in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday and said people want relaxations from Covid restrictions. “We have to seriously come up with a way out of the situation as people are very upset with the restrictions,” Bhujbal is said to have told the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-relax-curbs-in-25-districts-101627497289012.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Why Western Ghats are seeing landslides||Anthropogenic activities such as settlements and cutting for road construction, fluctuations in vegetation loosening the soil layer, deforestation, unchecked mining, concentration of extremely heavy rain at particular spots are, according to geologists and experts, to blame for the series of landslides in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Satara districts of the state last week. Last week, a landslide occurred in Taliye village in Raigad’s Mahad killing over 82. Besides Taliye, landslides also occurred in Ratnagiri’s Pedhe and Khed, and Satara’s Mirgaon, Ambeghar, and Dhokawale tehsils. Two to three landslides have been reported from uninhabited areas, blocking roads and highways in Raigad district, officials said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said the state will appoint a panel of geological experts to study the causes of landslides in the Western Ghats, which have claimed more than 100 lives and displaced thousands over last week. Geologists, who have studied the Western Ghats, say construction activities such as highways lead to haphazard cutting of mountain slopes. Dr Praveen B Gawali, scientist at Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, an autonomous research institute under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, has studied parts of Western Ghats and identified landslide susceptible villages in Ahmednagar district. He said heavy rain-triggered landslides are on the rise along the ghats. “Anthropogenic activities have given rise to anomalous slopes and due to gravitational pull and rain, the overlaying material comes down. In the Western Ghats, if you have continuous rainfall for a couple of days, the soil gets soggy, leading to landslides. This time, the rain was very heavy, which was concentrated at a few spots [leading to series of landslides]. If it is evenly spread out, it does not lead to landslides,” said Dr Gawali. According to Gawali, change in vegetational cover is also responsible for landslides in the region. He added that in India, landslides occur mainly in Himalayan region, Western Ghats and in the Nilgiris. While the incidents in Himalayan region occur due to tectonic movements, the landslides in Western Ghats and Nilgiris happen mainly due to heavy rain events. “We see a lot of landslides in the Himalayan region because the Himalayas is the youngest mountain range. The sediments are not yet compacted; they are loose. There is a tectonic activity with the plate moving up, which causes instability. It doesn’t require any precipitation activity, landslides occur in dry season there. In the Sahyadris, it is different. It isn’t any plate movement that is causing it. The vegetational cover is also responsible. During the monsoon, there is greenery, but afterwards it dries. The soil is exposed to natural conditions, many natural process occur with dampness. With excessive rainfall, chances of the soil cover creeping down increases manifold,” he added. Ecologist Dr Madhav Gadgil, who headed the state appointed Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel in 2010-11, said the committee’s recommendations to stop haphazard road construction, illegal mining, etc were not implemented by the state. “In 2011, we had submitted a report stating several activities that shouldn’t be carried out in such eco-sensitive zone. We had said that haphazard planning of highways by cutting mountains slopes, unchecked construction and mining activities should not be done. The windmill projects that have come up on the ghats have caused huge fractures on the mountains loosening structures. Similar issues are happening in Kerala and Maharashtra is seeing this. The recommendations of the committee were not followed by the government and these landslides are a result of these,” Gadgil said. Vijay Nahata, chairman of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, said all measures are fully followed before providing clearances to any project on the Konkan region. Nahata said, “Environmental clearances for new projects are provided based on several parameters. We are very cautious of the environment and ecology while doing so. The incidents of landslides mainly occur due to heavy and continuous rainfall in the region.” “The government can still implement the recommendations made by the committee. Activities that hamper the region need to stop and eco-restorations measures have to be adopted to tackle such incidents,” said Gadgil. Despite attempts, Aaditya Thackeray, minister for environment and climate change, was unavailable for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-western-ghats-are-seeing-landslides-101627497109004.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||Lake level crosses 70%, Mumbai has water stock till April 2022: BMC||Owing to heavy rainfall in Mumbai and its neighbouring areas in the past two weeks, water levels in the seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city crossed 70% on Wednesday. The city now has a water stock of around 260 days that will last till April 2022.Civic officials said it was very likely that the city might not have any water cuts this year. However, it will continue monitoring rainfall throughout August. A BMC official said, “Total lake level going above 85%-90% is considered to be safe, even 70% is safe, but we also need to have rainfall in August to not have any water cuts.”According to BMC’s data, four lakes — Tulsi, Vihar, Tansa and Modak Sagar — have overflowed so far. These lakes have 100% water stock except for Tansa which has 99% stock. Tulsi Lake, located inside the city, was the first to overflow on July 16 followed by Vihar Lake on July 18 and Modak Sagar and Tansa on July 22.It was between July 16 and July 23 that the catchment areas received the maximum rainfall. On July 17, the overall water level in seven lakes was just 17% and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) was considering announcing a water cut. However, the water level had crossed the 50%-mark by July 22, 60%-mark on July 24 and 70%-mark on July 28. Last year on July 28, the total water stock in the seven lakes was 32% and it was 75% in 2019.Bhatsa, which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement, has 64% water as compared to 36% last year at this time. Upper Vaitarna has 48% water as of Tuesday. Last year at this time, it had only 9%. The water level at Middle Vaitarna is 68% as compared to 32% last year at this time.The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems — the Vaitarna system which supplies to western suburbs and island city, and the Bhatsa system which supplies to eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres. In order to meet the shortfall, BMC has been exploring several ways to increase water supply. Two weeks ago, the civic body signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with an Israel-based firm for the city’s first desalination project at Manori in Malad. Under this project, BMC plans to turn seawater into drinking water, and the pilot project is expected to be ready by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lake-level-crosses-70-mumbai-has-water-stock-till-april-2022-bmc-101627497048986.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Fee hike: Delhi govt issues notice to pvt school, says it will take over||The Delhi government on Wednesday said it will issue a show-cause notice to Apeejay School in Sheikh Sarai for repeatedly failing to comply with the education department’s order on rolling back the fee hike introduced by them in the last two academic years, and said it will also take steps to take over the school management.“Directorate of Education (DoE) decided to issue a show-cause notice for taking over the management of Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai, after the school repeatedly failed to comply with multiple orders of the Delhi government asking it to roll back its unjustified fee hike. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal approved the proposal of the Directorate of Education to take over the management of the school. The decision [was] sent to the LG (Lieutenant Governor),” said a statement released by education minister Manish Sisodia’ s office.In its response to the notice, the school described the allegations as prejudicial and incorrect.In a similar instance, the Delhi government announced on July 27 that it will take over the management of Swami Sivananda Memorial School in Punjabi Bagh after it received complaints of charging arbitrary extra fee.According to education department officials, the DoE inspected the financial statements of the Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai, from 2012-13 to 2018-19. “After a detailed inspection, the department found that the total funds for the year 2018-19 amounted to ₹49,72,45,586, of which the expenditure was estimated to be ₹18,87,02,422, implying that there was a net surplus of ₹30,85,43,164, upon which the department concluded that the school had no actual need to increase the fees of the school. In the same regard, the directorate refused to accept the proposed fee structure of the school for the academic session 2018-19 and 2019-20,” the statement said.In May last year, the Delhi government sealed the two branches of Apeejay School in Saket and Sheikh Sarai for charging hiked fees from students in violation of the directions issued by the education department.The school approached the high court against the directorate’s order but the court endorsed the DoE stand asking the school to roll back the increased fees, officials said.The school said classes will continue. “All our actions and fees charged are as per the orders of the Delhi high court, and we are shocked at the prejudicial and incorrect statements made by the Delhi government while the matter is subjudice and especially during Covid-19. Our parents and students will remain unaffected, and we will continue our excellent virtual education in partnership with them,” the school spokesperson said in response to the government’s notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-issues-notice-to-take-over-sheikh-sarai-school-for-failing-to-rollback-fee-hike-101627495789430.html

Khan was murdered just a few hours after the incident on the same day,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rajesh Deo.DCP Deo said that around 8 pm on December 28, 2016, the Patel Nagar police received a call about a man found with stab injuries behind the Rock Garden gate number 1. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died during treatment.During investigation, the DCP said, the team found that Khan and his friends allegedly had an altercation with a man for sexually harassing a girl. Police said later in the evening, the man returned with his three friends, caught Khan who was alone by then, and allegedly stabbed him before fleeing.“Our team members re-examined the case and activated the human intelligence network to collect details of the suspects. On July 27, they received information that one Rohit from Karol Bagh was the one who had an altercation with Khan and his friends before the murder. We arrested Rohit and his interrogation led to the arrest of the other three suspects,” said DCP Deo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-solve-five-year-old-murder-case-arrest-four-101627495788832.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Cops deploy more boots on ground in Delhi after rains brings traffic to a crawl||A day after the city received over 100mm rainfall in just a three-hour span, which left roads inundated and traffic to a standstill, the Delhi traffic police department on Wednesday deployed all “boots on the ground” to ensure movement was managed efficiently. Though parts of the city saw snarls, especially immediately after the early morning showers, traffic officials said that the situation was “better compared to Tuesday”.Senior officials on Wednesday said strict directions were issued to all traffic circles to ensure more personnel were deployed to ensure smoother movement and to minimise snarls on arterial stretches.Traffic police chief Muktesh Chander after serpentine snarls on Tuesday around central Delhi after a DTC bus broke down on Red Cross Road, slowing traffic to a crawl around Parliament, where the monsoon session is underway. Officials said that Chander issued special instructions to ensure maximum deployment, especially during rainy days, to avoid a repeat of Tuesday’s scenario.“All circles were also asked to present accounts of the traffic situation in their areas every three hours. They were also asked to coordinate with other government agencies in the event of cave-ins and bus breakdowns, to clear passageways as soon as possible,” a traffic official said.Even though fewer traffic snarls were reported on Wednesday, it is important to note that Delhi’s Safdarjung weather station — data from which is considered representative for the city — recorded only 4.1mm rainfall till 5.30pm on Wednesday, as opposed to over 100mm of rain recorded in three hours, between 5.30am and 8.30am, on Tuesday. This meant that roads were relatively clear of water logging. However, instances of vehicle breakdowns and road cave-ins were recorded from parts of the city.Traffic police said that after the rain on Wednesday, a portion of Shahjahan Road near Jamnagar House caved in, after which the area was cordoned off and traffic movement was allowed only on a single carriageway.“The portion of the road has been temporarily fixed and traffic was being allowed here through the day,” the traffic department said.Snarls were also reported from Newada, Ashok Vihar, Dhaula Kuan, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) flyover, Ring Road (near Bhikaji Cama Place, South Extension, Defence Colony and Lajpat Nagar), Rajouri Garden, Dwarka Mor and Palam flyover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-deploy-more-boots-on-ground-in-delhi-on-wednesday-a-day-after-downpour-brings-traffic-to-a-crawl-101627495729426.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 3 dead, one hurt as car collides with cluster bus near Chhawla||Three men, including two brothers, were killed while another person was critically injured after the car they were travelling in had a head-on collision with a cluster bus in southwest Delhi’s Chhawla on Tuesday night. Police are on the lookout of the bus driver who fled the spot after the accident.The deceased have been identified as Akhil (35), who was driving the Swift car, two brothers Pradeep Singh (32) and Kuldeep Singh (30). The fourth person, identified by his first name Sahil (32), is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. His condition was serious till Wednesday night, said police.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said the accident took place on Jhatikra Mor near Chhawla police station around 10pm on Monday.A team was deployed to the accident spot, which found both the Swift car and the cluster bus in a mangled state. They learnt the four men trapped inside the car--three of them rescued by a marshal deployed in another cluster bus and its driver, along with some passersby, while Akhil was brought out by cutting the vehicle with a gas cutter--were injured and rushed to a hospital. Later, the police received a call from Rao Tula Ram hospital about admission of four injured men.“Akhil was declared brought dead while Sahil was injured and referred to a private hospital for better treatment. Pradeep and Kuldeep were referred to Safdarjung hospital and Venkateshwar hospital respectively, where they were declared brought dead,” said DCP Meena.Police said all the four were residents of Najafgarh and were into the business of real estate. On Tuesday evening, they had gone to see a property in Jhatikra and were returning home when the accident took place.A police officer said the accident took place on a road that did not have a divider. Prima facie, the officer said, it appeared that the car was moving at a high speed and the bus was trying to overtake another vehicle because of which it came on the wrong side of the road.“It appears that the car driver was trying to avoid a collision by taking a left turn. But since there was not enough space on the left and the bus was coming from the front, he may have lost control of the car and the vehicle ended up ramming into the bus,” said the officer.DCP Meena said that a case of rash and negligent driving causing death was registered and searches were on to nab the errant driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-3-dead-one-hurt-as-car-collides-with-cluster-bus-near-chhawla-101627495729986.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to hold special probe into renting of trommel machines by civic body||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday said the Delhi government will conduct a special investigation into the alleged corruption by the municipal corporations in getting trommel machines for cleaning the city’s main landfill sites in Bhalswa and Ghazipur.Addressing a press conference, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation is set to pay a yearly rent of ₹2.20 crore for trommel machines that can be bought for ₹17.70 lakh each. The proposal to rent these machines was passed by the standing committee on Tuesday, he said, adding that the AAP will file a complaint before the Delhi government to conduct a special audit under the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2011.A trommel machine is a cylindrical apparatus for cleaning and segregating waste for further remediation. Currently 23 trommel machines are being used by the corporation at the landfill sites.“The BJP-ruled municipal corporations have accepted that they will now rent this machines at a rate that is three times higher than their present rent. The north corporation standing committee president Jogi Ram Jain lied that these machines are not on rent. But, if you read the standing committee’s agenda, it clearly states that these machines are on rent,” said Bhardwaj.“Earlier, the monthly rent of each trommel machine was ₹6.30 lakh and even then, questions were raised by their own auditor about the amount and how it was too high. Now, as per the new contract that was revealed on Tuesday, the rent which the corporation is ready to pay for these machines has been increased from ₹6.30 lakh to ₹18.36 lakh, which is three times more. Yesterday (Tuesday), during the standing committee meeting, our councillors protested outside its office and staged a sit-in protest demanding an inquiry,” the AAP leader said.The Delhi BJP rejected the AAP’s allegations and said the company which has been given the contract to operate these trommel machines have been asked to run them round-the-clock in three shifts. “The company handling the machines will operate them round the clock to dispose of the garbage. The company will also bring in its own loaders and trucks to remove the sand generated by the trommel machines. The AAP may order any inquiry, but nothing wrong will be found as the trommel contract is fully transparent,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“The AAP is frustrated due to the L-G’s indication of a CBI inquiry in the DTC bus maintenance scam and strong allegations against the Delhi Jal Board over irregularities. As a political retaliation, AAP is trying to level false allegations on the north corporation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-hold-special-probe-into-renting-of-trommel-machines-by-civic-body-aap-101627495728826.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Rains in Delhi likely to intensify over weekend, says IMD||The light to moderate rainfall in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) on Wednesday helped bring down the daytime temperature by nearly seven degrees with the weather department predicting showers on Thursday, which is likely to intensify over the weekend.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 27.6 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below the season’s normal. The minimum here was 25.1°C, two notches below normal.At the Palam weather observatory, the maximum temperature fell to 27.2°C, eight degrees below what is considered normal for this time of the year, and the minimum was 26.7°C.Met department recordings show that till 5.30pm on Wednesday, Safdarjung recorded 4.1mm rain, Palam received 26.8mm and Lodhi Road recorded 6mm rain. The Ridge station received 32.6mm rain, while the Aya Nagar observatory received 22.4mm rain.This month, Delhi has already broken the record for the wettest July since 2003, recording 381mm rainfall till Tuesday (July 27). In July 2003, the city recorded 632.2mm rain. Normally, weather records show Delhi logs 210.6mm precipitation in July.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre, said another spell of moderate rainfall is likely to hit the city between July 30 and 31.“There is a forecast of moderate showers in Delhi and NCR again from July 30, so the cumulative rainfall recording for July this year could be even higher. We will have to see if it breaks any more records,” said Srivastava.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecaster, said despite a late start to monsoon, Delhi has managed to exceed the rainfall usually seen in July.“With just a few spells of rain, we have managed to record a surplus of nearly 200% rainfall already and we still have a few more days for the month to end. A low pressure area (LPA) over north Bay of Bengal has intensified into a well-marked LPA over the same region. This means that in the coming days, intense showers will be recorded in Delhi’s neighbouring states as well,” said Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rains-in-delhi-likely-to-intensify-over-weekend-says-imd-101627495669427.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi assembly to discuss appointment of Rakesh Asthana as police commissioner||The Aam Aadmi Party legislators have said that they will discuss the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the new Delhi police commissioner, which they claimed was done in violation of a Supreme Court judgment, in the two-day monsoon session of the Delhi assembly beginning Thursday.The Union home ministry announced the appointment of Asthana as the new Delhi police commissioner on Tuesday evening, three days before his retirement as the director general of the Border Security Force (BSF). He replaced Balaji Srivastava.“In 2019, the SC ruled that no officer with less than six months of tenure left should be named to a top police job. In fact, Asthana was the front-runner for being the CBI chief in May, 2019, but was dropped after the Chief Justice of India, NV Ramana, pointed to the same SC ruling,” said Sanjeev Jha, AAP MLA from Burari, one of the three legislators who said they will discuss the issue on Thursday in the assembly. The other two MLAs are Akhilesh Pati Tripathi and Som Dutt.The matter has been approved by the Speaker, and it is mentioned in the list of business for the day on Thursday.The BJP members, however, said the SC ruling only applied to selection of state DGPs. They said apart from raising the issue of shortage of teachers in schools, they will also highlight how the Delhi government’s alleged failed to manage the Covid-19 crisis during the brutal fourth wave in Delhi in April-May.“The Opposition will ask the Delhi government as to why the much renowned healthcare infrastructure in Delhi collapsed during the fourth wave, leaving people to fend for themselves. There were no beds in the hospitals, there was shortage of oxygen and ICU beds, despite Delhi having faced the three waves earlier and knowing its shortcomings,” said leader of opposition Ramvir Bidhuri.The Congress also raised objections to Asthana’s appointment on Tuesday, saying was in “direct contravention” of a SC judgment and asked whether any “quid pro quo” was involved. “Not just is it an issue of inter-cadre appointment; the issue expands to another instance of blatant disregard towards the Supreme Court of India and the laws of the land,” Congress Pawan Khera alleged.The AAP has 62 members in the 70-member Delhi assembly, while BJP has 8. The Congress has zero.An MHA spokesperson did not comment on the matter.The AAP legislators also plan to discuss the alleged failure of the city’s three municipal corporations, which are ruled by the BJP, in preventing waterlogging after heavy rains in the city this month. MLAs Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, Sanjeev Jha and Bhavna Gaur said the MCDs have failed to maintain drains that has led to chaos on roads.The assembly will also pass a resolution recommending Bharat Ratna — India’s highest civilian award — to environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna, a founding member of the Chipko movement. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 17, demanding that the honour be conferred on the environmentalist.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs are also expected to raise the issue of shortage of teachers in Delhi government schools on the first day. On July 4, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that 50% of the schools run by the civic bodies do not maintain pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) as mandated under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. However, the civic bodies claimed that the ratio was well within the legal limit.The assembly secretariat has made it mandatory for all the 70 Delhi MLAs to get tested for Covid-19 before attending the session on Thursday. Those who do not have a test report will have to reach the assembly premises before the session starts at 11am to get a rapid antigen test, a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-assembly-to-discuss-appointment-of-rakesh-asthana-as-police-commissioner-101627495668867.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court stays imposition of costs on police in Delhi riots case||The Delhi high court on Wednesday stayed the imposition of ₹25,000 in case costs on the Delhi Police till the next date of hearing in a case related to north-east Delhi riots, even as it refused to interfere with the trial court’s observation against the probe in that case.On Monday, the police moved the high court against the trial court’s order of imposing a cost on it and calling the probe “farcical” and “callous”. The order came on a plea filed by a man named Nasir (single name), who was shot in the left eye during the riots that broke out in February 2020.In his order, additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav pulled up the police for lack of efficacy and fairness in the investigation and said the probe was done in a most casual, callous, and farcical manner.“We can’t expunge the remarks without hearing you (police). Costs may not be deposited till the next date of hearing,” said justice Subramonium Prasad while posting the matter to September 13.The court issued a notice to the city police and also sought the response from Nasir within 10 days.Additional solicitor general S V Raju, appearing for the police, said at present, their main grievance was against the imposition of costs and the strictures. He also submitted that an FIR pertaining to the incident was lodged and the case thoroughly investigated; the accused was found to be not present at the spot at the relevant time.Advocate Mehmood Pracha, representing Nasir, claimed that the police’s stand was misleading and his client was under “tremendous pressure to withdraw his pleas” before the court.But the police argued that the imposition of a fine, which was to be recovered from the station house officer (SHO) of Bhajanpura police station and his supervising officers, was unwarranted and uncalled for.The police said the July 13 order of the trial court was in violation of the principles of natural justice as it was passed without giving due opportunity to the DCP (deputy commissioner of police) to make his submissions, and that very serious remarks were made by the court against the investigation even prior to the commencement of trial.Communal clashes broke out in north-east Delhi on February 24, 2020, after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 700 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-stays-imposition-of-costs-on-police-in-delhi-riots-case-101627495609382.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Rakesh Asthana takes charge as Delhi police commissioner||Rakesh Asthana, a 1984 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer from the Gujarat cadre, on Wednesday took charge as the Delhi Police commissioner at the force’s headquarters on Jai Singh Road. Asthana replaced Balaji Srivastava, who was given the additional charge of the police commissioner after the retirement of SN Shrivastava 27 days ago.In his first media briefing, Asthana said he believed in the basic concept of policing that includes maintaining law and order and preventing crime for establishing peace in society.“I have taken charge as the Delhi Police commissioner today (Wednesday). I believe in the basic concept of policing, that is, maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime. That is the basic thing which we are supposed to do. If these things are done properly, peace prevails in society. There are certain specialised problems, for which there are separate standard operating procedures (SOPs). We will work accordingly,” said Asthana soon after he took over from Srivastava at the commissioner’s office.Asthana’s appointment was announced late Tuesday evening, four days before his retirement as the director general of the Border Security Force (BSF). His inter-cadre deputation from the Gujarat cadre to the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory) cadre and extension of his service by one year was also announced on Tuesday.Escorted by two police vehicles, Asthana reached the Delhi Police headquarters at 1.45pm in a white sedan, the official police commissioner’s vehicle, and was greeted with a bouquet of flowers by Srivastava at the main reception area, where the police’s top officers and mediapersons were present. Ashtana was accorded the ceremonial guard of honour, after which he entered the headquarters building, flanked by all special commissioners of police.While other special commissioners left for the commissioner’s meeting hall named ‘Vimarsh’, Srivastava, and two special CPs Sundri Nanda and Praveer Ranjan, accompanied Asthana to the commissioner’s office where he took over charge.Asthana then briefed the media during which he also praised the Delhi Police for its “brilliant past and performance in handling complicated cases and situations”. He said he hopes to work in tandem with everyone to ensure the betterment of society.“Delhi Police has a brilliant past. A lot of good work has been done by the city police in the past. A lot of complicated cases have been solved. A lot of complicated situations have been handled by the Delhi Police. I believe in team work and I hope that with this team work, we will be able to put the best foot forward for the betterment of society and prevalence of peace,” he said.Before taking the charge as Delhi Police commissioner, Asthana was the director general of BSF and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). He has earlier worked as the special director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). During his stint in the CBI, he was engaged in an unsavoury spat with then CBI director Alok Verma with both of them levelling allegations of corruption against each other. In Gujarat, he has served as commissioner of police in Surat and Vadodara.Asthana graduated and did his post-graduation from St John’s College, Agra, the police said in a statement.In another development on Wednesday, Praveer Ranjan, a 1993 batch IPS officer who was heading the Delhi Police’s crime branch as a special commissioner, was appointed the director general of police (DGP) Chandigarh. Ranjan will replace 1989 batch IPS officer Sanjay Bainiwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/asthana-takes-charge-as-delhi-police-commissioner-101627495549354.html
29-07-2021||Delhi||Minor abducted, raped by 24-year-old repeat offender in Wazirpur||A 24-year-old man, who was absconding for nearly a year after fleeing custody in a case related to the rape and murder of a minor girl in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur, was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly kidnapping and raping a nine-year-old girl in a jhuggi near Wazirpur Industrial Area in northwest Delhi on Sunday afternoon.Police said the suspect, identified as Salim alias Chhotu, was homeless in Delhi after his escape from custody in Rampur and was employed as a cleaner in factories in Wazirpur Industrial Area. Police found out about his antecedents after his arrest.“Salim was in a jail in Rampur, when he was infected by Covid-19 and got admitted to a local hospital. On August 28 last year, Salim fled the hospital after which a separate case under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) was registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police. He had been absconding since then,” said deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani.According to a senior police officer associated with the case, Salim came across the girl, who was with her parents and two brothers, at a confectionery shop in Shalimar Bagh. He said Salim allegedly lured the girl by promising to buy her new clothes and sweets.“Salim boarded an e-rickshaw with the girl and took her to a vacant shanty close to the railway tracks in Wazirpur Industrial area. He held her captive for a couple of hours and raped her, after threatening to kill her with a knife... Later, he dropped the girl near her home and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the crime,” the officer said.Police said the girl, after returning home, was rattled and did not tell anyone about her ordeal despite her parents asking about it. In the evening, the girl complained of pain in the abdomen and was taken to a nearby hospital where the doctor said that she was sexually assaulted and called police.“We registered a case of kidnapping, rape, and criminal intimidation under IPC sections 363 (kidnapping),376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Shalimar Bagh police station. Counsellors talked to the girl and extracted information about the suspect. However, she was clueless about his identity as she had never met him before. She only remembered the vacant shanty near railway tracks ,” the officer said.DCP Rangnani said investigators scanned over 200 CCTV cameras to identify the suspect. “He was arrested from Wazirpur Industrial Area on Tuesday,” said the DCP.The girl’s father works as a truck cleaner and mother is a tuberculosis patient, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/absconding-arrest-for-rape-murder-24-yr-old-held-for-abducting-raping-another-9-yr-old-in-delhi-101627495548810.html
29-07-2021||Gurugram||Peacock killed in DLF-5 after being hit by car||A three-year-old male peacock was killed after being hit by a speeding car on Monday evening in DLF-5, the police said. However, a case is yet to be filed into the incident.The police said that they received a call around 10.30pm from a man who identified himself as a supervisor, following which a team from the Sushant Lok police station and wildlife officials recovered the carcass.According to the CCTV camera footage of the incident, which has been accessed by HT, the incident took place at 6.45pm, when a white car of Mercedes made a turn towards the Camellias residential society from the Golf Drive inside DLF-5.Rajesh Chahal, a wildlife inspector, said that the peacock died on the spot and an autopsy of the carcass was done on Tuesday. “The post-mortem examination report revealed that the bird was hit on its head and neck portion and died on the spot, but all the feathers of the bird were intact. The bird was consigned to flames with full national honours at the Sultanpur National Park on Tuesday,” he said.Peacock is listed under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, as is the National Bird of India. Officials said that killing a peacock is a serious offence that can attract a prison sentence of three to seven years or a fine of up to ₹25,000 or both.Chahal said they tried reaching out to the mobile number from which they received the call, but it was switched off due to which they could not record a statement of the supervisor.Sanjeev Balhara, an assistant commissioner of police, said that they have not received any complaint, from either a resident or wildlife department officials. “We will take action against the driver of the car that hit the peacock once the statement of the person who informed is recorded. The wildlife department is also conducting an investigation. We have received the car’s registration number and the owner has been identified as a resident of Aralias in DLF-5,” he said.Balhara said that the driver was speeding, entered the complex through Gate Number 2 and took a left turn towards the residential area.A circular, sent by DLF’s customer engagement team on Tuesday informing the residents regarding the incident, stated, “As you are aware the peacocks, partridges and other exotic birds have made the sanctuary their home and we are richer and blessed to have their beauty and presence in the DLF Golf Links. To prevent such unfortunate incidents again, we are reiterating that speeding on the Golf Drive is not permitted. We urge the residents and their guests to strictly adhere to the set speed limits.”Requisite signage will be installed on the Golf Drive in consultation with the forest department, to bring awareness about the wildlife around us, the circular stated.Despite repeated calls and messages, officials of DLF did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/peacock-killed-in-dlf-5-after-being-hit-by-car-101627495252065.html
29-07-2021||Mumbai||With a rising daily Covid caseload Beed, Solapur emerge as new areas of concern for Maharashtra||Two districts in Maharashtra — Beed and Solapur — are among 22 districts across India marked out by the Centre as “areas of concern” for recording an increasing daily Covid-19 caseload trend for the past four weeks. Drought-ridden Beed showed a meagre prevalence of the virus during the first wave but has since recorded over 97,600 cases and 2,600 deaths to date. It also clocks some of the state’s lowest vaccination rates. Solapur, which abuts Pune, Sangli and Kolhapur — all three districts of concern in the state — has recorded over 185,000 cases and 4800 deaths to date.“We have noted an increasing trend in these 22 districts, week on week basis. This is a cause of concern,” joint secretary of health ministry Lav Agarwal said in a media briefing on Tuesday. Besides Maharashtra, the other districts are from Kerala (7), Manipur (5), Meghalaya (3), Arunachal Pradesh (3) and one each in Assam and Tripura. The Union ministry of health and family welfare has said that these are “areas of concern” and are constantly talking with the states about containment and early detection efforts. “What was striking in Beed is the limited exposure to the virus during the first wave, due to stringent lockdown measures that were implemented,” said Dr Radhakrishna Pawar, the district’s health officer. “The first serological survey carried out in August last year showed merely 0.1% exposure in the population. The second survey carried out in June this year showed that nearly 41% of people had developed antibodies. The cases will keep rising till there is immunity by natural infections or vaccinations,” he said adding that they are anticipating a much severe third wave. On July 1, Beed recorded 103 cases. The number went up to 211 on July 20 and 244 on Wednesday. The district reached a peak in August last year with the highest daily caseload touching 350. This year, Beed recorded a peak in May with the highest daily caseload reaching 1,515. Beed’s vaccination coverage is among the lowest. The district has administered 699,483 doses as of July 28, of which merely 9500 people are in the age group of 18 to 44 and a little over 100,000 people above 45 years are fully vaccinated. “Our target adult population is 29 lakh, but we have just about achieved 18% vaccine coverage,” said Pawar adding that there has been an acute shortfall of doses, and vials run within hours of arrival. While most positive cases were recorded in urban blocks of Beed during the first wave, officials are now recording cases among the rural population. There are instances of clusters of cases coming from villages. For example, Sabalkhed village in Beed recorded 50 cases over the past two weeks. Health officials say that lockdown restrictions are mostly on paper now, and people have given up on adhering to protocols. “Physical distancing and covid appropriate behaviour like wearing masks are completely absent now, which is driving the positivity,” said Beed based chest physician Dr Anil Barkul. On July 1, Solapur district recorded 515 positive cases. The number went up to 615 on July 20 and 529 on Wednesday. In the last seven days of June, Solapur’s average daily positive cases were 354. “Our daily positivity rate hovered between 4% to 4.5% in June, but it gradually started rising in July between 5.5% to 6%,” said Dr Shitalkumar Jadhav, Solapur’s district health officer. The district is carrying out an average of 13,000 tests daily, but 60% of these are the Rapid Antigen Tests while 40% are RTPCR. Its vaccination coverage is also at the lower end with a target population of 36 lakh and only 914, 838 doses administered so far. “About 1.5 lakh people are fully vaccinated in the district,” said Jadhav. He said that five talukas- Karmala, Madha, Pandharpur, Malshiras and Sangola- are contributing to most cases. These talukas are neighbouring to districts like Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar and there is free movement between these areas after travel relaxations. “A lot of shepherds have been visiting from Satara and they have been holding small religious gatherings too. Besides, there is routine travel of farm labourers and others for work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/beed-and-solapur-emerge-as-new-areas-of-concern-for-maharashtra-with-a-rising-daily-covid-caseload-101627494348774.html

29-07-2021||Pune||Pune student bodies step forward to help flood victims||Students and student organisations from the city have come forward to help the flood-affected people from Chiplun, Sangli and Kolhapur districts. They have decided to provide drinking water and sanitary cleaning material to the flood-hit parts after the people there informed about scarcity of the same.Members of one of the students’ organisations which has taken the lead, “Youth the Power to Change”, are packing kits containing cleaning material. Rohan Shetty, president of the organisation, said, “Ever since the floods in Chiplun, Sangli and Kolhapur districts, we have been in continuous touch with our friends and other people there. With the waters now receding, the major issue faced by the people is how to clean their houses and shops. As there is no cleaning material available to them, we decided to make cleaning material kits and send them to Chiplun. Each kit includes a small bucket, scrubber, detergent powder and other necessary items.”Along with cleaning kits, the organisation is also sending 1000 litre of packaged drinking water for the benefit of the flood-hit people. A few collection centres have been set up around the city where Punekars including students can come forth and donate cash or material towards the cause.Another youth organisation which goes by the name, “Vande Mataram Sangathana” is focusing exclusively on the distribution of drinking water through public contribution. The organisation has decided to collect 1 lakh litre of packaged drinking water through public donations. “We have started the initiative since yesterday and appealed to students and Punekars to come forward and help the flood victims. The situation has got so worse that Chiplun will not have clean drinking water for the next three weeks. Punekars have responded whole-heartedly to our appeal and within a day’s time, we have collected 31,000 litre of packaged drinking water,” said Sachin Jamage, state executive president of the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-student-bodies-step-forward-to-help-flood-victims-101627491349688.html
29-07-2021||Pune||Despite STAC guidelines, PMC fails to keep Pune roads pothole-free||Despite a High Court’s order, the STAC (Standing Technical Advisory Committee) report and Urban Street guidelines, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is failing to maintain the city’s roads, with potholes frequently showing up, causing an inconvenience to citizens. The road department accepted the fact that after a gap of four to five years, this year, more potholes have emerged in July. PMC officials attributed the scenario to the 24x7 water project and laying of cables by various agencies. Civic activist Qaneez Sukhrani said, “I had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against PMC over the pothole issue in 2006. The Bombay high court had directed the PMC to constitute a technical advisory committee of experts in the field of road engineering and construction, in order to advise the PMC on its road strategy.” The STAC committee was constituted by PMC in 2007. It took many years of the committee stopping and re-starting until the report was finalised in 2013. Sukhrani said, “As a result of both orders, detailed matters relating to road design, construction, quality aspects, specifications, and maintenance management were laid down.” Vivek Velankar, a member of the STAC, said, “Despite having all the documents and technical guidance, the PMC is not following it. The contractors and officers are not bothered about resurfacing road works being carried out as per guidelines. They do shabby work and citizens become the victims.” Following heavy rains last week, most roads in the city, particularly in the peth areas, are laden with potholes. According to head of the road department, VJ Kulkarni, as road digging happened on a massive scale due to development projects, roads are getting damaged. Once a road loses its original status, it’s really difficult to retain it in a good condition. “After the water project, we would need to take on a road project. We will need to chalk out a plan for more than Rs1,000 crore for roads, as almost 18,00km of roads are getting dug-up under this scheme,” Kulkarni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/despite-stac-guidelines-pmc-fails-to-keep-pune-roads-potholefree-101627490268366.html
29-07-2021||Pune||Residents frustrated over poor, unsafe road conditions in Pune locality||Pune: Pedestrians face a tough time commuting from Gangadham to Kondhwa road as the entire stretch is in poor condition. Residents said that road repairs and extension work is going on for last two years and still it is not completed. The local residents’ forum has raised the issue with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune traffic police department many times, but to no avail. “We live on the Gangadham to Kondhwa road stretch passing through the Aai Mata Mandir chowk. Many new residential housing societies have come up on this stretch in the last few years. The road widening work is a long pending issue. It has not been completed since last two years. We have many times written to the authorities to complete the road extension work as it is dangerous for traffic movement,” said Atul Jain, resident and member of Kondhwa Development Forum. There are various issues which the residents have raised, including road widening pending since more than five years, no streetlights and bottleneck near the Aai Mata Mandir chowk, vegetable and roadside vendors encroaching road and leaving less space for traffic movement. Heavy vehicle movement and its parking also poses risk to pedestrians and vehicle users. Another resident Bipin Gandhi said, “I daily travel by this road for my work and it’s a nightmare with traffic jams during peak hours, garbage lying on road and encroachment by illegal hawkers. If we are paying taxes to PMC, then it is their responsibility to provide us with better and safe roads to travel.” Jyoti Dhotre, ward officer of Kondhwa-Yewalewadi, has assured the residents’ forum to take necessary action to repair the road and make safety arrangements. “We have received a letter from residents on the Gangadham-Kondhwa road issue and we will be working on it,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-frustrated-over-poor-unsafe-road-conditions-in-kondhwa-101627488348179.html

29-07-2021||Pune||Traffic snarls hit busy Pune peth areas||Pune: Commuting within afternoon hours in peth areas is turning out to be a chaotic experience for residents due to traffic jams leading to very slow movement for two-wheeler users and pedestrians. Road repairs, potholed stretches, non-functional signals at some places and continuous spells of rains are making commuting difficult in the core parts of the city. Once you overcome heavy traffic issue in the core parts of the city, roads connecting Pimpri-Chinchwad — University road, Khadki Bazar road — are also witnessing heavy traffic between 3pm and 5pm due to Covid restrictions with majority of offices closing down in the city during the same time. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) traffic Rahul Shrirame did not respond to calls despite many attempts. A junior official on request of anonymity said, “Since last one week traffic in the core part of the city has increased due to multiple reasons. Due to the reopening of shops, more people are seen on the roads. Road repairs is also one reason as vehicles are not able to move freely and heavy rains have created potholes. Even, many signals are not working.” Shivpriya Mote, resident of Tapkir galli on Appa Balwant chowk, said, “Residents living in these lanes face trouble even to walk on the main road. Pune Municipal Corporation should find a solution to decongest the roads.” Parisar, a non-governmental organisation that had presented a city mobility plan to PMC, said Laxmi road, Kumthekar road and a few main roads of peth areas should be made “no-vehicle zones” to ease traffic congestion. “It is not possible to add new development plans in these old areas of the city. Decongestion of traffic can give breathers to people who often visit these shopping areas. PMC should come out with norms of short and long-term parking under pay and park policy,” said Ranjit Gadgil, programme director, Parisar. “Due to free parking, many people are keeping their vehicles parked for long hours. Those who shop in these areas and have to park vehicles for five to six hours should park their vehicles in long-term parking while people who come for shopping should allowed parking in short-term parking zones,” said Parisar. PMC had planned to make Laxmi road walking plaza, however, plan never worked out and it remained on paper. PMC has also not taken any step to implement pay and park policy in the city. “Pune traffic police will be taking a few steps in coming days to reduce traffic congestion,” said the junior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traffic-snarls-hit-busy-pune-peth-areas-101627485047867.html

29-07-2021||World||Bill moved to kill work programme for foreign students in US||A group of Republican Congressmen re-introduced last week a legislation to eliminate a temporary employment programme for foreign students during their studies in US colleges or on completion of their courses called Optional Practical Training (OPT) programme .“At a time when American college graduates are struggling to find a job and many are saddled with student loans, our government should not be incentivising foreign employees over Americans. This badly flawed government programme should be eliminated,” said Paul Gosar, one of the four members of the House of Representatives, who moved the legislation.The other three are Representatives Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks and Any Biggs. All four are staunch loyalists of former president Donald Trump, who, while in office, had pushed for and effected hardline anti-immigrant polities in the name. Among other things, he had introduced measures to tighten the H-1B programmes.Gosar, Biggs and Brooks also face questions for their role in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol by Trump supporters who wanted to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s election.There was talk the Trump administration had wanted to end the OPT programme, which has been popular with foreign students, including many from India. It allows foreign students to apply for part-time or full-time work either during the course or after for a year. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students are allowed two more years.The Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act 2020, as the legislation is called, will have to be passed by the House and the Senate - both of which are controlled by Democrats - to reach the president’s desk for enactment, the chances of which appear extremely dim. To become law, it will need to be signed by another Democrat, President Joe Biden, who has shown no inclination to support any of Trump’s hardline immigration policies, and has, in fact, rescinded many of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-moved-to-kill-work-programme-for-foreign-students-in-us-101627578957442.html
29-07-2021||World||Clays likely source of Mars 'lakes', setback to liquid water hypothesis||The evidence of ‘subsurface lakes’ deep below the ice cap at Mars’ south pole could be due to clay, a trio of new studies have unravelled the mystery. For a long time, scientists have been probing about possible evidence of life on Mars and any evidence suggesting the presence of liquid water on the cold and dry planet tantalizes them.Citing evidence collected from a radar instrument aboard the European Space Agency Mars Express orbiter, a team of scientists from Italy had suggested the possibility of subsurface lakes below the ice caps at Mars’ south pole. According to Nasa, radar signals change when they are reflected off different materials.In this case, the radar signals from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding, or MARSIS, produced bright signals beneath the polar cap, which, the scientists said, could be interpreted as liquid water.Shortly after researchers from Italy’s Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica published the paper on the lake, about 80 Martian polar scientists met for an international conference in Ushuaia, a seaside village at the southern tip of Argentina. Lots of talks centred around the subsurface lakes as they discussed the possibility of brine lowering the freezing point of the water enough to keep it liquid, said Nasa.Jeffrey Plaut of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Aditya Khuller, a doctoral student who was interning at JPL analyzed 44,000 radar echoes across 15 years of MARSIS data and turned up dozens more bright reflections similar to the 2018 study. They found many of those bright signals in areas close to the surface, where it should be too cold for water to remain liquid.Another theoretical study conducted in a cold laboratory indicated that a group of clays called smectites, scattered in the vicinity of the south pole’s ice cap, could be the reason behind the bright signals.While the possibility of a potentially habitable environment for microbes excited the scientists, a closer look at the data along with laboratory experiments on Earth may have dried up the lakes hypothesis. Some scientists now think clays might be creating those bright signals.“In planetary science, we often are just inching our way closer to the truth,” Plaut, one of the scientists who travelled to the conference, said.“The original paper didn’t prove it was water, and these new papers don’t prove it isn’t. But we try to narrow down the possibilities as much as possible in order to reach consensus,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clays-likely-source-of-mars-lakes-setback-to-liquid-water-hypothesis-101627576574113.html
29-07-2021||World||Israel becomes first nation to give third Covid vaccine shot to people over 60||Israel’s health ministry on Thursday said it will offer a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine to people over the age of 60 years starting Sunday, news agency Haaretz reported. The ministry said the third dose will be given to those who have been vaccinated with both doses at least five months ago.Following this announcement, Israel became the first nation to announce that it will give booster doses to prevent Covid-19 infections among vaccinated people. The move is also seen as an effort by the Israeli government to slow the spread of the Delta variant, news agency Reuters said, quoting Channel 13 TV and Kan public radio.The health ministry earlier reported a drop in the vaccine's effectiveness against infection along with a slight decrease in the protection the vaccine was providing against Covid-19. Experts told the Israeli health ministry that the Covid-19 vaccine’s effectiveness in severe symptoms among those aged above 60 years dropped from 97% in January to 81%. The ministry last week estimated that the vaccine was 41% effective when it came to preventing symptomatic infections over the past month though protection against severe diseases remained strong at 91%.An expert speaking to Haaretz also said that over 4,000 Israelis with suppressed immune systems have already been administered with a third shot and have not reported any side effects.

29-07-2021||World||AstraZeneca exploring options for Covid-19 vaccine business||AstraZeneca is exploring options for the future of its Covid-19 vaccine and expects greater clarity on the matter by the end of 2021, a senior executive told Reuters on Thursday.The review of the future of the vaccine comes after a series of setbacks in its race to produce a shot for the world. Executives emphasised it was too early to say what the decision on the vaccine's future would be.AstraZeneca agreed to work with the University of Oxford on its Covid-19 shot last year despite having no prior vaccine experience, taking on the project with a pledge not to make a profit during the coronavirus pandemic.While a $39 billion dollar deal to buy rare drug firm Alexion is much more integral to the company's business strategy, the Covid-19 vaccine has quickly become the public face of the company's efforts during the coronavirus pandemic."A small group of people reporting into Mene (Pangalos, research chief) and myself are thinking about: is this a sustainable business?" AstraZeneca Executive Vice President and President of the BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit Ruud Dobber said, referring to the vaccines business."We need to have that discussion with our senior executive team, and then with the board of AstraZeneca. We are exploring different options, but it is far too early at this stage to conclude that (process)."Dobber added that "before year-end, we will have more clarity"."Hopefully before the year ends, we will have a better view how to move forward in the next few years," he said."If you ask me, is the vaccine business a sustainable business for AstraZeneca for the next five or 10 years, that big strategic question is under discussion."FAR TOO EARLYAstraZeneca has been criticised by the European Union for its supply of shots, and is being sued by the bloc. The vaccine has also faced age restrictions due to rare clots linked to the vaccine and its application for U.S. approval is longer than expected.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said he had no regrets over getting involved in COVID-19 vaccines as the company has made an "enormous difference".It has delivered one billion doses around the world globally and is celebrated by the British government as a national success story of the pandemic.Dobber said that AstraZeneca's "number one commitment" was to deliver hundreds of millions of vaccine doses that were covered by current contracts."It's not a distraction," he said.He added that the company would keep its pledge to deliver a broadly available and accessible vaccine. Soriot has said that the vaccine will always be kept affordable for low-income countries, even when the company moves away from a no-profit model.Results released on Thursday showed sales of the vaccine in the second quarter more than tripled to $894 million from the first three months of the year.But, unlike for rivals including Pfizer, it remains a drag on earnings overall, and Dobber said that if the vaccine business were to be sustainable, the company would have to stop making a loss on it."It doesn't mean that moving forward we will not make a bit of profit," Dobber said. "It's not sustainable to do it without profits, but it's too early now to speculate about that."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-exploring-options-for-covid-19-vaccine-business-101627565958659.html

It features a marzipan base and a sugar onlay coat-of-arms, colored in gold, red, blue, and silver, on top.The piece of cake was given to Moyra Smith, a member of the Queen Mother’s household at Clarence House. Smith kept it in a floral cake tin and with a handmade label on the lid reading: “Handle with Care - Prince Charles & Princess Diane’s (sic) Wedding Cake” which she signed and dated 29/7/81.Smith’s family sold the cake to a collector in 2008, but it is up for auction again Aug. 11. It is expected to fetch between 300 pounds ($418) and 500 pounds ($697), together with an order of service, ceremonial details and a royal wedding breakfast program.“It appears to be in exactly the same good condition as when originally sold,'' Chris Albury, auctioneer and senior valuer at Dominic Winter Auctioneers, said. “But we advise against eating it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slice-of-lady-diana-s-wedding-cake-up-for-auction-101627570649485.html
29-07-2021||World||US lawmakers introduce bill to end guest worker program for foreign students on F-1 visa||A group of House Republicans has introduced a bill to eliminate a programme that allows foreign students on an F-1 visa to stay in the United States after their completion of studies under certain conditions. Congressmen Paul A Gosar, Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs and Matt Gaetz introduced the ‘Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act’ in the House of Representatives to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act.Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, Optional Practical Training (OPT) provides for temporary employment in the area of study of F-1 students. They can apply to receive up to 12 months of employment authorization before completing their academic studies and/or after completing their academic studies. If passed, the law would affect thousands of Indians studying in the United States on F-1 student visas.“What country creates a programme, but not a law, that rewards its businesses to fire citizen workers and replace them with foreign labour to pay the foreign labour less? The United States. The programme is called OPT and it reflects a complete abandonment of our own workers,” Gosar said.About 80,000 Indian students are employed in the US through OPT and Gosar alleges that the programme circumvents the H-1B cap to allow over 100,000 foreigners working in the US after graduation. He argued that the F-1 visa holders are exempt from payroll taxes, making them at least 10-15 per cent cheaper than a comparable American worker.“At a time when American college graduates are struggling to find a job and many are saddled with student loans, our government should not be incentivizing foreign employees over Americans. This badly flawed government programme should be eliminated,” he added.The bill has to pass through the House and the Senate before it can be sent to the president to sign it into law. Since Democrats control both the Chambers of the US Congress, it would not be easy for the Republicans to eliminate the programme.“Landing that first job out of college will only become more difficult for young Americans as our universities formalise the role they play in crowding out opportunities once reserved for American graduates. For this reason, the OPT must be eliminated,” stated Kevin Lynn, Founder of US Techworkers, a non-profit pushing Congress to “protect” American workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-end-guest-worker-program-for-foreign-students-on-f-1-visa-101627570477888.html

The country also made vaccination mandatory for all public-sector workers and asked officials to get vaccinated by August 31, according to a report by news agency Reuters. The announcement was made by the National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC), a military-run body which oversees Pakistan’s pandemic response.Asad Umar, head of the NCOC, said at a press briefing on Thursday unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to enter government offices, schools, restaurants and shopping malls from August onwards. The government also said that teachers and students above 18 as well as public transport and retail staff would also have to get vaccinated by the end of August.“If you're not vaccinated you can't go to teach at schools and colleges from August 1. We can't put our children's lives at risk just because you're not ready to get the vaccine,” Asad was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, dominated by the Delta variant, and finds its health infrastructure under extreme pressure. Pakistan’s Covid-19 test positivity rate stood at 7.53%, according to the NCOC.The NCOC said that Delta, Beta and Alpha variants of Covid-19 have been detected in Pakistan since May. The Pakistan government ramped up its vaccination drive. On Wednesday it administered 850,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, Reuters announced. Umar said Pakistan aims to administer one million doses every day.Pakistan vaccinated at least 27.8 million with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine while only 5.9 million out of a population of 220 million have been fully vaccinated, according to NCOC. The nation recorded 4,497 new cases and 76 deaths in the previous 24 hours, taking the toll to 23,209.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-says-covid-vaccination-must-for-air-travel-announces-new-restrictions-101627565331876.html

A prehistoric solar observatory in Peru, an ancient Harappa city in India, and a railway connecting the Caspian Sea with the Persian Gulf were among the sites added to the list during the extended 44th session of Unesco’s World Heritage Committee.The committee didn’t meet last year owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, so they are reviewing the nominations for both 2020 and 2021. Unesco has listed ten selection criteria of which sites must meet at least one of them to be included on the World Heritage List.The UN cultural agency says the sites must be of “outstanding universal value” and meet at least one of the ten criteria to be included in the World Heritage List. The criteria include representing a “master of human creative genius”, and bearing a “unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared” among others.Also Read | Unesco World Heritage tag: Here's list of all 40 Indian sites after Dholavira additionIn 2021, the committee inscribed 33 properties on the coveted list which includes 28 cultural and 5 natural sites.Here’s the list of the newest World Heritage Sites:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unesco-adds-these-33-cultural-natural-sites-to-world-heritage-list-this-year-101627564288102.html
29-07-2021||World||Researchers develop antibodies '1000 times' better at neutralising SARS-Cov-2||Researchers at Germany’s Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Biophysical Chemistry have developed antibodies which, they claim, are “highly potent and stable,” and can effectively block SARS CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The antibodies were developed from the blood of alpacas, a species of mammals found in South America.For the study, the team immunised three alpacas with parts of the coronavirus spike protein. The animals then produced antibodies, while scientists also extracted a small sample of blood from them. Next, the team used bacteriophages (viruses which infect bacteria) to select the best antibodies from an initially vast pool. These were then tested for efficacy against SARS CoV-2, and improved in successive rounds of optimisation.“For the first time, these antibodies combine extreme stability and outstanding efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma,” said Dirk Gorlich, director at MPI for Biophysical Chemistry. These mini-antibodies, also called nanobodies, are currently being prepared for clinical trials, researchers said.The study, published in the EMBO journal, also noted that these nanobodies are “1000 times better” than previously developed antibodies in neutralising the virus. That these nanobodies can be produced at low costs and in large quantities could be a solution to the global demand for Covid-19 therapeutics, it further said.The research also witnessed participation from scientists at from the University Medical Center Goettingen (UMG), which, like MPI, is a German institute. “Our nanobodies can withstand temperatures of up to 95 degrees Celsius without losing their functions or aggregates. They might remain active in the body long enough to be effective,” said Matthias Dobblestein, director at the UMG’s Institute of Molecular Oncology.Antibodies help the immune system in fighting against pathogens. These can be produced industrially and used to treat acutely ill patients. Antibodies act like drugs, relieving symptoms, and shorten recovery period from the disease.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-develop-antibodies-1000-times-better-at-neutralising-sarscov2-101627564287282.html

They are from Quetta, Balochistan," Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police said in a statement in Lahore.The police claimed that they have established a "common link" between the incident and the blast outside the house of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief and Mumbai terror attack mastermind Saeed in Lahore.Three persons were killed and 24 others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside Saeed's residence at the Board of Revenue Housing Society in Johar Town in Lahore on June 23.After the bus explosion in Dasu, China had rushed a special team amid confusing signals from Pakistan that it could be a gas blast. Islamabad later admitted it was a bomb blast stating that traces of explosive substance were found from the scene.The Dasu bus blast had accentuated Beijing’s concerns as thousands of Chinese personnel worked in installations and projects being built under the aegis of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-work-closely-with-pak-prosecute-those-responsible-for-tragic-bus-blast-101627561799790.html
29-07-2021||World||US considers economic aid to be critical in preventing cross-border migration||The Biden administration is releasing its long-awaited strategy on addressing the root causes of migration from Central America as it continues to struggle with record high numbers of apprehensions at the US southern border.The strategy, spearheaded by Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House national security team, calls on the US to help expand economic opportunities in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in part by urging private-sector companies to invest there. It also includes programs to make agricultural operations that form the backbone of those nations’ economies more resistant to natural disaster and climate, which have caused people to flee.The document also outlines efforts to fight corruption, promote democratic governance and protect human rights as well as plans to counter smuggling rings, domestic violence and gender-based crimes.The strategy, according to a White House fact sheet, “is driven by the US government’s belief that all individuals should be able to find safety and achieve a stable and dignified life within their own countries. When that is not the case, asylum and other legal migration pathways should be available to those who need them.”Harris, in a letter, said that the coronavirus pandemic “and extreme weather conditions have indeed exacerbated the root causes of migration — which include corruption, violence, trafficking, and poverty. While our administration is proud that we have sent millions of vaccine doses and hurricane relief, we know that it is not enough to alleviate suffering in the long term.”She added that the administration had enlisted allies in the effort: “We have already received commitments from the governments of Mexico, Japan, and Korea, and the United Nations, to join the United States in providing relief to the region.”More than 150 businesses have expressed interest in making investments and charitable contributions to the region. Twelve companies have already done so. The UN also plans to issue a humanitarian response plan in September, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the plan.Another official said the administration’s goal is not to end migration from Central America but rather to ensure people come using legal means. The administration is exploring ways to make it easier for Central Americans to seek asylum in the US while still in their home countries, making more work visas and refugee slots available to Central Americans and working with other nations like Costa Rica to accept more migrants from the region.Biden, Harris and other administration officials have told migrants “don’t come” to the US-Mexican border, saying that it involves making an unsafe journey.US authorities have reported more than 1.1 million apprehensions at the US-Mexico border this fiscal year, including 188,000 in June, a two-decade high that has fueled Republican criticism of Biden’s policies.Yet more than a third of those who were caught were repeat crossers who had been apprehended by officers at least once in the past 12 months, according to US Customs and Border Protection. That is being driven by Title 42, a public-health authority invoked last year by then-President Donald Trump that allows authorities to quickly expel single adults and families. Biden administration officials have not said when they would lift that order.Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly assailed the Biden administration’s response to the surge in migration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-considers-economic-aid-to-be-critical-in-preventing-cross-border-migration-101627559584279.html
29-07-2021||World||Floods make thousands homeless in Bangladesh Rohingya camps||Days of heavy rainfall have pelted Rohingya refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, destroying dwellings and sending thousands of people to live with extended family or in communal shelters.Just in the 24 hours to Wednesday alone, more than 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) of rain fell on the camps in Cox’s Bazar district hosting more than 800,000 Rohingya, the U.N. refugee agency said. That’s nearly half the average July rainfall in one day while more heavy downpours are expected in the next few days and the monsoon season stretches over the next three months.“The situation is further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is currently a strict national lockdown in response to rising cases across the country,” the agency said.The agency said it was saddened by the deaths of six people at the camps earlier this week, five in a landslide caused by the rains and a child swept away by floodwaters.Citing initial reports, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said more than 12,000 refugees were affected by the heavy rainfall while an estimated 2,500 shelters have been damaged or destroyed. More than 5,000 refugees have temporarily been relocated to other family member’s shelters or communal facilities, the agency said in a statement.Refugees said they were struggling to eat or drink properly.“Due to the continuous rainfall for the last four days, today my house is full of water,” says Khatija Begum, who has five children. “We are not even able to eat.” Begum says she fears her children will drown and die in their sleep.Cyclones, heavy monsoon rains, floods, landslides and other natural hazards are an annual difficulty in the camps. More than 700,000 Rohingya have lived in refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown on the Muslim ethnic group following an attack by insurgents.The crackdown included rapes, killings and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the United Nations. While Bangladesh and Myanmar have sought to arrange repatriations, the Rohingya are too fearful to return home.The International Organization for Migration says Cox’s Bazar district, where more than 1 million Rohingya refugees live, is one of the most disaster-prone parts of Bangladesh.It is a delta nation crisscrossed by many rivers that gets intense rainfall regularly due to its monsoon climate and location on the Bay of Bengal, where the warm waters can generate destructive tropical cyclones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-make-thousands-homeless-in-bangladesh-rohingya-camps-101627552188134.html
29-07-2021||World||China lashes out at Blinken’s meeting with Dalai Lama aide||Beijing on Thursday lashed out at the US secretary of state Antony Blinken for meeting Tibetan leader Dalai Lama’s representative in New Delhi, saying it violated Washington’s commitment to recognise Tibet as part of China.Blinken on Wednesday met with Ngodup Dongchung, a representative of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), also known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, who presented him with a scarf from the Dharmshala-based Dalai Lama.Blinken also met Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of Tibet House in Delhi, during an interaction with representatives from civil society groups.Blinken’s meeting with Ngodup Dongchung was seen as the most significant one since the Dalai Lama met then-president Barack Obama in Washington in 2016.A day later, the Chinese foreign ministry reacted sharply to the interaction, saying it was an interference in China’s affairs. Speaking on Thursday, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the Tibet affairs were purely China’s own affairs and should not be interfered with by any outside forces. “The 14th Dalai Lama is not a mere religious figure, but a political exile who has long engaged in anti-China separatist activities and is trying to separate Tibet from China,” Zhao said when asked to respond to Blinken’s meetings.China, Zhao said, firmly opposes any form of contact between officials of any country and the Dalai Lama.The US contacts with the “Dalai clique”, and any form they take, violate the US commitment to recognise Tibet as part of China, he said. “Any formal contact between the US and the Dalai clique is a violation of the US commitment to acknowledge Tibet being a part of China; do not support Tibetan independence, do not support attempts to separate China,” he said.“We urge the US to honour its commitment to stop meddling in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Tibetan affairs, and offer no support to Tibet independence forces to engage in anti-China separatist activities,” Zhao said.China, he said, will take all necessary measures to defend its rights and interests.Blinken’s meeting with representatives of the Dalai Lama comes weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished the Tibetan leader ahead of his 86th birthday on July 6 - a rare public messaging to him from an Indian leader given China’s sensitivities.China’s President Xi Jinping visited the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) earlier this month for the first time, beginning his visit from a village close to the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.In May, China said it would choose the successor to the Dalai Lama through “drawing lots from the golden urn” with the candidate subject to the approval of the Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled central government.Citing historical precedence, a government policy paper on Tibet said the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance passed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).“The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of ‘drawing lots from the golden urn’, and the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China,” the White Paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lashes-out-at-blinken-s-meeting-with-dalai-lama-aide-101627559877459.html
29-07-2021||World||Majority of South Africans don't want Covid shot, many believe prayer more effective||A majority of South Africans have said they are unlikely to get vaccinated against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and almost half of them believe prayer is more effective against the virus, according to a survey. While 21% of the 1,600 respondents said they believed prayer and vaccines were equally effective in preventing coronavirus transmission, only a quarter of them believed vaccines are more effective than prayer.South Africans living in high levels of poverty and those below the age of 35 are most hesitant to get inoculated. On the other hand, half of the respondents with no formal schooling were more inclined to get vaccinated than those with at least a primary education. People living in urban areas showed less willingness to get vaccinated than rural residents.Less than 10% of the South African population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and the survey, conducted by Afrobarometer, shows the hurdle in the government's drive to vaccinate two-thirds of its citizens. The survey suggests that South Africans consider themselves well-informed about Covid-19 but do not trust the government to ensure the vaccines are safe.Afrobarometer said that the survey, conducted in May and June, has a 2.5 percentage point margin of error.South Africa has reported over 2.4 million Covid-19 cases and more than 70,000 related deaths. While about 7 million people have been administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, less than 3 million people have been fully vaccinated.The Beta variant of coronavirus, first detected in South Africa, was behind the country’s disastrous second Covid wave.A study found that the Beta variant showed widespread antibody escape for those vaccinated with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The study prompted the South African government to sell the doses of Covishield, a version of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, to African Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-south-africans-don-t-want-covid-shot-many-believe-prayer-more-effective-101627552121741.html

He went around hospitals collecting body parts, starting with Tharwat's scalp, and buried his remains in a small coffin.Nearly a year later, Hoteit, a spokesperson for families of more than 200 people who died in the disaster, is still trying to call to account those he says are responsible for allowing the accident to happen.Earlier this month, during a protest outside the caretaker interior minister's house in the Lebanese capital, he said security forces used tear gas during scuffles with the crowd."We can't be deprived of truth and justice in the face of a crime of such magnitude," he told Reuters.As Beirut prepares to mark the first anniversary of a blast that flattened large swathes of the city, politicians and senior security officials have yet to be questioned in a formal investigation.In the latest twist, Tarek Bitar, the judge leading the probe, had a request to question Major General Abbas Ibrahim - head of the powerful General Security agency - turned down by caretaker interior minister Mohamed Fahmy.Ibrahim said he was subject to the law like all Lebanese, but the investigation should take place "far away from narrow political considerations".Fahmy's decision prompted some relatives of those killed to march near his house this month, carrying empty coffins covered in images of the victims. The demonstration turned violent.A senior interior ministry source said measures the security forces took were necessary to protect the private home of the minister.The relatives' frustration reflects widespread anger among Lebanese about the investigation and, more broadly, over how the country is being run.Lebanon's debt has spiralled, inflation is high, more than half the population lives in poverty and rival political factions have repeatedly failed to form a government.SetbacksMuch of the devastation from the blast is still visible. The port resembles a bomb site, and many buildings have been left in a state of collapse.Major questions remain unanswered, including why such a large shipment of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in bombs and fertiliser, was left stored in the middle of a crowded city for years after being unloaded in 2013.The immunity enjoyed by senior officials has raised suspicions among some families that there may never be accountability."How can you have justice if everyone from the smallest official to the biggest ... has immunity?" said Nizar Saghieh, head of the Legal Agenda, a research and advocacy organization.Fahmy's move to block the judge from questioning Ibrahim was based on the advice of a judicial committee at the interior ministry not to lift his immunity, according to a letter explaining the decision.The challenges Bitar faces are not unique.His predecessor, Fadi Sawan, was removed from the probe in February after a court granted the request of two of the former ministers he charged with negligence for the disaster - Ali Hassan Khalil and Ghazi Zeaiter - to have him removed.A copy of the decision seen by Reuters cited "legitimate suspicion" over Sawan's neutrality, partly because it alleged his house was damaged in the blast.Khalil and Zeaiter, along with a third former minister and the outgoing prime minister Hassan Diab, declared their innocence when Sawan charged them, refused to be questioned as suspects and accused Sawan of overstepping his powers.A document seen by Reuters that was sent just over two weeks before the blast showed the president and prime minister were warned about the security risk posed by the chemicals stored at the port and that they could destroy the capital.Bitar wants the government and parliament to allow him to question several top officials, including all those charged by Sawan, in addition to former Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk.With his request to question Ibrahim denied, the immediate fate of Bitar's investigation appears to rest on parliamentary immunity being lifted from Machnouk, Khalil and Zeaiter, all of whom are MPs.MPs met to discuss Bitar's request earlier this month, saying they needed more information to before deciding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-blast-investigation-stalls-again-families-still-outraged-101627553435357.html

Then he added that Pakistan is not the spokesperson of the Taliban. Khan made these comments while interacting with the representatives of Afghan media that were aired on Thursday, the Dawn reported. A day before, the Pakistan Premier said the Taliban are normal civilians and not some military outfits that his country can hunt down."What the Taliban are doing or aren't doing has nothing to do with us. We are not responsible, neither are we spokespersons for the Taliban," Imran Khan said adding Pakistan has no interest to fuel civil war in Afghanistan. In his opinion, no one party will be able to take over Afghanistan and so whoever comes to power in Afghanistan, Pakistan will have good relations with them. "What interest could Pakistan have in backing someone to take over Afghanistan? Now, and especially in my government, we believe that Afghanistan can never be controlled from the outside. We have no favourites now," Imran Khan said."Now You have two choices. Twenty years of the military solution has been attempted to bring peace to Afghanistan and that's failed," Khan said adding that Afghanistan can continue with the US military if it thinks that it doesn't want Taliban to be part of the government. "But everyone knows that is not possible anymore. The other choice is a political compromise between Taliban and the government and to form an exclusive government and that is the only solution," the Pak premier said.Pakistan had nothing to do with the failure of the Nato troops in Afghanistan. "It's exactly like what the Americans did in Vietnam. When they failed in Vietnam, they blamed insurgents from Cambodia or Laos."A day before, on the question of providing safe haven to the Taliban in Pakistan, Imran Khan in an interview with PBS NewsHour said, "There are camps of 500,000 people; there are camps of 100,000 people. And Taliban are not some military outfits, they are normal civilians. And if there are some civilians in these camps, how is Pakistan supposed to hunt these people down?

The researchers said ecological destruction, limited resources, and population growth, with climate change serving as a “risk multiplier” has left human civilisation in a “perilous state”.The study, carried out by Nick King and Professor Aled Jones of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), noted that increasing “globalisation, complexification, interdependency and the speed of fundamental societal support systems” creates significant global risks that could lead to large-scale failures.These factors could trigger a global societal collapse during a “long descent” or very rapidly in the space of less than a year without warning of the coming disruption, the study said.The researchers assessed the most favourable starting conditions to survive a global collapse by examining energy and manufacturing infrastructure, the ability to grow enough food for the population and isolation from large population centres to avoid unwanted mass migration.Also Read | Qatar Airways named world's best airline for 2021. Here's list of top 20 carriersThe researchers identified five nations that could act as a “collapse lifeboat”, with New Zealand having the greatest potential. The other four countries most suited to maintaining higher levels of societal, technological, and organisational complexity within their own borders are Iceland, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland.The strong oceanic climatic influence and low temperature and precipitation variability in these five countries make them a favourite landmass for relatively stable conditions despite the effects of climate change, the study said. New Zealand topped the list due to its low population, abundant agricultural land, and ability to produce geothermal and hydroelectric energy.“Significant changes are possible in the coming years and decades. The impact of climate change, including increased frequency and intensity of drought and flooding, extreme temperatures, and greater population movement, could dictate the severity of these changes,” said Jones, co-author of the study published in the journal Sustainability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-global-collapse-4-other-countries-favourite-101627550314161.html
29-07-2021||World||Beijing records first Covid-19 cases in months||Beijing recorded its first two Covid-19 cases in months on Wednesday with authorities sealing communities and launching nucleic acid testing for residents in a northern district as health authorities scramble to contain a spreading Delta variant outbreak linked to the eastern city of Nanjing.Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, has launched a third round of nucleic acid testing for all its 9.3 million residents in just nine days as new infections soared to 171 since last week.The citywide testing covers all residents, including those who are paying a short visit to the city, health authorities said on Thursday, adding that 18 new locally confirmed cases were reported on Wednesday.The outbreak linked to Nanjing has spread to at least five provinces and 13 cities including the cities of Beijing, Chengdu in southwest China and Dalian in the northeast of the country.China reported 49 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, down from 86 a day earlier, the national health commission (NHC) said.Local infections accounted for 24 of the cases that were detected on Wednesday, lower than 55 recorded for Tuesday, the NHC added. Nucleic acid tests for residents in Changping, a district in north Beijing, were launched on Thursday after a couple was found to be Covid-19 positive. More than 650 contacts of the couple have been traced so far.State media reports said the seven infected persons in Beijing, Dalian, and Chengdu, had recently attended a show in the tourist town of Zhangjiajie in central China’s Hunan province on July 22 where an unknown number among the 2,000-odd attendees had flown in from Nanjing.Nanjing, the second largest city in eastern China after Shanghai, has seen cases of locally transmitted Covid-19 soar since around nine airport workers tested positive for coronavirus on July 20.The workers at the Nanjing Lukou International Airport tested positive for the virus during a routine inspection.The official Xinhua news agency reported that tracing of the Nanjing outbreak suggested the source was inadequately protected staff who cleaned aircraft after international flights landed at the airport.Infections have since spread across the city and beyond including among university dormitory administrators, teachers, and taxi drivers, authorities said.The city now has classified four areas as high-risk for Covid-19 and 42 as medium-risk areas.Nanjing has been virtually sealed with inter-provincial transport links suspended.On Tuesday, the city’s centre for disease control and prevention said the virus strain behind the recent spike in Covid-19 cases has been identified as the highly infectious Delta variant.“Officials therefore have urged those queuing up for the test to wear masks, keep at least one metre apart and avoid chitchat,” Xinhua reported.Since the novel coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, China has taken a zero-tolerance approach to infections, quickly testing large populations, tracing the contacts of positive cases and locking down communities where needed to break the infection chain.The current outbreak will be a test of the efficacy of China’s vaccination programme under which more than 1.5 billion doses have been administered so far, fully vaccinating around 40% of the population.Total confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stood at 92,811 and the death toll at 4,636 until Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-records-first-covid-19-cases-in-months-101627549615088.html
29-07-2021||World||Hong Kong radio host faces first 'sedition' trial after China's takeover||A pro-democracy Hong Kong radio host went on trial Thursday for sedition in the first use of the colonial-era law since the city's handover to China as authorities broaden their criminalisation of dissent.Tam Tak-chi, 48, is among a growing number of activists charged with sedition, a little-used decades-old law that prosecutors have dusted off in the last twelve months.It is separate from the sweeping national security law that was imposed on Hong Kong last year, which has also been used to prosecute dissidents.Best known by his moniker "Fast Beat", online talk show host Tam faces eight sedition charges for slogans he either uttered or wrote between January and July last year.He also faces other charges including inciting an unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct.At the opening of his trial on Thursday, prosecutors read out those slogans, as well as some pro-democracy speeches Tam gave, often littered with colourful Cantonese curse words.The slogans included "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times", "Corrupt cops, all of your family go to hell", "Disband Hong Kong police, delay no more" and "Down with the Communist Party of China".The trial is a watershed legal moment for Hong Kong because it will set a precedent for what political phrases and views are now deemed illegal as China looks to stamp out dissent following huge and often violent democracy protests two years ago.- Forgotten relic -On Tuesday, a Hong Kong court convicted a former waiter of terrorism and inciting secession in the first trial conducted under the new national security law.During that trial, judges ruled that the popular protest slogan "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times" was secessionist and therefore a national security crime.Tam's trial was delayed so judges could wait for Tuesday's verdict, which was from a higher court.In Hong Kong, sedition is broadly defined as any words that generate "hatred, contempt or disaffection" towards the government or "encourage disaffection" among residents.It was first penned by colonial ruler Britain in 1938 and had long been criticised as an anti-free speech law.By the time of Hong Kong's 1997 handover, it had not been used for decades and was a largely forgotten relic on the statute books in a city that had become a regional bastion of free speech.But China is currently remoulding Hong Kong in its own authoritarian image and the newly created national security police unit has resurrected the sedition law.Last week, five members of a pro-democracy Hong Kong union that published children's books about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village were arrested for sedition.Three have since been charged and remanded into custody.Sedition carries up to two years in jail for a first offence.In contrast, the national security law is much harsher with up to life in prison for those who are convicted of serious offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-radio-host-faces-first-sedition-trial-after-china-s-takeover-101627546153820.html
29-07-2021||World||Israeli authorities conduct inspection of NSO Group’s office||Israeli authorities have conducted an inspection of the office of the cyber-security firm NSO group following allegations by an international consortium of journalists about the misuse of its Pegasus spyware around the world. The inspection was announced on Wednesday in a tweet in Hebrew by the Israeli defence ministry’s official Twitter account, which said: “Representatives from a number of bodies came to NSO today to examine the publications and allegations raised in its case.” The defence ministry didn’t identify the bodies that visited the NSO Group office or give more details. Israeli news website Calcalist, which first reported the inspection, described it as a “raid”. Reports said officials inspected the firm’s office at Herzliya near Tel Aviv. NSO Group confirmed the inspection in a statement sent to the media. “We can confirm that representatives from the Israeli Ministry of Defense visited our offices. We welcome their inspection,” it said. The firm, which has already denied the allegations of unauthorised surveillance of mobile phones using its spyware, said it is “working in full transparency with the Israeli authorities.” It added, “We are confident that this inspection will prove the facts are as declared repeatedly by the company against the false allegations made against us in the recent media attacks.” Also Read | Why I went to the SC on Pegasus: MP John BrittasThe international media consortium last week began publishing reports based on what is believed to be a leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers worldwide that were targeted by NSO’s customers for surveillance. Evidence of the Pegasus spyware was found on 37 phones that were examined by forensic experts, including in India. Journalists, businesspeople, critics of the government and politicians were among those allegedly targeted in India. NSO says its software is sold only to government customers after vetting by Israeli authorities. The Indian government has denied all wrongdoing and has also not confirmed or denied acquiring the Pegasus spyware. The report by Calcalist said the possibility of the inspection by authorities leading to “substantial sanctions on NSO is slim”. It added that the defence ministry and NSO have “complementary interests”, and authorities have in the past used their “power to protect the company from criticism and lawsuits”. Calcalist also reported that the inspection was coordinated with NSO and didn’t include an audit or examination of the firm’s computer systems or documents. NSO Group has faced increasing pressure from the world community, especially after the international consortium of journalists’ reports revealed that among the phones targeted for surveillance were those of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and French President Emmanuel Macron. The French leader has sought an investigation. Israeli defence minister Benny Gantz is set to meet his French counterpart Florence Parly to brief her on the findings of a government assessment of NSO’s exports. A statement from Gantz’s office said: ““He will also update the minister on the topic of NSO.” Gantz’s ministry, which oversees commercial exports of cyber-surveillance technologies, is part of a high-level task force assessing allegations about Pegasus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-authorities-conduct-inspection-of-nso-group-s-office-101627548114841.html

There should be no slack in prevention and control of the epidemic," Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the city's centre for disease control, told reporters.A high-end hotel in downtown Beijing has been locked down after media reported an imported case was found among the guests.Police and workers wearing PPE suits were seen outside the Legendale Hotel on Thursday.Most of the patients testing positive in the latest outbreak have already been vaccinated, raising concerns about the efficacy of vaccines against new variants.China is racing to vaccinate at least 65 percent of its 1.4-billion population by the end of the year.The country had administered 1.6 billion doses of the vaccine as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission said, without offering details on the number of people fully inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-drives-virus-spread-to-three-china-provinces-101627547395896.html

The new rules will come into effect from Monday.Currently, only people who received their Covid-19 vaccine in the UK can avoid quarantine when arriving from these "amber list" countries under the government’s traffic list travel system.However, India continues to remain on the red list which means even if fully vaccinated, the travellers from here will have to undergo compulsory 10-day quarantine upon reaching England. The next review of that status is expected by the middle of next week.Announcing the new rules UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, “We’ve taken great strides on our journey to reopen international travel and today is another important step forward. Whether you are a family reuniting for the first time since the start of the pandemic or a business benefiting from increased trade - this is progress we can all enjoy.”He said that further relaxations will depend on the latest scientific data. Since the UK is ravaged by the delta variant of the coronavirus, first identified in India, the change in status is expected to be difficult. France too is out of the amber list due to a surge in Beta variant cases in the country.India had last week urged the UK government to remove it from the red list. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, who went to the UK on a two-day visit, met UK foreign officials and told them that the pandemic situation in India is improving.Shringla said that Mumbai, Delhi are "practically free of Covid".Meanwhile, UK’s top epidemiologist Neil Ferguson has said that the end of the pandemic in Britain could be just months away. Speaking to BBC, Ferguson said he is positive that by late September, October time "we will be looking back at most of the pandemic".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lifts-quarantine-for-us-eu-travellers-india-still-on-red-list-101627534110057.html
29-07-2021||World||Animal life may have existed 890 million years ago: Canadian scientist||A Canadian scientist has claimed to have found evidence of the oldest form of animal life, in the form of sponges, on Earth, dating back 890 million years ago or about 350 million years older than what is currently the case.These findings were published by Elizabeth Turner, sedimentary geologist and professor with the Harquail School of Earth Sciences at the Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. Her peer-reviewed paper was published by the journal Nature.In the paper, she stated, “If the Little Dal objects are truly sponge body fossils, they are older than the next-youngest undisputed sponge body fossils (Cambrian) by approximately 350 million years.”Little Dal refers to the area with the reefs containing the sponge fossils which were discovered in the northwest territories of Canada.Cambrian refers to the period approximately 541 million years ago which is associated with an “explosion” of the first animals on the planet, as per fossil records. According to an article in Nature accompanying the study, these included arthropods, molluscs and worms.In response to emailed queries from the Hindustan Times, Turner said, “If I am correct in my interpretation of the material, it establishes that animals were already present by 890 million years ago.” That would make these “350 million years older than the next-youngest undisputed sponge fossil”. Though this may seem a big difference, she said it was “actually not all that surprising. We already knew that animals must have had a lengthy evolutionary history prior to the appearance of mineralised animal body fossils (such as shells and exoskeletons) in rocks younger than 540 million years. Molecular clock estimates place the origin of sponges in the same time-frame as the age of the rocks I worked on, and so it is not surprising to find possible physical evidence of sponges at that time”.She explained that sponges are the most basic animal in the animal tree of life, so it would not be surprising that the earliest animals may have been sponge-like.Turner collected the samples as a student from the ancient reefs and has argued they display complex structures unlike cyanobacteria and algae. She said, “I initially discovered the material accidentally several decades ago while working on my unrelated PhD research.” The idea “gestated” in her mind, but what finally allowed her to publish was that there “have been a number of recent papers on how sponges get preserved, and that’s the information I needed to support the interpretation of my own strikingly similar but much older material”.According to an accompanying article in Nature, Turner examined her samples, slices of rock, under a microscope and saw “branching networks of crystalline tubes” which she “later realised” were structures resembling “the internal scaffolding of modern horny sponges, and line up with the expected decay and fossilisation patterns of spongin, a collagen protein that forms their scaffolding.” The argument forwarded is that these crystalline tubes seen in the rocks could have formed when the collagen-like skeleton of the 890-million-year-old sponges decayed and fossilised.Despite the adverse low-oxygen environment, the sponges could have survived on oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria and being nourished by the “organic ooze” these microorganisms generated.As the Nature study appeared, Laurentian University tweeted, “We should note Dr Turner’s discovery would be the oldest form of animal life discovered on Earth.”The Nature article also cited scientists questioning the findings and seeking further evidence before arriving at the conclusion these animals, the sponges, existed nearly nine million centuries back.Asked about her confidence in the discovery, she replied the evidence is “very distinctive to sponges, and does not compare favourably to other possible interpretations such as microbial, algal, or fungal”. While she is “reasonably comfortable publishing” the findings, she added her “main intent” was to “present a new type of evidence and a logical interpretation of it, and then open it up to the scientific community for discussions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/animal-life-may-have-existed-890-million-years-ago-canadian-scientist-101627534193270.html

The development comes amid a surge in new Covid-19 infections in the United States as the more infectious delta variant spreads like wildfire across the nation.“I think when someone says here’s $100 for you, that’s going to make a big impact,” the New York Times quoted de Blasio as saying. “The key is vaccination. We can talk about so many other issues with Covid-19, but if we're not talking about vaccination then we're not talking about the solution.”New York, as of Wednesday, had vaccinated nearly 71% of all the adults in the city, the report said, adding that around 59% of the city's total population have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. More than 65% of adults and 54% of New York City's total population have been fully vaccinated, the report added.The delta variant of the coronavirus is, however, making things complicated. Certain parts of New York look like they're once again on their way to becoming a Covid-19 hot spot, and CDC guidelines suggest that authorities enforce mandatory masking for both vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens.The new guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which arrived on Tuesday, recommend both vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans wear masks in those areas which have registered more than 50 new cases per 100,000 residents over the week prior, or where more than 8% of Covid-19 tests came back positive over the same period.All five of New York's boroughs tick the check-boxes under these criteria, according to the publication. While Brooklyn and Manhattan have recorded 78.1 and 70.4 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively, Staten Island clocked a staggering 109 positive cases per 100,000 residents last week.New York mayor de Blasio calls this "complicated information".“So our health team is reviewing, and we’ll have more to say on it in the next few days,” he was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-offers-100-to-whoever-gets-vaccinated-against-covid-19-at-city-run-sites-101627527305873.html
29-07-2021||World||Qin Gang, new Chinese envoy to US, vows to bring frayed ties 'back on track'||A close confidante of Chinese President Xi Jingping has reached Washington as his country’s new ambassador to the United States.Considered one of China's most prominent "Wolf Warrior" diplomats, Qin Gang, is taking up the new role at a time when ties between the two nations are at a low and he is likely to deliver a combative message.With two stints as an aggressive foreign ministry spokesperson, the new envoy has vowed to bring US-China ties "back on track"."As two big countries different in history, culture, social system and development stage, China and the United States are entering a new round of mutual exploration, understanding and adaptation, trying to find a way to get along with each other," Gang told reporters on his arrival in the American capital.The relationship has rapidly deteriorated in recent years, with the two powers clashing on a wide range of issues, including trade, human rights, cybersecurity and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.While President Joe Biden has lowered the tone since taking office, he has largely maintained his predecessor Donald Trump's stance on China and described it as the pre-eminent challenge to the United States.Gang, who accompanied Xi on numerous overseas trips as the foreign ministry's protocol chief, is among the diplomats who have vigorously defended China in the face of increasing criticism on the world stage. In February, he defended the style of diplomacy as a necessary response to "groundless slander" and "crazy attacks against China".The 55-year-old is considered more hawkish than his predecessor in Washington, Cui Tiankai. Fluent in English, the new envoy has spent years at the Chinese embassy in London.Beijing-based independent analyst Hua Po described Qin as "one of the backbone members" of the Wolf Warrior movement, with diplomats adopting an indignant tone to defend the Communist-led country and even promote conspiracy theories or openly insult foreign counterparts.However, Xi has urged top political leaders to help cultivate a "reliable, admirable and respectable" international image to improve China's soft power.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qin-gang-new-chinese-envoy-to-us-vows-to-bring-frayed-ties-back-on-track-101627529867592.html
29-07-2021||World||First sign of animal life on Earth may be a sponge fossil||A Canadian geologist may have found the earliest fossil record of animal life on Earth, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Nature.Around a billion years ago, a region of northwest Canada now defined by steep mountains was a prehistoric marine environment where the remains of ancient sponges may be preserved in mineral sediment, the paper says.Geologist Elizabeth Turner discovered the rocks in a remote region of the Northwest Territories accessible only by helicopter, where she has been excavating since the 1980s. Thin sections of rock contain three-dimensional structures that resemble modern sponge skeletons.“I believe these are ancient sponges — only this type of organism has this type of network of organic filaments,” said Joachim Reitner, a geobiologist and expert in sponges at Germany's University of Gottingen, who was not involved in the research.The dating of adjacent rock layers indicates the samples are about 890 million years old, which would make them about 350 million years older than the oldest undisputed sponge fossils previously found.“What’s most stunning is the timing,” said Paco Cardenas, an expert on sponges at Sweden's Uppsala University, who was not involved in the research. “To have discovered sponge fossils from close to 900 million years ago will greatly improve our understanding of early animal evolution.”Many scientists believe the first animal groups included soft sponges or sponge-like creatures that lack muscles and nerves but have other features of simple animals, including cells with differentiated functions and sperm.To be sure, there’s very little scientific consensus or certainty about anything dating back a billion years ago, so other researchers will likely continue to vet and debate Turner's findings.“I think she’s got a pretty strong case. I think this is very worthy of publishing — it puts the evidence out there for other people to consider,” said David Bottjer, a paleobiologist at University of Southern California, who was not involved in the research.Scientists believe life on Earth emerged around 3.7 billion years ago. The earliest animals appeared much later, but exactly when is still debated.Until now, the oldest undisputed fossil sponges date to around 540 million years ago, an era called the Cambrian period.But scientists using a line of reasoning called the molecular clock — where they analyze the rate of genetic mutations to backdate when two species likely diverged — say that available evidence points to sponges emerging much earlier, around a billion years ago.Yet no supporting physical evidence has yet been found until now.“This would be the first time that a sponge fossil has been found from before the Cambrian, and not only before, but way before — that’s what’s most exciting,” said Uppsala University’s Cardenas, adding that the research seems to confirm the molecular clock estimates.Fossil evidence is scant before the Cambrian period when animals first developed hard skeletons, exoskeletons and shells, which are more likely to be preserved.“Those kinds of fossils belong to more complicated animals — obviously there has to be a back history” of simpler animals like sponges emerging first, said the paper's author Turner, who is based at Laurentian University in Ontario.The dating of 890 million years ago is significant because, if the sponge's identification is confirmed, it shows that the first animals evolved before a time when oxygen in the atmosphere and ocean reached a level scientists once thought was necessary for animal life. Yet recent research shows that some sponges can survive with very little oxygen.“Everything on Earth has an ancestor. It’s always been predicted that the first evidence of animal life would be small and cryptic, a very subtle clue,” said Roger Summons, an MIT geobiologist who was not involved in the research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-sign-of-animal-life-on-earth-may-be-a-sponge-fossil-101627525649268.html

29-07-2021||World||China calls upon Taliban to steer Afghan peace bid||China on Wednesday told a visiting Taliban delegation that it hopes the insurgent group will play a critical role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan in the backdrop of US forces leaving the country.State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi also urged the Taliban to crack down on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group it alleges is fuelling unrest and separatism in China’s Xinjiang province while operating from Afghanistan.Wang met Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s political chief, in Tianjin, a city some 100km from Beijing.Baradar said the Taliban are willing to establish an inclusive political structure in Afghanistan that will protect human rights as well as the interests of women and children.Baradar, who heads the Taliban’s political office in Qatar and is the lead negotiator for talks with the US, is leading a nine-member Taliban delegation on a two-day visit to China.Calling the Afghan Taliban a “critical military and political force in the country”, Wang said the group is “expected to play an important role in the peace, reconciliation and reconstruction process of Afghanistan”.“The sudden withdrawal of forces by the US and Nato from Afghanistan marks the failure of the US’s Afghanistan policy, and Afghan people now face an important opportunity to stabilise and develop their own country,” Wang was quoted as telling Baradar in a readout issued by the Chinese foreign ministry.On the issue of ETIM, Wang said he hoped the Taliban would crack down as it was a “direct threat to China’s national security”. Baradar, as per the Chinese readout, said, “China has always been a trustworthy friend of the Afghan people.”Meanwhile, Pakistan PM Imran Khan said the US “really messed it up” in Afghanistan as he questioned the US motive for the 2001 invasion and its attempts at seeking a political solution with the Taliban from a position of weakness. He said the only good solution is through a political settlement that is “inclusive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-upon-taliban-to-steer-afghan-peace-bid-101627504500869.html
29-07-2021||India||Kerala reports over 22,000 Covid-19 cases for third consecutive day||On the third consecutive day Kerala reported over 22,000 Covid-19 virus cases on Thursday showing no sign of any downward trend, state health ministry statistics show. The state reported 22,064 cases after testing 1,63,098 samples with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 13.55 per cent.Its active caseload also rose to 1,54,820. The country logged 43,509 new cases on Thursday of which the state’s share was more than half of the total cases. The national weekly TPR average is 2.38 whereas for the state it stood at more than 11 percent.Kerala also reported 128 Covid-19 deaths taking the total number of fatalities to 16,585, according to the health ministry data.A close look at the recent statistics shows an upward trend in Covid-19 cases in the state. Kerala reported 22,056 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday with a TPR of 11.2 percent while on Tuesday it accounted for 22,129 cases. Three districts - Malappuram, Thrissur and Kozhikode - topped the most-affected districts in the country reporting around 3,000 daily cases. The Union government has decided to rush another team of experts in a couple of days to co-ordinate containment and mitigation measures. This will be the second team to visit the state in July.State health minister Veena George said there is no need for panic and the government is doing everything possible to contain the surge. She said since a large chunk of people is uninfected, the number will remain high before stabilizing. The fourth round of the serosurvey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research shows antibody prevalence to be 67.7 per cent nationally while it is 42.7 % in the state. This shows a huge chunk of the population in the state is still susceptible to the virus.Experts have asked the government to move from containment to mitigation and redraw its strategies. “Targeted testing resulted in high TPR. It has a better case detection rate. But this alone won’t do,” said public health expert Dr NM Arun, emphasising the need to redraw present strategies.As cases show no sign of abating, the blame game has also started among political parties. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the state’s “unmindful relaxation” during the Bakrid festivities led to the spike but the CPI(M) said the Union government’s “poor vaccine distribution policy” led to the sorry state. “50% of the Covid positive cases come from Kerala, thanks to Eid relaxations. But as expected, the narrative would always be built around Kumbh or Kanwar yatra. Hmmm... Kerala model”, tweeted BJP spokesman Sambit Patra. Another leader Amit Malviya also criticised the Pinarayi Vijayan government. “Eid relaxation is coming to roost. Silence of secularists is deafening,” said the national convenor of the party’s IT cell. He also mentioned the Muslim-majority Malappuram district, which recorded the highest number of cases, to buttress his point. The CPI(M) criticised the BJP for taking the issue on communal lines saying, the virus has no religion or caste. “Kerala has lowest seroprevalence rate. They are more vulnerable to infection. The present policy of vaccine distribution punishes the state that protected a larger portion of people from infection. Provide more vaccine to Kerala than free advices,” tweeted former state finance minister Thomas Isaac. Isaac said the country will have to pay a heavy price for “Modi’s vaccine folly” and the state was proud of its records.Many BJP leaders took a pot shot on awards the state received during the first wave. A BJP delegation from the state is also camping in the national capital to add fuel to the fire. Leaders alleged that at many places local CPI(M) leaders were controlling the vaccination drive and “behave as if the state government procured it for a price”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-over-22-000-covid-19-cases-for-third-consecutive-day-101627582739630.html
29-07-2021||India||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav says Mahua Moitra’s ‘Bihari gunda’ jibe is ‘saddening’||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday deprecated Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra for reportedly using the ‘Bihar Gunda’ jibe on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey by terming it as “saddening,” news agency ANI reported.Addressing the media, Bihar’s Leader of Opposition said, “It is saddening if someone has said such a thing. One must refrain from making such comments, I can only condemn if anybody makes such a remark.”Tejashwi added that Bihar is the “mother of democracy and the state has a glorious past” and its contributions to the building of the nation have remained “unparalleled.”However, when asked if RJD will break ties with TMC over Moitra’s comment, Tejashwi said that the statement didn’t arrive from TMC or the party chief Mamata Banerjee. “It is an individual’s comment,” he further told the media persons.The incident unravelled on Wednesday after Dubey and Moitra engaged in a war of words on Twitter, with the former alleging that the TMC MP called him “Bihari gunda” thrice in the meeting of the IT committee. In his tweet where he tagged Moitra, Dubey said that her jibe has exposed TMC’s hatred towards north Indians and the Hindi-speaking people of the country.However, Moitra replied by saying that she is a “bit amused” by the name-calling charges as the IT meeting didn’t happen because “no quorum members did not attend.” “How can I call someone a name who was not even present! Check attendance sheet,” she wrote in her reply on the microblogging site.The heated argument, however, erupted at Parliament itself, when the BJP leaders boycotted the IT committee meeting and denied signing the attendance register. Dubey gave a notice to move a privilege motion against the removal of Congress leader Shashi Tharoor as the head of the committee. The committee, of which both Moitra and Dubey are members, was scheduled to hold talks regarding Pegasus snooping row, but it was cancelled owing to BJP MPs not signing the attendance register.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-leader-tejashwi-yadav-says-mahua-moitra-s-bihari-gunda-jibe-is-saddening-101627581126802.html

A day after they were all tested for Covid. All of them tested negative and on Tuesday night they were released from 'house arrest'. On Thursday, the members were granted pre-arrest bail. Some members of the team, which has reached Tripura on Trinamool Congress assignment, will have to appear before the police on August 1.The members were reportedly confined to a hotel for questioning by police. Agartala police said that it was a routine interrogation and also a measure amid the ongoing pandemic. “The outsiders-- around 22 persons—were roaming around in various places. Since Covid restrictions are in place, we are enquiring to verify the reasons behind their arrival and stay in the city," Manik Das, Superintendent of Police, West Tripura, said.The team has been camping in Agartala since last week, but the sudden detention stirred a political battle as Trinamool Congress announced to send Derek O'Brien and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar to Tripura. West Bengal ministers Bratya Basu and Moloy Ghatak were already there in Agartala."All are welcome in Tripura. But we don’t interfere in police work. Police have done their job. This is a bordering state and August 15 is coming, so they have to see who all are coming (to the state)," CM Biplab Deb said.Ahead of elections in 2023, the team is now doing some ground work for Trinamool Congress.

The Kerala government on Thursday reimposed weekend restrictions and the Centre has sent a special team to look into the Covid-19 situation of the state.Several factors have come to the surface as the state, which had recorded the very first Covid-19 patient of India, is seeing a sharp uptick in the number of Covid-19 cases. The rise in the number of cases has also led to a political battle over the Pinarayi Vijayan government's management of the pandemic.Why are Kerala Covid cases increasing? Study says every 100 people spreading infection to 111'Superspreader'Reports said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written to the Kerala government specifying that the spike is a result of the superspreader events that took place in the state recently. Kerala health minister Veena George said she has no information about the letter. While several BJP leaders are putting the blame on the government's decision to ease restrictions during Eid-Al Adha.'Many cases from outside'Data reveals that many of the fresh cases being reported daily are from people who have come from outside. For example, 120 cases reported on Tuesday were from outside the state. As Kerala contributes to a large population working in the Gulf countries, the number of people returning to Kerala is also high. According to state data, 14 lakh people have returned to Kerala after the pandemic broke out.DeltaDelta, the variant which drove the second wave of the pandemic, is believed to be more transmissible. Kerala health minister Veena George attributed the spike to the Delta variant.Lowest seroprevalenceAccording to the ICMR's 4th serosurvey report, Kerala has the lowest seroprevalence in the country which means that the least number of people have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. CPM leaders said that this proves that Kerala managed Covid better and that's why not many people have been exposed to the infection.Increased number of testsKerala government has claimed that it has increased the number of testing so that every single positive case gets identified. "We are conducting maximum tests these days. Yesterday, we conducted over 1.96 lakh tests. Today we did more than 1.63 lakh tests," the state health minister state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/superspreader-event-returning-expatriates-delta-5-things-to-know-about-kerala-s-covid-spike-101627575804059.html

India formed a special company in 2018 to operate one of the terminals of Iran’s Chabahar port to improve connectivity to both Afghanistan and the Central Asian states. However, the operations of the port and efforts to acquire heavy equipment for the development of the facility have been impeded by American sanctions on Iran, even though the US has given a waiver for Chabahar. “India has proposed to include the port in the framework of the International North-South Transport Corridor and has welcomed the formation of the India-Uzbekistan-Iran-Afghanistan quadrilateral working group on the joint use of Chabahar port. The meeting is likely to take place in the later half of this year,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing. Since December 2018, when India began operations at Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chabahar port, the facility has handled 134 vessels, 14,258 TEUs of containers and more than 2.08 million tonnes of bulk and general cargo. The cargo included humanitarian supplies such as wheat sent by India to Afghanistan during the Covid-19 pandemic. External affairs minister S Jaishankar had highlighted the practical steps taken by India since 2016 to operationalise Chabahar port at a meeting on regional connectivity hosted in Tashkent by the Uzbekistan government on July 16. In his speech at the event, Jaishankar said Chabahar port provides secure, viable and unhindered access to the sea for Central Asian countries. “Its efficacy is now clearly proven,” he added. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quadrilateral-working-group-on-chabahar-port-to-meet-this-year-101627573377036.html

Addressing media persons after the meeting, Akhtar said, “In our little conversation, she never said that leadership is her priority. She believes that she wants a Parivartan. Earlier she fought for Bengal and now she wants to fight for a change in India.”Akhtar said that he believes there “should be a change” in the country, adding that it is a “matter of shame” that Delhi witnessed communal riots. “There are so many tensions in the country right now…There is the issue of polarization. Many give aggressive statements…There are incidents of violence,” the lyricist told the media.Referring to the meeting with Banerjee, Akhtar said that it was a “courteous meeting,” and that it is West Bengal’s history that it had “led the revolutionary movements.” He added that he also congratulated the Bengal chief minister for her victory in the recently concluded Assembly elections and that he is “grateful” to her for support in the Royalty bill amendment in order for music, composers, lyricists and songwriters benefitting from the royalty. “The artists and intellectuals of Bengal support Mamata ji,” Akhtar said.When asked if Banerjee’s popular “Khela hobe” slogan will resonate across India, the lyricist said that it is beyond discussion now. “It does not need proof,” he added.Banerjee has been meeting several important Opposition leaders since her visit to Delhi, including Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi, party leader Rahul Gandhi and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. On Wednesday, following her meeting with Sonia, Banerjee said that in 2021 Lok Sabha elections “poore desh me khela hobe” (game will be on all over the country).Also Read | 'Poore desh me khela hobe': Mamata on Opposition’s unity ahead of 2024 electionsThe chief minister said that during the 2024 general elections, the competition will be between “Prime Minister Narendra Modi versus [the] country.”She also urged all Opposition parties to come together in the fight against dethroning Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the central ruling dispensation. “It is essential for everyone to come together in order to defeat the BJP.

It was done as part of the state government’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign to make all tourist destinations in Kerala completely risk-free for visitors, the government said. It became the first holiday hub to immunise the entire population including tourism sector stakeholders under the initiative, a press release from the government said.“In the post-pandemic phase visitors will be looking for safe and hospitable places to spend time.The Government considers it as vitally important to administer COVID-19 vaccine to the entire stakeholders in all the destinations across the state,” state tourism minister PA Mohamed Riyas as said, news agency PTI quoted from the press release.As many as 5,395 people in the tourism segment alone were inoculated with the first dose during the campaign in Vythiri with the support of the health department, district administration and the industry bodies.Also read | 'Planned campaign,' says Kerala health minister as concerns rise over Covid-19 situation in stateThe initiative to declare all popular holiday destinations in Kerala as completely vaccinated zones was announced on June 10. “We are mulling to make famous tourist destinations in the state 100 per cent vaccinated zones by July 15 with the support of the health department,” Riyas had told the state assembly, according to a news report by PTI.

This was the first time the PTI came to power in the region, which has so far been mostly ruled by the PML-N or Pakistan People’s Party. There were, however, allegations of the Pakistan Army playing an impartial role in the elections.Asked about the elections during a weekly news briefing, Bagchi said, “Let me make very clear that the so-called elections in Indian territory under the illegal occupation of Pakistan are nothing but an attempt by Pakistan to camouflage its illegal occupation and the material changes undertaken by it in these territories.”India, he said, had lodged a strong protest with Pakistani authorities on “this cosmetic exercise, which has been protested and rejected by the local people”. Bagchi said the elections “can neither hide the illegal occupation by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom to people in these occupied territories”. He added, “Pakistan has no locus standi on these Indian territories. We call upon Pakistan to vacate all Indian areas under its illegal occupation.”Responding to another question on the reference to Kashmir in the Pakistan-China joint statement, Bagchi reiterated India’s categorical rejection of any such reference to Jammu and Kashmir. “The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the union territory of Ladakh have been and will remain an integral and inalienable part of India,” he said. Noting that the joint statement also contained a reference to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said India has consistently told both China and Pakistan that the “so-called CPEC is in India’s territory that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan”.India has not signed up for China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and has always opposed CPEC, a flagship project under BRI, because a crucial part of it passes through PoK.Bagchi said India opposes “any attempts by other countries to change the status quo in areas illegally occupied by Pakistan, as also to Pakistan bringing up any material change in Indian territories under its illegal occupation”. He added, “We call upon parties concerned to cease such actions.”The joint statement issued on July 24 after a meeting between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi in Chengdu had said the Chinese side believes the Kashmir issue is a “dispute left over from history between Pakistan and India”, and it should be resolved in line with the UN Charter, Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. China also opposed “any unilateral actions that complicate the situation” in Kashmir, and the joint statement said the two countries would “continue to firmly advance the development of CPEC”....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-elections-in-pok-opposes-reference-to-kashmir-in-china-pakistan-statement-101627570617723.html
29-07-2021||India||Lok Sabha passes bill to amend Airports Economic Regulatory Authority Act||The Lok Sabha on Thursday, through a voice vote, passed the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which was tabled in Parliament by the newly inducted Union Minister for Civil Aviation Jyotiradtiya Scindia for passing. The bill was earlier brought to Parliament in March this year and was referred for a review by the standing committee on transport, tourism, and culture.The bill seeks to amend the 2008 Act by modifying the definition of “major airport” as under the current law, tariffs for the aeronautical services of a group of airports together cannot be determined. The amendment will now insert a provision in the original Act for tariff determination of a “group of airports.”Presenting the bill, Scindia said that under this new clubbing, the Airport Authority of India (AAI) will give priority to airports in smaller cities while newer airports will also be inaugurated. He also listed various areas which have been the beneficiaries of the UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) regional connectivity scheme of the government.Apart from newer airports in Assam, Punjab, Karnataka, Scindia specifically spoke about Darbhanga Airport in Bihar which, he said, was “missing” from the map of civil aviation and had now witnessed 110 flight movements from there to various parts of India since last one and a half year.“We have identified five zones for this clubbing which include north, south, east, west, and northeast zone. Based on this clubbing... the Airport Authority of India will be giving priority to airports in smaller cities and newer airports will also be inaugurated…,” he said, adding that the government has the vision to make new airports and also lend a “cross-subsidy” towards the smaller airports.“While today we have 128 airports and 713 airplanes, we are aimed to lead... the aviation sector globally in coming future,” he said. Following Scindia’s speech, the bill was passed in Lok Sabha through a voice vote. Earlier in the day, Scindia told Parliament that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was resolved that air travel which was exclusively used by well-off people, “should also be accessible to the poorer sections… of Indian society.”“If there has been any democratisation of the travel in India, it has only happened under the government led by PM Modi, and all these things are motivated by only one thought which is the Atmanirbhar Bharat,” he had said.Scindia said that PM Modi was resolved to develop rural India like Gandhi who said, “the true citizen of India lives in a village.”Scindia also praised PM Modi for launching the UDAN scheme and said the government was committed to the promise that the PM had made wherein he had said that every poor citizen of the country who wears a “Hawai” slipper should fly in a “Hawai Jahaz”.Responding to a question by MP Sunil Baburao Mendhe, Scindia had said that there were many cities in India where no one had ever seen an aircraft and today over 100 flights are operating towards such cities.“The dream of connecting each Indian (to every part of India) is getting fulfilled under the leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Narendra Modi,” he said.He added that 780 air routes have been specified by the government under the UDAN scheme and 359 of these routes are already functional with the government inaugurating 59 new airports under the scheme.“As per the UDAN Scheme, only the unserved (with no air connectivity) and underserved (having up to 7 departures per week) airports are considered for providing connectivity,” Scindia said.About India’s cargo transport share, Scindia said that the government’s efforts since the last one and a half years have increased it from two percent to 19 percent. He had said the government has facilitated cargo transport by making storage facilities available at 39 airports and refrigeration and cold storage facilities in 15 airports.“These diverse steps have been taken so that our national carriers can also offer the cargo services…,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-passes-bill-to-amend-airports-economic-regulatory-authority-act-101627569359613.html
29-07-2021||India||Why are Kerala Covid cases increasing? Study says every 100 people spreading infection to 111||Kerala, the state with the highest load of active Covid-19 at present in the country, has the highest R-value, or reproductive factor, an analysis by the researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai has revealed. The R-value in Kerala is 1.11, which means that one infected person is spreading the infection to more than one person, every 100 infected persons are spreading the virus to 111 people.The overall R factor in the country in the last week of July has remained 0.95. How significant is the R factor? R factor is the number of people that can be infected by one Covid-infected person. This is a mathematical calculation. When the number is less than 1, for example, 0.95, it means that every 100 infected people pass on the infection to 95 other individuals. Scientists have explained that as long as the number is less than 1, new infections will be lesser than existing infections and there will be an overall decline in the number of cases.Explained: Does Kerala have lowest immunity against Covid-19?According to the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, while the national R-value is lower than 1, Kerala's R-value is higher than 1 and is the highest in the country. Pune and Delhi's R-values are close to 1, while most of the northeast states have an R-value exceeding 1, the institute said adding that the R factor which climbed down after the peak of the second wave of the pandemic is again rising.Week-wise R-factor in IndiaFrom March 9 to April 21: 1.37From April 24 to May 1: 1.18From April 29 to May 7: 1.1From May 9 to May 11: 0.98From May 14 to May 30: 0.82From May 15 to June 26: 0.78From June 20 to July 7: 0.88From July 3 to July 22: 0.95Overall, there has been an increase in the R factor in teh country, the figures reveal as between May 15 and June 26, the rate at which the virus spread was the lowest."India's overall active cases are fluctuating too much to get a reliable estimate, but data is pointing at a value close to 1. It may tip over either way in the coming few days," Sitabhra Sinha of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, who is leading the team, told news agency PTI.Going by Kerala's high R-value, which suggests that the infection is spreading rapidly in the state, experts are predicting that the Covid-19 situation in Kerala will continue like this for another few weeks.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-kerala-covid-cases-are-increasing-study-says-every-100-people-spreading-infection-to-111-101627568206138.html

29-07-2021||India||SC verdict on Kerala assembly violence: CM rules out minister’s resignation||There was a furore in Kerala assembly on Thursday after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan rejected the Opposition demand for the resignation of education minister V Sivankutty, an accused in the assembly violence case. The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the state government’s plea to withdraw the case and asked all six accused, including the minister, to face criminal proceedings for destroying House property during a ruckus in 2015. Many youth outfits hit the street seeking Sivankutty’s exit and a rally of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) outside the assembly turned violent. An adjournment motion was introduced in the House by Congress member P T Thomas who said it was immoral and unjust to allow the minister to continue. The minister was not present in the House. “What message you will be giving to students if you continue to allow him in the education ministry? It is a disgrace for a state like Kerala,” said Opposition leader V D Satheesan, asking the CM to drop Sivankutty. Also Watch | Kerala reports 50% of India’s Covid cases: BJP blames Eid, Centre rushes teamBut Vijayan said the court did not get into the merit of the case and it has not taken any specific name. He said all accused legislators were punished by the Speaker after the incident. “I feel what happened in the assembly should have ended there,” he said, amid protests from Opposition members who said he was casting aspersions on the judgment of the highest court. After the CM’s explanation, Speaker M B Rajesh denied permission to the motion and Opposition members stormed out of the House. In March 2015, Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislators tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget over his alleged role in the bar bribery case. The chaos that followed saw two legislators injured and damange to property worth ₹2.20 lakh. After coming to power in 2016, the government tried to withdraw the case, only for a local court to reject it. The Pinarayi Vijayan government then moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The government also invoked the privilege of legislators and public interest to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it saying privilege was not a licence for violence in the House. Later, the apex court also upheld the lower court’s verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-verdict-on-kerala-assembly-violence-cm-rules-out-minister-s-resignation-101627561196376.html

Defending his client, Ponda said Kundra should have been given a date and time to appear before the police. The court said that when his client was issued a notice, he refused. "I should have been given an opportunity to appear, even if I don't accept the notice. They can't whisk me away like this. Refusing to accept a summon is not a cognisable offence for which they can arrest me," Raj Kundra's lawyer said during the hearing, Live Law reported.The lawyer also referred to comedian Munawar Faruqui's case where the Supreme Court ordered an ad-interim bail to the comedian, who was arrested by Madhya Pradesh police for allegedly hurting religious sentiment in one of his shows. To this, Justice Gadkari said only the Supreme Court can do that.Also Read: Mumbai Police transfers Raj Kundra pornography case to property cellThe case will again be heard on Saturday, Justice AS Gadkari said.Terming the arrest illegal, Raj Kundra's lawyer said that Mumbai Police got a search warrant from the magistrate court on July 19 searched the office premises of Viaan Industries, which is located in Andheri West, Mumbai. After the search, the police issued summon under Section 41A of CrPC which Kundra refused to accept and sign. Before the search, Kundra was not issued any notice, his lawyer said.The court said that this does not make the arrest illegal as nowhere the law says that the police can't arrest him. To this, Ponda said police should have given notice while Raj Kundra extended full cooperation with the searching team. Kundra was not at the office when the search began. As it went n for 5-6 hours, he was called and he reached the spot, his lawyer said.Mumbai Police on July 19 arrested Raj Kundra on several charges of the Indian Penal Code and the Information and Technology Act. It has been alleged that Kundra's Viaan Industries was involved in a porn racket in Mumbai, though the streaming platform Hotshots, which is at the centre of this alleged crime, was owned by a UK firm. Police investigation revealed that the firm is owned by Raj Kundra's brother-in-law and they were making crores by making porn. Police have also found some international deals that Kundra was finalising, following which several bank accounts are now on police radar.On Wednesday, Mumbai's Esplanade court rejected Raj Kundra's bail plea as the public prosecutor contested that since he is an influential person, he can intimidate witnesses if he gets bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-whisk-someone-away-like-this-lawyer-says-raj-kundra-didn-t-escape-101627559578156.html

29-07-2021||India||India’s 14 tiger reserves set global standard in tiger conservation||Fourteen out of India’s 51 tiger reserves have received the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CATS) accreditation for meeting a set of standards for effective conservation of big cats, the Union environment ministry said on Thursday. An international group of experts and protected area managers have created the criteria.CATS is a globally accepted conservation tool that sets best practices and standards to manage tigers and assessments to benchmark progress. It is being implemented across 125 sites, including 94 in India, in seven tiger range countries.The accreditation has been granted to 14 reserves in India, one each in Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia, the ministry officials said. The 14 reserves are Manas, Kaziranga, and Orang (Assam); Sundarbans (West Bengal); Valmiki (Bihar); Dudhwa (Uttar Pradesh); Panna, Kanha, Satpuda and Pench (Madhya Pradesh); Anamalai and Mudumalai (Tamil Nadu); Parambikulam (Kerala) and Bandipur (Karnataka).Officials said they underwent external evaluation for the accreditation.Also Read | With 51 reserves in 18 states, India now home to 70% of world’s tiger populationThe Global Tiger Forum (GTF), an international NGO working on tiger conservation, and World Wildlife Fund India are the two implementing partners of the National Tiger Conservation Authority for CATS assessment in India. The aspects monitored for accreditation include the importance and status of a reserve, management, community participation, tourism, protection, habitat management, and tiger populations.“CATS accreditation is a global recognition of good tiger governance. This recognition means a lot in the context of adaptation to climate change, sustainability of ecosystem services, and safeguarding disruption of zoonotic cycles, through an umbrella species approach,” said Rajesh Gopal, secretary-general, Global Tiger Forum.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said all 51 tiger reserves should try to achieve the status. “Tiger conservation involves saving the entire ecosystem, not just the tiger. Tiger is a symbol. Topography or tiger landscape and tiger corridors also need to be protected. Tigers also use international corridors with neighbouring countries. We should renew dialogues with these countries. Finally, public participation is very important and forest departments should recognise local conservation practices,” he said. “We have to be cautious about the impact of ecotourism. Ecotourism will increase but with improved sensitivity for nature.”RP Gupta, secretary (environment), said it is interesting that the three most popular tiger reserves—Bandhavgarh, Corbett, and Ranthambore--are not on the list of reserves that have been granted accreditation. “The three most popular ones also have the highest tourist footfalls which may be a factor,” he said.“As tiger population increases in India we need protection of sink areas. These are surrounding tiger landscape where tigers often sustain themselves when they move out of the source area or the core tiger habitat. Tiger corridors need to be conserved on priority so that they don’t remain isolated. Tiger reserves need be disturbance-free, for example, a national highway is passing through the edge of Kaziranga national park. Kerala has been also asking for widening a highway along Bandipur reserve. Most importantly, we need a specialised team for conflict management to prevent and address conflict situations with local communities,” said Sanjay Gubbi, conservation biologist.On the occasion of International Tiger Day on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also tweeted that India has achieved the target of doubling the tiger population four years ahead of the schedule under the St Petersburg Declaration.In the 2010 declaration, 13 countries, including India, agreed to a Global Tiger Recovery Programme and pledged to strive to double the number of tigers by 2022 by “doing everything possible to effectively manage, preserve, protect, and enhance habitats.”“India is home to 51 tiger reserves spread across 18 states. The last tiger census of 2018 showed a rise in the tiger population. India achieved the target of doubling of tiger population 4 years ahead of schedule of the St. Petersburg Declaration on tiger Conservation,” Modi tweeted.In 2010, India had 1,706 tigers. They more than doubled to 2,967 by 2018, according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-14-tiger-reserves-set-global-standard-in-tiger-conservation-101627558556046.html

PM has brought a henchman on a "special mission" to destabilize Delhi," Jha was quoted as saying by AAP on its Twitter post.AAP MLA Bhupinder Singh Joon said, “If the Union government does not consider the post of director general of police as equivalent to commissioner of Delhi Police, it is a demotion for Asthana who already served as director general of BSF. If the post of police commissioner of Delhi is similar to that of a DGP, the appointment it is a clear violation of the SC order.”Rakesh Asthana, during his tenure as the special director of CBI, was embroiled in a spat with the then director of the central probe agency, Alok Verma, with both of them levelling allegations of corruption against each other. Both were moved out of the CBI in 2019.Ashthana also served as the police commissioner of Vadodara when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-assembly-passes-resolution-against-rakesh-asthana-s-appointment-as-top-cop-101627555953885.html

At least 300 kanwariyas were made to go back from Haridwar railway station where they had reached to fetch Ganga water as per the rituals.Deputy inspector general Nilesh Anand Bharne said, “Haridwar district police turned back 3,635 kanwariyas from Haridwar borders where they had reached by 1,174 two-wheelers, 3,473 small vehicles and 136 big vehicles till July 27.”“Apart from this, 316 kanwariyas who reached Haridwar by train were also returned to their destinations in shuttle buses from Haridwar railway station,” said Bharne.“We have arranged tankers with Ganga water for the pilgrims of other states at Haridwar border so that they need not enter the holy city for it. Despite that, if anyone is caught inside the city, then he would be put in quarantine for 14 days and those caught at the border would be made to go back in their own vehicle or the shuttle buses arranged by police,” said Bharne.On July 13, Uttarakhand government cancelled kanwar yatra, heeding warning from health experts who that millions of devotees thronging the banks of the Ganga in Haridwar could spark a devastating third wave of Covid infections and seed clusters of cases across north India.Meanwhile, the state police has also decided to start a month-long special drive to nab wanted criminals in the state, including those from other states hiding here. The drive will begin from August 1.Director general of police Ashok Kumar said, “There are total 545 wanted criminals in the state, as per the police records.

In election-bound states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, where the OBC communities wield considerable influence, the BJP is hoping to gain from the decision.The ministers and lawmakers had informed the PM that as per the provisions of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Examination (NEET), the state government colleges and private medical and dental colleges are required to give 15% of the total number of seats in diploma and undergraduate courses and 50% in postgraduate courses against the all India quota and these can be availed by students from across the country. However, OBCs could not benefit from this reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/landmark-decision-modi-on-obc-ews-reservation-in-all-india-quota-medical-seats-101627556456438.html

The new reservation provision will be implemented in this year's admission as well, the government said. All undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses, including dental, will have reservations for OBCs and economically weak sections from 2021-22 onwards. Nearly 1,500 OBC students in MBBS and 2,500 OBC students in postgraduation will be benefitted from this reservation every year, apart from 550 students from the economically weaker sections in MBBS and around 1,000 in the post-graduation, every year.This will immensely help thousands of our youth every year get better opportunities and create a new paradigm of social justice in our country."This will immensely help thousands of our youth every year get better opportunities and create a new paradigm of social justice in our country," PM Modi tweeted hailing the decision as a 'landmark' one."The present government is committed to providing due reservation both to the backward category as well as the EWS category. The Union government has now taken a historic decision to provide for 27% reservation for OBCs and 10% reservation for EWS in the AIQ Scheme. The OBC students from across the country shall now be able to take benefit of this reservation in AIQ Scheme to compete for seats in any State. Being a Central Scheme, the Central List of OBCs shall be used for this reservation.," the government said. What is AIQ scheme?All India Quota scheme was introduced in 1986 under a Supreme Court direction. The aim was to enable students of another state to get reservation benefits in other states as well. Until 2008, there was no reservation in the All India Quota scheme. In 2007, the Supreme Court introduced reservations of 15% for SCs and 7.5% for STs in the all-India scheme.What does this OBC quota in AQI means?Students belonging to OBC can now apply to any government medical or dental college to any other state under this quota. This was a long-pending issue as OBCs did not have any all-India quota for medical admission. State government medical colleges have 15% reservation in undergraduate seats and 50% in post-graduate seats for All India Quota. Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled (ST)s has reservation under the All India quota. So OBC students if migrated to another state could not reap avail of any reservation.Reservation for EWSIn 2019, a constitutional amendment was made to provide 10 per cent reservation for the economically weaker sections. Accordingly, the seats in medical and dental colleges were increased so that unreserved categories do not get affected. But this category was not included in the All India quota scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/27-quota-for-obcs-in-medical-admission-10-for-economically-weak-section-101627552900469.html

29-07-2021||India||India will never accept outcome in Afghanistan decided by force: Jaishankar||India is working with the world community to push political negotiations to find a lasting solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and will never accept any outcome decided through the use of force, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. There was a very detailed discussion on the situation in Afghanistan with visiting US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Wednesday and there is “a very strong convergence” in the positions of India and the US on this issue, Jaishankar said while answering a question in the Rajya Sabha or upper house of Parliament. “We were very clear that there must be a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan, that there cannot be a military solution, there cannot be a takeover by use of force in Afghanistan, that we will work with the international community to ensure that political negotiations for a settlement are pursued seriously and we would never accept any outcome which is decided by force,” he said. Also Read | China calls upon Taliban to steer Afghan peace bidHe was responding to a question from BJP lawmaker Swapan Dasgupta on China’s apparent efforts to prop up the Taliban. A Taliban delegation led by chief political negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar met Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Wednesday, the first high-level engagement between the two sides since the US began withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan. India has been increasingly concerned by a massive surge in violence in Afghanistan, including the Taliban’s campaign to capture districts in rural areas and crucial border crossings. It has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire and resumption of intra-Afghan talks to find a settlement. Responding to another question from Samajwadi Party lawmaker Rewati Raman Singh on whether human rights and democracy had figured in his talks with Blinken, Jaishankar said the two sides had a “good discussion” on global issues such as human rights, democracy, trafficking and big tech Jaishankar said he had highlighted that India’s approach to such issues is guided by a “quest for a perfect union”, though the government also seeks to “right historical wrongs”. This was an apparent reference to the enactment of laws such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and Jaishankar had made a similar comment at his joint media interaction with Blinken on Wednesday. Jaishankar said the issue of freedom should not be treated as “non-governance or as abdication of responsibilities”. He added, “We believe that our conversations on this subject should be balanced, we also feel that we should have the same standards when we look at the issues and that all conversations should be fact-based.” The minister also defended India’s participation in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, a grouping that includes Australia, Japan and the US, in the face of criticism from China while responding to more questions. “Let me make it very clear that when it comes to our relations with the US, Quad [and] Indo-Pacific, these are all our national choices which serve our national interests. We look at Quad as a platform where four countries have come together for the good of the world, who are discussing a range of issues from making and providing vaccines to education and connectivity to maritime security,” he said. Any narrative about the Quad not based on reality will never gain traction, and India’s work with international partners “will help deal with many regional and global challenges”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-never-accept-outcome-in-afghanistan-decided-by-force-jaishankar-101627550754668.html

He warned of strict action against “habitual offenders”.“Yesterday’s incident was very painful and against the norms of the House. Whatever happened yesterday was against the basic ethics of the House. If there are any complaints, then they should come to my chamber with the issues,” Birla said.At least nine Congress members tore placards with protest messages and threw them in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday and an unidentified lawmaker blew a whistle in the Rajya Sabha as the Opposition continued its protests against the snooping row and the three farm laws. Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party members on Thursday demanded an apology from Opposition for throwing papers towards the chair.Also Read | Scindia to introduce amendment to airports economic regulatory Bill in Lok Sabha todayCongress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury blamed the government and said that the Opposition was unable to raise issues in the House.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi interrupted Chowdhury and asked the Opposition to apologise. “They (opposition members) threw big bundles of papers towards us, the chair and the media… do they not want to even apologise to the chair?” He added the government is ready for the discussion. “...this is not the way the Opposition (should) behave.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi earlier also said the government was not allowing the Opposition to raise the issues of national importance. In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said: “The foundation of our democracy is that the parliamentarians should be the voice of the people and discuss the issues of national importance. Modi government is not allowing the opposition to do this work.” He asked the government not to waste Parliament’s time and let inflation, farmers, and Pegasus spyware issues to be discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saddened-over-ruckus-in-house-lok-sabha-speaker-warns-of-strict-action-101627546374379.html

The remarks of Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, have drawn severe criticism and the chief minister has been reminded of the government’s duty to ensure the state’s law and order.“When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police,” Sawant said on Wednesday, during a debate on a calling attention notice in the House. The chief minister said parents have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their wards and hinted that they should not let children, particularly minors, out at night.Soon after, the Goa Congress hit back saying the law and order in the coastal state has deteriorated over the years. “Why should we fear while moving around at night? Criminals should be in jail and law abiding citizens should be out freely moving around,” Congress leader Altone D'Costa said.Vijai Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party, a former ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), called the CM’s statements disgusting. “The safety of citizens is the responsibility of the state government and police. If they cannot provide the same to us, the CM has no right to sit in the post,” he said.Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte said Goa has had a history of being a safe state for women, but that status is being lost under the current dispensation. “It is shocking that @goacm is blaming parents for allowing their children to venture out in the night claiming that it is not safe. If the State govt can't assure us our security, who can give it? Goa has a history of being a safe state for women, that tag is being lost in @BJP4Goa rule,” Khaunte wrote on Twitter.“We directly blame police, but I want to point out that of the 10 youth who went to the beach for a party, four stayed on the beach the whole night and the remaining six went home,” Sawant had said in the House. “They were on the beach the whole night, two boys and two girls,” said Sawant. Teens, particularly minors, should not be spending the nights on beaches," he added.Four men, one of them a government employee (a driver with the agriculture department), posed as policemen and raped the two girls after beating up the boys who were with the girls on Benaulim beach, around 30 km south of Goa's capital, on Sunday. All the four accused have been arrested, Sawant told the Assembly. During the discussion in the House on Wednesday, an MLA claimed that an “influential person” was trying to protect the accused, while another opposition member alleged that a minister was calling the police and trying to influence the investigation. Speaker Rajesh Patnekar expunged the remarks from the proceedings.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-beach-gangrape-cm-pramod-sawant-asks-why-minors-out-so-late-at-night-draws-101627545680597.html

Additional district judge Uttam Anand was hit by “an unidentified vehicle” barely half a kilometre from his home in Dhanbad early on Wednesday, police said. A special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to look into the case. According to latest reports, an autorickshaw driver and his two associates have been arrested. The incident was brought to the attention of the Supreme Court by senior lawyer and former Additional Solicitor General Vikas Singh. Urging the court to take suo motu cognisance of the case, Singh, appearing for the Supreme Court Bar Association, said the killing was a "brazen attack on the judiciary" that needs a CBI investigation.He said local police are usually complicit in such matters. “A judge is on a morning walk and is hit by a vehicle. He was dealing with bail applications of gangsters. This is an attack on judicial independence,” Singh was quoted as saying by LiveLaw.Chief Justice NV Ramana said he has had a word with the chief justice of Jharkhand High Court. “The High Court Chief Justice has taken up the issue and the case is now on at the High Court. We are aware of the case and we will take care," Justice Ramana said.झारखंड, धनबाद में आज सुबह 5 बजे मॉर्निंग वॉक पर निकले ADG-8 न्यायधीश उत्तम आनंद को एक ऑटो ने पीछे से टक्कर मार दी, जिससे उनकी मौत हो गयी। CCTV फुटेज देख लग रहा है कि ऑटो ने जानबूझकर टक्कर मारी है। पुलिस हत्या के एंगल से जांच कर रही है।@JagranNews @JharkhandCMO @JharkhandPolice pic.twitter.com/IpXaYNPeRPThe accident took place a little over 5am on Wednesday. The judge was rushed to the city’s medical college by passers-by but doctors said he was dead by the time he was brought. No one knew who he was.It was only much later when the judge’s family, worried that he had not returned home by 7am, notified the police.The judge’s driver who accompanied the police team after it was informed of a road accident, identified his body at the hospital.The judge is reported to have recently rejected the bail plea of an alleged contract killer from Uttar Pradesh, who is in Dhanbad jail in a high-profile murder case. But officials said it was too early to link the order to this case.Police said the SIT would look at footage from other CCTV cameras on the roads used by the three-wheeler to identify the vehicle and see if there was a pattern.s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lens-on-jharkhand-judge-s-death-as-new-clip-emerges-sc-lawyer-seeks-cbi-probe-101627539516919.html

29-07-2021||India||Developed countries fail to meet pre-2020 climate commitments: report||Most developed countries, including members of the G7 forum, collectively reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by only 3.7% by 2019 over the 1990 levels, a Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) report released on Wednesday said. This is far short of their commitments made under the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. All developed countries together emitted 25 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2eq) more than their estimated emission allowances in the 2008-2020 period, the report said.“CEEW’s analysis of developed nations’ pre-2020 climate actions have significant implications for the fate of post-2020 negotiations. Many developed countries have consumed disproportionate shares of the global carbon budget because they did not meet their commitments in the pre-2020 period. Trust in their long-term commitments will be regained only if their near-term actions free up carbon space for others. Further, the cost of mitigation efforts is set to increase significantly in the coming decade. While all countries must consider raising ambition, the burden of unmet promises and disproportionate use of carbon space cannot fall on developing countries,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, in a statement.CEEW conducted a review of mitigation measures by all developed countries vis-a-vis their overall commitment under the Kyoto Protocol and the Doha Amendment. The report also presented a ranking of 43 developed countries based on their climate actions and mitigation efforts made in the pre-2020 period. Sweden, the UK, Belgium, and Denmark topped this ranking. But the US, Canada, Australia, and Russia featured in the bottom half.While nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement are essential for achieving the 1.5 degrees C global warming target, it is equally important to study the outcomes of the emission reduction pledges made by developed countries before the Paris Agreement, in the pre-2020 climate regime, the report said. It added that the fate of post-2020 negotiations for climate crisis crucially hinges upon the achievements, gaps, and issues recognised in the pre-2020 period.“The developing countries have concerns of bearing the burden of tackling the mitigation gaps from the pre-2020 period in the future. Furthermore, it has caused a further fissure between the developed and developing country groupings, contributing to mistrust on the next set of ambitions that were tabled in the negotiations,” the report said.Both Kyoto Protocol and the Doha amendment quantified emission reduction targets to developed countries, based on their 1990 emission levels. Under the Kyoto Protocol, an emission reduction target of 5% based on 1990 levels, was set to be achieved by developed countries in the first commitment period (2008–2012). Under the Doha Amendment, an emission reduction target of at least 18% would be met by developed countries in the second commitment period (2013–2020).Major economies like the US, Canada, Russia, and Japan did not participate in either one or both commitment periods. US non-participation in both commitment periods had several adverse effects on global climate action, including the withdrawal of other developed countries from critical agreements, the report said.The greenhouse gas emissions from all Annex I Parties (both industrialised and economies in transition [EIT] countries) declined by about 14.8% in 2019 compared to their base year emissions levels. This reduction when considering non-EIT Annex I Parties (majorly comprising industrialised countries) was only 3.7% by 2019 compared to their base year emissions levels.A fact sheet by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on “Status of the Country Commitments on the road to COP 26” highlighted that the NDC Synthesis Report 1 published in February 2021 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) found that the world in 2030, as per the current level of country commitments/NDCs, will have 0.7% lower total greenhouse gas emissions than when it started its negotiations for a climate change agreement in 1990. A look at the pledges and emissions of the top emitters reveals a large gap between ambition, and the transformative short-term actions needed to decarbonise their economies and limit global temperature rise. “The two largest emitters, the US and China, are not definitively on track to achieve their 2030 targets and continue the unrestrained production and use of fossil fuels,” CSE said. “India is mostly on track to achieve its 2030 goals and has a minimal contribution when considering the size of its population.”“The implementation phase of the Paris Agreement began in 2021. The world needs the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement to succeed. For this, there has to be trust and confidence in the multilateral process. Thus, it is important to recall and review what were the promises made in the pre-2020 period and whether those were delivered. A clear and unbiased assessment of the pre-2020 commitments and mitigation as well as finance is the need of the hour,” said Richa Sharma, additional secretary, Union environment ministry, at the launch of the CEEW report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/developed-countries-fail-to-meet-pre-2020-climate-commitments-report-101627538453493.html

29-07-2021||India||Jet Airways staff turn to aviation minister over employment issues||Mumbai: Jet Airways employees, on Wednesday, wrote to the new aviation minister- Jyotiraditya Scindia asking him to intervene and help resolve their issues. Their letter comes after Jet Airways is said to recommence its operations by the year end after Jalan Kalrock consortium emerged as a winning bidder for the defunct airline.There are around 3500 employees attached to the airline even after it shut operations who are seeking assurance of employment from the new management. In a letter to the minister, the All India Jet Airways’ Officers & Staff Association requested Scindia to take up their issues with the representatives of the consortium.The letter read, ‘We are shocked and surprised to notice that complete injustice has been done to the employees of the company in as much that the dues offered is about Rs. 52 crores which is a miniscule amount compared to the original claims accepted by the resolution professional.’The employees also complained that the company has indicated a desire to restart its operation by hiring ‘very few’ employees as per the plan submitted and also of hiring other employees on the rolls of an associate company (Air Jet) which is a ground handling arm of Jet Airways. “This decision to put employees on a ground handling company is completely strange and in violation of the ground handling policy of the government,” the employees said. The employees also complained that despite approaching the monitoring committee to take up the issue of payment of dues, no information has been provided to them.Requesting a meeting with the revived management in Scindia’s presence, the employees asked for assurance of employment to existing employees on the payroll and payment of all security dues. “We realise that the new management seeks to revive the airline shortly but has not provided any information to employees on the real situation on the ground,We therefore request you to kindly take up the matter on our behalf and request for a meeting in your kind presence along with the representative of the revived management team (Jalan & Kalrock) so that the issues of the employees are redressed,” concluded the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jet-airways-staff-turn-to-aviation-minister-over-employment-issues-101627536413267.html

29-07-2021||India||India-US bond over Quad, China, America sheds reticence over Dalai Lama||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to India revealed strong convergence between the oldest and largest democracies on Quad, China, and Indo-Pacific, shifting of American position closer to New Delhi’s viewpoint on Afghanistan over Taliban offensive and Washington’s has shed its reticence over the exiled 14th Dalai Lama.Blinken’s conversations with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Wednesday were largely centered on Taliban offensive in Afghanistan accompanied with brutality on innocent citizens and increasing Chinese belligerence in its pursuit to become the numero uno in the world.While Blinken’s official discussions with Indian leadership were extensive on conflict situations all over the globe, Secretary of State statement that Afghanistan yet again will be treated as pariah state if Taliban seize power by force instead of negotiated political settlement will force the Sunni fundamentalists and their handlers to rethink. Just as Jaishankar’s public dismissal of China’s fears over Quad as unreasonable will push Beijing to recalibrate its aggressive, which has now reached a point of being overbearing to the democratic world. Fact is that China has virtually encircled India by forging ties with Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nepal through economic leverage, but it accuses India of joining anti-China camp led by the US. It is now 14 months since the PLA transgressed into East Ladakh with the objective of unilaterally changing the status quo on ground forcing India to respond and deploy equal number of troops as the adversary along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).India is not the only one at the receiving end of Chinese aggression, but other Quad powers have also been singled out by Beijing activating land, sea or trade disputes. While China has firewalled its citizens from social media, its propaganda machine and information warfare has gone into an overdrive attacking the Quad partners and exploiting the fault-lines within the security grouping. Beijing’s all-weather client state Pakistanis again playing the double game by sending a Taliban delegation headed by Mullah Baradar to China and sending the DG (ISI) Lt General Faiz Hameed and Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf to Washington perhaps to assure the Biden administration that Taliban will deliver on its commitments and extract leverage for beleaguered PM Imran Khan on economy and FATF.While the US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman highlighted Chinese repression in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong during her visit to China last Sunday, the other Quad partners have also decided to pushback on Beijing’s unilateral diplomatic demands. Secretary Blinken on his own meeting Dalai Lama’s representative Ngodup Dongchung separately on Tuesday at a New Delhi hotel are indicators that US is not squeamish about the exiled Tibetan community and their Buddhist leadership.Bilaterally both India and US are on a strong wicket as could be seen from the bonhomie between the two foreign ministers with the Biden administration ready to part with high defence and other technologies to New Delhi as a major defence ally. The openness with which both Indian and US interlocutors exchange notes over matters of concern also show the build up of trust in the bilateral relationship.The joining of hands for vaccine production and building resilient global supply chains, which are not dependent only on one country, are part of India-US growing convergence. These initiatives will only be strengthened when Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes to Washington to attend the Quad summit in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaus-bond-over-quad-china-america-sheds-reticence-over-dalai-lama-101627533389790.html

Chief Justice of India, N V Ramana, played a special role in resolving the dispute between Andhra Pradesh-based estranged couple.The woman had sought enhancement of jail term for her husband in a dowry harassment case. When the case came up for hearing, Chief Justice Ramanna asked to speak to the couple through video conferencing.As the woman was not comfortable in speaking in English, the official language of the court, the CJI conversed in Telugu and also explained her statements to fellow judge."If your husband goes to jail you will lose the monthly compensation as he will lose his job," the CJI told the woman. The other judge in the bench was Justice Surya Kant.The man against whom the charges were pressed by the wife, is a state government employee in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. His lawyer said the CJI explained to the woman that if the jail sentence of her husband is enhanced, she will have to forego the monthly compensation, news agency PTI reported.The woman heard CJI’s advice patiently and agreed to live with her spouse provided she and their only son are maintained properly by her husband, the lawyer was quoted as saying by PTI.Both husband and wife agreed to withdraw their respective petitions against each other.The two got married in 1998, but the relationship soon turned sour following which the woman filed a criminal case in 2001. She had also named her mother-in-law and the sister-in-law. Several mediation bids were made by different courts, but they all failed.The husband received a jail term of one year, but the wife wanted an enhancement of the sentence and moved the petitions in sessions court, high court and finally, the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/couple-fighting-legal-battle-for-20-years-reunited-cji-plays-special-role-101627528739118.html

In September last year, the Rafale aircraft were inducted into the 17 "Golden Arrows" Squadron.Addressing the personnel at the air force station, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said the induction of the Rafale jets at Hasimara was carefully planned, keeping in mind the importance of strengthening the IAF's capability in the eastern sector.India and China have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year. In the northeast, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh share borders with China.The induction event included a fly-past heralding the arrival of the Rafale aircraft at Hasimara, followed by a traditional water-cannon salute, according to a statement issued by the IAF.India has so far received 26 of the 36 Rafale aircraft it has ordered from French firm Dassault Aviation, Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt informed the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.In his speech at Hasimara, the IAF chief recalled the glorious history of the 101 Squadron, which earned it the title of "Falcons of Chamb and Akhnoor"."CAS urged the personnel to combine their zeal and commitment with the unmatched potential of the newly-inducted platform (Rafale)," the IAF said.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said he has no doubt that the squadron would dominate whenever and wherever required, and ensure that the adversary would always be intimidated by its sheer presence."The IAF formally inducted Rafale aircraft into No. 101 Squadron at Air Force Station Hasimara in Eastern Air Command on July 28," the statement said.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria presided over the induction ceremony. On arrival, he was received by Air Marshal Amit Dev, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Air Command.The multi-role Rafale jets, built by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are known for air superiority and precision strikes.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, 2020, nearly four years after the country signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 aircraft at a cost of ₹59,000 crore.The Rafale jets are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale aircraft are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor, a beyond visual range air-to-air missile, and the Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-formally-inducts-rafale-jets-into-101-squadron-of-eastern-air-command-101627520213443.html
29-07-2021||India||Kerala gold smuggling: HC to hear bail pleas in NIA case against Swapna Suresh, others||The Kerala high court is slated to hear on Thursday a case registered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with last year's sensational Kerala gold smuggling case. The court will hear all the bail pleas of the accused, including Swapna Suresh who, along with others, is said to have smuggled 167kg of gold into India from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between November 2019 to June 2020 allegedly through diplomatic channels.The NIA, opposing any potential relief to Swapna Suresh in the matter, told the Kerala high court in the last hearing that she and the others committed a "terrorist act" by attempting to sneak gold into India through official channels, knowing full well that it would threaten the security and economic stability of the country.An NIA court had earlier on March 22 denied bail to seven accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case, including Suresh, KT Ramees, Sandeep Nair and P S Sarith.Swapna Suresh later approached the high court, challenging this order.In her bail plea, Suresh questioned the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) charge against her and also said that the trial was being stretched endlessly for no particular reason. She also accused the authorities of falsely implicating her in the case and said that she has been granted bail in the customs and PMLA cases related to the very same alleged criminal activity of gold smuggling.Opposing her plea, the NIA has filed its statement of objections regarding the same. The investigating agency informed the Kerala high court that Suresh and the others were aware that their actions would damage India's relations with the UAW. Thus, these acts qualify for offences under the UAPA for "terrorist activity, conspiracy and being part of a terror organisation.""Investigation conducted by NIA has established that prime accused Sarith, co-accused Swapna Suresh and others, with the knowledge that their act of smuggling of gold into India in large quantity would threaten the security and economic security of the country, destabilise the Indian economy and damage the friendly relations with UAE, conjointly committed the terrorist act," the NIA said its application to the court, opposing Suresh's bail plea.A bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ziyad Rahman A A at the Kerala high court had earlier on July 16 adjourned the pleas of Suresh and some others to July 29 to await the decision of the Supreme Court in NIA's appeal against the bail granted earlier by the trial court and the high court to another batch of accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-hc-to-hear-bail-pleas-in-nia-case-against-swapna-suresh-others-101627518214287.html

29-07-2021||India||Juhi Chawla seeks amendment in Delhi HC order on 5G plea, hearing today||The Delhi high court will on Thursday hear actor Juhi Chawla's plea seeking amendment in its earlier order on her plea against implementation of 5G network in the country. The court had dismissed her lawsuit last month and imposed a cost of ₹20 lakh.Chawla wants the word 'dismissed' to be changed to 'rejected'. Her lawyer has said in his argument that the plaint, which “never went up to the level of suit”, could only be rejected or returned in terms of the Civil Procedure Code, and not dismissed.The original order was passed by Justice JR Midha, who retired in June. The matter listed before Justice Sanjeev Narula who directed for placement of the matter before the roster bench and deferred the matter for July 29.The actor moved the high court in May seeking to challenge the setting up of 5G network in the country, expressing concerns over its impact on animals and children. Chawla claimed in her petition that once 5G is implemented, no one will be able to avoid exposure.But the court dismissed the petition saying it was filed for publicity. It said that the actor circulated the link of the hearing on social media which created the disruption thrice.The high court had posed several questions to Chawla's lawyer Deepak Khosla. It asked whether the plaintiff had approached the government through any representation before coming to the court.Juhi Chawla, who was in South Africa, also joined the court proceeding through video conferencing.After the petition was dismissed, Chawla posted a video on her Twitter account in which the actor said she is not against the 5G technology and only wanted the government's certificate that it is safe.The Cellular Operators' Association of India also said that 5G in India is safe, claiming that the radiation permitted in the country is one-tenth of what is globally accepted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/juhi-chawla-seeks-amendment-in-delhi-hc-order-on-5g-plea-hearing-today-101627516217806.html

29-07-2021||India||Taliban coup will lead to pariah state: Blinken||India and the US on Wednesday made a concerted push for immediate intra-Afghan negotiations to end the violence in Afghanistan, and find a political settlement that ensures the country doesn’t become a base for terrorists or pose a threat to regional stability.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and secretary of state Antony Blinken said after their meeting that both sides had agreed negotiations were the only way to create a lasting solution. Blinken referred to atrocities committed by the Taliban in areas the group had taken over and said an Afghanistan that didn’t respect the rights of its people would become a “pariah state”.Addressing a joint media interaction, Blinken and Jaishankar outlined plans for future cooperation in the fight against Covid-19 and post-pandemic recovery – including an additional outlay of $25 million by the US to support India’s vaccination programme – and defended their collaboration under the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, in the face of China’s strong criticism of the grouping.Blinken, the third senior leader of the Biden administration to visit India this year after defence secretary Lloyd Austin and special representative for climate action John Kerry, also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and national security adviser Ajit Doval.Modi expressed appreciation for Biden administration’s initiatives related to the Quad, Covid-19 and climate change. He said the societies of the US and India share a deep commitment to the values of democracy, freedom and liberty, and noted the bilateral strategic partnership will be of even greater global significance in the coming years in the context of economic recovery and climate action.Blinken and Modi also discussed regional challenges and a growing range of cooperation on Covid-19 response efforts, shared values and democratic principles, and regional security, including through the Quad consultations, the US state department said.Jaishankar said there was “much more convergence” between India and the US on finding a lasting settlement in Afghanistan that takes into account the country’s diversity. The world wants an Afghanistan at “peace with itself and with its neighbours”, but the country’s independence and sovereignty will “only be ensured if it is free from malign influences”, he said.An “unilateral imposition of will by any party...can never lead to stability” and such efforts cannot acquire legitimacy, Jaishankar said. Stressing the need to preserve gains made by Afghanistan in the past two decades in terms of human rights and social freedoms, he added: “Afghanistan must neither be home to terrorism nor a source of refugees.”Blinken said: “We’re both committed to the proposition that there is no military solution to the conflict that afflicts Afghanistan. There has to be a peaceful resolution which requires the Taliban and the Afghan government to come to the table, and we both agree...that any future government in Afghanistan has to be inclusive and fully representative of the Afghan people.”The Taliban is seeking international recognition and wants its leaders to be able to travel freely in the world after sanctions are lifted, but taking over Afghanistan by force is not the path to achieve such objectives, Blinken said. “And ultimately, an Afghanistan that does not respect the rights of its people, an Afghanistan that commits atrocities against its own people, would become a pariah state.”The remarks came against the backdrop of a fierce campaign by the Taliban to capture swathes of rural areas and crucial border crossings, and reports of killings and other atrocities in districts taken over by the group. India also has concerns about thousands of terrorists from Pakistan-based groups fighting alongside the Taliban.Jaishankar said it was inevitable that the drawdown of US forces would have consequences and countries in the region will have to deal with the situation. Without naming Pakistan, he said there was an exception among Afghanistan’s neighbours who had reached a broad consensus on the need for a political settlement. “I grant you not everybody who agrees does what they say they would do. I noted the exception that you have pointed out too. But I think that is the reality, this is not new. That is the reality over the last 30 years,” Jaishankar said.Both Blinken and Jaishankar strongly defended the Quad, saying it was a group of four like-minded countries working collectively to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region that is not directed against any nation. Blinken said the Quad was collaborating on issues that impact people in the region, including Covid-19 vaccines, post-pandemic economic recovery, climate crisis, and maritime security and infrastructure.“What the Quad is not is a military alliance, it is not that. Its purpose is...just to advance cooperation on regional challenges while reinforcing international rules and values that we believe together underpin peace, prosperity and stability in the region,” Blinken said.Jaishankar added that India’s interests went far beyond its borders, including trade partners and routes in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, at a time when rebalancing was underway to tackle new global challenges.On Covid-19 cooperation, Blinken acknowledged the responsiveness of the Biden administration in keeping raw materials supply chain open for vaccine production in India and support during the second wave of infections. “We focused today on expanding vaccine production to make it globally affordable and accessible. We also discussed travel challenges resulting from Covid,” he said.Blinken noted the US has contributed more than $200 million to India for Covid-19 relief and announced an additional outlay of $25 million to support vaccination efforts across the country. This will strengthen vaccine supply chain logistics, addressing misinformation and vaccine hesitancy, and help train health care workers.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia said Blinken’s visit is “set to contribute significantly to consolidation of India-US relations and deepen multifaceted cooperation within the Quad, a force of stability and hope in the Indo-Pacific”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-coup-will-lead-to-pariah-state-blinken-101627512235077.html
29-07-2021||India||The contrasting tale of inflation in India and US||Retail inflation is making news in both the United States (US) and India. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew at 5.4% in the US in the month of June 2021. This is the highest monthly inflation in the US in 13 years. Retail inflation in India was 6.26% in June. June 2021 is the second consecutive month when India’s CPI has stayed above the 6% mark, the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) tolerance band. The wholesale price index (WPI) in India continued to grow in double digits for the third consecutive month in June. While, both the US and India are experiencing a high inflation environment, the situations are very different. Here is how.1) Composition of CPI indices in US and India is differentBase effect is a much bigger factor in inflation in the US than it is in India2) Base effect is a much bigger factor in inflation in the US than it is in IndiaSince the pandemic inflicted a huge disruption to economies across the world, it is important to keep in mind the role of base effect while looking at any statistic which uses year-on-year comparisons. Base effect is a bigger factor in generating tailwinds for inflation in the US than in India. CPI growth in US in June 2020 was 0.65%, compared to 3.18% in June 2019. This is not the case in India. India’s CPI grew at 6.23% in June 2020 as well. A useful way to filter out the base effect in inflation indices is to look at two-year growth rather than the year-on-year growth number. The CPI index in US and India grew by 6.07% and 12.88% respectively between June 2019 and June 2021.3) What is driving inflation in US and India at the moment?The first issue here is the importance of core and non-core inflation. Core inflation measures the change in prices of all items in the CPI basket excluding food and fuel. In India, both core and non-core inflation are high at the moment. The respective values were 6.39% and 6.27% in June. These numbers are 4.5% and 8.3% for the US economy. Food inflation, both in stand-alone and overall terms, is a much smaller factor in the US than in India. Food prices grew at 5.58% in India and 2.4% in the US in June. Their contribution to overall CPI growth was just 6.42% in the US compared to 32.48% in India. Bulk of the food inflation in India is on account of edible oil and pulses. Prices of petroleum products, which are at a record high, is the other big factor behind the inflationary spike in India. While fuel inflation is also up in the US, this is largely a base effect. Unlike India, petroleum prices actually went down in the US when crude prices crashed during the pandemic. Weekly retail gasoline price per gallon fell by 20% in the last week of June 2020 from $2.715/gallon in June 2019. This has since increased. What is really driving inflation in the US is a rise in prices of things such as used cars, which experts believe is symptomatic of persisting supply side constraints as demand bounces back in the economy. “With used cars and trucks accounting for more than one-third of the surge in prices reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday, economists continued to believe that higher inflation was transitory, aligning with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s long-standing views”, said a Reuters story. In contrast, unless the government cuts taxes on petrol and diesel, prices are likely to remain high in India. India is also expected to experience additional inflationary tailwinds as demand for services rises with the economy opening up.4) How do markets and economists see inflation?Inflation numbers influence more than an ordinary household’s budget. Thanks to the entrenched inequalities in what is a globalised economy, inflation can have very different consequences for different economies. Interest rates, capital movements and stock markets are one such example. Real interest rates have been almost zero in advanced countries for quite some time. This has encouraged capital to move to emerging markets in search of better returns. If inflation were to rise in the advanced capitalist world, interest rates will have to rise. Even an expectation of this could trigger some sort of capital flight from emerging economies. This is exactly what happened during what is now referred to as the Taper-Tantrum in 2013. So far markets have not reacted negatively to high inflation in the US markets. In India, RBI has repeatedly asserted that restoring growth will remain a priority for monetary policy, though analysts expect the central bank will have to start withdrawing its monetary easing efforts by the end of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-contrasting-tale-of-inflation-in-india-and-us-101627510577462.html
29-07-2021||India||Supreme Court bench sets time limit for lawyers, says time to change old habits||NEW DELHI: A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court replicated the practice adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States by directing lawyers appearing in a case to confine their oral arguments to 30 minutes and submissions on law to three pages.Wondering which country in the world would allow lawyers to argue a case for hours and days together, the bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhash Reddy said that time has come for lawyers to change their habits.“We would like to be enlightened which court in the world permits lawyers to argue for days and hours together. Even in England, I have failed to find such a practice. Time has come to change the habits,” the bench said.The observations by the court came on a petition filed by Yatin Narendra Oza, a veteran lawyer from Gujarat who was stripped of the “senior advocate” designation following contempt proceedings initiated against him by the Gujarat High Court. Oza had made distasteful remarks against the judges of the high court and was defended before the top court by senior advocates, Arvind Datar and Abhishek Manu Singhvi. His petition has been pending in the top court since August 2020.The court directed Datar and Singhvi to take 30 minutes each and complete submissions within an hour. The Gujarat high court, the contesting party, was allotted 45 minutes while intervention applications filed in the case were told to finish submissions in 15 minutes. Even on submissions on law and citation of judgments, the bench told lawyers on both sides to file a three-page synopsis on law citing one best judgment on the point.Imposing this discipline on lawyers, the bench said, “Many times we find a 30-page synopsis filed for a 28-page writ petition. Lawyers must understand that in this kind of a hearing, how we can justify to a litigant whose appeal is pending for 10 years that some matters are being given priority and are heard for hours together.”Both Datar and Singhvi agreed to abide by the time restrictions on the next date of hearing on September 1.Datar pointed out that a similar system prevails in the Supreme Court of the United States where lawyers are given 25 minutes to argue a case and five minutes to reply to the other side’s contentions. He was referring to Rule 28 of the US Supreme Court Rules on oral hearing which states, “Unless the Court directs otherwise, each side is allowed one-half hour for the argument.”The change being envisaged by the Supreme Court bench also found reflection in a recent judgment authored by justice Kaul. There, justice Kaul, heading a three-judge bench, referred to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights which recognised the right of fair trial and public hearing to be completed within a “reasonable time”.The July 8 judgment said, “Delay in judicial proceedings has been the bane of our country and there cannot be a refusal to part ways from old practices especially when they have outlived their purpose…Instead of restricting oral arguments court has become a competing arena of who gets to argue for the longest time.”As of July 2, the Supreme Court has 69,212 pending matters of which 447 matters are Constitution bench matters. This fact was taken note of by Justice Kaul in his judgment that said, “The time spent on routine matters leaves little time to settle legal principles pending before larger Benches that may have an impact down the line on the judicial system.”Justice Kaul’s court is also unique as the daily list of cases comes with a special instruction for lawyers which says, “Parties to get ready with a short synopsis of not more than three pages each in the final hearing/disposal matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-bench-sets-time-limit-for-lawyers-says-time-to-change-old-habits-101627502991740.html
29-07-2021||India||Rajya Sabha clears bill to give more power to DMs||The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021 that proposes to increase the role of district magistrates and additional district magistrates in child care and adoption.The Bill which seeks to amend the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 was passed by Lok Sabha in March this year. The Act stated that adoption of a child is final on the issuance of an adoption order by the civil court.The Bill provides that instead of the court, the district magistrate, including additional district magistrate, will issue such adoption orders.Amid disruptions in the House, Smriti Irani, women and child development minister, while moving the Bill said children of this country deserve Parliamentarians’ attention for protection and support. “Some of the renowned Parliamentarians, who have always prioritised the needs of the vulnerable...however, politics demands that they stand right here in the Well and attract attention towards the issue which they feel fit,” Irani said. Irani said the adoption of a child is a legal process that creates a permanent legal relationship. Therefore, it may be questioned whether it is appropriate to vest the power to issue adoption orders with the district magistrate instead of a civil court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-clears-bill-to-give-more-power-to-dms-101627499703279.html

Widow says can die in peace||BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha high court has ordered the state government to quickly pay the money owed to an 83-year-old widow who continued to fight her husband’s legal battles for the pension he believed he was entitled to. She won the case last week.Minalata Mohanty said her husband, a retired primary school teacher, would have been very happy had he been alive. They had fought long, and hard.“The kind of hardships that we went through all these years looking for justice is unimaginable. But I am happy. I can die in peace,” she said after the high court ruling delivered on July 23. The verdict was uploaded on Wednesday.Justice Biswanath Rath ordered the state to pay the admissible entitlements of the school teacher with penal interest.“She has lost her husband and there should not be any further delay in the release of entitlements through the (earlier) judgment (in OJC No 1345 of 1999) at least to see the 83-year-old lady spend her last part of life with peace,” justice Rath said, describing the state government retaining the teacher’s entitlements three years after losing its appeal in the Supreme Court a crime.Her husband, Prafulla Chandra Mohanty, spent his years after retirement in 1986 struggling to get a higher scale that he was entitled to before his superannuation. Since the pension is calculated on the basis of an employee’s last drawn salary, Mohanty was determined to get his dues. After he retired, he filed the requests and reminders for years. In 1999, Mohanty finally moved the Odisha high court.The teacher from Cuttack’s Salipur area won the high court case in 2004 but the state government went in appeal.Mohanty died in 2010 before the Supreme Court delivered its verdict in 2018. But his wife did not still get the benefits.Justice Rath took a dim view of the conduct of state government officials in this case that resulted in the delay.“There is also a requirement for bringing all persons responsible for such delay to be brought to book to check no repetition of this conduct in future,” the court said. The court also told the state to pay a 5% interest on the remainder of his retirement dues from July 1986 to November 2004, 6% interest from November 2004 to August 2018 and 10% interest from August 2018 when the Supreme Court rejected the state’s special leave petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-teacher-wins-pension-case-11-yrs-after-death-widow-says-can-die-in-peace-101627501130279.html
29-07-2021||India||CJI mediates in Telugu, helps couple reunite after 21 years of separation||An unusual situation conjured up an unusual response from Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Wednesday. The first judge of the country chose to deviate from the customary norms and interacted with a couple in Telugu, counselling them, and finally uniting them after 21 years of separation.The scene in the first court looked out of the ordinary on Wednesday afternoon when CJI Ramana spoke in Telugu with the couple that didn’t understand English — the official language of the Supreme Court.The situation was unique. The couple from Andhra Pradesh had been living separately since 2001 but the man was financially supporting his estranged wife and their son for the last 18 years even after he got convicted in a criminal case lodged by the wife.The man worked in the revenue department of the Andhra government while the woman was a homemaker. A month after their separation in 2001, she filed a criminal complaint, alleging cruelty upon her by the husband. He was charged under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).In 2002, the husband was convicted by a Guntur trial court and was sentenced to a year in jail. The high court, however, suspended his jail term. Meanwhile, the wife moved a family court for alimony and the man started paying her maintenance in 2003. He continued doing so even after his conviction.In 2010, the high court reduced the husband’s punishment to the jail term already undergone by him. Disgruntled, the woman approached the Supreme Court for enhancement of her husband’s jail term. She complained that all her husband got was a slap on the wrist and he kept his job too.In 2012, the top court tried for mediation but to no avail. Recently, CJI Ramana initiated yet another attempt for a settlement, but the lawyers came back a day ago to inform that the wife was still insisting on enhancement of the husband’s jail term.The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and Surya Kant, pointed out that if the man was put behind bars, he would lose his job and then there will be no alimony for the woman and the son. It asked the lawyers to keep their clients present in the court through video-conferencing.On Wednesday, the couple showed up. The wife, however, said she could not understand English. Unhesitatingly, CJI Ramana broke into Telugu. The judge tried to bring her to reason, unambiguously apprising her of the consequences if the man was incarcerated. The judge listened to her side of the story too and counselled her.Next, CJI Ramana asked the couple if they were willing to live together again. “But that, only if you assure us that you will take care of her very well. Do not forget you have been convicted and unless you take the initiative, things will not materialise,” the bench told the man, who readily agreed to reunite. The woman also nodded, expressing her wish to restart their relationship as husband and wife.The bench then recorded in its order that the two have agreed to submit their undertakings in two weeks. The man will pledge to take her back while the woman will agree to settle the criminal case. “Parties have agreed to live together forgetting the past differences...Parties are allowed to move the applications,” stated the order.Advocate D Rama Krishna Reddy, who appeared for the husband in the case, told HT: “But for the efforts of the CJI, it was not possible for the couple to end their bitterness and come together. A human problem was addressed by the CJI in a most humane manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-mediates-in-telugu-helps-couple-reunite-after-21-years-of-separation-101627500110523.html
29-07-2021||India||Blinken meets representative of Dalai Lama||New Delhi: US secretary of state Antony Blinken began his formal engagements in New Delhi on Wednesday by meeting a representative of the Dalai Lama, signalling the Biden administration’s support to the Tibetan cause. Blinken met briefly with Ngodup Dongchung of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) before his meetings with top Indian leaders. Dongchung presented Blinken with a scarf from the Dalai Lama and conveyed the CTA’s gratitude for the US administration’s backing of the Tibetan cause, people familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity. The meeting was one of the most conspicuous contacts between American and Tibetan officials since former president Barack Obama met the Dalai Lama in Washington in 2016 and former CTA head Lobsang Sangay was invited to the White House last November. The meeting also came two days after US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman met Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and raised American concerns about human rights, including abuses in Tibet, the anti-democracy crackdown in Hong Kong, and the genocide in Xinjiang. “Secretary Blinken had an opportunity to meet briefly this morning in New Delhi with a representative of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Central Tibetan Administration representative Ngodup Dongchung,” a US state department spokesperson said without giving details. Another US official, on condition of anonymity, said: “The Dalai Lama obviously is a globally revered spiritual leader and so the gesture was gratefully received and appreciated.” The people cited above said the meeting was being seen as a strong signal of support for the Dalai Lama and was also significant as it was held in India at a time when New Delhi and Beijing are locked in standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “It was a clear signal that the Biden administration will continue the Trump administration’s high-level engagements and support to the Tibetan side. It also has to be seen in the context of the Tibet Policy and Support Act passed by the US Congress last year, which calls for the Tibetans to have the final say in choosing the successor to the Dalai Lama and the setting up of a US consulate in Lhasa,” one of the people cited above said. Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of Tibet House in New Delhi, was among the select group of people invited for a civil society roundtable with Blinken shortly after the meeting with Dongchung. There was no immediate response from the Chinese side to the meeting between Blinken and Dongchung.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blinken-meets-representative-of-dalai-lama-101627500050785.html
29-07-2021||India||‘Democracy not a patent to any nation’: China targets U.S.||Beijing: A seemingly upset spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday sought to give a lesson on democracy to India and the US, the largest and oldest democracies in the world, after it appeared that the two had ganged up against authoritarian China, which defines itself, in a marginally unwieldy fashion, as a socialist consultative democracy.All because the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visiting India at present, talked about a rising global threat to democracies and that the two leading ones should stand together to support the threatened ideals.A Bloomberg question on whether the Blinken statement pointed a finger at China during the Chinese foreign ministry briefing on Wednesday triggered a passionate discourse on democracy from high-profile spokesperson, Zhao Lijian.Zhao dived right into it.“I want to stress that democracy is a common value of humanity. It is not a patent to any country. The way to realise democracy is diverse without a certain pattern or only one answer. A multiparty political structure is not the only form of democracy and democracy cannot be used to stoke confrontation,” Zhao said.The reference to the US went like this: “Some countries claim themselves to be democratic, but they face the problems of racial discrimination, political polarisation, among other issues.”“Is this the kind of democracy that they pride them on?”Then came the reference to neighbour, India – with the inevitable conclusion that money wins elections in India – and rhetorical questions, one after the other.“In some countries, without money you cannot get votes. Political parties place their interests above that of the people. Is this democracy or the rise of the wealthy?”“Some democratic countries contain others’ development. Is this democracy or hegemony? Is this the kind of democracy that you want?”The way to judge which country is democratic and which one is autocratic should not be decided by one certain country, Zhao mused.“The way to judge whether a political system is good is to see whether it can deliver progress of society, better livelihood and whether it is endorsed and supported by its people and whether it can make contributions to the progress of mankind.Zhao didn’t name either India or the US but clearly did not leave much to anyone’s imagination. Maybe, like Blinken’s statement.Elsewhere, the nationalistic state-run tabloid, Global Times was direct.“Such an arrangement, (Blinken’s visit) which closely follows (deputy secretary of state Wendy) Sherman’s visit to China on Sunday and Monday, is seen as a sign that the US will spend more efforts to rope in India to contain China and play the ‘India card’,” analysts told the tabloid.But all isn’t good between India and the US, the analysis said.One of the major rifts between New Delhi and Washington is the US decision to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, which has left India’s investment in the region for the past 20 years hanging in the air, Long Xingchun, from the Beijing Foreign Studies University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/democracy-not-a-patent-to-any-nation-china-targets-us-101627500050223.html
29-07-2021||India||Blinken talks farmers’ protests, China, CAA in civil society meet||Interfaith relations, the farmers’ protest, freedom of expression, and the Pegasus spyware issue figured at a civil society roundtable held by US secretary of state Antony Blinken ahead of his meetings with the Indian leadership on Wednesday, according to people aware of the developments.Concerns over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, and China’s aggressive actions were also raised by the seven civil society representatives who joined the roundtable with the theme “Advancing equitable, inclusive, and sustainable growth and development”, added the people who declined to be named.Ahead of Blinken’s visit, the US side said it intended to raise human rights and democracy during his engagements in New Delhi. The US has, in the recent past, spoken out on issues such as the situation in Kashmir and movements such as the farm protests on the outskirts of Delhi.The seven civil society representatives are: Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of the Tibet House in New Delhi, lawyer Menaka Guruswamy, Inter-Faith Harmony Foundation of India head Khwaja Iftikhar Ahmed, Swami Shantamandada of the Ramakrishna Mission, AK Merchant of Bahai Foundation, Anuvinda Varey of the Christian Coalition of Health, and a representative from a Sikh organisation. The seven invitees spoke for a few minutes each during the roundtable that lasted almost an hour.“The farmers protest, CAA, restrictions on the media, freedom of expression, rights of minorities, interfaith relations, and the Pegasus surveillance issue were all raised by the representatives but there was no substantial discussion on these matters,” said a participant who asked not to be named.Besides issues of concern within India, regional issues such as the security situation in Afghanistan and China’s aggression were part of the discussions, a second participant said, also on condition of anonymity.When contacted, Ahmed said he spoke on the need for interfaith relations to come to the centre stage while pointing out the challenges to the region due to developments in Afghanistan. “Afghanistan is a priority for both sides and it is high time for them to collaborate on this issue in the larger interest of global peace and security,” he said.The role of civil society in India also figured in the discussions, with Blinken saying in his opening remarks that democracies such as the US and India need a vibrant civil society if they are to be “more open, more inclusive, more resilient, more equitable”. He added that “all people deserve to have a voice in their government and be treated with respect”.Blinken said India and the US should continue to stand together as leading democracies at a time when global threats to democracy and international freedoms are increasing. Both sides talk about issues such as democracy as friends, “because doing the hard work of strengthening democracy and making our ideals real is often challenging”, he said.Referring to efforts in the US to become a “more perfect union”, Blinken said, “Sometimes that process is painful, sometimes it’s ugly, but the strength of democracy is to embrace it”. Blinken also tweeted about “India’s pluralistic society and history of harmony” and said civil society “helps advance these values”.It is learnt that Blinken flagged the concerns of the US regarding democracy and human rights during his talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Asked about these issues at a joint media interaction with Jaishankar, Blinken said shared values and democratic traditions “were very much a part of our conversation today”.He described Indian democracy as a “force for good in defence of a free and open Indo-Pacific and a free and open world” and said both countries have “self-righting mechanisms” made up of free citizens of different faiths, a free media and independent courts powered by a system of free and fair elections.Jaishankar said he made three points to Blinken, including the fact that the “quest for a more perfect union applies as much to the Indian democracy as it does to the American one”.In an apparent reference to the Indian government’s actions such as enacting CAA, Jaishankar said it is the “moral obligation of all polities to right wrongs when they have been done, including historically, and many of the decisions and policies you have seen in the last few years fall in that category”.He also said freedoms are important but one could “never equate freedom with non-governance or lack of governance or poor governance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blinken-talks-farmers-protests-china-caa-in-civil-society-meet-101627499929219.html
29-07-2021||India||Nobody can capture party, AIADMK united: OPS||AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam on Wednesday finally broke his silence on former party leader V Sasikala’s move to reclaim the party and said “nobody can capture’’ the party, adding that the dual leadership set-up with co-coordinator Edappadi Palaniswami is working successfully. Panneerselvam was talking to reporters after the AIADMK conducted a state-wide protest on Wednesday against the DMK for not implementing its election promises, such as abolishing NEET and cutting fuel prices. This assertion comes just a day after Panneerselvam and Palaniswami returned from New Delhi, where they held discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and with Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday. Tamil Nadu’s political scenario has been abuzz over what had transpired at the meetings. Multiple leaders from the AIADMK and BJP, who are unrelated to each other, have confirmed to HT that the BJP has delivered a message to the AIADMK’s dual leadership “to not rock the boat” and continue the status quo. Sasikala was not discussed, they said.Even before the duo left for the capital, BJP’s new Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai met with Panneerselvam and Palaniswami separately in their residences in Chennai. “He had conveyed to them that the BJP wants the alliance to continue for the local body polls and wants the AIADMK to be together to defeat the DMK,” a senior BJP leader said. “In Delhi, they have got an assurance on this from the party leadership.” He added that the meeting itself conveys a message to AIADMK’s cadre that it is Panneerselvam and Palaniswami who have the ear of the two most powerful politicians in the country amidst Sasikala attempting to claw her way in. Sasikala has reached out to several cadres of the AIADMK and its rebel faction Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) founded by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. She recently visited the former party’s presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan in a city hospital, even though he had rebelled against her during the several factions that arose following J Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016. Palaniswami, who was in the hospital during the same time, left in a huff.“AIADMK in the past four-and-a-half years has successfully put in place a system that the party affairs are run without the dominance of an individual or a particular family,” Panneerselvam said on Wednesday. “The system that we have created is democratic, and cadre is happy with the current set-up.” The BJP’s direction and Panneerselvam’s clarification is significant as the tension between him and Palaniswami has become public after their electoral loss in the assembly elections. Panneerselvam was said to be softening his stance towards Sasikala’s return. And as their rift deepened, it offered a space for Sasikala to position herself as the saviour of the party she once manoeuvred from behind the scenes when Jayalalithaa was alive.“We don’t want to pressurise them about Sasikala. That’s their wish,” the BJP leader said. “The damage is already done. They didn’t listen to us before the elections. The results could have been different if we had roped in Dhinakaran, who split our vote bank.” Dhinakaran Tuesday reiterated that AMMK would continue its founding mission along with his aunt to “retrieve the AIADMK from detractors”.A senior AIADMK leader said that they had discussed the recent raids against their former transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar. It has made the principal opposition jittery as it is being seen as DMK’s beginning of a crackdown given their election promise to establish a special court and try cases against top AIADMK ministers. “Sasikala has no traction no matter what she has tried to do. There was nothing to discuss,” he said. Their meeting with Modi-Shah and the protest on Wednesday across 4500 places in the state has given a boost to the cadre, said another AIADMK leader not wishing to be named. “They (BJP) have told us that we could continue to function the way we have been so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobody-can-capture-party-aiadmk-united-ops-101627499749358.html
29-07-2021||India||Oppn attacks Kerala govt after SC verdict in 2015 assembly ruckus case||Thiruvananthapuram: The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front government in Kerala suffered a major jolt on Wednesday after its plea to withdraw cases against some of its legislators in connection with a ruckus in the state assembly in 2015 was rejected by the Supreme Court, which said allowing prosecution to be withdrawn would amount to interference in normal course of justice for “illegitimate reasons”. Soon after the apex court order, the opposition parties in Kerala stepped up pressure for the resignation of state education minister V Sivankutty, who is one of the six accused in the case. Senior Congress leader and leader of the opposition in assembly VD Satheesan said, “He holds the education portfolio. What message the government will give to students if it allows him to cling on to power.” “He has no right to continue in power. It is a big paradox that the man who destroyed assembly property is still in the House,” said Kerala Congress chief K Sudhakaran. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kerala unit president K Surendran said, “As the main accused in the case he has lost moral authority to continue in Cabinet.” However, the ruling party defended the minister, saying he will face the trial as the apex court did not get into the merit of the case. “It is not the final verdict. All accused will face the trial,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. Sivankutty also said he was ready to face judicial proceedings. “A Communist’s life is full of struggle and revolts. I have waged numerous strikes and struggles since my school days. I will face this case also,” he said in the state capital. The Kerala House witnessed violent incidents in March 2015 after LDF legislators, then in the opposition, tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget . Angry lawmakers snapped mikes, threw chairs, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee, which also resulted in two legislators landing up in hospital. The session was being broadcast live when violence took place and property worth ₹2.20 lakh was destroyed in the ruckus. After coming to power in 2016, the LDF government tried to withdraw the case, only for a local court to reject it. The Pinarayi Vijayan government then moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The government also invoked the privilege of legislators and public interest to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it saying privilege was not a licence to carry out violence in the House. The Supreme Court on Wednesday also upheld the lower court’s verdict and directed all accused to face criminal proceedings. The apex court said acts of destruction of public property cannot be equated with either the freedom of speech of the legislator or with forms of protest legitimately available to the members of opposition. “Privileges and immunities are not gateway to claim exemption from the general law of the land, particularly as in this case the criminal law which governs the action of every citizen,” a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and M R Shah said. All six accused , V Sivankutty, K T Jaleel, E P Jayarajan, C K Sadasivan, Kunahmed Master and K Ajith , were charged under the prevention of damage to public property act and other provisions. Out of six, Sivankutty and Jaleel are sitting MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-attacks-kerala-govt-after-sc-verdict-in-2015-assembly-ruckus-case-101627499690384.html
29-07-2021||India||Rising Covid cases pose challenge for Kerala amid third wave threat||Thiruvananthapuram: As threat of a possible third wave looms large in the country, the steady rise in Covid-19 cases in Kerala is posing a big challenge to the overstretched health system while also exposing the “situation under control” claims of the state government. The state reported 22,056 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, its second consecutive over 20,000-caseload day, at a test positivity rate (TPR) of 11.2%, according to the health department’s daily bulletin. Kerala also reported 131 deaths in last 24 hours, taking the toll to 16,457. On Tuesday, Kerala accounted for nearly 50% of total caseload on the day in the country (22,129 out of 42,498 cases) and its average test positivity rate (TPR) at 12.35% was almost four times the national average of 3%, according to the health department. In Kerala, which reported the first coronavirus disease case in the country in January last year, the second wave of the pandemic is showing no sign of abating in the last three months. It is also the only state in the country to report over 20,000 cases in nearly two months, prompting the worried Union health ministry to ask it to ramp up its virus control measures. A team of leaders from the state unit of the Bharaitya Janata Party met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday and urged him to prevail upon the state government to take proactive measures to contain the surge. The intensity of surge can be gauged by comparing Covid-19 numbers with neighbouring states. Tamil Nadu logged 20,421 cases on June 6, the last time any Indian state crossed the 20,000-mark, but on Tuesday, the state reported only 1,767 cases. Another neighbouring state Karnataka, which also witnessed high volume of cases in April-May, reported only 1,501 new cases on Tuesday with a TPR of 1.46%. According to the Kerala health department data, total cases in the state crossed 3.3 million, second highest after Maharashtra with 6.2 million. Out of the around 450,000 active cases in the country, the state’s share is 149,000. Worried experts hinted that steady rise in cases is the sign of a possible third wave in the state. Ground reports also show that things are not rosy for the state with most of vacant Covid beds filling up and demand for ventilators rising. An estimated 14.8 million people above 18 years of age are still waiting for the first dose of vaccine. The fourth round of the sero survey, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, shows 67.7% antibody prevalence nationally while it is way low at 42.7 % in the state. This shows a huge chunk of Kerala’s population is still susceptible to virus, a health expert said. With high density of population (859 people per sq km), comprising of around 15% of those above 65 years, and high volume of lifestyle diseases (mostly diabetes), the state will have to go an extra mile to change things around, experts said. Experts have also blamed low testing rate, the state’s continued obsession with cheap antigen tests and over dependence on bureaucracy for the stagnant situation. Kerala was lauded for its pandemic control measures during the first wave, but it turned into a Covid-19 hot spot in the second wave and shows no sign abating in the last three months, with experts calling for a scientific study on low transmission and progression behaviour of the virus. “The government sniffs politics in every aspect of pandemic. Experts and medical bodies have been kept away deliberately. Ill-flated record won’t stand forever and now it stands exposed,” said Dr SS Lal, a public health expert who worked with World Health Organisation for many years. “Mere lockdown won’t do any good. It is time for the state to redraw its strategies,” said Dr NM Arun, another public health expert. Though no shortage of oxygen or Covid beds has been reported in the state, but pressure on overburdened health system is quite visible. Compared to last week, there is a 14% jump in demand for beds and 80% of Covid beds are occupied this week, health ministry statistics show. Out of 30 worst affected districts in the country, 10 are in Kerala, including Malappuram which tops the list with 4,037 cases. Despite grim picture, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan put up a brave face, saying situation was well under control. “Second wave started late in the state and about 50% of the state population are yet to contract virus. So, we expected this increase,” he said in the state assembly on Tuesday. He also blamed vaccine shortage for delaying the state’s universal inoculation programme. However, the opposition Congress and BJP blamed the government for the sorry state of affairs. “Its lies are falling flat. The government fudged data to give a rosy picture but now skeletons are tumbling out of its cupboard. The RTI reply we received shows more than 7,316 fatalities were not accounted for. And its Covid stimulus package turned out to be a big farce,” said senior Congress leader and leader of the opposition in assembly VD Satheesan. He added that the government relegated virus management to bureaucrats and they framed rules and regulations with no thought for human woes. “We have appraised the Union government and party central leadership about ground situation in the state. The government can’t hide truth for long,” said BJP state president K Surendran. He alleged that CPI(M) local leaders were controlling vaccination process at many places, something that the ruling party has denied and blamed opposition parties instead “for playing dirty politics” even during the pandemic. “Both Congress and BJP are in same boat, and they are yet to learn a lesson from recent assembly poll debacle,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rising-covid-cases-pose-challenge-for-kerala-amid-third-wave-threat-101627499389747.html
29-07-2021||India||Bommai remains tight lipped on new cabinet, says decision after Delhi visit||Bengaluru: After Basavaraj Bommai’s appointment as Karnataka chief minister, speculations have now begun on the cabinet posts. On Wednesday, when asked about the cabinet expansion, Bommai said that decision would be taken after his visit to New Delhi. Talking about the cabinet formation, on Wednesday morning, Bommai said, “I met Dharmendra Pradhan and Arun Singh this morning. They have told me there is no need for any meeting (on cabinet formation) today (Wednesday). We will make a decision after they have left.” He also clarified that during his first visit to Delhi he will be meeting PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and BJP national president J P Nadda to thank them, and thereafter he will discuss with leaders on the cabinet expansion. “We won’t take much time. For all the work that needs to be completed, we need a full team (of ministers). So, we will do it (cabinet formation) at the earliest,” he added. While the party leadership has remained tightlipped about the candidates, party insiders say that the saffron party will stick to three-deputy chief minister formula. “Like the last term, there will be three deputy chief ministers and they will be from the three prominent communities,” said a senior BJP office bearer on the condition of anonymity. In the previous government, Govind Karjol, a Dalit, CN Ashwath Narayan Gowda, a Vokkaliga and Laxman Savadi, a Lingayat were deputy CMs. This was a signal that has been sent to all the three major caste groups in the state that their interests are being taken care of. The office bearer, however, indicated that in this term, instead of having a Lingayat deputy chief minister, two deputy chief ministers could represent the ST and SC community. “The party has made a decision to pay attention to the other communities in the state as well. Also, the chief minister is a Lingayat,” he said. The three popular candidates speculated to the next deputy chief minister are B Sriramalu (ST), Govind Karjol (SC) and R Ashok (Vokkaliga). “The final decision will be taken by the central leadership, but these are the names that are on top of the list,” said a senior BJP leader. Apart from the DCM post, the future of the rebel MLAs is a matter of concern as well. 10 MLAs who had left the Congress and JD(S) during the 2019 political crisis, are staring at an uncertain future ahead of the cabinet formation. Since their resignations had paved the way for Yediyurappa to form a government, all of them were given a cabinet berth and other important posts in the government. With the change in guard, it remains unclear if they will find space in the new cabinet. In the previous government, Yediyurappa had stood his ground to ensure all of them got postings. “It doesn’t look like all of them will get cabinet posts this time. Mostly, only those high performing ministers will be retained. But at the same time, they are not part of the BJP, and they will go by the high command’s decision. There is no doubt about it,” said a senior leader. Senior Congress leader and the leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah had said that none of these rebel MLAs will be taken back, which puts the 10 MLAs in a tough position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-remains-tight-lipped-on-new-cabinet-says-decision-after-delhi-visit-101627499329684.html
29-07-2021||India||Floods to Covid: Key challenges for the new CM||Bengaluru: For Basavaraj Bommai, who took over as Karnataka chief minister on Wednesday, his tenure will not be an easy one. From handling the floods to keeping the leaders happy to run the government that is facing a fund crunch, the new chief minister has his hands full on all fronts from day one. Here are some of the main challenges Bommai will face during his tenure. Handling the floods The immediate challenge for Bommai is to address the flood situation in the northern and coastal parts of Karnataka. So far, 10 people have lost their lives and the Opposition has accused the BJP of playing politics, while the people of the state are facing a natural calamity. On Wednesday, Bommai said that the central government has released funds and he will be making a personal visit to flood- affected areas. Over the past few days, residents of flood-affected areas have been raising voices against the government’s inaction. Providing them reassurance will certainly be high on his priority list. The Covid-19 challenge On the Covid-19 front, even though the number of cases have come down, experts are predicting a third wave to hit the state, which is still lagging in providing vaccines. Ensuring that the state doesn’t witness another Covid wave is high on the priority, said the new chief minister on Monday. During the past two waves, it was Yediyurappa who led the state’s Covid response. Being the state with the second-highest death rate so far, he has a big challenge ahead of him. A lot will, however, depend on who is the new health minister. K Sudakar, outgoing health minister, is said to have done a decent job in handling Covid.Striking a balance between the high command, BSY and RSSBommai is a candidate acceptable to the three main stakeholders in Karnataka BJP – Party’s central leadership, BS Yediyurappa, and the RSS faction. But this could pose a problem for Bommai. In the days ahead, there are chances of him getting pulled between three powerhouses over decision making. With all three groups trying to assert their influence on governance, Bommai will have to strike a middle ground and balance all factions. His political mentor Yediyurappa could be his biggest problem as he would like to remain a de-facto chief minister, which, other BJP leaders would not like. Striking a more secular and socialistic outlook may not be easy in the present BJP state unit having several hardliners.Control dissidence within the party Soon after Yediyurappa announced his resignation, MLAs who joined the BJP from the Congress and JD(S) during the 2019 political crisis, were in panic. The BJP government came to power because of these “rebel MLAs”. With Bommai’s appointment, the state will see a new cabinet and there are speculations that some of them may lose important portfolios. When Yediyurappa last reshuffled the portfolios, there was a huge hue and cry among ministers, forcing the CM to conduct the exercise thrice within a fortnight. Bommai will have to play a balancing act to ensure that all leaders in the party – rebels and other leaders – are kept happy. A job not easy. Recovering from financial troubles Bommai on Wednesday said that the government will focus on maintaining fiscal discipline through efficient utilization of resources and reducing expenditure amidst the pandemic. He said that he has directed the officials to focus on time-bound implementation of development programmes with interdepartmental coordination. He expected officials to reduce unnecessary expenditure to a minimum of 5%. A new system to dispose of files without delay would be adopted, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floods-to-covid-key-challenges-for-the-new-cm-101627499209171.html
29-07-2021||India||'Won’t be a rubber stamp CM': Bommai||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday took oath as the 23rd chief minister of Karnataka at a ceremony held at the Raj Bhavan and told reporters that he will not be a “rubber stamp CM”.Bommai, the son of former chief minister SR Bommai and a former home minister,was named the CM by the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tiuesday, a day after four-time CM BS Yediyurappa resigned following months of dissidence. A Lingayat leader, 61-year-old Bommai is considered close to his predecessor.When asked about the perception that he was a proxy chief minister for Yediyurappa, Bommai said, “I have a simple response to this question. I am no rubber stamp CM, and I will prove that by ensuring that people will give their stamp of approval for my schemes.”Soon after taking oath, Bommai thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his good wishes and said he would continue the good work done by the previous BS Yediyurappa-led state government.“Thank you Prime Minister @narendramodi ji for your kind wishes. I will definitely continue the good work done by the state government under the able leadership of @BSYBJP. We, as a team, will work for the development of the state and the nation under the guidelines of all our senior leaders,” Bommai tweeted.Earlier, while congratulating Bommai, Modi lauded his predecessor Yediyurappa for his ‘monumental contribution’ to the growth of BJP and the state.“Congratulations to Shri @BSBommai Ji on taking oath as Karnataka’s CM. He brings with him rich legislative and administrative experience. I am confident he will build on the exceptional work done by our Government in the state. Best wishes for a fruitful tenure,” he tweeted.Clarifying his statement on Tuesday that he would consult Yediyurappa on decisions, Bommai said, “When I said I will consult Yediyurappa on my decisions, I meant that the former CM had tackled the Covid-19 pandemic effectively, despite having financial constraints due to the pandemic. He gave several good schemes and ensured an able administration. These experiences matter and that is what I meant that his guidance will be sought for the new cabinet to take further steps.”He added that there were no two power centresin Karnataka. “In our constitutional setup, there are certain posts which are mandated. As a chief minister of the state, you are first among equals. Even the cabinet has got its own constitutional power. As a CM, my job is to carry everyone along as a team. I can only say that we will work as a team and the power will rest with the team.”Highlighting his immediate priorities, Bommai said he will be visiting flood-ravaged Karwar in Uttara Kannada district on Thursday and was waiting for PMModi’s appointment for the Delhi visit, where he added, he will also meet home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and BJP national president JP Nadda. He said thereafter he will discuss with leaders on the cabinet expansion.On his first day as the CM, Bommai announced several policy decisions. Speaking to reporters after chairing his first Cabinet meeting, Bommai said ₹1,000 crore will be set aside for the scholarship scheme aimed at encouraging farmers’ children to pursue higher education. The Cabinet also decided to increase pensions under various schemes, he added.Pension under Sandhya Suraksha scheme (old-age pension) will go up from ₹1,000 to ₹1,200, benefiting 3.6 million residents. Monthly widow pension will be increased from ₹600 to ₹800, covering 1.7 million beneficiaries, and disability pension (40-75% disability) from ₹600 to ₹800, aiming to benefit 400,000 residents.Bommai said he will soon hold a meeting with senior officials in the government to take stock of the administration. Talking about cabinet formation, he said that he met the observers from the party’s high command. “I met Dharmendra Pradhan and Arun Singh this morning. They have told me there is no need for any meeting (on cabinet formation) today (Wednesday). We will make a decision after they have left,” said Bommai.“We won’t take much time. For all the work that needs to be completed, we need a full team (of ministers). So we will do it (cabinet formation) at the earliest,” he added.The chief minister, who also held a meeting with additional chief secretaries and principal secretaries of various departments on Wednesday, said officials have been given a broader picture on the orientation of his government. He added that the government will focus on maintaining fiscal discipline through efficient utilisation of resources and reducing expenditure amidst pandemic.Emphasising on inter-departmental cooperation, Bommai said all departments have been given 15 days to clear all pending files, adding that he wanted to do away with the “chalta hai” (relaxed) attitude among the officials. A ranking system will be introduced to encourage departments to perform well, he said, adding, “I have told officials that the new administration will get a new orientation.”Bommai was the home minister in Yediyurappa’s council of ministers, which was dissolved following the 78-year-old leader’s resignation on Monday. Bommai is considered a close confidant of former chief minister Yediyurappa.Son of former chief minister SR Bommai, Basavaraj started his political career with the Janata Dal and worked with senior leaders including HD Devegowda and Ramakrishna Hegde. He left the Janata Dal (United) and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in February 2008.The selection of Bommai, who is from the Lingayat community, comes after several pontiffs from Lingayat mutts in the state had warned the BJP central command against removing Yediyurappa, a tall leader of the community. The Lingayat community forms close to 16% of the state’s population and they have been a loyal vote base for the BJP. Even though there were speculations that the BJP may appoint a leader from a different community, it eventually zeroed down on the Lingayat leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-be-a-rubber-stamp-cm-bommai-101627499149180.html
29-07-2021||India||Jump in share of Indian carriers in international cargo business: Scindia||New Delhi Minister for civil aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia on Wednesday told the Rajya Sabha that the share of Indian carriers in the international cargo business has increased from 2% to 19%.To a separate question, the Union minister said the next round of bidding for airports will begin soon. He also said that the Centre was still considering the Bihar assembly’s resolution on renaming the Darbhanga Airport as the Vidyapati Airport.Speaking during the Question Hour, which was held amid protests by Opposition members, Scindia said the cargo business in the domestic sector, which was 800,000 metric ton in 2010-11, has increased to 1.4 million metric ton, an increase of 75%.Scindia said efforts such as providing cold chain logistics and new cargo hubs have been made to increase the share of Indian carriers in the international market. He said India’s share in the international cargo business was worth ₹1,686 crore in 2019-20, which rose to ₹2,644 crore in 2020-21 despite the Covid-19 pandemic.To a question on whether his ministry was considering extending the 50% subsidy for agri-perishables for transportation from the North-east and four Himalayan states to other parts of the country, the minister said that the Centre was contemplating how this could be turned into a pan-Indian scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jump-in-share-of-indian-carriers-in-international-cargo-business-scindia-101627497529022.html
29-07-2021||India||IT panel meet on Pegasus put off after BJP MPs refuse to take part||The meeting of the standing committee on information technology led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday to discuss the controversial Pegasus Project had to be called off due a lack of quorum, after Bharatiya Janata Party MPs refused to participate and staged a walk out.“@BJP4India members come to the IT Committee & refuse to sign the attendance register to deny a quorum. Further all the witnesses called from MiEIT & MHA wrote in excuses & didn’t appear as called to testify. It’s very clear that #Pegasus is a no go area for this government,” Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, who is a member of the panel, said.The committee needs at least nine members to be present in order to function. It has 21 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha, of which nearly half are from the ruling party. BJP leaders walked out of the meeting on Tuesday too. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said then that participating in the meeting when the House was in session was not correct.Meanwhile, Dubey on Wednesday, moved a privilege motion seeking removal of Tharoor as the head of the panel. Invoking the rule 222 of “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha” which says that a “member may, with the consent of the Speaker, raise a question involving a breach of privilege either of a member or of the House or of a Committee,” Dubey said, “It is shocking that opposition here doesn’t want Parliament to function. However, they want the same issues to be discussed in the committee (meetings) which the government is ready to discuss in Parliament.”HT reached out to Tharoor for a response but did not get one immediately.The Pegasus row erupted last Sunday before the beginning of the current monsoon session of Parliament after an international investigative consortium reported that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were potentially targeted by Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software, Pegasus, with a forensic analysis of 10 of the targets proving they had been hacked or that there had been attempts to do so.The government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the spyware. NSO Group has on multiple occasions said that it offers services only to vetted government clients. The company has disputed the leaked list of numbers as those targeted by its clients.On July 19, reports revealed that aside from 38 journalists, former Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi, two of his aides, political strategist Prashant Kishor, former election commissioner Ashok Lavasa and Union minister Prahlad Patel were also allegedly hacked. The list also included 11 members of the friends and family, along with the number of the woman who accused former Chief Justice of India Rajan Gogoi of sexual harassment.Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who defended the government in Parliament, was also named as a potential hacking target.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. The government denied any involvement. The opposition, however, has called for a probe into the allegations.Dubey said that there has been a breach of privilege of the house as the issue to be discussed in the meeting “was already out in newspapers” which is a violation against the “directions” laid for the meetings.“The Constitution of India, under article 94…. says that we can bring in a privilege motion against him,” he said , adding that there 17 signatories to this motion.Dubey also appealed the speaker that “until there is no decision on the notice given by him” there should be “no meetings of the said committee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-panel-meet-on-pegasus-put-off-after-bjp-mps-refuse-to-take-part-101627497289549.html
29-07-2021||India||Chaos in House: Oppn MPs tear placards, blow whistle||At least nine Congress leaders tore placards -- they’d brought in these with protest messages on them -- and threw them in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday and an unidentified lawmaker blew a whistle in the Rajya Sabha as a determined Opposition continued its protests against the Pegasus snooping row and the three farm laws, seeking an adjournment motion to discuss the former in the lower house. The government, however, managed to clear a bill each in the two houses, pushing ahead with its legislative agenda after it became clear that the Opposition was keen on not allowing the house to function.Congress MPs Gurjeet Singh Aujla, TN Prathapan, Manickam Tagore, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Hibi Eden, Jothimani Sennimalai, Saptagiri Ulaka, V Vaithilingam, and the Communist Party of India’s AM Ariff have been identified by the authorities as involved in throwing papers on the Chair of the House. Last week, Trinamool Congress MP Shantanu Sen was suspended from Rajya Sabha for the remainder of the session after he snatched papers from IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and tore it in the House.According to a senior official, “the authorities are yet to decide if these Lok Sabha MPs should also be suspended or not.”Some of the MPs involved previously faced suspension for throwing papers at the Chair in March 2020.The government maintained that it is ready for any debate . Information and Broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur later said, “Government is ready for a discussion. If the Opposition (member) snatches the statement from hands of Minister and tears it, and if they throw pieces of paper on the Speaker and a minister replying in the house, then this is not right for democracy,”A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 was passed by the Rajya Sabha while the Insolvency and Backruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill was cleared in the Lok Sabha in flat six minutes.An Opposition leader claimed that a senior government floor manager told them that as there was no sign of normalcy, the government needed to push two bills a day to meet its legislative agenda for the session.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other Opposition leaders jointly submitted an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha for a discussion on the Pegasus snooping controversy in the “presence of the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and/or (Union) Home minister (Amit Shah)”.The motion was submitted after Opposition parties met twice on Tuesday and Wednesday and decided to move it together as part of a united strategy. Representatives of 14 Opposition parties attended the second meeting under Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge’s chairmanship on Wednesday.“Sitting with the entire Opposition is extremely humbling. Amazing experience, wisdom, and insights from everyone present,” Gandhi said.Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress , which could not attend the meeting said his party is with the other Opposition parties.Leaders of 10 Opposition parties earlier met on Tuesday. “...there will be better coordination among all of us as the government does not want to discuss the matter (alleged snooping) at all,’’ said one of the leaders, requesting anonymity.Kharge and Manickam Tagore submitted adjournment motions earlier in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.The Pegasus row erupted on August 18 before the beginning of Parliament’s ongoing monsoon session after an international investigative consortium reported that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen, and journalists were potentially targeted by the Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software Pegasus. A forensic analysis of phones of 10 of the targets in India proved they had been hacked or that there had been attempts to do so.Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the Congress can’t even handle its internal troubles, “but is hell-bent on forcing its views on other Opposition parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chaos-in-house-oppn-mps-tear-placards-blow-whistle-101627497168925.html
29-07-2021||India||Kerala with lowest exposure to Covid-19: Sero-survey||Kerala has had the lowest exposure to Sars-Cov-2, according to true infection estimates based on serological studies, new data by the Union government showed on Wednesday, with only 44% of the population projected to have been infected till early July compared to nearly 67% across the country as a whole.The results, based on the study of how many people had antibodies in a survey involving nearly 29,000 people, appear to explain Kerala’s current high numbers and suggest the state was able to detect true infections better than any other region. The study was carried out by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The overall sero survey results were released last week by the Union government and suggested two out of every three Indians may have been exposed to the virus. If extrapolated, this would mean roughly 900 million people have been infected by the virus; India’s official Covid-19 count on July 10 (when the survey ended) was 30 million.Including Kerala, the states with the three lowest estimated population exposure were Assam (50%) and Maharashtra (58%). The states with the highest exposure were Madhya Pradesh (79%), Rajasthan (76.2%) and Bihar (75.9%).“(The findings) reinforces my point that case numbers mean very little, without sero-surveys to inform what fraction is being detected. This data fits better the severity of the second wave ,” said Anurag Agarwal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB).He added that this also means the second wave will “run longer for Kerala and Maharashtra because of less steep rise”.To be sure, the fourth round of the sero study also included those who received vaccines. While the data released on Wednesday did not give a split between those with natural exposure and those with vaccine-mediated antibodies, the information released last week suggests the latter category accounts for a very small proportion: Of the 67.6% who had antibodies overall, 62% were not vaccinated, officials said at the time.According to experts, current infection trends and the new data by the Union health ministry offer two important insights: Kerala may have the least amount of under-reporting, and it has the most number of vulnerable people at present.“India was able to detect only 1 in 33 cases as of May 31st as estimated from the 4th ICMR serosurvey -- Bihar: 1/134; UP; 1/100; MP: 1/86. Detection was much better in Kerala (1/6) and Maharashtra 1/12). Unfortunately, the fingers keep pointing to MH & KL. For detecting cases better?” wrote Rijo M John, a heath economist, in a post on Twitter.Having antibodies reduces the chances of being infected almost completely, and experts said last week that it could explain why cases have been falling, although they urged caution, pointing to the nearly 400 million people who remain vulnerable to the virus.Kerala’s outbreak followed a similar trajectory as the nationwide second wave. But since around mid-June, the test positivity rate – a key metric that is often a proxy to estimate the size of an outbreak – levelled out at around the 10-12% from the third week of June. At the same time, this metric fell drastically across the country.Taken together with the serology estimates of the true spread, this also means that the virus spread more gradually within Kerala, helping flatten the curve of infections, while it spread rapidly in other parts of the country, where testing as well as treatment facilities where overwhelmed.A second expert said the study findings were not surprising: “Kerala implemented good Covid-appropriate behaviour and strict lockdown since the first wave. The cases went down in places such as Bihar, UP, and Delhi not because people started following Covid-appropriate behaviour but because a significant proportion was already exposed to the infection. What this means is that the second wave will continue in Kerala for a while and high number of new cases will be reported,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, head of the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“Delhi saw over 28,000 cases a day despite a sero-positivity of over 50% during April and May. Just imagine how many cases Kerala may see with such a high proportion of people being susceptible,” he added.In the last two weeks, the number of new cases in the state has risen by 28%, which could partly be due to increased testing – over the same duration, the number of daily tests has gone up by an average of 10%, while the positivity rate has risen by 1.8%. It could also be on account of Covid-inappropriate behaviour, with the state government rashly relaxing restrictions on account of the festival of Bakrid.On Wednesday, the state recorded 22,056 new cases ; on average, the state has added roughly 17,000 new cases over the last seven-day period.The health ministry said on Wednesday that the national survey by ICMR “was designed to capture the extent of the spread of Covid infection at the national level” and urged states to conduct their own sero-prevalence studies in consultation with the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-with-lowest-exposure-to-covid19serosurvey-101627496991048.html
29-07-2021||India||Chhattisgarh govt tables bill to acquire college||Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo on Wednesday introduced a bill for the immediate acquisition of a loss-making privately-run medical college in Durg district, a decision hugely criticised by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that has attributed the move to nepotism, not public interest.As he introduced the Chandulal Chandrakar Memorial Medical College (Acquisition) Bill 2021 in the state assembly on Wednesday, health minister Singh Deo said: “The present owners of the college requested the state government to take over the institute in view of their financial difficulties. It is necessary to take over the medical college immediately in the public interest”.The minister said the acquisition will lead to an annual financial burden of about ₹140 crore.“This is not in the public interest”, said senior BJP legislator and former minister Brijmohan Agrawal in his brief statement.The assembly will discuss the legislation on Thursday.The move turned controversial after it emerged that among those on the board of the medical college set up in memory of veteran Congress leader Chandulal Chandrakar is a member of the joint family into which chief minister Bhupesh Baghel’s daughter is married.Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal has called the proposed acquisition “sheer deceit and misuse of public funds”. BJP MP Rajyavardhan Rathore said it was furthering the “family’s interest on the pretext of public interest”.To be sure, Bhupesh Baghel has rebutted the allegations on Tuesday, insisting that his only aim was to save the medical college and benefit the state’s students. “By acquiring (it), we will save the time to open a new medical college and we will get 150 doctors every year,” the chief minister said.According to the bill, the government will appoint a special officer to conduct a valuation of all the movable and immovable assets of the college. “..the payable amount considering the inevitability of the acquisition would be double of the actual valuation amount,” section 8 of the bill said.The bill said the state will not pay any other amount for the college or shall not be liable to pay towards any liability incurred before the acquisition. The liabilities of the college prior to vesting in the government shall continue to be the liabilities of its former owners and may be recovered from them by the lenders through normal procedures of law, it said. This would include any outstanding dues of its employees as well.A social worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Considering the need to save a medical college, the move to acquire seems noble but the question of nepotism will arise if the valuation of the properties is done on the higher side and the bill provides double of that amount as payment to previous owners.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cgarh-govt-tables-bill-to-acquire-college-101627496929534.html
29-07-2021||India||Buzz over Prashant Kishor’s Congress entry grows||Is the Congress keen to induct election strategist Prashant Kishor into its ranks?And is Kishor, who has spoken of stepping back from his organisation, Indian Political Action Committee, keen to throw in his lot with India’s grand old party?Whispers to the effect have grown louder in Congress circles although neither the party nor Kishor have said anything on the record.Three people familiar with the details of what is happening in the Congress claimed the issue was discussed at a meeting on July 22, chaired by Rahul Gandhi, and attended by key leaders of the Congress Working Committee including AK Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge, KC Venugopal, Kamal Nath and Ambika Soni. All three spoke on condition of anonymity.HT learns that a senior leadership role was being considered for Kishor either within the existing party structure or with a possibility of a new role. HT reported on July 15 that Kishor’s ambitious revival plan for the party, which he has presented to the Gandhis, involves the creation of a parliamentary board, new posts, and an overhaul of how the Congress party operates in every district.One of the people added that the July 22 meeting was to gauge how senior Congress leaders felt about Kishor’s suggestions, which were first made to party president Sonia Gandhi just before the onset of the pandemic last year; the second leader said Sonia Gandhi wanted the consultation before the final decision was taken within the next few days.“There is a willingness to adopt the strategies suggested by Kishor and during consultations, a consensus seems to have evolved,’’ added the second person. “We are optimistic about this because Kishor has said that it is not possible to beat the BJP without the Congress. Secondly, he was the one who approached us.’’His reference is to Kishor’s comments made last month in the context of a third front to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party -- buzz on this has increased since the Trinamool Congress’s victory in West Bengal (Kishor was an advisor to the party) and the strategist’s multiple meetings with the nationalist Congress Party’s Sharad Pawar -- Kishor said he didn’t believe that any third or fourth front could defeat Narendra Modi indicating that the Congress was necessary.There was no official comment emerging from the Congress on the meeting. HT contacted Antony who refused to speak on last Thursday’s meeting while the other leaders were not available. Venugopal said: “It was an informal meeting where we have started discussions about assembly polls that are scheduled for 2022.’’Kishor said he had “no idea about the Congress meeting”.On July 15, HT reported on Kishor’s meeting with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi and his possible role in shaping the national party.. One of the proposals made by Kishor is that Rahul Gandhi should head the new Congress parliamentary board. The creation of such a board, which will consider the party’s stand on key issues, was also one of the key demands of the so-called Group of 23, named after the number of senior leaders who wrote to Sonia Gandhi last year demanding change in how the party worked. In addition to suggestions on changes in the party, Kishor’s plans are also believed to include details on building a possible united front against the BJP, starting with accepting a common opposition candidate in the 2022 Presidential elections (NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s name was mentioned in this context and it is a fact that Kishor has met him thrice in the past month).It still isn’t clear whether the party and the strategist will take the plunge.There are concerns on both fronts.For the Congress, this stems from wariness over Kishor’s style of functioning -- he is believed to value autonomy. For Kishor, it’s the fear of a repeat of 2017 where he worked as a consultant with the alliance between Samajwadi Party and the Congress which ended in disaster.“Prashant Kishor joining the Congress would lead to an important strategist being in the party. Let’s remember that Kishor earlier joined the JDU and it was a bumpy journey. What is critical is how he can reshape the Congress and how the Congress leaders and workers will accept him,’’ said political scientist Sandeep Shastri.In September 2018, Kishor joined the Janata Dal United , with which he worked in the 2015 Bihar polls, as vice-president before exiting in February, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buzz-over-kishor-s-cong-entry-grows-101627496748946.html
29-07-2021||India||No immunity to MLAs, MPs from criminal law: SC rejects Kerala govt plea||Legislators do not have immunity from criminal law for acts of vandalism or destruction of public property inside state assemblies or in parliament, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday, clearing the decks for the prosecution of some of Kerala’s sitting and former MLAs who threw furniture and destroyed computers and microphones during a House proceeding in 2015.It also said that in this case, there is no need for the sanction of the speaker of the assembly to prosecute the legislators.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah underlined that privileges and immunities to the legislators under the Constitution “are not gateways to claim exemptions from the general law of the land, particularly, as in this case, the criminal law which governs the action of every citizen.”It held that any attempt to claim an exemption from the application of criminal law would be betraying the trust impressed on the character of elected representatives as the makers and enactors of the law. “No member of an elected legislature can claim either a privilege or an immunity to stand above the sanctions of the criminal law, which applies equally to all citizens,” said the bench, rejecting a plea by the Kerala government to let it drop the criminal charges against two sitting and four former MLAs.The Kerala government, through senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, sought to protect the six accused, who were MLAs of the Left Democratic Front (the opposition then) at the time of the incident in March 2015, by citing immunity granted to the members of the House under Article 194(1) of the Constitution and their right to protest. Senior advocate Jaideep Gupta appeared for some of the accused as he defended the state government’s decision to withdraw the prosecution. The lawyers asked for setting aside a Kerala high court judgment of March and let off the six accused , KT Jaleel, V Sivankutty, CK Sadasivan, EP Jayarajan, K Ajith and Kunjammadu Master.But the bench rejected their submissions, emphasising that the privileges and immunity given to legislators inside the House was to create an environment in which they could perform their functions and discharge their duties freely and cannot be construed as a mark of status that made legislators stand on an unequal pedestal.“The persons who have been named as the accused in the FIR in the present case held a responsible elected office as MLAs in the Legislative Assembly. In the same manner as any other citizen, they are subject to the boundaries of lawful behaviour set by criminal law. No member of an elected legislature can claim either a privilege or an immunity to stand above the sanctions of the criminal law, which applies equally to all citizens,” said the court.Soon after the apex court’s order, the opposition parties in Kerala stepped up pressure for the resignation of state education minister V Sivankutty, who is one of the six accused.However, the ruling party defended the minister, saying he will face the trial as the apex court did not get into the merit of the case. “It is not the final verdict. All accused will face the trial,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.It added: “An alleged act of destruction of public property within the House by the members to lodge their protest against the presentation of the budget cannot be regarded as essential for exercising their legislative functions. The actions of the members have trodden past the line of constitutional means, and is thus not covered by the privileges guaranteed under the Constitution.”The court cited previous judgments of the Supreme Court to underscore that privileges to legislators under Articles 105 (for MPs) and 194 would be confined to only such privileges essential for undertaking their legislative functions such as discussions, debates, resolutions and voting.“Acts of destruction of public property are not privileged under the first limb of Article 194(2). Consequently, acts of vandalism cannot be said to be manifestations of the freedom of speech and be termed as ‘proceedings’ of the assembly,” it noted.Shooting down the Kerala government’s argument on protest inside the House being a manifestation of free speech, the court said: “It was not the intention of the drafters of the Constitution to extend the interpretation of ‘freedom of speech’ to include criminal acts by placing them under a veil of protest. Hence, the Constitution only grants the members the freedom of speech that is necessary for their active participation in meaningful deliberation without any fear of prosecution.”Committing acts of destruction of public property, said the bench, could not be equated with either the freedom of speech in the legislature or with forms of protest legitimately available to the members of the opposition.“To allow the prosecution to be withdrawn in the face of these allegations, in respect of which upon investigation a final report has been submitted under Section 173 of the CrPC and cognizance has been taken, would amount to an interference with the normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons. Such an action is clearly extraneous to the vindication of the law to which all organs of the executive are bound,” it held.The bench also highlighted that permitting withdrawal of prosecution would only result in a singular result; that the elected representatives were exempt from the mandate of criminal law and this could not be countenanced as being in aid of the broad ends of public justice.It said that the recognition that there shall be freedom of speech in parliament and the state legislatures were as much a matter of duty and trust as they were of a right inhering in the representatives, who got chosen by the people.The court affirmed the decisions of the judicial magistrate and the Kerala high court in dismissing the plea for withdrawal of prosecution against the six accused, saying the prosecution’s application was based on a “misconception that elected members of the legislature stand above the general application of criminal law.”It has also held that there was no requirement of a sanction by the Speaker of the House for prosecuting the legislators since Kerala had enacted no provisions warranting the prior sanction of the Speaker. The court further said that no immunity could be claimed against the video-recording of the alleged incident since the recording was not published by private TV channels under the authority of the House.After the apex court’s verdict, the accused shall face charges under Sections 425 (mischief), 427 (mischief causing damage to property) and 447 (criminal trespass) of the IPC and under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Damage of Public Property Act. The maximum punishment under these charges is five years in jail, besides a fine.Senior advocate V Giri said, “With this judgment there is clarity now that members of legislatures will have to face the law for committing criminal acts inside the House. The Court has held that Legislature is a public place and assaulting the Speaker, destroying public property are plain offences, against which no state can withdraw prosecution. MPs and MLAs have other ways to show protest by raising slogans and staging walkout and the judgment makes it clear that any act of vandalism will not go unpunished.”(Ramesh Babu in Thiruvananthapuram contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-immunity-to-mlas-mps-from-criminal-law-sc-rejects-kerala-govt-plea-101627496568922.html
29-07-2021||India||HC raps Twitter over non-compliance with new IT rules||The Delhi high court on Wednesday pulled up micro-blogging site Twitter for appointing a “contingent worker” as its Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) and gave it “a last opportunity” to “wholeheartedly” comply with the new Information Technology (IT) Rules.Justice Rekha Palli said that it was “unacceptable” that the social media intermediary has not specified the third-party contractor via whom the services of the CCO and the RGO have been taken. The court also expressed displeasure on the delay of appointment of nodal contact officer (NCO).Under Rule 3 of the IT Rules introduced on February 25, a social media intermediary was required to put in place a three-tier grievance redressal system and appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person and a resident grievance officer by May 25.Twitter, in an affidavit filed on July 13, told the court that it has appointed an Indian resident as the CCO and RGO whose services were taken via a third party contractor. They would perform their functions and duties as per applicable law, it said adding that it would require two weeks to appoint a nodal contact officer (NCO) through a third party.Twitter asked for eight weeks to appoint the CCO, RGO and NCO as a direct employee and on a permanent basis.“I have a problem with the word ‘contingent worker’ because it gives the impression that it is based on some contingency. You are not using interim, but you are using a contingent. It is even worse. We do not know who this third party contractor is. I am not happy with this affidavit anyway,” Justice Palli said.“I don’t know what your company wants to do. If you have to comply, it has to be done whole-heartedly. You have not specified the timeline by which the nodal contact officer will be appointed,” the court said.The judge, while rejecting Twitter’s affidavit, said that it showed “total non compliance with the rules” and gave one week to file their fresh stance on the compliance of the IT Rules.“Last opportunity is given to file a better affidavit clearly setting out the details of the person who is stated to have been appointed as the CCO and RGO. Twitter will also give reasons why NCO was not appointed till now and by when could he be appointed,” the court noted in its order.“Twitter continues to make every effort to comply with the new IT Rules 2021. We are committed to keeping the honourable court and the Government of India apprised of the progress at every step of the process,”Twitter said in a statement.The case deals with a plea by a lawyer Amit Acharya, who through his counsel Akash Vajpai, contended that Information Technology Rules came into effect from February 25 and Union government gave three months to every social media intermediary, including Twitter, to comply with them.However, even after the lapse of three-month period on May 25, no resident grievance officer was appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform, due which, he could not take action against two alleged offensive tweets by TMC MP Mohua Moitra and journalist Swati Chaturvedi, Acharya contended through a petition filed on May 28.Twitter responded saying that the tweets in question were not offensive according to its policies.In an affidavit on May 31, Twitter claimed it had already appointed a RGO on May 28. Subsequently, on July 6, the court pulled up Twitter for not informing it that this appointment was on an interim basis, and not sharing information that the person resigned shortly after the appointment. Twitter was given time till July 8 to inform the court on the status of the appointments. And then, on July 8, it was given time till July 13 to file a copy of an affidavit on the appointments. The court also asked the person appointed as the resident grievance officer as well as the chief compliance officer, Vinay Prakash to file his own affidavit, also by July 13.Both of those came up for discussion on Wednesday.“The word ‘interim’ had been employed earlier to denote that the three roles, as of now, are or were not being filled by employees, but by contingent or other workers, and that Respondent No. 2 (Twitter) is endeavoring to make offers of employment for all the three roles. This having been clarified, the word ‘interim’ will not be used anymore,” Twitter said in its July 13 affidavit.On Wednesday, senior advocate Sajjan Poovaya, appearing for the social media intermediary, told the court that on July 27, they have verbally appointed a nodal contact officer but formal paperwork and announcement are yet to be done.However, the court said that mere appointment of the officers as “contingent workers” is “not acceptable”.“This is not in compliance that you have appointed a contingent worker. When you file something, it should be completely clear....This is not acceptable. I will have the matter after one week or 10 days. I am giving you a long rope but please don’t expect the court to go on and on,” the court said.It also said that there should be “seriousness” with the post of the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) who under Rule 4 (1) (a) of the IT Rules, 2021 holds a key managerial personnel or a senior employee.“You have appointed Mr Vinay Prakash who is 31 years old. He (in his affidavit) in fact is very categoric that ‘I am not an employee and have been engaged as a contingent worker’. So, this in itself is in the teeth of the rule,” the court said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Centre, said that there has been an “absolute abject non-compliance” of the IT Rules on part of Twitter. He said that the nodal contact person has yet not been appointed and “we are hunting for that man”.“It has been months since they were to comply. The Union and everybody is before a constitutional court but they cannot have it so easy. Either they comply wholeheartedly or they say ‘we are not complying’,” Sharma said, adding that the company earned $7 million dollars in 2019 from India.The counsel for the petitioner raised objections on the appointments and said that one person cannot hold more than one position as different officers would have different functions.Twitter, through its lawyer, sought time to address the issues raised by the court following which the matter was posted for hearing on August 6.Centre and Twitter have been locking horns over the compliance of the IT Rules. Twitter had said it was committed to India as a vital market, but criticised the new IT rules and regulations that it said, “inhibit free, open public conversation”.Responding to Twitter’s comments, the Centre had said the messaging platform was levelling baseless and false allegations to defame India and dictating terms to the world’s largest democracy. The Centre has said that only WhatsApp and Facebook have complied with the guidelines of appointing three separate officers for the grievance redressal.The ministry has asserted that the social media firm has failed to comply with the guidelines, which can result in it losing the safe harbor protection granted to intermediaries under the IT Act.Twitter, in turn, has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police. There have been several instances of confrontation between the social media firm and the government over orders to block access to content and marking of posts by BJP leaders as manipulated media.On July 22, the union government had informed the Rajya Sabha that even though Twitter was non-compliant of the IT Rules till May 26, it had subsequently appointed an RGO and CCO and submitted its first compliance report in June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-raps-twitter-over-non-compliance-with-new-it-rules-101627496509551.html
29-07-2021||India||CM Mamata stresses on Oppn unity for ’24 polls||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday repeatedly emphasised on forging a broader pact among Opposition parties for the 2024 national elections, throwing her weight and political capital behind an ambitious project of bringing together different forces opposed to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“When (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi will fight his next election, it will be an India vs Modi battle,” she declared.Banerjee met Congress president Sonia Gandhi at the latter’s residence and the two leaders, accompanied by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, discussed the possibilities of different parties coming together to take on the mighty BJP. Later, she met Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.Describing the 45-minute-long meeting with Sonia Gandhi as “positive”, Banerjee said, “Soniaji had invited me for a cup of tea. We discussed the political situation in the country. We also discussed the issue of opposition unity.”Banerjee, who came to Delhi on July 26, has been meeting a series of Opposition leaders. She made it clear that the aim was to secure more space for regional parties and sounded hopeful that parties averse to the Congress can join this ambitious pact.“I maintain good relationship with Jagan Mohan Reddy, Navin Patnaik and Arvind Kejriwal. If not today, they can always come (with us) tomorrow. If there is a political storm, it is difficult to contain,” she said.She also set aside speculations of any leadership position for her in this possible dispensation. Describing her as a LIP (less important person), Banerjee announced her popular poll slogan “Khela Hobe” (game on) will continue and even coined “Hope 24”, as if the countdown for the next polls has already started.She maintained that the leadership issue will depend on situation, structure and system. “It is not that everybody can take the lead. We can work together,” Banerjee quipped.She even kept the door open for her erstwhile arch-rival, Communist Party of India (Marxist). “CPI(M) has its own problems. They have to decide who is their first enemy, is it BJP or Trinamool,” she said“Look how popular Modi was when he came to power in 2014. But now people are angry with him. People saw dead bodies floating in the river, will they still support him?” she said, referring to reports during the second Covid-19 wave of dead bodies floating in the Ganga in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.“Wealth wise, BJP is very strong. But opposition will also be very strong politically. If all regional parties come together, it will be stronger than one party rule,” the West Bengal CM added.Banerjee has already met senior Congress leaders such as Kamal Nath, Anand Sharma, Abhishek Singhvi, and had a telephonic conversation with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav. She is expected to meet Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday,The Bengal CM, who defeated the BJP in assembly elections in May, lashed out at the Modi government for not responding to questions raised by Opposition over allegations that politicians, activists and journalists were potentially targeted by Pegasus spyware.“The government can order an enquiry by a sitting judge. If you raise an issue, they don’t care. In democracy, you have to respond to what others say. Why is government not taking suo motu action in Pegasus controversy? In every other matter, they immediately send CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] or ED [Enforcement Directorate]. All institutions are full of BJP’s own people. They give reports based on what the BJP party offices say,” she said.On July 26, the West Bengal government announced a probe into the Pegasus row, becoming the first state to do so. Former Supreme court judge, justice (retd) Madan Lokur and former Calcutta high court chief justice, justice (retd) Jyotirmay Bhattacharya comprise the probe panel.Indian polity has seen several non-BJP, non-Congress formations gain power at the Centre, especially in the heyday of coalition politics in the 90s, but in recent years, such third front formations have been short-lived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-stresses-on-oppn-unity-for-24-polls-101627496510216.html
29-07-2021||India||16 dead after rain fury lashes hills||Gushing torrents of water triggered by torrential showers in the hills of northern India flattened villages, washed away roads and cut off remote villages on Wednesday, killing at least 16 people with 30 others either injured or missing.Authorities reported two separate cloudburst incidents – when one station receives 10cm or more of rainfall in an hour -- in J&K’s Kishtwar district on Wednesday morning and Himachal Pradesh’s Lahaul-Spiti on Tuesday night.Flash floods were reported from three states-- Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and J&K -- with experts linking the devastating downpours to climate change. Heavy rainfall across north India threw life off gear, inundating cities, marooning crop fields and even damaging a power plant in Kargil.“Central government is closely monitoring the situation in the wake of the cloudbursts in Kishtwar and Kargil. All possible assistance is being made available in the affected areas. I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Union home minister Amit Shah spoke to senior officials and said teams from the National Disaster Response Force were on the spot. “Our priority is saving lives,” he said.JAMMU AND KASHMIR Around 4am on Wednesday, a torrent of water gushed downstream and caught around 100 residents of Honzar village in Kishtwar district unaware. Many of them were still sleeping when the water marooned their village and swept their homes into the stream.Additional director general of police Mukesh Singh said seven people died and 17 were rescued. “Six were critically injured and shifted to Kishtwar district hospital,” he said. At least 26 people were still missing.Singh said the deluge damaged 19 houses and 21 cowsheds. “Army is assisting local police is the rescue operations,” he said.A separate cloudburst later in the day triggered flash floods near the Amarnath shrine. No loss of life was reported.HIMACHAL PRADESH Nine people died and seven reported missing in two separate flash floods in Kullu and Lahaul-Spiti districts, officials of the state disaster management authority said.A cloudburst flooded Tozing Nullah and washed away two tents of labourers and a JCB machine in Lahaul and Spiti district on Tuesday evening, said deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar. Eight people were killed.State disaster management director Sudesh Mokhta said a landslide near Kirting village of Lahaul sub-division blocked state highway number 26, leaving 50 vehicles stranded. Another landslide occurred on the highway at Hawai Mod near Kukumseri village. Landslides also block the Leh-Manali highway.In Chamba, a JCB helper was killed in flash floods. Five others were missing. In Kullu, a 25-year-old woman and her four-year-old son were swept away by gushing river waters.In two simultaneous cloudbursts on Tuesday evening, a mini power plant was badly damaged in Kargil area of the union territory of Ladakh.UTTARAKHAND Heavy rainfall led to several landslides and traffic snags across the state. In Almora district, a home guard jawan was swept away by an overflowing water stream on Wednesday morning. Low-lying parts of state capital Dehradun were inundated.Tourists were also stopped from going to the popular tourist spot of Kempty Falls near Mussoorie.The Dehradun centre of the India Meteorological Department said the state on Wednesday witnessed “moderate rainfall with heavy to very heavy rainfall” and the monsoon is expected to remain active over the state for next few days. “The rainfall in state is above normal in July with excess rain in June,” said Bikram Singh, director of IMD Dehradun centre said.Heavy showers were recorded in the national capital region, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand and bihar. The IMD predicted heavy rainfall across northern India and several areas of Madhya Maharashtra, Kokan and Goa for the next two days.July had witnessed several incidents of cloudburst and mini-cloudburst, where 50mm to 60mm rainfall takes places in a short duration. Both lead to sudden spurt of water in catchment areas of monsoon streams leading to massive landslides and movement of boulders in fast flowing water. Last Sunday, heavy rainfall and landslides killed nine tourists in Himachal Pradesh’s Kinnaur district.The data collected by governments in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand show a gradual increase in cloudburst incidents, which officials in the two states attribute to devastation of hilly forests for development and horticulture, apart from the impact of climate change on rainfall patterns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-dead-after-rain-fury-lashes-hills-101627496448952.html
29-07-2021||India||Sharp rise in cloudbursts due to climate crisis, say experts||At least seven people died and many more were reported missing on Wednesday after a cloudburst caused flash floods in Jammu’s Kishtwar district. Nine people died and seven reported missing in two separate flash floods in Kullu and Lahaul-Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh, officials of the state disaster management authority said on Wednesday. Last week, several parts of Konkan reported what scientists termed mini-cloudbursts leading to flooding of rivers, damage to infrastructure and the death of at least 100 people. And at least 10 cars were washed away when a flash flood triggered by a suspected cloudburst swept through Bhagsunag locality near McLeodganj in Himachal Pradesh on July 12.This monsoon has seen a spate of cloudbursts and mini cloudbursts over the Western Himalayas and the west coast revealing the deadly, unpredictable face of monsoon rains. There has been a sharp increase in cloudburst incidents in the past few years according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), although the agency has not conducted an analysis of cloudburst incidents specifically but observed trends from media reports and data on heavy and extremely heavy rainfall events that it documents.A cloudburst is when 10 cm or more rainfall is recorded at one station in one hour according to IMD. “When moisture availability is very high large deep clouds develop and the droplets, they form can be both big and very high in number. Cloud efficiency can go up in many cases leading to cloudburst incidents,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.He added that it was likely their numbers were increasing. “We know that incidence of heavy rainfall events is going up, and along with that cloudburst numbers are also likely to be increasing as an impact of climate change.”It is very difficult to predict a cloudburst because of its very small scale in space and time. To even nowcast such events, experts said, IMD may require a very dense radar network in cloudburst prone areas such as the Western Himalayas. Nowcasts are predictions of the present or the very near future.“IMD has about 150 weather stations from where hourly rain data can be accessed. But all regions are not covered. IMD has no specific analysis on cloudbursts. Overall higher water vapour availability due to climate change may have led to a rise in cloudbursts,” Rajeevan explained.There has been a rise in short span high intensity rain occurrences (mini cloud bursts) along the west coast of India and along the foothills of Western Himalayas between 1969 and 2015 according to “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region,” a report by the union ministry of earth sciences published last year.Scientists have also said even if heavy rainfall events don’t meet the exact criteria defined, but cause extensive damage such as flash floods and landslides in high altitude areas, they should also be considered cloudburst events. A paper authored by including those from scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology titled ‘Statistical characteristics of cloud burst and mini-cloud burst events during monsoon season in India’ published in International Journal of Climatology categorised cloudbursts in to three categories.The first, CBa events are associated with heavy rainfall in the mountainous regions of Himalayas identified based on flash floods and damage to properties and human losses, irrespective of the rainfall amount.The second, CBb events are associated with rainfall in excess of 10 cm per hour as per the definition of IMD.The third, are mini-cloudbursts (MCBs), where the rainfall in two consecutive rain-hours is 5 cm or more. MCBs typically occur in June over the Western Ghats;and in July and August over central India and the foothills of Himalayas. Trend analyses indicate significant increase in these events at many places, except over northeast India, the paper said.“We know that these incidents both in plains and hills are being reported frequently. This year they have been reported in Mumbai and Konkan region. In 2019 also there were several cloudburst incidents. Since they cannot be predicted people need to be better prepared during monsoon months. In 2005 Santacruz in Mumbai reported 38 cm rain in 3 hours. It was clearly a CB led flooding. Something similar had happened in 2013 in Uttarakhand also. They have a potential for extensive damage of life and property,” said a co-author of the IITM paper who asked not to be named.“Cloudburst events were not common in Kerala though Kerala records monsoon days with moderate continuous kind of rain spanning through the day. But in recent years we are seeing some changes in cloud structure. We did an assessment of 2018 and 2019 floods in Kerala. While the 2018 floods saw more continuous kind of rain, during 2019 we saw very deep clouds up to 12 to 14 km which is not common here. When such clouds form after a long dry spell over a region, they bring an extremely intense downpour in a few hours. They probably develop because the thermal potential is very high but they can cause very severe damage in Kerala and the Konkan region,” explained S Abhilash, director, Advanced Centre for Academic Radar Research (ACARR) at Cochin University of Science and Technology.Mumbai’s Santacruz and Colaba recorded extremely heavy rainfall, 23.4 cm and 19.68 cm rain on July 17 and 18 in the span of five to six hours triggering urban flooding and devastation.“We need a dense rain gauge network and hourly rain data to document all cloud burst and mini cloudburst events. We know from media reports that this year the number of such events may be higher than usual, but the exact figure is not there. Several such events have occurred this year in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre of IMD.While cloudburst incidents are less likely to be captured in IMD’s grided dataset, this data does show an increase in heavy and extreme rainfall events. Rainfall of 35.5 mm to 244.5 mm in a 24-hour period in a grid (box bound by two latitudes and longitudes 0.25 degrees apart) is classified as heavy, while that above 244.5 mm is classified as extreme. Average heavy and extreme rainfall during the June-September monsoon season was 376.5 mm in the 2011-2020 decade, compared to 363.4 mm in the long period average or the average of such rainfall in the 1961-2010 period. This amounts to a 3.63% increase. In comparison rainfall of lesser intensity than heavy or extreme rain has increased only 0.35% compared to the LPA. A district-wise analysis shows that heavy and extreme rainfall has increased more in the peninsular and north-western regions of the country.(Abhishek Jha contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharp-rise-in-cloudbursts-due-to-climate-crisis-say-experts-101627496388896.html
29-07-2021||India||Assam, Mizoram to pull back forces; CRPF to guard stretch||Assam and Mizoram, which clashed over a border dispute on July 26, will withdraw their police forces and central paramilitary troops will be deployed in the four-km disputed stretch, which will function as a sort of no man’s land, till a permanent solution is found, according to an interim agreement reached by both states during talks held in Delhi.The decision was taken at a meeting called by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday to mediate between the sparring states, people familiar with the development said.The police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle in southern Assam on July 26, in which six Assam policemen and a civilian died. Assam claimed Mizoram police opened fire on Assam’s forces who objected to a road being constructed by Mizoram on a patch of forested land it claims. Mizoram claims the land belongs to it.Wednesday’s meeting was attended by Assam chief secretary Jishnu Baruah and director-general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta and their Mizoram counterparts Lalnunmawia Chuaungo and SBK Singh, apart from the director-general of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Kuldiep Singh.The four-km stretch on which central forces will be deployed runs between Vairengte on the Mizoram side and Lailapur in south Assam, along National Highway 306.Both states decided to withdraw their police personnel from the stretch and “agreed to continue discussions mutually to resolve the border issue in an amicable manner”, an MHA officer said.Barua told reporters after the meeting that “paramilitary forces will take overVairengte border. The process of withdrawal of state police is being worked out”.Mizoram officials, in the meeting, admitted to opening fire on Assam policemen and “offered their condolences”, but insisted Assam police breached the borders, according to a second official aware of the development.Chuanungo said the situation was currently peaceful at the border. “We will try to maintain peace. There is no point indulging in violence. (Our) forces are being withdrawn from the area”.MHA officials said they would continue to facilitate talks and monitor the ground situation.The CRPF already has five companies (around 500 personnel) deployed there while two more companies are on standby. This will be a rare instance where it functions as a border force; it will also be a rare instance where a patch of no man’s land has been created, albeit temporarily, within the country.Assam and Mizoram were talking through their chief secretaries in a Centre-chaperoned dialogue process to douse interstate border tensions before police forces of the two northeastern states fatally clashed on July 26, shocking the country.One round of talks in the national capital was held on July 8, a third official aware of the development said. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, too, told the media on Tuesday, while putting out his version of the dispute, that the talks failed at the final stage of a proposed memorandum of understanding.The official cited above said the talks between the two sides were focussed on some kind of “status quo ante”, which refers to a return to earlier positions. The process failed because differences persisted over what should be the point of the status quo ante, the person said.Assam proposed a satellite-based mapping of the disputed interstate border, a proposal that found its way into a draft memorandum of understanding, while Mizoram proposed chief secretary-level talks monitored by the Centre.“My proposal to him (Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga) was that we will carry out satellite photography of the borders. In the talks, Assam said that whatever is the status quo situation, be that on May 10 or six months ago or as on date, we should maintain status quo on the border as determined through satellite mapping,” Sarma said in one of his several media briefings on Tuesday.The border dispute has its roots in how Assam was carved up to form other states in the region. Mizoram, which became a state 1987, was once part of Assam. Specifically, the contested area is claimed by Mizoram on the basis of a 1875 demarcation by the British, while Assam claims it on the basis of a 1933 one, also by the British.In his version of the events, Assam chief minister Sarma said the draft memorandum of understanding would have gone through had Mizoram agreed to sign off on it.The Mizoram government has claimed that Assam has blocked National Highway 306 and other roads connecting the state with other parts of the country to cut off supplies.In a letter to union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday, Mizoram also accused “unknown miscreants” from Assam of destroying railway tracks and lines at Mohammedpur and Ramnathpur railway stations in Hailakandi district of Assam, due to which only railway line connecting Bairabi railway station in Mizoram has been blocked.“Assam has been indulging in the practice of imposing economic blockade merely because of the fact that main supply routes i.e. national highway and railways are passing through the state,” the letter, written by Mizoram’s home department Secretary Lalbiaksangi, stated.It sought Centre’s intervention in immediate removal of blockade by Assam as it was “affecting the livelihood of the people of Mizoram adversely”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mizoram-to-pull-back-forces-crpf-to-guard-stretch-101627495968856.html

As per SEBI’s Prohibition of Insider Trading Rules, 2015, the husband-wife duo had to reveal this transaction to the company within two days in case it surpassed ₹10 lakh value. The SEBI stated that the disclosures associated with the 2015 transaction were made only in 2019 despite the value exceeding ₹2.5 crore each, according to the Moneycontrol report.This comes amid Mumbai Esplanade court refusing to grant bail to Kundra, who was remanded to police custody for 14 days till July 27 on Tuesday, in connection to alleged creation of pornographic films. He was apprehended on July 19 along with 10 others on charges related to the matter that is being probed by Mumbai Police Crime Branch.Also Read | Raj Kundra's bail plea rejected by Esplanade Court; 'Is he a terrorist,' asks lawyerThe 45-year-old businessman has been charged with cheating and for indecent and obscene advertisements under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

29-07-2021||India||Chandrayaan-3 launch likely in third quarter of 2022: Govt||India is likely to launch its third lunar mission Chandrayaan-3 in the third quarter of next year because the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the fabrication of the spacecraft, Union minister of state for the department of space Jitendra Singh told Parliament in a written response (CHECK). The tentative schedule is based on the assumption that work will proceed apace and normally henceforth, Singh added.Chandrayaan-3 was planned to demonstrate India’s capability of soft landing on a celestial body, with the rover then communicating with Earth via the existing orbiter from Chandrayaan-2. The orbiter has an estimated lifespan of seven years. The third mission was announced months after the Vikram lander aboard Chandrayaan-2 crash-landed on the lunar surface just 2.1 km from its destination in September 2019. Chandrayaan- 3 was initially scheduled for late 2020 or early 2021, but the disruption caused by the pandemic affected the schedule.“The realisation of Chandrayaan-3 involves various processes, including finalisation of configuration, subsystem realisation (manufacturing), integration, spacecraft-level detailed testing and a number of special tests to evaluate the systems performance on Earth. The realisation process was hampered due to Covid-19 pandemic,” Singh said in his response. On Monday, Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chief K Sivan told news agency PTI that the first uncrewed mission planned for December as part of the human space flight programme Gaganyaan would be delayed because of Covid-19, which had caused a disruption in the delivery of key components. Before the second wave of the pandemic in April-May, Isro finished manufacturing the propulsion system for Chandrayaan -3 and started tests on it. The lander and propulsion systems were being integrated and several tests were planned for the middle of the year. A successful moon landing would have made India the fourth country in the world to land a rocket on the moon after the US, the erstwhile USSR, and China, and the first to have landed close to the lunar South Pole.“There were several big-ticket missions planned for 2020 and 2021; many commercial missions too. Now all the missions are getting pushed and it will have an impact on the image of India’s space mission internationally. We haven’t been able to successfully create a bio-bubble like China and US that have been carrying out missions through the pandemic,” said Ajay Lele, senior fellow working on space security and strategic technologies at Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. “As for the commercial launches like the maiden flight of the small satellite launch vehicle, many customers have already booked slots for their satellites but if the missions keep on getting delayed, they might move towards other launch providers. As for the scientific missions, the delay there can cost us valuable observations. There was a gap of eleven years between the first and the second lunar mission; meaning we have to wait that long to reconfirm findings from previous mission. We have already missed three launch windows for a follow-up Mars mission and we will miss the next one in 2022 as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrayaan3-to-be-launched-in-third-quarter-of-2022govt-101627458750281.html
29-07-2021||Today's||Cognitive bias explains the inconsistent citizen response to Covid-19||In India, the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was devastating. People were hospitalised with severe illness, and many lost loved ones. It was distressing to watch, in disbelief and agony, patients being denied their right to breathe, with the constant fear that any one of us could be next. People expressed their concerns about how the State and the health system failed us, all while wondering what could have been done to save more lives.With the second wave receding and the number of daily cases on the decline, lockdowns and curbs have been lifted in many states. This, naturally, has led to an increase in social interactions and travel. Market places and hill tourist destinations are being thronged by people. Viral videos and photographs have emerged of people making merry, with no masks on.As images of those gasping for air fade from people’s memories, how has citizen behaviour flip-flopped to disregarding Covid-19-appropriate behaviour such as ensuring physical distancing and wearing masks? Why is the fear of the virus ebbing?Also Read | Study highlights psychological consequences of Covid-19 on healthcareThe inconsistent response to the threat of Covid-19 may be related to a systematic error in thinking known as cognitive bias. Cognitive biases affect our everyday lives, choices and actions. They occur as a result of the brain prioritising simplified information processing. Because people’s capacity for reasoning is limited, cognitive biases work as shortcuts — rule of thumb — that lead to relatively speedy decisions as the brain makes sense of what’s happening.Many cognitive biases are likely at play here. Evidence of the confirmation bias, a type of cognitive bias, is people selectively favouring news stories that confirm a drop in new infections and lifting of curbs, as a sign of a reduced threat of Covid-19.Similarly, the optimistic bias, another type of cognitive bias, may lead people to believe that they are less likely to suffer from the misfortune of falling sick like others. These biases are likely to distract people from taking precautions, and, thereby, influence recklessness.This is also the second year of the pandemic. People are tired. Fear, an adaptive emotional response to a threat or danger, can feel burdensome when it is tentative and continuous, because of which it is insufficient to motivate wise choices. The constant stress of illness, financial losses, layoffs, the disruption caused to children’s education, and crucially, deaths, along with the forced physical separation from friends and family have led to widespread emotional exhaustion, which is being called Covid-fatigue.Covid fatigue, also called behavioural fatigue, pandemic fatigue, or adherence fatigue has gained currency as an explanatory framework. It explains the tendency of people to become naturally tired of preventive rules and guidance. This fatigue may make people less motivated to adhere to these rules over time.The World Health Organization acknowledges the complex nature of pandemic fatigue and recommends four key strategies to maintain and reinvigorate public support for protective behaviours. First, design effective policies and interventions based on evidence tailored for people. Second, allow people to live their lives, while reducing risk. Third, acknowledge and address the hardships faced by people. Last, and most importantly, engage citizens as part of the solution. Community role models can be engaged to help encourage preventive behaviours.Until a significant percentage of people is double-vaccinated, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as avoiding crowded places and rigorous mask etiquette are of utmost importance. While individual responsibility to mitigate the risk of infection is high, people’s fluctuating fear of the virus, pandemic fatigue, and a lackadaisical approach in following preventive behaviour must be understood, acknowledged, and addressed. Rules related to Covid-19-preventive behaviour cannot be broken. A reinvigorated effort is needed to remind the public of the enormity of this disease.Payal S Kapoor is associate professor, FORE School of Management, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/cognitive-bias-explains-the-inconsistent-citizen-response-to-covid19-101627555135140.html
29-07-2021||Today's||The politics and ethics of surveillance||Long before Narendra Modi held sway, there were the omnipotent Nehru-Gandhis. In his book, Open secrets, India intelligence unveiled, former Intelligence Bureau joint director MK Dhar writes of Indira Gandhi ordering snooping on her daughter-in-law Maneka Gandhi and reveals how Rajiv Gandhi’s government was spying on President Giani Zail Singh, forcing him to conduct all personal meetings in Rashtrapati Bhavan’s verdant Mughal Gardens and not in his office.So why the fuss, argue Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters, over unverified allegations that the central government was hacking mobile phones using Israeli spyware. Well, because not only is the typical whataboutery a lamentable alibi that rationalises possible illegal acts, but it fails to recognise crucial differences between snooping then and hacking now.In a previous time, the tracking was less intrusive and limited in scope: The jasoos (detective) assigned to follow a target was a visible entity who could be held accountable when caught. If a landline was bugged, the recorded conversations were not a 24x7 trail. But now, when the smartphone is an intimate and inseparable extension of mind and body, the dangers of hacking the phone involve a near total compromise of a person’s life and work. And with a shadowy, military-graded Pegasus-like technology infiltrating the phone in real time, where does one even begin fixing accountability?The Pegasus investigation claims that at least 300 phones in India were seen as potential targets for hacking. Truth is, even one person’s phone being hacked constitutes a prima facie unlawful act unless there is a compelling national security threat at stake. When the scale reaches the point where it allegedly covers political rivals, Union ministers, journalists, judges, human rights activists, election commissioners, businessmen, even scientists, then there is reason to believe that it isn’t just individual privacy rights that are being violated, but constitutional democracy itself is being disfigured.Also Read | Tokyo 2020: The Sun rises in the pool, againAnd yet, the government has chosen to brazen it out with denials, a refusal to debate the issue in Parliament or allow a court-monitored probe. Why? Primarily because a brute parliamentary majority has convinced the political leadership that its dominance can’t be challenged by a weak Opposition and any noise inside Parliament isn’t going to have an echo effect outside it.Moreover, the absence of greater civil society indignation suggests an ominous normalisation of hacking and its likely consequences. It reveals a disturbing willingness to acquiesce in governmental actions which, if proven true, reveal a criminal abuse of power.It is this numbing of the collective conscience of the Indian middle class that the government is counting on to tide over the Pegasus crisis. At one level, the passivity reflects the preoccupations of a majority of the population. In an extraordinary period of Covid-19 and economic hardship, a hacking controversy may not resonate. Somehow, the right to privacy doesn’t seem to register as strongly as other personal freedoms.At another level, the mixed response mirrors the hyper-polarised times in which public opinion is more sharply divided than ever before. With the prime minister elevated into a cult-like figure by his vast army of supporters, any criticism of his leadership is instantly targeted as “anti-national”. Not surprisingly, the BJP has described the hacking allegations as a “foreign conspiracy” by Left-wing organisations designed to derail the monsoon session. Nothing could be more illogical. Why would a French-based non-governmental organisation coordinate a global expose into spyware hacking across countries simply to coincide its revelations with India’s parliamentary cycle?Truth is, the government knows that a court-monitored investigation could lead to further embarrassment by exposing the nature of State surveillance. Which might explain why the government has tied itself up in knots while refusing to answer a central question. Did it have any contractual dealings with the Israeli company, NSO Group Technologies on Pegasus? Any admission would amount to virtually conceding that government agencies are guilty of unlawfully hacking phones in contravention of Information Technology (IT) Act provisions.Also Read | The contrasting tale of inflation in India and USThe very idea of being subject to institutional scrutiny appears anathema to the government. Its style of functioning has been marked by a resolute defiance of established procedures for accountability or willingness to accept mistakes. Dodge, deny, distract are the three Ds of its crisis management mantra — don’t concede that oxygen shortages led to Covid-19 deaths, insist the migrant crisis last year was exaggerated, don’t acknowledge job losses and a faltering economy, and reject proof of Chinese border intrusions.Why would the government now choose to debate hacking charges in Parliament, or indeed, agree to any judicial oversight? Pegasus was, after all, a mythical winged horse. Perhaps snooping and hacking too are mythical concepts.Post-script: Long before Delhi 2021, there was Gandhinagar 2008-09. As revealed in my book, 2019: How Modi won India, senior Gujarat IPS officers were called in for a demo of a sophisticated Israeli spyware machine that could record all mobile conversations. We don’t know whether the machine was eventually procured or used but from that day, most officers began keeping two phones — one for official communication and one for private use.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-politics-and-ethics-of-surveillance-101627552554912.html
29-07-2021||Today's||Xi Jinping’s Tibet visit should worry India||China’s President Xi Jinping arrived at Nyingchi’s Mainling Airport in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) on July 21 at the start of a two-day visit, without prior public notice and amid stringent security. He was escorted throughout the tour by TAR party secretary, Wu Yingjie, and chairman of the TAR government, Che Dalha.The importance of the visit was highlighted by the inclusion of three politburo members and General Zhang Youxia, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission in Xi’s entourage. Its main focus was on implementation of the 14th Five Year Plan, the party’s policy initiatives in TAR, and the military.The visit, which took place in the midst of high military tensions between India and China, has implications for New Delhi.Xi’s decision to start his tour from Nyingchi Prefecture, opposite India’s Arunachal Pradesh, is significant. Official Chinese maps include most of Arunachal within the administrative boundaries of Nyingchi Prefecture. Relevant in this context are Xi’s insistent calls for the “rejuvenation” of the Chinese nation and recovery of territories claimed to have been lost by the imposition of unequal treaties by hostile foreign powers.Also Read | China calls upon Taliban to steer Afghan peace bidNyingchi is also important for the presence of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) units, border defence regiments and missile bases. It is the gateway for the railway linking Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, with Lhasa, the capital of TAR. Once completed, this will be the second railway connecting Lhasa and Shigatse to other provinces in the mainland. It will reduce travel time between Chengdu and Lhasa to 10 hours from the current 30-odd hours. The world’s largest dam being built at the Great Bend on the Brahmaputra (Yarlung Tsangpo) is also in Nyingchi.China’s leadership has paid special attention to the strategically important Chengdu-Lhasa railway. During this visit, Xi went to Linzhi railway station, an important hub station of the Sichuan-Tibet railway, on July 22, for a briefing on the overall plan of the Sichuan-Tibet railway and of the Lhasa-Nyingchi section. He was briefed on the ongoing construction of the crucial Ya’an-Nyingchi section. Xi pointed out that the planning and construction of the Sichuan-Tibet railway is a major measure to promote the development of Tibet and improve people’s livelihoods. He later travelled by the Fuxing (bullet) train to Lhasa.Economic issues and the implementation of proposed reforms ranked high on Xi’s agenda. Liu He, politburo member, vice-premier and director of the office serving the Chinese Communist party (CCP)’s Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, and He Lifeng, minister of the important National Development and Reform Commission, would have reviewed the projects earmarked for TAR in China’s 14th Five Year Plan and Long Range Objectives. These include defence infrastructure-related projects such as the 20 “general purpose” border airports and upgradation and extension of two additional highways along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Other major projects are the construction of numerous smaller dams along the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra), and the massive dam at the Great Bend on the river. The likely impact of the influx of large numbers of workers and technicians from the mainland for these projects into sparsely populated Tibet would have been on the agenda.General Zhang Youxia’s presence confirmed the visit’s military content. After greeting military personnel and veterans at Lhasa, Xi addressed a separate meeting attended by nearly a thousand PLA and PLA Air Force officers. Among those identified as attending were the Western Theatre Command commander, its political commissar, the commander of the Tibet Military Region and its political commissar.Xi thanked them for their “large contribution to the nation in terms of security and unification along with ensuring peace and stability in Tibet”. He urged “the army to be committed to the Party and its ideology” and focus on becoming “a formidable force”. Declaring that they have already passed the difficult challenge of Tibet’s harsh climate and environment and done a good job of protecting the country, Xi asserted “they need to continue training hard and prepare for future wars”. The prevailing situation along the LAC in Ladakh and future operations would almost certainly have been discussed.Keeping Tibetan sentiments in mind, Xi visited the Potala Palace, Barkhor and Drepung monastery in Lhasa. He also called on veteran 81-year-old Tibetan Party cadre, Phakpa Lha Gelek Namgyal.Xi Jinping’s visit has given a definite impetus to the policies being implemented in TAR. In the course of the visit, he spoke of environmental and ecological protection. Xi reinforced the CCP’s directives and stressed the necessity of “blending ethnic groups”, “adapting Tibetan Buddhism to socialism with Chinese characteristics” and ensuring the loyalty of party members. He emphasised promoting Mandarin as the primary language in ethnic schools in TAR, development of the transport network including railways and highways, the security of Tibet’s borders, and building border defence villages.Xi’s visit will give a major push to the socio-economic changes planned for TAR. India should carefully assess its implications and be prepared for increased military activity on LAC, including opposite Nyingchi and Shigatse.Jayadeva Ranade is former additional secretary, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India and is presently president of the Centre for China Analysis and StrategyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/xi-jinping-s-tibet-visit-should-worry-india-101627552195000.html
29-07-2021||Editorials||Mr Blinken pays a visit||If there was any doubt about the strength and depth of the India-United States (US) relationship, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit should put it to rest. Mr Blinken underlined that on all crucial issues — Covid-19, climate, emerging technologies, Indo-Pacific, maritime security — India was a vital partner. The fact that President Joe Biden has had several conversations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin has already visited India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has reached out to the US administration in Washington (Wednesday marked his fourth meeting with Mr Blinken in six months), Mr Modi could possibly visit the US soon, and less publicly, there is across the government collaboration with US agencies points to how far the two estranged democracies have come. They talk, all the time, on all issues. And this is excellent news.Also Read | India-US bond over Quad, China, America sheds reticence over Dalai LamaTwo themes appears to dominate Mr Blinken’s visit. The first is the strategic relationship. It is an open secret that the emergence of Quad is a direct attempt to ensure that China is constrained to play by the rules of the game. But that remains the unstated part. Quad, as both Mr Blinken and Mr Jaishankar emphasised, was looking at a constructive agenda, particularly vaccine supplies. This is smart, for the delivery of global common goods by a set of democracies will send a far more powerful message than rhetorical statements. By meeting Tibetan leaders, Mr Blinken did well in underscoring US support to the Tibetan community as it prepares for a post-Dalai Lama phase. By allowing the meeting to happen tomorrow on its soil, India did well in sending a signal to China. On Afghanistan, India and the US, in principle, have common goals in preventing a forcible Taliban takeover and ensuring a democratic and inclusive regime. But Washington can’t wait to rush out and has limited security stakes; India knows it will have to stand for its beliefs largely on its own.On democracy, Mr Blinken was careful to hint at the failings of democracy in the US itself, before making it clear how democratic values, institutional independence, and fundamental freedoms were crucial in cementing ties. The unsaid part was that Delhi appeared to backsliding on these metrics. While India put forth its response, the fact that such a conversation is happening itself is proof that the quality of Indian democracy is now a variable in the relationship. But notwithstanding differences, the big story remains one of increasing convergence. This is in India’s national interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/mr-blinken-pays-a-visit-101627559575656.html
