12-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Expect heavy rain till July 16, says IMD||The city saw its heaviest spell of rainfall in at least three weeks on Monday, with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) automatic weather station in Santacruz recording 42.6mm of rain (in eight hours between 8:30am and 5:30am). This was despite a drier morning, with just 2.8mm of rain recorded 24 hours. Official forecasts predict continued heavy showers in the city and suburbs until at least July 16, after which rainfall intensity will reduce.Doppler radar images from as late as 1:30am on Sunday showed the presence of rain clouds around the city, but the presence of a cyclonic circulation offshore prevented moisture-laden clouds from penetrating inland. However, the cyclonic circulation moved northward during the day while intensifying into a low pressure area, allowing rain bands to move in over the city and cause isolated heavy showers through the afternoon and evening.Ratnagiri, for example, recorded 92mm of rain in eight hours on Monday. Within a 24-hour period, areas along the same coast recorded very heavy rainfall, touching 350mm in Murud, 230mm in Dapoli and 124mm in Harnai. “The westerlies resumed during the day and were strengthened by a low pressure system currently prevailing over the west central Bay of Bengal as well. The synoptic situation is good for widespread rain over the Konkan coast next few days,” said Dr Jayanta Sarkar, head of IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai, on Monday evening.As per official forecasts, the maximum temperature over the next two days is expected to hover around 31 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature at 24 degrees Celsius -- down from 31.5 degrees and 25.8 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Monday.1 dead as bridge collapses in Raigad
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Despite July hiccups in Mumbai’s vaccination drive, double the jabs given||Although the city’s Covid-19 vaccination drive was hit thrice since July 1 due to shortage of doses, the number of citizens vaccinated doubled in the first 10 days of July, when compared to June, according to civic body data. Around 113,000 citizens were vaccinated in 243 civic centres between June 1 and 10. In the same period in July, the number of vaccinations increased to 238,000, across 281 civic centres.Further, in terms of vaccination across all 401 vaccination centres, which includes civic, state and private, the number is 539,568 between June 1 and 10, which increased marginally to 541,220 in the same period in July.According to BMC officials, along with the increase in number of vaccination centres, the supply has also increased due to which more vaccinations were possible.One indicator of increased supply is the supply of 688,470 vaccine doses to BMC in June 2021, up from the 523,440 in May. However, the demand is surplus to that of supply and hence we are seeing the vaccination drive being suspended despite more citizens getting vaccinated.In the past month, overall vaccination centres have increased from 342 in June to 401 in July. In terms of civic centres, they have increased from 243 in June first week to 281 in July first week.Of the 6,009,025 citizens vaccinated in the city, 42% vaccination was done at private hospitals. The maximum load was handled by civic vaccination centres.Further, between June 1 and 10, 453,455 citizens were vaccinated at private hospitals that went down to 282,991 in the same period during July as supply seems to have relatively improved at civic centres.Meanwhile, as vaccination resumed in the city on Monday with few centres seeing high footfalls for walk-in vaccinations resulting in crowding.There were long queues reported for walk-in vaccinations at BKC, Bhandup, Kandivli area. According to civic officials, the footfall probably increased as there is already a piled-up demand owing to vaccinations remaining shut since three days due to shortage of doses.Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “The increased vaccination is because of increase in supply. We got around 240,000 vaccine doses in July till now and it looks like it is little better than June. However, there is still time to conclude that July has better supply than June.”Dr Gomare added, “Our vaccination is also increasing because we are not keeping vaccine doses in reserve by stocking them. Instead, we are administering them as we are getting them. Our capacity is to easily vaccinate 100,000 citizens daily with help of state government vaccination centres, provided we have that sort of supply.”Further, the BMC is expecting fresh stock of vaccine doses on Monday night and owing to this, the drive is unlikely to be suspended for now. On Monday, 106,904 citizens were vaccinated in the city. Until now, a total of 6,115,929 citizens have been vaccinated in the city with at least one dose.On Tuesday, the vaccination drive will continue at civic and state vaccination centres with 50:50 ratio, wherein 50% of slots will be given for walk-ins and remaining for online booking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-july-hiccups-in-mumbai-s-vaccination-drive-double-the-jabs-given-101626114288751.html
12-07-2021||Lucknow||Two killed in tiger attack in PTR, probe ordered||Two people were killed, allegedly in a tiger attack, in the Deoria range of the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) late on Sunday night, forest officials said on Monday. A friend of the deceased who was travelling with them escaped the attack by climbing a nearby tree where he stayed perched through the night.Three men, Kandai Pal, 27, Sonu Pal, 22 and 23-year-old Vikas, were returning on a motorbike to their village in Pilibhit from nearby Shahjahanpur district via the Deoria range of PTR. The trio reached the barrier on the road passing through the PTR at around 9 pm. The forest guards present at the barrier warned them about the movement of a female tiger in the area which had been spotted with her cubs.“The trio neglected the warning and drove ahead on the road which passes through the forest. They were reportedly attacked by a tiger. The big cat killed Kandai and Sonu while Vikas managed to climb a nearby tree,” said Lallan Singh, circle officer of the area.The matter came to light when some locals passing through the road during the day spotted the bodies and informed the police. According to locals, Kandai and Sonu had visible paw injuries on their neck, face and chest. The locals also helped shell-shocked Vikas to come down from the tree. A team from the nearby police station that reached the spot recovered the bodies which were later sent for a post-mortem examination. The police team has admitted Vikas in a nearby hospital.“Vikas is in a state of shock. He informed us and a team of forest department about the tiger attack. We are investigating the matter,” the CO said.Meanwhile, forest officials are trying to identify and locate the big cat involved in the attack. “A female tiger was spotted in the area a few days ago so it is being suspected that she was behind the attack. Our teams are trying to locate it. Villagers in the nearby area have also been alerted about the animal and measures are being taken to mitigate any possibility of man-tiger conflict,” said Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director, PTR.This is the first incident of man-animal conflict reported in the PTR following a slump in such cases lately. As many as 29 people have been killed in man-tiger conflicts in PTR since 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/two-killed-in-tiger-attack-in-ptr-probe-ordered-101626114048710.html
12-07-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka faces big task of reviving UP Cong for 2022 polls||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra faces major challenges as she arrives here this week to interact with partymen and gear up the party organisation for 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. “Priyanka is likely to arrive here on a four-day tour on Wednesday,” said a party leader.As Priyanka begins her interactions with different groups of faction-ridden party at Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters here, her first major challenge will be to make an assessment about the apparent party’s poor infrastructure and strengthen it further despite the UPCC’s claims of carrying out a revamp at different levels across the state.The Congress has put up a poor show in the panchayat polls. Barring three block panchayats in Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra’s assembly constituency and a block panchayat in Amethi MLC Deepak Singh’s area, no other leader has been able to ensure victory of any party supported candidate in the rural polls. “Priyanka’s first major task will be to make an assessment about the party organisation infrastructure and gear it up for the 2022 polls,” said a functionary.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee had claimed of putting up strong organisation teams at district and block levels following the party’s revamp. UPCC leaders had assured the party leadership of a good show in the panchayat polls that they said would make the party a strong claimant for power in the 2022 UP assembly elections.“As the UPCC had assured good results in panchayat polls, the party earmarked a large chunk of funds to the state party to fund the party supported candidates. Accusations have been made about misuse of funds too and the party needs to get an inquiry conducted,” said another party functionary.Priyanka also needs to work on bringing old guards and other senior leaders together into party’s mainstream. A divide has persisted between the UPCC’s new team and the old guards following action taken against them. Efforts though have been initiated to bring the old guards into the mainstream, many senior leaders still find them isolated. A group of young leaders too had staged a protest in front of UPCC headquarters accusing the state party of not taking all party leaders together.On whether Priyanka will meet the disgruntled leaders during her visit, a party functionary said, “Priyanka’s only programme in Lucknow is to meet partymen. We are not sure whether disgruntled leaders will be allowed to meet her.” Priyanka has continued to have virtual interaction with the partymen. This will be her first visit to the state capital after a gap of more than a year-and-a-half. Her programme to visit Lucknow had to be deferred more than once in view of restrictions in fight against Covid-19.A bungalow situated at Gokhale Marg here, meanwhile, has been refurbished to work as her residence during her tours to the state. The bungalow belongs to former union minister and senior Congress leader the late Sheila Kaul.Priyanka recently addressed training programmes organised for block party teams via videoconferencing in different districts. She also addressed senior party leaders through videoconferencing on Monday.Priyanka speaks to UP party leaders Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday expressed serious concern over rising prices of petroleum products and essential commodities besides irregularities in the recently-held panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh.Priyanka was speaking to senior party leaders from UP at a videoconferencing with party’s strategy group and advisory council. She said the BJP government was taking recourse to violence to win the panchayat polls instead of helping people and crime-affected women and providing jobs to the unemployed youth.Senior party leaders, who attended the video conferencing, said a discussion about the state government’s population policy was also held at the videoconferencing. The party would come out with comments after studying the policy, said a leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-faces-big-task-of-reviving-up-cong-for-2022-polls-101626113629346.html

Over 60,000 signatures have been taken on an online petition on the issue, as a result of which ‘Nina’ has been taken to the Elephant Hospital in Mathura for treatment. “The elephant is blind in both eyes and suffers from severe arthritis, lameness, and degenerative joint disease. Her deteriorating health and critical medical condition means she needs urgent medical attention. Wildlife SOS and forest department rushed ‘Nina’ to the Elephant Hospital in Mathura for urgent treatment and care,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS. Nina has been subjected to begging for alms and used for wedding processions all her life. Despite being blind, weak, elderly, severely malnourished, and suffering from arthritis and fused joints, she continued to be exploited for commercial use, alleged Kartick. “The sharp jab of the bull hook by her owner/mahout forced the blind elephant to walk through busy traffic, towns from wedding to wedding where the startling loud noises and crowds of people kept her confused and scared. When Nina was not at work, she was tightly shackled by a spiked chain which prevented her from lying down and resting. Even during the pandemic, when there was a ban on crowds at weddings, this elephant was used for wedding processions and forced to beg for alms on the streets. Nina never received proper medical treatment,” said Dr Ilayaraja, deputy director of Veterinary Services at Wildlife SOS. “Bollywood celebrities such as Athiya Shetty, Shruti Haasan, Randeep Hooda, Vivek Oberoi, Adil Hussain, Ramona Arena, Pia Trivedi, Bani J, Pooja Batra and Suchitra Pillai, and even popular US TV series—“Modern Family” star Nolan Gould joined in to show their support by signing the petition to help Nina and sharing the same on their respective social media accounts,” he said. At the Wildlife SOS Elephant Hospital in Mathura, Nina now has the comfort of a dedicated team of experienced elephant veterinarians and care staff who are carrying out ultrasound of her damaged eyes to explore possibilities of reducing her discomfort, X-rays of her fragile bones, blood tests and other tests to assess her health status. The Wildlife SOS veterinary team has also developed an intensive treatment plan for her that involves hydrotherapy, laser therapy and healthy nutrition to help reduce her pain, stated Dr Ilayaraja. Baiju Raj M.V, director - Conservation Projects, WSOS, said: “We are very happy and grateful to the Uttar Pradesh forest department for their trust in us to help handicapped elephants like Nina.” Rajnikant Mittal, divisional forest officer, Mathura, said: “The UP forest department is happy to provide medical treatment for suffering elephants at the Elephant Hospital in collaboration with Wildlife SOS.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bollywood-celebs-lend-support-to-blind-elephant-nina-101626113508709.html

Over 40 per cent of lightning strikes in Odisha are cloud to the ground the highest in the country along with Gujarat.The rise in fatalities due to an increase in frequency and intensity of lightning strikes prompted the IMD to start lightning forecasts from April 1, 2019.Despite an increase in the lightning strikes, Odisha managed to bring down the associated death toll to 156 from 207 a year ago.As per the Annual Lightning Report 2020-21, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh are the only two states in the country that have pruned the lightning deaths by a whopping 70 per cent between 2016-2020.At least 1,697 people died due to lightning between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Of this, 401 died in Bihar, followed by Uttar Pradesh (238 deaths) and Madhya Pradesh (228 deaths).According to a pre-print accepted for the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics recently, the frequency and intensity of lightning strikes in India are expected to increase by 10-25 per cent and 15-50 per cent by the end of this century. Coastal areas may be at the highest risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-tops-list-of-states-with-maximum-lightning-strikes-for-2nd-year-101626113331001.html

We have high moisture, easterly winds and clouds, it’s just the rains that we are waiting for and expect it anytime soon in Noida,” said Jenamani.There is high moisture content in the air, the easterly winds are strong and clouds are low— but the monsoon has been delayed by almost two weeks in the region. Normally the monsoon arrives in Noida around June 27. Jenamani added that the monsoon had covered most of the part of Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab, and will soon cover remaining part of western UP, Noida, Gurugram and Delhi.“Only a small patch (Delhi -NCR) is yet to be covered due to several reasons, including the effect of a dry westerly wind. However, to discern the monsoon advancement or movement and tell when will it exactly rain is a mystery,” the IMD scientist said.On Monday, the IMD recorded a maximum and minimum temperature for Noida at 37.3 degrees Celsius (°C) and 27.4°C, against 37.3 degrees Celsius and 29.3 degrees Celsius a day earlier. “There is good moisture content in the air and there is also easterly winds, so the mercury won’t rise,” said Jenamani, allaying fears of a heatwave that had plagued the region in the beginning of the month.According to private weather forecasting agency, there are chances of heavy rain by July 16.“The monsoon could be declared with the first rains in region as all other criteria are being fulfilled. But the rains would be light and we can only expect strong rains by July 16-17. Till then the day time temperatures will hover between 36 to 38°C,” said Mahesh Palawat, Vice President, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the national Capital region, the maximum temperature was at 37.7°C which is two degrees higher than the season’s average and a minimum of 27°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/all-conditions-favourable-for-monsoon-in-noida-predicts-imd-101626113088663.html

And, if they do not get well with those medicines, we conduct their reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for confirmation of the presence of specific genetic material in any pathogen, including the Covid-19 virus infection,” he said. Dr HM Lavania, the head of pathology department in the district hospital, said that cases of malaria and typhoid too have increased. “However, this is quite common as the number of patients increase in rainy season every year,” he said. The Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI), better known as Child PGI, too has reported a rise. Dr (Major) BP Singh, the medical officer in the emergency department of Child PGI, said that the number of children, having fever and cough, has nearly doubled in last 10 days. “Earlier, the average number of such patients were around 10 in a day, which has now gone up to 20,” he said. GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, ruled out Covid-19-induced rise in infection. “Every year we see a sudden influx of patients having flu, cough, cold and conjunctivitis. The number will go down by mid-August. For critical patients, we cross-check it with the RT-PCR tests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-hospitals-witness-rise-in-patients-with-fever-cough-101626113029348.html

The Covishield allocation for July is 2.5 million doses while we require at least 2.83 million doses for the second dose in July. We would be forced to delay the second dose of several people,” he said.India’s per day vaccination peaked on June 21, when prime minister Narendra Modi launched free vaccination for all, with 9.1 million vaccinations. Since then, the CoWin website shows that per day vaccination numbers have been going down with the lowest reported on Sunday.“Normally, vaccination is usually low on Sundays when fewer vaccinations sites operate,” said a health ministry official, who was not willing to be quoted. He hoped the numbers to increase from Monday and expressed confidence in meeting the July target.Former and first vice-chairperson of National Institution for Transforming India (Niti) Aayog, Arvind Panagariya, on Monday tweeted: “India’s current vaccination rate of 3 to 4 million per day is simply not good enough. We need to up our game to achieve daily rate of at least 5 to 6 million jabs. Not clear whether the cause is hesitation or insufficient production.”As of now, a total of 13.3 million people, including 10.5 million first doses and 2.78 million second doses, have been vaccinated in Odisha. Many, like 75-year-old Biswanath Mohanty of Sanalpur village, have not received their second jab for lack of vaccines. “I have been told to wait for some time,” he said.Madhya Pradesh, which created a record by vaccinating 1.7 million people on June 21, has been able to vaccinate only 2.6 million people in the first 12 days of July, including 50,000 on Sunday, as per official data. State immunisation officer, Santosh Shukla, issued an order saying as the state has run out of vaccines, there will be no vaccination on Monday and Wednesday.MP Medical education minister, Vishwas Sarang, said, “We are receiving doses regularly but the manufacturers have supply limitations. We have conveyed that in MP people are showing more alertness now and want to get vaccinated as soon as possible so we need more doses.” Till Sunday, 23.9 million people had been vaccinated in MP.Officials in Rajasthan and Jharkhand also said that they have slowed down vaccinations due to a shortage in supply. Rajasthan health secretary, Siddharth Mahajan said from June 21 to July 8, they have received 31.63 lakh vaccine doses, an average of 1.75 lakh doses per day. The state has the capacity to vaccinate 15 lakh people daily, he said. The secretary said the state is regularly asking the Centre about vaccine shortage.Jharkhand government officials said the state can administer 1.5 lakh doses every day but only 19,586 people were inoculated on Sunday due to limited stock. “We sent an SOS to the Centre about the prevailing stock. On Monday, they delivered 2.5 lakh doses,” said Naman Priyesh Lakra, nodal officer, vaccination. The state administered over a lakh doses at least three days in the first week of July. However, with stock running dry, the daily vaccination since July 7 has been less than 50,000 that came down to 19,000 on Sunday.Tamil Nadu, which has so far received 16,780,460 vaccines, incessantly faced vaccine shortages. On Saturday, 18 districts had no vaccines left. By Sunday night, five-lakh doses of Covishield were sent. “The chief minister sent our health secretary to Delhi to meet with the Union health ministry officials to dispatch our July allocation at the earliest,” said state health minister M Subramanian. “So, for the past two days, we have been receiving our supply without any disruption.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-mp-halt-vaccination-as-states-complain-of-vaccine-shortage-101626112969269.html

Nowadays, we do not have a lot many cases. Two days ago, two patients were found to have low oxygen saturation levels and were immediately shifted to a facility,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “We have also started mapping areas from where fresh cases are coming in.”According to official records of the district health department, the district has 70 PICU beds at Santosh Medical College and Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital while there are 110 isolation beds for children at the two hospitals besides the four community health centres at Muradnagar, Loni, Modinagar and Dasna.As per state control room record of July 12, the Ghaziabad district has 55583 total cases which include 55087 patients discharged, 461 deaths and 35 active cases.“Although there is no major increase in number of cases, we are keeping a constant tab on health status of every individual patient and are closely monitoring high case load areas. We are sending 5% of positive samples regularly for genome sequencing and till date, of about 192 samples, none have returned any positive result for a severe variant of the coronavirus,” said Dr Gupta.According to official records, the district detected 49 patients (11.61%) in age group 0-20 years out of total 422 positive cases detected during the period June 1 to July 10 this year. Of the 49 patients, seven cases are aged 0-10 years while the rest are in age group 11-20 years.During the period of first wave from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, the health department data indicated that the percentage of patients in age group 0-20 was 9.82%; 2718 out of total 27671 cases.It was about 9.89% (2755 cases out of total 27849 cases) during the second wave period identified from April 1, 2021, to June 18, 2021, by the health department.The experts said that there is no major surge witnessed at present in patients having Covid-like symptoms.“The severity in cases is also not majorly adverse. But having said this, people should not shun the use of mask at any cost. It must continue. The health department should accelerate vaccination process with wider coverage,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-one-year-old-is-first-patient-at-paediatric-icu-set-up-for-third-wave-101626112908809.html

For Dr Panda, it was a case of gurudakshina (payback to teachers). The institution, in 1957, gave her a monthly scholarship of ₹25 to pursue her MBBS course in SCB Medical College in Cuttack city as her veterinarian father did not have enough financial resources to fund her education, as well as 10 of her siblings.“A month ago I got a call from her saying she has some money to donate to the alma mater that helped her study. She said she wanted to repay something to her institution. Though she passed out of GM University long ago, I was touched by her sense of gratitude,” said professor N Nagaraju, vice-chancellor of GM University, who received the cheque of ₹30 lakh from her during the 77th Foundation Day celebration of the institution.In 1957, when she secured a seat in the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack following an interview, Dr Panda was worried about her father’s ability to fund her education. “My father, who was a veterinary officer in Sambalpur, once told me it would be difficult for him to finance my MBBS education as there were 10 other siblings. But I was determined to study. When I got to know that the GM College Trust was giving monthly assistance of ₹25, I applied and got it. Besides, I got a monthly scholarship of ₹35 for being among the top 3 in the class. The ₹60 that I got was more than enough to fund my medical studies for the first 2 years till my father started paying for my expenses,” said Dr Panda, who was among dozen-odd girls in Odisha pursuing their MBBS degree then.The GM College Trust was set up in 1944 by a few like-minded intellectuals of Sambalpur to help needy students further their education.After completing her MBBS, Dr Panda joined the district headquarters hospital in Sambalpur in 1963 but quit a year and a half later after she was transferred to Kalahandi district as she thought she would not be able to look after her younger siblings who were still pursuing their studies. She then joined the municipality hospital in Sambalpur town, from where she retired 31 years ago with a small pension.“I was the third among 11 siblings. As my sister and 9 brothers looked up to me, I thought it was my duty to look after their education and get established in life. Later, all my brothers and sisters became, principals, lecturers and professors,” she said. In the process of helping her siblings build their careers, she postponed her marriage till her early Forties. Her husband Prashant Mohanty, a renowned journalist of Odia daily Samaj, passed away two years ago.While she was helping her siblings find their own feet, she did not forget the assistance that GM University provided her back in the day.Dr Panda said she wanted to give back to the university as her parents valued education above anything else. “My mother was quite instrumental in our education. Though I did not have much money after my retirement, I made up my mind to give back something that helped me pursue my education. Recently, I got some money from the sale of land and also broke my fixed deposit from which I could arrange ₹30 lakh,” she said.Nagaraju said the ₹30 lakh that Dr Panda donated would burgeon to ₹60 lakh as the state government under its Mo College-Mo University programme gives double the amount donated by alumnae. The Mo College-Mo University programme started in March this year is a platform through which the alumnae can connect and contribute for the development of their alma mater.“She was hesitant towards any publicity for her contribution. But we too have a sense of gratitude towards her act of philanthropy,” said the vice-chancellor. The chairman of Mo College-Mo University programme, Akash Dasnayak praised her contribution saying her gesture was worth emulating.Though retired now, Dr Panda was treating patients till the Covid-19 pandemic struck last year and keeps visiting people who need treatment in her district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-doctor-donates-rs-30-lakh-to-her-alma-mater-64-years-after-her-mbbs-101626112789830.html
12-07-2021||Noida||UP govt relaxes night curfew timings by 2 hours||Noida The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday relaxed the night curfew in the state by two more hours, which will now be applicable from 10pm to 6am.Last month, the timings had been relaxed from 7pm-7am to 9pm-7am. The government had allowed resumption of markets outside of containment zones, and also restaurants and malls to open with 50% capacity. The weekend curfew, however, continues to be in force.According to data available on Sunday (July 10), Gautam Budh Nagar reported three fresh Covid-19 cases. No deaths or discharges were reported in the 24-hour duration. The active caseload in the district was recorded at 43, total death toll at 466, and total discharges at 62,606.‘Market to suffer till weekend curfew in place’Sushil Kumar Jain, president of Sector 18 Market Association and convener of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) - Delhi-NCR, says traders are happy that the curfew timings were relaxed. “Earlier, traders had to shut shop by 8.30pm as the curfew timings started from 9pm. However, with the new relaxations, now shopkeepers will be able to generate more sales.”Jain, however, added that the market will continue to suffer till the weekend curfew is in place. “Earlier, Noida traders were hopeful that the government would permit them to run businesses on Saturdays and Sundays, however, it did not happen. According to CAIT findings, traders, including retailers and wholesalers, in Gautam Budh Nagar suffered an estimated loss of ₹10,000 crore between March and June 2021. Markets collect the majority of revenue during the weekends, and they will continue to suffer losses as long as the weekend curbs are in place,” he said, adding that customers from Noida also travel to Delhi on weekends. “This not only harms the business, but the revenue also goes to Delhi instead of Uttar Pradesh.”‘Barely get customers on weekdays’Restaurateurs, too, welcomed the move, but were disappointed about the weekend curfew.Varun Khera, president of National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), Noida chapter, said, “The relaxation of night curfew is somewhat good for restaurateurs as we will be able to hold on to our dinner revenue. However, the weekend curfew is a major hurdle for us as we barely get customers on weekdays. Moreover, we have to pay bills and salaries every month, but are only generating revenue for a maximum of 20 days.” The NRAI had sent a letter to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on July 6, requesting him to allow reopening of their establishments on weekends, too.‘Losing revenue to Delhi and Gurugram’District pub owners say they are losing revenue to Delhi and Gurugram, as there are no restrictions on restaurants and bars during weekends.Varun Puri, owner of Duty Free Courtyard in Noida and Duty Free - The Vayu Bar in Gurugram, said, “Earlier, corporate professionals used to go to pubs during weekdays, too. However, with office shut and work-from-home in place, people usually step out on weekends... Since there are no curbs on cross-border movement, Noida and Ghaziabad residents go to Delhi and Gurugram on weekends... Even I get maximum business from Gurugram on weekends.”Govt treading cautiously: Medical expertsMedical experts, however, say that weekend relaxations may lead to overcrowding at restaurants and pubs, increasing the risk of getting Covid-19. “I believe the government is treading cautiously and opening up the city gradually. Weekend curbs may lead to an overcrowding situation in markets, pubs and restaurants, which may eventually invite the purported third wave of Covid-19 sooner than we are expecting,” said Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Noida chapter.Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, sais, “The state government can only take decisions on relaxations during the weekend.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-relaxes-night-curfew-timings-by-2-hours-101626112788606.html
12-07-2021||Gurugram||Post Covid-19 illnesses: Radiology test prices capped||The state health department has capped the charges for radiology tests to detect post-Covid complications, following complaints of overpricing by hospitals and private labs. As per an order issued on July 7, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain will cost between ₹2,200 (without contrast) and ₹3,000 (with contrast), as opposed to around ₹8,000 at present. Contrast dye is a substance that allows a radiologist to see the internal structure of concern in greater detail by making it more visible against the background of other tissues. “In order to rationalise the rates of various radiological investigations required for the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19 patients or post-Covid illnesses, the state government has limited the maximum charges to be levied for MRI brain and orbit, and CT Paranasal Sinuses (PNS),” the order stated. An MRI of the brain and orbit is generally done in case of post-Covid complications such as mucormycosis (black fungus infection), which affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement, the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound. Currently, at least 119 cases of black fungus infections are active in the district. Till now, 316 cases have been confirmed and 45 deaths have been reported in the district.An MRI of the orbit is conducted to detect the prevalence of infection in the optic nerves. This cost of the test, which is around ₹8,000, has been capped at ₹2,300 (with contrast) and ₹1,700 (without contrast), as per the order. An MRI of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which covers the nose region, has been fixed at ₹4,000 (with contrast) and ₹2,500 (without contrast), while the computed tomography (CT) of the nose will vary from ₹1,000- ₹1,800. The CT PNS procedure costs ₹2,500 at present.The maximum charge for CT chest has also been reduced from ₹2,100 to ₹1,800. The health department had previously revised the charges of CT chest in May, as labs were charging ₹4,000- ₹5,000 per scan.The fixed rates include all diagnostic expenses, concerning films, taxes and documentation, among others. As per the order, the revised rates do not apply to diagnostic centres providing services to the health department under a public-private partnership.Doctors treating mucormycosis suggest that the state administration should reduce the cost of the amphotericin-B drug, which increases the overall treatment cost of black fungus cases. Dr Rahul Bhargava, principal director, haematology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram, said, “Diagnostic tests like MRI or PNS are done only once or twice in case of mucormycosis. The cost should have been reduced when cases of post-Covid complications were at their peak. However, the maximum cost is incurred in the purchase of the amphotericin-B drug, which should be reduced. A patient with black fungus infection spends nearly ₹36,000 every day for at least three weeks on the amphotericin-B drug. Reducing the cost of one vial, which is around ₹6,000, will bring down the overall treatment expenditure.”Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “Directives have been issued to labs and hospitals to follow the new order. Action will be taken if we receive any complaint regarding overcharging.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/post-covid-19-illnesses-radiology-test-prices-capped-101626112490782.html
12-07-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 prep: Only 17 of 43 private hospitals have oxygen plants||Of 43 private hospitals in the district that have more than 50 beds, only 17 have a medical oxygen plant or are in the process of installing it, according to the district health department data. Even though the health department has been reporting a constant decline in new cases of coronavirus infection for more than a month now, private hospitals were directed in June to augment bed capacity for children and infants. They were given a deadline of July 10 to submit the data and ensure the installation of medical oxygen plants (in facilities with more than 50 beds).“The state government has extended the deadline for setting up of medical oxygen plants in hospitals by a few months now. In many hospitals, the installation process is in progress and will be completed by July-end or August. Also, the overall reserved bed capacity for children has been increased by 10%, which is also a part of the overall preparedness to tackle (the next) Covid-19 wave,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer for Gurugram. The district also has over 900 paediatric beds, including 258 newborn intensive care units (NICU) and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), to tackle the next wave of Covid-19. Officials said that bed capacity in at least 76 hospitals has been increased by 10% to treat neonatal, infants and young children, who, as adults, are susceptible to get infected in the next wave. Data available with the district health department shows that of 96 hospitals registered with the government portal, at least 76 declared having neonatal, infant and paediatric bed capacity, amounting to about 900 paediatric beds in all. This includes at least 67 ICU beds for neonatal and infants, with ventilators, and 191 ICU beds without ventilators. More than 627 beds are for paediatric care, as per the data.To study the impact of Covid-19 on children, a pan-India serological survey was conducted, in which at least 1,059 people from the Ballabhgarh district of Haryana were covered. The survey, which was released in June, showed that 61.4% of children younger than 18 years and 58.8% above 18 years had antibodies to fight the infection. Officials said that as per the results of the survey, children and adults will be equally impacted.Currently, over 3,837 beds have been reserved for adult Covid-19 patients, of which 2,817 are oxygen beds, 759 are ICU and 261 are equipped with ventilator support systems. Since there has been a decline in the new Covid-19 cases, only seven patients from Gurugram are critically ill and being treated at hospitals, of the 81 active cases.On Monday, the district reported four new Covid-19 cases, while no death was reported for the third consecutive day. The death toll stands at 919. So far, 180, 762 cases have been detected in Gurugram, with the second wave alone accounting for over 100,000 cases in April and May. “Details submitted by hospitals will be reviewed in the next few days. Thereafter, further directives will be issued to gear up for the (next) suspected wave,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-prep-only-17-of-43-private-hospitals-have-oxygen-plants-101626112489615.html
12-07-2021||Gurugram||Dalit woman held captive, gang-raped by four men||Four men were booked for allegedly raping an 18-year-old Dalit woman at gunpoint after holding her captive for over nine days from June 30, the police said. The woman alleged that she was injected with sedatives and was unconscious for most of the time.According to the police, the woman was acquainted with the suspects, who were also residents of her village near Sohna. They allegedly recorded videos of the incident to threaten her to not disclose the incident to her family members. On July 8, they left her at the Ballabhgarh bus stand, following which she contacted her husband and reached home, the police said on Monday. A case under sections 201 (destruction of evidence), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 365 (kidnapping), 376 D (gang rape) of the Indian Penal Code, relevant sections of the Arms Act and Section 3 of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was registered at the Sohna police station. The police said that the woman was abducted from a temple on the outskirts of the village. She was talking to an acquaintance when two of his friends arrived in a car and invited her for a ride to Faridabad. “I asked them for water and after drinking a few sips, I fell unconscious. When I regained consciousness, I was in a room where there were four mattresses and a few liquor bottles. There was no cooler or fan in that room. Another man from our village visited the next morning. They raped me one after another,” the victim told the police in her complaint. The police said that the suspects threatened her life as well as that of her family members. They disposed of her clothes so that police could not recover any evidence. Umesh Kumar, station house officer of Sohna police station, said that suspects injected her with sedatives every evening. “When her family members called, they held her at gunpoint and asked her to tell them that she was at a friend’s place and would return soon. They bought her a shirt and a pair of trousers to return home on July 7,” he said. The woman said that she did not disclose the incident to her family for a few days, but later confided in her husband as her health deteriorated. She was taken to a government hospital as she suffered abdominal pain due to injuries, the police said.The police recorded her statement before a duty magistrate and are on the lookout for the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dalit-woman-held-captive-gang-raped-by-four-men-101626112432563.html
12-07-2021||Gurugram||Fire at Bandhwari landfill continues for second day, citizens’ groups protest ‘waste mismanagement’||A fire that broke out at the Bandhwari landfill around noon on Sunday continued to rage on Monday despite continued dousing operations. Fire department officials said they expected the blaze to be extinguished by Tuesday afternoon. Members of city-based environmental groups, meanwhile, protested over the incident, calling it a “mismanagement of waste.” Officials of the fire department said that due to toxic gases and windy conditions on Monday, waste lying underneath the mountain of garbage continued to catch fire. At least 12 fire tenders, from Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabhgarh have been engaged in dousing operations round-the-clock, officials said.“The blaze is not of high intensity and is difficult to spot. Embers and smoke emitting out of the garbage piles are giving us an indication that waste underneath is on fire. Earthmovers and propellers are being used to clear the waste pile right from the top. Until we reach the bottom of the pile, our dousing operations will continue,” said Sunil Adlakha, fire safety officer.Adlakha said that the fire at the landfill is a common occurrence due to the heavy build-up of toxic gases and high temperatures. However, it is for the first time it has continued for a second day.“The fire broke out naturally due to a high presence of methane gases and high temperature. All support was lent by Ecogreen for dousing operations. The main centre of fire has been extinguished and work is ongoing to douse any remaining embers as a precautionary measure,” said Sanjeev Sharma, spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, which is the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG) concessionaire for waste management.Around 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste is lying at the Bandhwari landfill, with heaps of waste as high as 37 metres. Around 1,800 tonnes of waste is dumped at the site from Gurugram and Faridabad every day.On Monday evening, members of the Aravalli Bachao Citizens Group and Citizen for Clean Air, carried out a protest outside the landfill citing “mismanagement of waste” in both Gurugram and Faridabad. The issues highlighted by the citizens’ groups included the dumping of 2,000 tonnes of unsegregated waste at the landfill every day and the lack of strict enforcement, concerning segregation at source and solid waste management rules in both cities.“Landfill fires often occur from trapped gases generated through the decomposition of mixed waste including wet food waste. It is critical for the government to implement a sustainable waste management plan for both Gurugram and Faridabad that consists of segregation at source, decentralised composting, production of biogas, and dry waste recovery centres. This will take care of 75-80% of the total waste,” said Neelam Ahluwalia, a member of Aravalli Bachao Citizens Group. The Aravalli Bachao Citizens Group also raised issues regarding the Haryana government’s plan to set up a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at the landfill, as the location is a biodiversity-rich area with important wildlife habitats, a leopard corridor and “very critical” water recharge zone for the National Capital Region. Ahluwalia said that the two groups held the protest so that the Haryana government takes cognisance of the matter and takes constructive steps that firstly prevent future fires and come up with sustainable solutions based on the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, to reduce the volume of waste being transported to the landfill and eventually, remove this landfill from the eco-sensitive Aravalli area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fire-at-bandhwari-landfill-continues-for-second-day-citizens-groups-protest-waste-mismanagement-101626112431565.html
12-07-2021||Gurugram||Lift and loot: Gang involved in 50 robberies busted||A four-member gang that allegedly robbed around 50 people after offering shared rides in cabs on the Delhi-Jaipur highway (National Highway-48) over the past six months was busted, the police said on Monday. The police said that the gang members were from Jaipur and were involved in highway robberies in Delhi, Gurugram and Rajasthan. They were previously arrested in Jaipur in 2019 and were out on bail. Three members of the gang were arrested early on Monday morning, while the police are tracking the fourth member of the group.According to the police, the gang offered to drop people waiting for public transport at major intersections on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, such as the Iffco Chowk, Shankar Chowk, Rajeev Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk, at cheap prices. When the commuters boarded the vehicle, the gang members would assault them, rob them of their valuables and force them to share their ATM codes to withdraw cash.The police said that their crime teams used technical surveillance to arrest the suspects. The police also seized a car that was allegedly used in the crimes. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspects were arrested from Bawal in Rewari. “They were involved in highway robberies in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana. They used to target victims who used to wear gold chains and wristwatches. They revealed that they targeted ‘rich’ executives looking for lifts. They used to travel to Gurugram and offer lifts from spots close to corporate spaces on Sohna Road, Udyog Vihar, Sector 17/18, Iffco Chowk and Rajeev Chowk,” he said. Sangwan said they received several complaints of lift-and-loot incidents in which a Brezza car was involved. They said that it took a week of rigorous technical and human surveillance to identify the suspects. The suspects were identified as Manoj alias Monu (27), Surender Kumar (35), and Naresh Kumar (32) of Jaipur in Rajasthan. They lived at a rented accommodation in Bawal, the police said. “This gang was active since 2016 and they used to change places after a few robberies. They targeted different routes in Delhi-NCR, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The CIA-17 team, led by Narender Chauhan, started rigorous technical exercises and reconstructed the sequence of events right from the start until the victim was let go by the assailants. While retracing the past incidents, the team picked up several vital clues, both technical and human,” he said. Sangwan said that with the arrest of this group, a gang responsible for a majority of loot-and-lift crimes since the last year was busted. However, the police said they are suspecting the involvement of similar gangs from Nuh, who are also operating on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. The modus operandi of all the gangs are similar, due to which it is hard to zero in on the total number. They offer victims shared rides at night or early in the morning, assault and rob them. In the present case, the gang mainly operated from the three locations on a 10-kilometre stretch of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, the police said. The police are compiling details of cases lodged at various police stations across the city and contacting victims to identify the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lift-and-loot-gang-involved-in-50-robberies-busted-101626112430479.html
12-07-2021||Gurugram||Sadar Bazar pedestrianisation on the cards again, committee to file report by July 20||A seven-member committee has been tasked with formulating a comprehensive plan to develop Sadar Bazar as a pedestrian-friendly and vehicle-free zone, as per an order issued on Sunday by the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). A deadline of July 20 was set for the committee to submit its report. The committee, which comprises MCG officials, World Resources Institute (WRI) officials, Gurugram traffic police personnel and civil defence personnel, will formulate the design plan under the Streets for People Challenge, hosted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA). As per the plan, a 600-metre stretch of Sadar Bazar starting from the T-point at New Railway Road, near the post office, up to the Sohna Chowk on Old Railway Road, near Jama Masjid, is to be made vehicle-free and pedestrian-friendly. The plan for pedestrianisation of the market, however, has been opposed by shopkeepers in the past. The MCG attempted a week-long pedestrian-friendly and vehicle-free trial on the 600-metre stretch on March 20. Within an hour of the trial starting, shopkeepers resisted the initiative citing loss of customers and difficulties in parking, following which the MCG allowed entry of vehicles. “The key responsibility of the committee will be to develop a comprehensive plan and design for pedestrianisation of Sadar Bazar main market street, which implies making the street motorised vehicle-free and creating space for pedestrians and cyclists. Thus, the committee would aim to create a sustainable, comfortable, accessible and inclusive market street, positively impacting the user footfall and triggering a transformation in the area,” an excerpt from the order issued by Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, MCG commissioner, issued on Sunday, stated.Part of the redesigning process also includes streetscaping, managing parking spaces, formulating enforcement strategies, managing vending zones and public amenities, among other such measures, said MCG officials. “All the aspects that can contribute to a holistic development of the area will fall under the purview of the committee,” Ahuja’s order stated. In the order, Ahuja also directed the committee to consult public representatives and local shopkeepers. It can also use the services of design experts who are experienced in street designs.Bablu Gupta, the president of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association, said, “There is a massive communication gap between the MCG, traders and shopkeepers. The MCG tells us one thing and does another thing on the ground, which has been the root cause of all the issues in the past. Pedestrian-friendly markets have been a success in Delhi as the local municipal corporation and shopkeepers both had clarity regarding the type of redesign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sadar-bazar-pedestrianisation-on-the-cards-again-committee-to-file-report-by-july-20-101626112429365.html

12-07-2021||Kolkata||CID starts probe into alleged suicide of Suvendu Adhikari’s security guard||The state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday initiated a fresh probe into the death of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari’s security guard who reportedly died by suicide in 2018, officials said. On Saturday the victim’s wife lodged a three-page complaint with the local police in Purba Medinipur district demanding a fresh probe into her husband’s death. According to the police, the victim, Suvabrata Chakraborty, allegedly shot himself with his service revolver in October 2018. Chakraborty was the former security guard of BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who was then state transport minister in the Mamata Banerjee administration. He succumbed two days later. Adhikari, however, sided with the BJP in December 2020 just ahead of the state assembly elections. Even though the TMC returned to power with a sweeping victory, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who contested from Nandigram in Purba Medinipur district, was defeated by Adhikari, her protégé-turned-adversary. Adhikari is now the leader of the opposition in the state legislative assembly. “A CID team came to our house on Monday. They wanted to know what exactly happened on that day – October 13, 2018. We requested them to unearth the truth. Even if it was a suicide, we want to know why did he die by suicide,” said a relative of Chakraborty, who didn’t wish to be named. Even though the victim’s wife Suparna Kanjilal Chakraborty lodged a complaint with the local police and the cops started an investigation, the CID took over the case initiating a fresh probe. “From the beginning, I had doubts about my husband’s death,” Suparna Kanjilal Chakraborty wrote in the complaint letter. She also wrote, “As Adhikari was a powerful man both at the state and district level, and I used to stay with my two daughters, I could not gather the courage to say anything. But now situations have changed and I thought I may get justice.” The complainant also wrote that when her brother-in-law raised doubts over the ‘suicide theory’ behind Suvabrata Chakraborty’s death, one Rakhal Bera, a close aide of Adhikari told them that Adhikari was unhappy. Incidentally, Bera has already been arrested by the Kolkata Police in early June in connection with a job racket. He is now in custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cid-starts-probe-into-alleged-suicide-of-suvendu-ahikari-s-security-guard-in-2018-101626109611655.html

Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The demand for a special general body meeting to discuss the development plan came from the elected members.” Political lines are being clearly drawn, and re-drawn, over the 23 villages merged into the PMC, not least because of civic elections due later in the year, At a recent meeting attended by the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and Pune’s guardian minister, it was decided a development plan created by the PMRDA (Pune Metropolitian Region Development Authority) for the villages would be adopted by the PMC. Suggestions and objections to the plan would then be invited. Leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar said, “We have issued a whip to all BJP members to remain present for the special GB.” Chandrakant Patil, state unit president of the BJP is also of the view that the development plan for the merged villages should be prepared by the PMC, with no interference from the Urban development department or the PMRDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-calls-special-general-body-meet-on-july-15-101626107088360.html

Police said the young man left behind a note that linked his decision to the taunts that he had to suffer for the murders allegedly committed by his brother.The man used to run a tea stall in Betul, a little over 150 km from state capital Bhopal.

Manisha Shekatkar, executive engineer of PMC water supply department said, “We have tabled a proposal in the CIC to raise a demand for five TMC water from Mulshi dam. We mentioned in the proposal that a total of 23 villages have been merged into the corporation. Khadakwasla dam has been overstressed, due to the merger of villages, the PMC water demand has increased and we need a separate water source to quench the thrust of the increasing population. We have raised the demand to the state government through this proposal.” She further said, “At present, we tabled a proposal in CIC. It will be sent to the state government for approval. After the state government approval, we will take the decision to carry out further processes.” Khadakwasla irrigation division of the water resource department wants to reduce the water quota of 2.5 TMC from Khadakwasla dam as the city is getting that much water from Bhama-Askhed dam. During the inauguration of Bhama-Askhed water supply project in PMC, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had instructed a committee to submit a report to fetch water from Mulshi dam which is around 40 kilometres away from Pune city. After that, the state water resource department appointed a committee headed by retired irrigation secretary Avinash Surve to study the issue and submit a report to the government. The committee was supposed to submit a report in April 2021; however, the committee received an extension. The state government appointed two senior officials of the water resource department retired and posts are vacant. Avinash Surve, committee chairman said, “We have-not submitted a report to the state government. We need two reports, one from Maharashtra state Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) and another from Tata Power Company. For this project, the state government will have to approach the water tribunal and convince them about the requirement of drinking water in Pune city.” The Mulshi dam water is controlled by a private company, Tata which utilizes the water for hydroelectricity generation. The hydropower project located in Mulshi was established in 1927.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-raises-demand-for-five-tmc-water-from-mulshi-dam-for-city-101626106428320.html

The arrested man was identified as Raghunath Rajaram Yemul (48), a resident of Dhawalgiri Apartment, Ivory Estates in Baner area of Pune. Yemul was remanded to police custody. The case was registered against Ganesh alias Kedar Gaikwad, his father Nanasaheb Gaikwad, their family members, and one bodyguard. However, the police also arrested Yemul in it for provoking the 36-year-old man to leave his wife by making him believe that it if he remained married to the complainant, he would never become an MLA or a minister. “Because of this, he asked her to get a divorce from her and take custody of their son. He asked the family to use a lemon he had given to them in order to rid the family of bad omens. The family believed him and began physically and mental abuse. In the 21st century, members of the well-known family believed such things and mistreated a highly educated woman,” read a statement by the police. A case under Sections 498(a), 354, 392, 323, 325, 406, 420, 506, 120(b), 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 3 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was registered at Chaturshringi police station. Invoke Anti Black-magic Act: ANiS The workers of Andhashradha Nirmoolan Samiti (ANiS), a non-government organisation (NGO) started by slain rationalist and anti-superstition activist Dr Narndra Dabholkar, have demanded that the anti-black magic act be invoked in the case. Dr Dabholkar, who was shot dead in Pune, was instrumental in formulation of the law. “A woman in Pune has been beaten up mercilessly along with physical and mental torture. More seriously, a spiritual guru Raghunath Yemul has told the family that this woman is a bad omen, will bring bad luck, and her time of birth is wrong. He subjected her to superstitious customs. This is a serious case. ANiS urges the Maharashtra government and police to take strict action,” said Prashant Potdar of ANiS. “The police have arrested him, but they have not invoked the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013. This case clearly falls under its ambit,” said Milind Deshmukh of ANiS. Another case against Gaikwad When the case was registered at Chaturshringi, a case of attempted murder was also registered against the father-son duo at Hinjewadi police station. In that case, the complainant woman has alleged that her husband fired a gun at her. She was not injured in the firing, according to the police.

Another consignment of 1.09 lakh doses of Covaxin is scheduled to arrive on July 15, as per the supply schedule. A total of 7,42,450 doses of Covishield and Covaxin are expected in the next three days by July 15, the official said. The state has not received a single vial of Covaxin this month, leading to its shortage and causing panic among those due for the second dose. Bihar recorded its lowest vaccinations on Sunday when it administered only 18,064 doses due to shortage of vaccines. This was the lowest single-day vaccination so far after the state peaked on July 2, when it administered 6,81,776 doses. “We have already informed the Centre about the shortage of Covid-19 vaccines, which is hampering our vaccination drive. The Centre has assured us to make available vaccines soon,” said the official. The Centre has allocated a total of 90 lakh doses of vaccines to the state in July, of which 67 lakh doses have to be administered through government channel, while the remaining through private facilities. The state has received around 30 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far this month, the official said. Bihar launched a mega vaccination drive from July 1, setting itself a target to administer 4.54 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine four days a week till December 31 in its endeavour to inoculate its the 7.22 crore adult target population in six months. However, erratic supply of vaccines has pegged back its vaccination campaign. Barring July 2, it could achieve its daily vaccination target on July 8, when 4,84,673 doses were administered to beneficiaries. Efforts to reach executive director State Health Society, Bihar, Manoj Kumar, also the state nodal officer for vaccination, proved futile as he did not respond to phone calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-centre-fails-to-supply-vaccine-as-per-schedule-101626105288211.html

12-07-2021||Patna||SC agrees to hear Bihar govt’s plea against acquittals in Senari massacre case||The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine an appeal by the Bihar government against the Patna High Court’s judgment which acquitted 14 people convicted for the infamous Senari massacre in which 34 people were killed allegedly by Maoist groups in 1999. A bench comprising Justices Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari issued notices to all 14 acquitted by the HC on May 21 this year. The state government, through its counsel Abhinav Mukerji, has challenged the HC order while arguing that it did not consider the testimonies of 23 eyewitnesses, of which 13 are those who lost their family members and three who were themselves injured in the incident. After nearly 17 years of trial, a Jehanabad court had held 14 accused guilty and sentenced 11 of them to death and three to life imprisonment in two separate judgments delivered on November 15 and November 18, 2016. Altogether 34 men were allegedly dragged out of their homes by the armed members of the outlawed and now-defunct Maoist group Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) in Senari village of Jehanabad district (now in Arwal) on the night of March 18, 1999, by the assailants wearing police uniform. It was widely believed that the MCC had struck at Senari to avenge the killing of more than 60 of its alleged sympathisers at Laxmanpur Bathe less than two years ago, when the dreaded Ranvir Sena, a militia of upper castes, had carried out the worst ever carnage in the history of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sc-agrees-to-hear-bihar-govt-s-plea-against-acquittals-in-senari-massacre-case-101626105229035.html

Else, people may not be able the able to reap the benefits of development measures taken by governments. It’s welcome move,” said Kushwaha, who began his statewide tour of Bihar from West Champaran’s Valmikinagar on Saturday. Kushwaha’s statement came a day after chief minister Yogi Adityanath released Uttar Pradesh’s Population Policy 2021-2030 on the occasion of World Population Day on Sunday in Lucknow. The policy is apparently aimed at bringing down the fertility rate. The JD (U) leader said he would collect feedback on the flood situation and relief measures announced by the state government for flood and Covid victims during his statewide tour.

Laws alone can’t check population. It was found after a lot of research work that the rate of reproduction comes down effectively if women are educated. Bihar has experimented with this by promoting education among girls and achieved success. If it continues, the state would have a negative growth of population after 2040.”“There are some exceptions. But overall, girls’ education has yielded good results in the state,” Kumar said.The CM once again made a pitch for total prohibition in the country while responding to a query over the Delhi high court’s observation that the time has come to go for the uniform civil code, which was provided for in the directive principles of the Constitution. Though the CM refrained from commenting on the court’s observation, he said the government should care for other suggestions made under the directive principles as well. “Uniform civil code pertains to Article 44 of the constitution, while Article 47 contained the provision for total prohibition,” Kumar said.Around 200 petitioners met the CM during the programme grievances pertaining to different departments. Majority of complaints were related to health and education departments. Dilapidated state of hospitals and non-availability of doctors in rural areas, denial of benefits to students through the government’s credit card scheme, etc were raised during the programme. The CM gave directions to concerned the officers present during the programme to resolve them promptly.The CM was taken aback when a student hailing from the extremely backward class (EBC) alleged that many students had been left to fend for themselves after the scholarship amount was slashed during their study period.A woman petitioner alleged her gold pendant was stolen in the middle of Janata Darbar. Another student claimed he was not being granted credit card loan to pursue course of mass communication and journalism in Gaya, even though his friends in other districts were getting in. A few other complaints related to the government’s failure to offer job on compassionate grounds and non-payment of rent for buses hired by the district administration during the assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-frowns-at-law-route-to-curb-population-101626105108195.html

Delhi chief minister (CM) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal’s promise of free electricity supply of up to 300 units each to all the households may have been brushed aside as a “political gimmick” by both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, both the parties have made similar promises already.In fact, state power minister Harak Singh Rawat recently announced free power supply of up to 100 units to all the households. Former CM and Congress national general secretary Harish Rawat had said, way back in 2019, that if voted to power in 2022, Congress would provide free electricity of up to 100 units in the first year followed by 200 units of free power from the second year of the five-year tenure. Also Read | Over 5k people arrive in Har Ki Pauri on Sunday, police ramps up border checkingOn Sunday, Kejriwal also added that AAP would also ensure 24-hr electricity supply to all the households along with free supply to the farmers. He also promised to waive all the pending electricity bills. Experts said with its announcement, AAP got the reaction it wanted. Political analyst and professor of political science in Garhwal Central University in Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal, MM Semwal said, “AAP, which is still very new in the state the political scenario of Uttarakhand made such an announcement to become the talk of town ahead of elections. And they succeeded very well in that.” “Whether they win the elections in 2022 is a different matter, but they have got the attention of the people and both the major parties that were earlier calling it irrelevant in the state politics. They have started a debate on the free power issue in state with the people talking about it now,” said Semwal. Political analyst SMA Kazmi said, “Kejriwal’s announcement was a very well thought move with months left for the next assembly elections...He has actually done that in Delhi where people are getting free water and free power supply up to 200 units.”Meanwhile, the Congress and BJP tried to downplay the announcement. Congress state president Pritam Singh said, “Kejriwal made the announcement because he knows AAP has no political ground in the state. Hence, he made it before the elections which is just a political gimmick. People of Uttarakhand are smart enough not to get trapped in such lucrative promises.” On whether his own party has a similar promise for the electorate, he said, “The Congress will make only those promises which it can fulfil after winning. Not like AAP [without any proper analysis].” BJP state president Madan Kaushik too termed AAP as irrelevant and said, “Their false promises won’t benefit in Uttarakhand where people are well aware. AAP did nothing in the state politics and is making such promises with the hope to get some votes. Both AAP and Congress would be rejected by the people in 2022.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/aapspromise-of-free-power-sparks-debate-inuttarakhand-101626101509018.html

Such is the arbitrariness of the dismal orders,” the Hurriyat said in a statement.On Saturday, officials said that the administration has sacked 11 government employees, including sons of Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin, for alleged links with militant organisations. The employees were sacked without any inquiry and can approach a high court for relief.People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday termed the government action as criminal.“GOI continues disempowering people of J&K in the garb of pseudo nationalism by trampling the constitution that ought to be upheld. The abrupt dismissal of 11 employees on flimsy grounds is criminal. All policy decisions vis a vis J&K are taken with the sole objective of punishing Kashmiris,” she had said.The Hurriyat alleged that after August 2019 the new laws introduced and being implemented by the government, deprive the people of J&K of employment opportunities in their own land.“Now, with such arbitrary actions, even those employed are uncertain about their future and live in fear of being removed in this abrupt manner,” the statement said.“This is an absolute abuse of power. In times of covid when economic hardship faced by people is on the rise, the rulers of the land are least thoughtful of the consequences such harsh actions will have on those dismissed and their families,” it said.The separatist conglomerate asked the government to revoke this “authoritarian” order or give those dismissed a fair chance to challenge the charges if any, levelled against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/abuse-of-power-hurriyat-on-sacking-of-j-k-govt-employees-101626099769365.html

Solapur superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute said, “No devotee is allowed to enter Solapur district and mainly Pandharpur between July 17 and 25 this year.” After launching search operations over reports of devotees having already arrived and staying at ashrams in Pandharpur, Solapur police have appealed to them to leave the temple town. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Monday issued instructions regarding the Eid festival. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “Citizens cannot offer Eid namaz at public places and should keep the celebrations at home only. The animal markets would remain closed and citizens should either buy it online or through telephone to avoid crowd.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shirdi-pandharpur-temples-closed-for-devotees-eid-celebrations-at-home-101626099707795.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray, Ajit Pawar tracking my moves: Congress' Nana Patole||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said on Monday leaders of the ruling alliance in Maharashtra of which his party is also a partner are keeping a watch on his movement. Patole said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray of the Shiv Sena and home minister Ajit Pawar from the NCP receive an intelligence report every morning and are shaken by the Congress’ moves to resurrect itself. Later, he said his comments have been misinterpreted and he would soon clarify the matter.Addressing party workers at a meeting in Lonavala, said, "Every morning at 9, an intelligence report is submitted to the chief minister and the home minister on what is happening in the state. The Congress is resurrecting itself and the report is making the ground beneath their feet slip away. I am here in Lonavala and this report will go to them," Patole was quoted as saying by PTI.He further said the Congress is re-establishing itself in Maharashtra and that is creating a “disquiet” among the other allies of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Also Read: Small person, won’t react, says Pawar over Patole’s claimHours later, he said he did not mean the state government was keeping a watch on him. "My allegations were against the Centre. I will issue a clarification when I return to Mumbai,” he said.Patole, who contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket before joining the Congress in 2018, has been in the news for some time now over his comments on the coalition government. Last month, he told reporters that “MVA was formed in 2019 for five years to stop the BJP. This is not a permanent fixture. Every party has the right to strengthen its organisation and the Congress has always given priority to providing relief to COVID-19 affected people by making available blood, oxygen and plasma at various places".He was in the news again this week for asking party workers to appoint “our people” as the guardian minister of Pune, a post which Ajit Pawar holds. NCP chief Sharad Pawar soon hit back saying, "I do not get into these things. These are small (junior) people. Why should I speak on it? If (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi says something, then I will speak”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-ajit-pawar-tracking-my-moves-congress-nana-patole-101626093129168.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Lost and found: Slide rule, peace of mind after war||The 1965 war had not started, yet, but was expected any time since the army was visible in the countryside everywhere and the people were eager to see action. USAID and UNESCO organised 10-week Summer Institutes at Chandigarh in collaboration with Panjab University under the munificent PL 480 funds. Two accomplished professors from America, Dr Metzner and Father Dressel, had been appointed to conduct the physics programme of daily lectures, demonstrations, practical and weekly tests. About 80 of us had been selected after a rigorous test. The institute was a picture of highly organised lectures well supported by slides and demonstrations. The 10 weeks flew like a long cruise and we were awarded certificates of participation, sets of books summarising each lecture, expensive slide rules and the summer school ended. The schools reopened in late August. We were brimming with the curiosity to lace our lessons with snippets from America’s Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC) course. In the last week of August 1965, I got myself deputed to buy some much-needed new equipment and minor apparatuses from Ambala Cantt. I remember I bought like an eager student but taking care to select only quality items, all made in England. I bought even a 3-ft teaching model of slide rule (a calculating device used by engineers then) because it had been introduced in the new school curriculum. Perhaps, I bought more than I could handle personally. However, I reached Ambala Cantt railway station in a rickshaw. It was almost evening and there were few passengers amid a complete blackout. Trains steamed in slowly and quietly. My train, a slow, Amritsar-bound Dehradun passenger, arrived, pulled by a steam locomotive like other trains but its head light was kept at faint low beam. Even the analogue signals had been covered with long hoods. The train steamed out slowly and when it reached Amritsar, it was past midnight, perfectly dark, no sound, no coolies and no local transport. Nothing of the sort, till I saw a cycle rickshaw and reached home. After a couple of days, the much-awaited action the people had been anticipating, started. News of our army tanks having broken into the border gate and pounding Lahore came from milk vendors and border students. Dog fights of PAK Sabre jets and India’s tiny Gnats were daily events watched from rooftops. All schools had been closed but ours remained open because there was no headmaster to order closure. Ultimately, the cantonment authorities got it closed because boys would gather on the terrace and watch gun-hit enemy aircraft winging downward like a feather. After the ceasefire, normalcy returned and schools reopened. With a curious and excited mind, I went into the lab to take stock of my purchases from Ambala made three weeks before. Shockingly, there were many items missing, including some expensive apparatuses. Obviously, I had lost them while deboarding the train in pitch dark, but couldn’t share my grief with anyone. I was a confused lot. I came home all worried about the loss and the risk of losing my job. The next day, while pedalling past the railway station, I casually shambled in to platform No. 1 and looked into the lost property office (LPO), just in case. Believe it or not, I discovered my bag sitting on the top shelf, including the king-size slide rule, all staring at me like a lost child, among a pair of umbrellas, a paraffin stove and a bag of clothes. I had just to pick it up, no formality, nothing of the sort as such. Imagine my relief and peace of mind, after the war. prof.mohansingh@yahoo.in The writer is a retired professor in Amritsar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lost-and-found-slide-rule-peace-of-mind-after-war-101626093288092.html
12-07-2021||Patna||Criminals shoot at petrol pump cashier, loot ₹48 lakh||Unidentified criminals shot at a Reliance petrol pump’s cashier and looted ₹48 lakh from him near Siris More on National Highway-2 under Barun police station of Bihar’s Aurangabad district on Monday, officials said.The injured, Ram Niwas Singh, a resident of Japla in Jharkhand, along with another staff, was on his way to Dehri branch of Punjab National bank to deposit the cash of Reliance Petrol pump when four criminals on two bikes shot at him and fled with the cash, Aurangabad SP Sudhir Kumar Porika said.“Ram Niwas Singh, was attached with Radiant Security Company and worked at Reliance Petrol pump, received a gunshot injury on his shoulder and is undergoing treatment at Jamuhar Narayana Hospital,” SP Porika said.The SP said the criminals had probably been following the employees from the petrol pump itself. He said police had got some CCTV camera footage of the suspects and were working to ascertain their identities.Porika said though only one empty cartridge was recovered from the spot, they came to know that criminals had fired several rounds during the incident.“The money was collected from sales on Sunday,” he added.According to the injured, he along with Arun Kumar, left the pump on a Bolero jeep at around 12 pm to deposit the cash when bike-borne criminals intercepted and forced them to hand over the bag at pistol point. “When I resisted their attempt, one of them fired and snatched the bag containing cash,” he said. The victim then informed the police, who have lodged a case and have started the investigations.Meanwhile, Bihar Petroleum Dealers’ Association general secretary Bijendra Sinha said they have become a soft target for criminals. “Though we have been asked to get security cover from the police station concerned, practically it is impossible as there are multiple petrol pumps under one police station,” he said.Sinha said it would be better to develop some mechanism that money from all pumps under one police station is collected and police escort it to a bank. “There is no option for us but to continue depositing money as until oil companies are paid, they won’t deliver us fuel,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/criminals-shoot-at-petrol-pump-cashier-loot-rs-48-lakh-101626093227754.html

We are politely urging pilgrims and tourists to ensure they get tested for Covid-19 as its mandatory requirement to enter Uttarakhand,” said SHO Shyampur Anil Chauhan. An increase in the arrival of vehicular traffic is being witnessed for the past two weeks in Haridwar since Covid-19 curfew norms were relaxed and inter-state transport was allowed. At Chidiyapur-Shyampur check post, on the border of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, on an average daily basis, 300-400 vehicles of pilgrims and tourists are arriving. Additional barricades have been put and police personnel have been deployed at the border check posts. According to Station House officer Shyampur Anil Chauhan, on Monday hundred-odd vehicles were sent back hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana for not having a negative RT-PCR report conducted within 72 hours of their arrival. The administration has now also charted weekend specific traffic plans taking into account the past two weekend’s rush at Har Ki Pauri and the national highway stretch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/over-5k-people-arrive-in-har-ki-pauri-on-sunday-police-ramps-up-border-checking-101626092507609.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal Police renew strategy to clamp down on illegal mining||With illegal mining in the riverbeds and rivulets of Himachal Pradesh continuing unabated, the Himachal Pradesh Police have reworked their strategy to curb the malpractice. The problem is grave in border districts of Una, Kangra, Chamba, Sirmaur and Solan. The banks of the Ravi, Beas, Swan, Sutlej and Mand rivers are affected. Also read: IMD alerts: Heavy rainfall to continue in Himachal, Uttarakhand for 2 daysChief minister Jai Ram Thakur had recently taken a notice of the issue and ordered stringent action against the people involved in illegal mining. Himachal Pradesh director general of police Sanjay Kundu, who recently visited the border districts to review the situation, has issued an advisory on illegal mining to range inspector generals and superintendents of police. “In recent years, the sand mining industry has grown exponentially as a major economic activity due to the spurt in construction and urban expansion. Due to deforestation, incidents of flashfloods have increased,” Kundu said. A survey found that despite the ban, indiscriminate mechanical mining is going on unabated and the mined material is being smuggled into other states, causing loss to the state exchequer. “The industry is often patronised by local strongmen who are resourceful, and more often than not, they are also mixed up with the local law enforcement agencies,” he said. Increased presence, tech in vulnerable areas So far, the Himachal Pradesh Police have been carrying out legal action under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act and Rules, but such action has been insufficient to prevent illegal and indiscriminate mining, particularly that of sand. “Therefore, it is imperative that we widen the scope of police action to offer a greater deterrent to such illegal mining. The deterrent action has to include both increased presence in the vulnerable areas and more efficient and directed use of technology and criminal prosecution,” he said. Going after the big fish with robust intelligence Under the new strategy, the districts will focus on catching the big mining mafia. “These people will work from behind the curtain and can be tied to offences only with methodical investigation. A robust intelligence will be developed for which mobile data of vulnerable areas can be analysed to find out movements during odd hours,” Kundu said. He stressed on better liaison with neighbouring states so that intelligence is shared in real-time. CCTVS will be installed at particular locations to study movement of vehicles and if possible, drones will be used. District police heads have been directed that the team deployed to check mining activities should comprise of personnel of integrity headed by a gazetted officer. “Safety of personnel is of prime importance and therefore they should be well-armed, trained to handle the weapon being carried and wear body armour,” he said. The DGP said in the past three years and five months up to May 31, 2021, the state police issued 25,437 challans of illegal mining of which 21,597 were impounded and a fine of ₹15.85 crore was realised. A total of 101 cases were registered of which 94 are pending in court and offenders have been convicted in two cases and five are under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-police-renew-strategy-to-clamp-down-on-illegal-mining-101626090527417.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||IMD alerts: Heavy rainfall to continue in Himachal, Uttarakhand for 2 days||Heavy rainfall is likely in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Monday and the next two days as rains lashed several states in north India, causing flash floods and deaths due to lightning strikes, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Flash floods and cloudbursts were reported near Bhagsunag in Himachal Pradesh’s Dharamshala and landslides in the hill state’s Kangra district. At least six houses were swept away and over 10 people are feared trapped after the landslide hit Kangra. And, more than 60 people lost their lives to lightning strikes amid heavy rainfall in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.IMD's senior scientist K Jenamani said on Monday that the monsoon has covered most parts of Rajasthan and some parts of Punjab. “For Delhi, conditions continue to remain favourable and we’re monitoring the situation. Monsoon is active in peninsular India, parts of north India, including Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.As per IMD’s latest bulletin, conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over Delhi, some parts of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, and the remaining parts of Uttar Pradesh on Monday.Here is a list of key IMD alerts due to the monsoon:1. Isolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, and northwest Uttar Pradesh, among others, during the next two days.

12-07-2021||Bhopal||Over 47,000 private schools in MP suspend online classes indefinitely||More than 47,000 private schools in Madhya Pradesh suspended online classes for an indefinite period on Monday to stress on their demands, including restoration of their recognition and resumption of physical classes for Classes 9 to 12, news agency PTI reported.The president of the MP Private School Association, Ajeet Singh, said that their decision to suspend classes indefinitely comes after they failed to get a response from the state government. There are nearly 45,000 private schools in Madhya Pradesh, which are affiliated to the Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE), and 2,800 come under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The MP Private School Association is the umbrella body of about 45,000 MPBSE-affiliated schools in the state, PTI reported.Singh said that their primary demands were that authorities renew recognition certificates of already closed schools for five years, instead of one, and also cease inspecting these educational institutions. “Looking at the losses that we have incurred, the state government should not charge the annual school recognition fee during these testing times," he was quoted as saying by PTI.Singh added that under the Right to Education (RTE) act, the state government provides education to the underprivileged children, and the government is “supposed to pay” for it; hence they should pay the dues pending with the schools, the PTI report added.Meanwhile, the president of another private school association that has around 2800 CBSE-affiliated schools under its ambit confirmed that they have also suspended online classes from Monday onwards. “Among other things, we want resumption of physical classes for standards IX to XII immediately. When all other things have reopened, why are senior classes in schools not being allowed to re-open?" VR Modi asked, according to news agency PTI.According to the PTI report, MP school education minister Inder Singh Parmar and education commissioner Jayashree Kiyawat couldn’t be reached for their comments over the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/over-47-000-private-schools-in-mp-suspend-online-classes-indefinitely-101626087965130.html

12-07-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: With fuel prices touching new highs, low bus fares can be a game changer||Rising fuel prices perhaps overshadowed an important local story last week, when the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) started its special air-conditioned bus service running through some of the most congested parts of Pune central. The highlight of this new bus transport service is that, the PMC-controlled public transport body, the PMPML, will charge only ₹10 for a ticket that will be valid for the entire day and a commuter can travel the central parts of the city. The decision is likely to increase transit ridership as petrol has reached ₹105 per litre, and diesel, ₹96 per litre. The service, if operated smoothly with increased frequency, can also provide a strong alternative to private transport that often leaves central parts of Pune congested, heavily polluted, and a nuisance for pedestrians. The PMC had earlier started the ATAL service through the PMPML, in which commuters can travel 5 km for Rs5. While the service was a hit among commuters, frequent restrictions and closure of schools and colleges, put the breaks on it. Keeping in mind the proposed no-parking policy that PMC is waiting to implement, the new service designed for congested areas like the peths, where the PMC will later go in for a pay-and-park service, will discourage citizens from driving private vehicles on congested roads. These central parts house various businesses, including cloth markets on Bajirao road, Laxmi road and Kumthekar road. A large number of students also throng the nearby wholesale market for books at Appa Balwant chowk, stationary items in Raviwar peth, electrical and electronics in Budhwar peth, automobile parts in Rasta peth, the hardware and timber market on Shankarsheth road, the utensils market in Ghorpade and Shukarwar peth. For women, the famous Tulsibaug market and Mahatma Phule vegetable market are a favourite. The central part of the city also has various religious places including the famous Shreemant Dagdusheth Ganesh temple and the Kasba ganesh temple. It has historical monuments such as Shaniwarwada, Vishrambaug wada and Lal Mahal. The PMC’s decision to engage only CNG buses on the nine routes in the central part of the city with ₹10 as the fare will reduce air pollution, lower traffic congestion and free footpaths. Once successful, the PMC plans to expand the service to other parts of Pune, which has 3.9 million private vehicles, almost equivalent to its population. On one hand, when PMC has lowered bus fares, the rising fuel prices are unlikely to reduce anytime soon. The increased prices have hit the poor even harder as they find it difficult to buy vegetables and groceries, which have also seen a price rise in a cascading effect. There have been demands to lower taxes – India is among the countries that levies the maximum taxes on fuel by the Centre and state. While both are unlikely to reduce the taxes given that government coffers have been emptied due to the pandemic and its impact on economy, they can further cross-subsidise the fares, making public transit even cheaper. This will help environment, and be a sustainable solution for various cities including Pune and its citizens, beset as it is with pollution, traffic congestion and high vehicle ownership. The second positive is that it is obviously a more environment-friendly and sustainable solution for the city and its residents, beset as it is with pollution, traffic congestion and high vehicle ownership. A reduction of fares even to May 2017 levels will result in a drop of 25%–33% in us of private vehicles on most commutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-with-fuel-prices-touching-new-highs-low-bus-fares-can-be-a-game-changer-101626086748139.html

They were protesting against the government allotment of a piece of land in an industrial area to Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The Bhopal district industries centre (DIC) handed over the 10,000 sq feet land available for utility in Govindpura Industrial Area (GIA) to LUB for free a month ago for promotion of small and medium scale industries and developing a skill development centre. The GIA opposed the decision, claiming that the DIC handed over a park to LUB, said a district official. GIA has handed over a memorandum to a district collector but refused to talk to media on the issue. GIA president Amarjeet Singh also refused to comment on this issue. Also Read | ‘Covid infection rate decreasing to zero, situation under control’: MP ministerLUB office bearers were laying the foundation stone of their office on the land on Sunday when Congress leaders led by Singh staged a protest there to stop the programme. Police force had to be deployed in the area and the LUB laid the foundation stone amid heavy security. Police resorted to mild force and used water cannons to disperse the protesters. An argument also broke out between Singh and Bhopal deputy inspector general of police, Irshad Wali. Later, Ashoka Garden police registered a First Information Report against Singh, former minister PC Sharma and 200 others under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 147 (rioting) and 269 (spreading disease) of the Indian Penal Code. Singh said, “The state government is harassing common people and handing over land to RSS for free. LUB office bearers cut down at least 30 plants of the park to construct the office. We were staging a peaceful protest but police used force on our workers.” However, district administration and DIC officers said the land allotment was done as per the rules. DIC officer Kailash Manekar said, “In the map, the land was reserved for utility. It is not a park. GIA has been given 44,000 sq feet land and 10,000 sq feet was given to LUB for opening a skill development centre and state office for the promotion of small and medium scale industries.” LUB claimed that the GIA was trying to encroach upon the land by planting saplings there. LUB joint general secretary Sudhir Daate said, “We applied for the land last year in July and received the nod in September but GIA planted about 25 saplings on the land. After registry of the land a month ago, we shifted the plants to other places. The Congress is politicising the matter without a reason.” Local BJP MLA Krishna Gaur said, “The land was allotted to GIA free of cost during the regime of then chief minister Digvijaya Singh and he has a problem in handing it over to another organisation [LUB] for skill development. At a time when the economy is in a bad shape, everyone should support such organisations without creating a controversy.”PTI quoted state medical education minister Vishvas Sarang as saying that the LUB project will provide skill development and create jobs. “This land was allotted to the LUB after considering all the aspects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/digvijaya-singh-booked-for-flouting-covid-norms-during-bhopal-land-site-protest-101626081760389.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Need 3 crore doses per month: Maharashtra health minister highlights vaccine shortage||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said on Monday that the state requires a minimum of three crore doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) each month to inoculate all eligible beneficiaries at the earliest.Maharashtra, which has been the worst hit state from the pandemic in India, has and continues to grapple with a shortage of vaccine doses which has led to the frequent shutting down of vaccination centres across. In May, the Maha Vikas Aghadi led state government announced that it will divert the doses procured for inoculating those between the age of 18 and 44 to give the second dose to 45+ beneficiaries.And just last week, several vaccination centres were shut on June 30 owing to the shortage of doses, Hindustan Times reported. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) suspended the vaccination drive at its centres in Mumbai twice this month, on July 1 and July 9.The frequent suspension of vaccination drives in Maharashtra has also affected the state’s inoculation rate.Speaking to news agency PTI, Tope said on Monday that Maharashtra currently has a capacity to administer doses to 15 lakh people daily but only two to three lakh people are being vaccinated because of the shortage.“Three days ago, we got seven lakh vaccine doses. The stock will be exhausted by the end of the day (July 12). We have got more than 3.60 crore vaccine doses so far and this includes about 25 lakh doses purchased directly by the state government,” the Maharashtra health minister added.As of Sunday, a total of 3,65,25,990 doses have been administered in the state to eligible beneficiaries. On being asked about the scarcity of doses, Tope further told PTI that the authorities are working below their capacity and it is becoming a hand to mouth situation.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/need-3-crore-doses-per-month-maha-health-minister-highlights-vaccine-shortage-101626079465342.html

12-07-2021||Patna||Bihar: 18 cops found protecting illegal sand mining shifted, more under radar||18 Bihar Police officers were transferred after being found to be protecting illegal sand mining mafia in the state, according to a senior officer in the state police headquarters in Patna, who didn’t wish to be named.The development was confirmed by the additional director general (ADG) (headquarters) of police Jitendra Kumar, who said 13 sub-inspectors, four inspectors and an assistant sub-inspector have been shifted to other range on “administrative grounds” without divulging more.However, an officer of the home department, said on condition of anonymity that the transfers are part of a crackdown on illegal sand mining mafia in the state following chief minister Nitish Kumar’s orders,“We have found that despite repeated warnings given to district officials to curb illegal sand mining at various places, the sand mafia continues to excavate sand from various rivers in Patna, Rohtas, Aurangabad, Bhojpur and Saran districts,” the officer quoted above said.He added that following a detailed investigation ordered by the home department, more than 50 government officials including superintendent of police (SPs), sub-divisional officers (SDOs), district transport officers (DTOs), circle officers (COs) were in the firing line for their alleged involvement in illegal sand mining, stone quarrying and transportation that has robbed Bihar of huge revenue but helped the corrupt make a fortune while harming the ecology, the official quoted above said.“It [crackdown] was on cards, and we have taken the step after a proper investigation. A few more officers are on the radar, and we shall not hesitate to take tough actions against any officer who indulges in corrupt practices,” he added.Another home department official aware of the developments said that the lid of the alleged cop-politician-sand mafia nexus was blown after top police officers made surprise visits to illegal mining hotbeds to find it thriving with the support of a few administrative and police officers. This led to police headquarters ordering the shifting of 18 police officers including seven station house officers (SHO) out of their present police range.Three SHOs of Bihta, Ranitalab and Paliganj from Patna district, while four from Koilwar, Chandi, Sandesh and Azimabad police stations in Bhojpur district have been shifted out for turning a blind eye to illegal mining and trade in their areas.“The transfers are probably in an attempt to send a message to field officers that they are being watched,” said a senior IPS officer posted at the police headquarters.“Illegal sand mining is not a new phenomenon. It has been going on unabated for years, which clearly points to a nexus, as truck loads of sand are able to find their way despite government’s directions to check. It is a kind of parallel economy, on which the high and mighty thrive. Even during monsoon season, when mining activity is banned, it goes on right under the nose of the administration”, said Jitendra Kumar, a Right to Information (RTI) activist from Chhapra.Earlier on June 19, the Vigilance Investigation Bureau (VIB) arrested Rajesh Kumar, the SHO of Didarganj police station, while taking ₹60,000 as bribe from a transporter of sand and stone chips. ₹559,000 in cash and a few land agreement papers were also recovered from the police officer’s residence in the state capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-18-cops-found-protecting-illegal-sand-mining-shifted-more-under-radar-101626078280588.html

12-07-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand’s Cryptogamic garden of plants from Jurassic era opens to public||Uttarakhand Forest department has dedicated a Cryptogamic garden of ancient plants/organisms, existing since the Jurassic era, that grow without seeds and flowers, to the public on Sunday. It was built in the Deoban area of Dehradun district at a height of 2,700 metres. Cryptogam are plants or plant-like organisms that reproduce by spores, without producing flowers or seeds. Uttarakhand forest department’s research wing developed the Cryptogamic garden over three acres of land with 75 species of such plants and plant-like organisms (in case of fungi) belonging to six different groups. The forest officials said the aim of developing the garden was to create awareness and display the diversity of ancient Himalayan flora in the state. The garden was dedicated to the public by Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities. Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests and in-charge (research wing) said such ancient plants need pollution-free area and moisture to grow. “After searching for the right area, we finally found Deoban, which is pollution-free and has pristine forests of Deodar and Oak”, he said He said Cryptogam, which comes from Greek, means hidden reproduction as these ancient plants need no seeds, nor flowers to reproduce. “Cryptogamic plants include Algae, mosses, liverworts, lichens, ferns and fungi and they reproduce by spores”, he said. Chaturvedi said these plants have various commercial uses about which most people know very little. “Algae, being rich in vitamins and minerals are also used as a food ingredient in many countries. It is also used as a liquid fertilizer as it helps in repairing the level of nitrogen present in the soil. Many algae species are used in making medicines. Brown algae like Laminaria, Sargassum are good sources of iodine”, he said. He added that Bryophytes which include liverworts and mosses are reliable indicators and monitors of air pollution and help in the prevention of soil erosion as they bind to the rocky surfaces. “In the case of lichens, some are used as ingredients in dishes like Hyderabadi biryani. They are also used in making medicines, dyes and perfumes and cosmetics”, he said “Fungi species are used in many household and industrial processes, like the making of bread, wine, beer, and certain cheeses”, he said. Chaturvedi said Uttarakhand was very rich in such plants with 539 species of lichens, 346 species of algae, 478 species of bryophytes and 365 species of pteridophytes found in the state. Earlier this year, in its initiative to protect Himalayan flora, Uttarakhand forest department also created a repository of 1,576 plant species including 73 threatened, rare and vulnerable species, aimed at their germplasm conservation, so that these species remain conserved in case they disappear from the wild due to any reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhands-cryptogamic-garden-of-plants-from-jurassic-era-opens-to-public-101626076720415.html

12-07-2021||Patna||Unseasonal yatras, JD(U)-LJP slugfest keep political pot boiling in Bihar||Parliamentary board president of Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal United (JD-U), Upendra Kushwa has launched a yatra with a vow to catapult the party into the forefront of national politics. This the second unseasonal political yatra, taken out close on the heels of Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan’s Ashirvad Yatra, within a year of assembly election results which returned a weakened Nitish Kumar into power with the opposition making bold predictions of a mid-term elections in the state.While this kind of political muscle flexing may also be considered unusual during the rainy season, it is not without reason since Nitish Kumar led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s razor-thin majority in the 243-member state assembly could be put to test during the forthcoming monsoon session of the assembly starting July 26. Political experts say strong undercurrents are affecting Bihar’s politics as seen in the JD-U getting just one Union cabinet berth, a number it had refused in 2019; and LJP rebel Pashupati Kumar Paras too making it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ministry with Chirag Paswan calling it a result of a conspiracy by Nitish Kumar to split the LJP. In such a fluid situation, JD-U has been busy with strengthening the organisation while protecting its severely depleted turf. This was evidenced recently when on one hand it tried to shore up its numbers by inducting three floaters but on the other, it also made extra effort to win back party MLA Manjeet Singh, who was made the state vice president after he threatened to quit. CM Nitish Kumar has also decided to revive his weekly programme Janata Ke Durbar me Mukhya Mantri after five years. It is likely to give him a platform to counter the opposition narrative of the state’s failure to manage the pandemic and the floods. Political analyst Nawal Kishore Choudhary said that Bihar politics was witnessing intense mind games with attempts to out-manoeuvre one-another.“One thing is clear that we are witnessing a weakened Nitish Kumar when it comes to his bargaining power with the Centre, which may have its roots in his poor show in the assembly election. He wants to regain his strength, but that is not easy in the present circumstances. I will not be surprised if there was some tacit understanding between chief minister Nitish Kumar and the BJP top brass,” Choudhary said. While the BJP does not want to yield any more ground to Nitish Kumar, whose party could only win 43 seats, it also does not want to alienate another ally after having seen Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena walk out of the alliance.“There appears to be a balancing act from both the sides as things are delicately poised in Bihar politics and none of the two can afford to take greater risk,” Choudhary added. Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences DM Diwakar said the political parties in the state were currently in a state of flux. “It is just to keep themselves in the memory of the masses with glib talk or attacks. BJP is happy sitting quiet, as issues like fuel price or inflation are not on anyone’s agenda. It also does not want to threaten Nitish Kumar, who also is not interested in pushing for his claims at a stage when chips are down for him,” Diwakar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/unseasonal-yatras-jd-u-ljp-slugfest-keep-political-pot-boiling-in-bihar-101626074620286.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||8 months after complaint, Punjab MLA Simarjit Bains booked for rape||Punjab legislator and Lok Insaaf Party chief Simarjit Singh Bains, 51, was booked for raping a 45-year-old woman in Ludhiana on Monday. The woman had lodged a complaint against Bains eight months ago and had been protesting outside the office of the commissioner of police in Ludhiana for the past five months, seeking that the rape case be registered against the MLA, who represents Ludhiana’s Atam Park constituency in the assembly. Also read: BJP leaders taken hostage by farmers rescued in PunjabThe case was finally registered at the division number 6 police station on Monday on the directions issued by the district court last week. In his order on July 7, additional chief judicial magistrate Harsimranjit Singh said: “Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures. Extreme indeed, are the circumstances in this case at hand. The unsuspecting victim is a hapless woman stricken by adversity who was unabashedly exploited by the so-called saviour and his coterie. With the first responder, police agency having turned a blind eye to her hideous abuse, she knocked the door of the court. The real cause of concern is whether a miserable and poor victim of sexual exploitation be expected to get justice by lodging the private complaint and collecting evidence from a place alien to her and against the perpetrators who are powerful and resourceful. In case the directions for registering of case is not made, the entire case of complainant would crumble and it would tantamount to failure of justice.”. On November 16, 2020, the woman had moved a handwritten application to the commissioner of police for registering the FIR against Bains, Kamaljit Singh, Baljinder Kaur, Jasbir Kaur, Sukhchain Singh, Paramjit Singh, and Gogi Sharma of Ludhiana. The woman alleged that she had come into contact with the MLA in a property dispute but she was trapped. She claimed she received repeated phone calls and WhatsApp messages soliciting physical relationship with her and was raped repeatedly by Bains. Shiromani Akali Dal activists held a protest outside the office of the Ludhiana commissioner of police on Monday, demanding the arrest of Bains. BJP leaders also arrived at the Mini Secretariat to protest against the attack on BJP leaders in Rajpura. The main Ferozepur Road has also been blocked by protesters of both parties and traffic has been diverted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/8-months-after-complaint-punjab-mla-simarjit-bains-booked-for-rape-101626074200336.html

12-07-2021||Chandigarh||BJP leaders taken hostage by farmers rescued in Punjab||Twelve BJP leaders of the party’s Rajpura unit in Patiala district, who had been taken hostage by farmers since Sunday afternoon, were rescued around 4am on Monday after the Punjab and Haryana high court and the Union home ministry intervened. Police used mild lathicharge to disperse the farmers, who had gathered outside a house at Guru Arjan Dev Colony in Rajpura town, 45km from Patiala, and took away Punjab BJP spokesman Bhupesh Aggarwal and general secretary Subhash Sharma, Patiala rural BJP unit president Vikas Sharma and Rajpura unit workers under tight security. Also read: Punjab: Farmers manhandle BJP leaders, hold them ‘hostage’In a midnight hearing urgently convened through video-conferencing, high court judge Suvir Sehgal ordered the safe exit of those illegally detained at the Rajpura house and a compliance report by 2pm on Monday. DC, DIG camp at Rajpura at protest site Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit and Punjab Police deputy inspector general (DIG) Vikramjit Duggal were at the spot since Sunday evening to ensure the safety of the BJP leaders. The protesters had even cut off the electricity supply of the house. They were demanding the registration of a first information report (FIR) against the BJP leaders as one of their bodyguards had taken out a pistol in self-defence while they were protesting. The BJP leaders made several calls to their state and central leaders. “The Union home ministry was apprised of the situation and after their intervention, the police, which was earlier a mute spectator, swung into action,” a BJP leader said, requesting anonymity. Rajpura BJP councillor assaulted, clothes torn Tension prevailed in Rajpura since Sunday morning when agitators disrupted the district-level meeting of the BJP leaders at the Bharat Vikas Parishad in protest against the Centre’s farm laws. Aggarwal, Vikas Sharma and the other leaders were taken to a house adjoining the Bharat Vikas Parishad office, from where a panicky Aggarwal released a video, saying the lives of the BJP leaders was in danger. Police managed to take him and others to safety, but Rajpura BJP councillor Shanti Swarup was not as lucky. While being escorted out by the police, protesters chased and manhandled him and even tore his clothes. The incident was shared on social media. BJP leader blames Congress goons By Sunday evening, the party leadership rushed BJP state general secretary Subhash Sharma to Rajpura to address a press conference. He blamed chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for the situation in the state and said, “Congress goons are trying to intimidate the Hindu minority in Punjab.” As farmers learnt about the press conference at Lions Club, Rajpura, they surrounded it but the police escorted Subhash Sharma to safety. Defiant BJP leaders firm on meeting In the meantime, Aggarwal issued a statement on Sunday evening that the BJP will hold its meeting as planned at the Guru Arjan Dev Colony. Following this, Aggarwal along with Subhash Sharma, Vikas Sharma, Patiala district president Harinder Kohli and other local leaders gathered at the house in Arjun Colony. The protesters laid siege to the house and the police managed to surround the house. In a video from the house, Subhash Sharma alleged that the Congress had sent its workers for the gherao. “It’s like terrorism days in Punjab. Police are not acting against goons,” he said. Protesters say Aggarwal provoked them Rajpura-based farmer leader Prem Singh Bhangu said that Aggarwal had used provocative language and added that the peaceful protesters turned restive in the morning when Aggarwal’s bodyguard pointed his pistol at them. He demanded an apology from the BJP leadership. The DC and the DIG tried to defuse the situation, but the stalemate continued overnight. BJP leaders at the receiving end in PunjabPunjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said: “This is an attack on democracy, and not the BJP. There is lawlessness in Punjab as police have become mute spectators.” Farmers have been targeting BJP leaders and events over the past few months.

12-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Sadar Bazar area shut till Tuesday over violation of Covid-19 norms||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases have been steadily coming down in Delhi. And the state government wants the downward trend to continue.This is the reason why it has been cracking down on places and market areas where Covid norms are violated. Two main markets - Lajpat Nagar and Rui Mandi in Sadar Bazar - were asked to shut down last week after overcrowding and violation of social distancing norms were seen in these areas.The shutdown in Sadar Bazar will continue till Tuesday. The orders were issued on July 10 to keep the part of the market from Bara Tooti Chowk to Qutub Road closed. It will remain closed till 10pm on July 13.In his order, the central district magistrate (DM) stated that shopkeepers, street vendors and even customers were found flouting Covid-19-appropriate behaviour on Saturday. The official noted that such behaviour would lead to “super spreading of the coronavirus”, according to news agency PTI.The DM further pointed out that the move to shut the aforesaid market area was an “immediate and stringent action to curtail the spreading of the virus”.However, the restriction will not be relevant to shops in Sadar Bazar that are dealing with essential goods and services, the order clarified.According to PTI, traders have been directed to submit an action plan before Tuesday to make sure that Covid-19-appropriate behaviour is adopted and maintained in the market area.The order revealed that if any shopkeeper is found not following the closure rule till Tuesday or any act that may cause Covid-19 spread, “necessary action as per law would be taken against him or her under Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC (Indian Penal Code) and other relevant applicable Acts”.This development comes after in recent weeks the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) shut popular Delhi markets, including Laxmi Nagar, Kamla Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, and Karol Bagh, among others, due to violation of Covid-19 protocols.Delhi on Sunday reported 53 new coronavirus cases, taking the cumulative tally of the national capital to 1,435,083, the government’s bulletin revealed. With three new fatalities recorded, the death toll of Delhi has reached 25,015, the bulletin showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-sadar-bazar-area-shut-till-tuesday-over-violation-of-covid-19-norms-101626068480738.html

12-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai misses out as clouds deposit heavy rains off the coast||Despite the weather department’s forecast of Mumbai witnessing “moderate to intense spells of rain” on Sunday night, the city woke up to a drier morning on Monday compared to Sunday, with only 2.8mm rainfall recorded in the 24 hours ending 8:30am.On Sunday, the city had recorded 45.6mm of rain in the 24 hour period with three isolated heavy spells (between 40 to 70m) seen along the Western railway line, IMD data shows.Though doppler radar images from as late as 1:30am showed presence of rain clouds around the city, particularly off the coast, the prevalent wind patterns did not allow for moisture incursion inland, officials and independent meteorologists clarified. The development of a wind shear, with opposing easterly and westerlies, caused Mumbai to miss out on rain over the weekend. As the wind shear moved northward, the formation of an anticyclonic vortex of the coast of Mumbai began causing rain bands to move away from Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and toward the sea.“Half of the active phase of the monsoon is already wasted for MMR. Current model guidance suggests that by 2-4 pm today (Monday), the vortex will be north enough to allow westerlies to resume over Mumbai and suburbs. However, the monsoon trough is not that strong anymore, so only usual heavy rains in Mumbai,” tweeted independent meteorologist Athreya Shetty.This view was echoed by a spokesperson with the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Mumbai, who said, “There will be more rains now in the second half of this week. We had anticipated as much as 200mm of rainfall in about 24 hours between Sunday and Tuesday, but that seems unlikely now. The latest images from our doppler radar in Mumbai at 8.45am show that clouds are still lying off the coast, with some over Raigad district, which received some heavy showers last night.”The city has so far seen 1,109mm of rain since June 1, which is about 37% in excess of the seasonal normal of 801mm. However, since at least July 1, the city has recorded largely deficient rains at a departure of more than -80% of the normal rainfall for the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-misses-out-as-clouds-deposit-heavy-rains-off-the-coast-101626064600244.html

12-07-2021||Patna||Bihar’s artists seek help from Lalit Kala Akademi to tide over Covid crisis||Visual artists in Bihar have requested the National Academy of Arts in Delhi, popularly known as Lalit Kala Akademi, to launch a welfare programme to help them survive the financial impact of Covid-19 pandemic. They have also demanded greater inclusion in exhibitions and art camps held nationally by the academy to revive their earning, which has dried up since March last year, when restrictions on cultural events and exhibitions first kicked in to contain the pandemic outbreak. The artists earlier also approached the Bihar government for financial assistance.Bihar has a large community of visual artists including painters, sculptors and installation art makers apart from craftsmen including for internationally celebrated Mithila and Manjusha art and Sikki craft. It is also home to contemporary art geniuses such as Subodh Gupta, an installation art maker.“As most of these artists and craftsmen have been dependent upon exhibitions, shows, art camps and workshops, they are now in trouble. None of these activities have been held in the last 17 months due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. We want the Central Lalit Kala Akademi to launch a welfare programme for us,” Shyam Sharma, the Padmashree award winning block print artist from Bihar, said.Birendra Kumar Singh, a painter and Bihar Kala Manch secretary, said the visual artists last month gave a memorandum to the state government seeking monthly pension among other assistance. “Bihar chief secretary Tripurari Sharan had assured us of all possible help, but it was still awaited. That is why we have to knock at the doors of the Central Lalit Kala Akademi,” Singh said.Uttam Pacharne, the pro-tem chairman of Lalit Kala Akademi in Delhi, said the institution will plan welfare programmes. “But we are waiting for the artists of the state to send proposals in this connection.”“There is also a plan to organise a National art camp in the state capital [Patna]. Delhi Lalit Kala Akademi has its camp office in the city and the event was being planned there. Altogether 30% artists in the camp will be from the state while the rest will be from other areas. It will provide good financial support and exposure to a wide variety of art styles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-artists-seek-help-from-lalit-kala-akademi-to-tide-over-covid-crisis-101626063460374.html

The routine was suspended in May due to the second wave of pandemic and is being resumed now after the Covid situation in the state has come under control, a government official said. The two hour relaxation in the state-wide night curfew, announced by the CM on Sunday, will also begin from today with curfew timings curtailed from 9pm -7am to 10pm-6am.CM Yogi said on Sunday that the Covid test positivity rate in the state in the past 24 hours was a mere 0.04% and the recovery rate stood at 98.6%.“No fresh cases of Covid were found in 29 districts. Forty-five districts reported fresh cases in single digits. Only one district recorded new cases in double digits. Despite all these improvements, aggressive testing must continue,” he said.The chief minister also said that only 125 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in the state in the past 24 hours taking the number of active cases in the state to 1594.He noted that 37.1 million doses of Covid vaccine had been administered in Uttar Pradesh so far, including 31.3 million first doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-resumes-janata-darshan-as-covid-19-cases-dip-in-the-state-101626060759794.html
12-07-2021||Other||Staff, students restricted from entering IIT Bhubaneswar if not vaccinated||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneswar has imposed restrictions on the entry of students and staff unless they are vaccinated. It has also asked them to submit a “self-declaration every Monday” that no guest arrived at the campus to meet them, and neither did they travel outside the Khordha district where the institute is located.While the government has declared vaccination against Covid-19 “voluntary”, the institute has said that “all the fraternity of IIT Bhubaneswar, including outsourced manpower, mandatorily be inoculated at least one dose of vaccine by July 10, 2021.”It added that even if the staff and students were vaccinated with both doses, their entry to the campus would be restricted if they “visited outside Khordha-Bhubaneswar-Cuttack regions.”“While coming back, (students are) mandatorily required to inform the (Covid) nodal officer (at the institute) and should be at home quarantine for 5 days followed by RT-PCR test (sample of which should be collected on 5th day of quarantine),” the guidelines issued by the institute’s registrar Debraj Rath read.Also Read | Orissa HC orders probe into allegations mismanagement in Covid hospitalsIt further said that guests of any member of the institute needed to follow the same instructions and were also required to undergo “home quarantine for 10 days if both the doses of vaccine are not completed.”“Further, during the quarantine period, the entire host family of the guests must quarantine at home,” the guidelines read.The institute fraternity, however, alleged that the administration was using Covid-19 to issue their “autocratic and arbitrary diktats.”“Actually, this SOP is to put faculties/staff under severe pressure to keep them shut. While hundreds of people are coming and going from the institute every day, they want to terrify their employees so that they can be arbitrarily punished; their lives fully controlled,” said a faculty member of the institute, on condition of anonymity.A scholar at the institute said, “While the government is promoting vaccines as effective, I don’t understand, how a government-funded research and higher education institution can consider vaccines completely unreliable.”He added that the SOPs with “bizarre” restrictions will not just affect employees and scholars, but also their family members. “Imagine a family member such as a son or daughter of an employee studies or commutes to his job in the adjoining district? In effect, he cannot stay with the employee if we go by these guidelines,” he said.Meanwhile, an official from the institute said that vaccination at IIT Bhubaneswar is mandatory in general. “However, it provides exceptions for those who have valid reasons not to do so. [They can] inform IIT [in that case]. In a community, if vaccination is done in part, it will not work and protect. Also, it is not a ritual that we vaccinate. We need to holistically immunise a community,” he said.Asked why a self-declaration was required every Monday, the official said that they needed the information for contact tracing, to control infection effectively and responsibly, and to keep track of those coming in from other states. “Please note that it is a self-declaration that is sought from our staff and students coming from the outside. Without this information readily available how do you act quickly and protect the community?” he said.He added that at the IIT campus, the mechanism was well-controlled through several checks at the entry point. “We have students, families of faculty, staff, much outsourced staff, and 1,000 construction workers living or working on the campus. It is challenging to protect the campus. The campus cannot be Covid-19 free with a casual approach,” the official added.Chandrakant Lahariya, a public health expert and a senior epidemiologist said vaccination should be a priority, but it is not the only protection against Covid-19. He added that enforcing a mandatory vaccination protocol was very impractical.“Not everyone is lucky enough to get a shot instantly. When there is a limited vaccine supply, there are many people who have to wait for a long time before a vaccine is made available to them. So, there is no point of mandating vaccination in such circumstances,” he said.Lahariya added that the restrictions of quarantine of students, of temporary guests and even of their host families is an unrealistic approach. “The biggest problem with our country is that at times the decision to define Covid-19 protocols is made by individuals who have no scientific understanding of the problem,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/staff-students-restricted-from-entering-iit-bhubaneswar-if-not-vaccinated-101626060519725.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi weather: Cloudy sky with a chance of light rain today||With monsoon likely to hit the national Capital this week, Delhi may witness cloudy sky with light rain on Monday as per India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast.The minimum temperature on Monday is likely to be 26 degrees Celsius (°C) while the maximum temperature is predicted to reach 35°C. The minimum temperature on Sunday was 28.8°C – one notch above the normal and the maximum temperature was 39°C– three degrees above the normal.Monsoon forecast by IMD was off the mark for the fourth time this season on Sunday. On Saturday, IMD’s daily bulletin said monsoon rain will take “another 24 hours” to reach the Capital. The bulletin repeated this on Sunday.Also Read | Rain deficiency looms large as monsoon revival remains sluggishThis is the second most delayed monsoon onset in Delhi since the IMD began documenting the arrival dates in 1920. The only time that the arrival of the monsoon was later than this was on July 19, 2002. The usual onset date for Delhi is June 29.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality was in the satisfactory category on Monday morning. Data from Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7am stood at 96. On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI had been 94, which is also in the satisfactory category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.Due to the rain, air quality in the national Capital is also expected to stay in the satisfactory category this week. On Sunday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) said, “The overall air quality is in the satisfactory category as forecasted. Surface winds are moderate and in east southeasterly direction. Increased rainfall activity is likely to influence AQI positively. As part of the advancing monsoon over the region, widespread rainfall is very likely during the next few days.

12-07-2021||Patna||Post-Covid complications rise at AIIMS Patna as new cases go down in Bihar||Number of patients with post-Covid pulmonary cavitation or cavity in the lungs and lung fibrosis or irreversible scarring in the lungs is increasing at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Patna, a designated centre of excellence (CoE) for clinical management of the pandemic in Bihar.“We have already got 30-40 cases of post Covid pulmonary cavitation in the last two months,” said Dr Deependra Kumar Rai, additional professor and head, department of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS-Patna.Such cases mostly show symptoms like persistent cough, chest pain, dyspnea (breathlessness) or hemoptysis (blood in sputum). Patients may have fever with oxygen saturation around the threshold level of 94.Additional professor and head, department of medicine, AIIMS-Patna, Dr Ravi Kirti, said there is a significant rise in patients with post-Covid fibrosis and “fibrosis-like changes” that may regress with time, depending on the severity of scarring.“Patients with post-Covid chest infection, whose oxygen saturation still drops below the threshold limit or those having dry cough and reduced exercise tolerance are increasing. We generally suggest a chest X-ray, sometimes followed by a chest CT scan and spirometry before deciding on further treatment,” said Dr Kirti.Cases of post-Covid pulmonary cavitation are often diagnosed as tuberculosis (TB) and Dr Rai advocates bronchoscopy investigation, especially in case of patients who cannot expectorate phlegm, before prescribing anti-TB drugs or antibiotics to the patient.“Patients are generally referred to us after they have been administered a strong dose of antibiotics, which is ineffective in such cases,’’ said Dr Rai, who is researching on post-Covid pulmonary cavitation.During his research, Dr Rai found that five of the six patients in his sample study had contracted aspergillosis fungal infection while one was a mucormycosis (black fungus) suspect.Dr Rai, however, said the prohibitive pricing of Voriconazole is a deterrent in the treatment of poor patients suffering from aspergillosis fungal infection.“Each tablet costs around ₹850 in the open market, but the same is available for one-third the market rate at AIIMS. We generally prescribe it twice a day for nearly three months to our patients. The government should include some such drugs related to Covid-19 and post-Covid ailments in its essential drug list and supply them to patients through its channel,” said Dr Rai.The AIIMS has played a significant role in the treatment of Covid-19 and post-Covid ailments, including mucormycosis, in the state. Its team of experts, led by additional professor of ENT, Dr Kranti Bhawna, has operated over 100 cases of black fungus.As many as 6,346 Covid-19 patients and suspects have undergone treatment at AIIMS-Patna since March 20 last year, when the state reported its first Covid-19 case. The institute has treated 5,650 patients, with a recovery rate of nearly 80%, after it set up dedicated Covid wards in May 2020, according to Dr Sanjeev Kumar, Covid-19 nodal officer of the institute.Around 1,437 Covid-19 patients were admitted to AIIMS-Patna between April and May, the peak of the second pandemic that saw 29% of the total Covid deaths with 377 out of the total 1,291 patients dying due to Covid-19 at the institute. “July 10 was the first day since the second wave of the pandemic that no sample out of the 2,217 collected for real-time polymerase chain reaction test tested positive,” said Dr Kumar.From 15,853 new infections and 82 deaths on May 1, the number of new Covid cases and deaths has come down to 87 and two, respectively, on July 10. As many as 1,233 cases and 23 deaths have been reported this month against 723,147 cumulative Covid-19 cases and 9,618 deaths so far in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/postcovid-complications-rise-at-aiims-patna-as-new-cases-go-down-in-bihar-101626059199860.html

12-07-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A jamun tree in CP||The ground looks like a fresh battlefield, splattered with blood stains, slippery with hundreds of used bullets. The blood isn’t red, but purple. And the bullets are actually jamuns. They have fallen from the tree above.It’s jamun season in Delhi. The lanes teem with vendors selling these berries. Their straw baskets are piled up with mounds of these soury treats. Posh fruit shops sell the exact same fruit, but neatly stacked inside transparent plastic boxes. Parts of Delhi are full of jamun trees. One evening in Deer Park, a group of folks were spotted shaking its trunk, making the jamuns fall from the branches like a sudden shower, before picking them up.There might be a jamun tree around your house too. But even then you should make a pilgrimage to the aforementioned tree, so generously weighted with its yield. The tree is situated in the commercial heart of Connaught Place, in N Block. It’s so gigantic that its dense foliage makes a virtual roof over the staircase emerging out of the subway. This afternoon, the whole ground under it is covered with jamuns. They all are squashed, probably after being trampled by the feet of busy pedestrians. On looking up, one is blindsided at first by the thousands of green leaves, and wonders where the jamuns are falling from, unable to see them. Gradually, the eyes adjust to notice big clumps of jamuns nestled across the foliage. They look like purple daubs in a green canvas.One wonders how long this tree has been standing here. Can it be older than the colonial-era shopping district it inhabits? After all, Connaught Place was formerly a forest of babool trees. In any case, this jamun must have seen so much change over the years. Its leafy branches are within a kissable distance of what used to be Winpy—the popular hangout of yesteryears that served lamb burgers for 16 rupees. Today, that building lies closed, and the tree faces a small hip cafe that came up not so long ago.Meanwhile, a long row of ants is climbing up the trunk. A broken statue of Goddess Lakshmi is lying at its feet—probably left here because it is not considered a good omen to keep a damaged idol.Some steps away, a woman is selling jamuns. “I get them from Azadpur (wholesale fruit market),” she says, her back turned towards the great jamun tree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-jamun-tree-in-cp-101626035344599.html
12-07-2021||Lucknow||Food joints focusing more on direct delivery!||Multiple food joints are on their way to become ‘atmanirbhar’ and have started self-delivery services in the city. Some of them have discontinued the services of known food aggregators. They have by now strengthened their self-delivery mechanism while some are using organised delivery players for additional turnover and focusing on direct orders. Hazratganj-based famous Bajpai Kachori has withdrawn from online delivery providers. Now, customers queue-up at this food joint to pick their stuff. “Their commission is too high and then our loyal customers have to shell out extra money due to the inflated pricing. So, we decided that we won’t let them make a hole in people’s pockets,” says a salesperson from the joint. Afreen Restaurant in Indira Nagar completely switched to its own delivery system. “We can’t sustain if we give 25-30% to these aggregators. Either we compromise on quality, or we inflate prices which we don’t want to do. So, we are doing self-delivery which is picking up gradually,” says Chef Abdul Haleem. Similarly, Awadh Biryani Corner on Rana Pratap Marg too withdrew from the apps to give added value to their customers. Though cloud kitchens are highly dependent on aggregators, Pepperz chose to do business their way. “We have kept delivery boys and we pay them ₹100 per order and if it’s far-off we add petrol charges. We get big orders from our regular clients so this way we have control on quality, pricing and margin is also taken care of. This way we give buyers better portion in earthen-packing which is a win-win for everyone,” says Chef Zulfiqar Hussain. Players like Mr Brown are getting 25-33% business from their own apps. “We have own order-delivery system and take services of food aggregators as well. Customers are growing on our Danbro app, and our free-delivery system is known to transport cakes in the city. Besides, they are winning points and coupons which is an extra benefit for them,” shares Vikas Malik. Popular sweet shop Chhappan Bhog is also doing good deliveries through their own app. Pawan Agarwal of Kitchen the Food Stop informs that they are balancing both. “We are doing 50% business through our own 20 delivery vehicles. Though increasing own fleet will be an added cost as not all days and months one gets equal business.” Many are opting for both self-delivery as well as aggregator services but certainly their focus is more on self-mechanism. “Orders from aggregators all small-ticket size and commissions are very high. So, we focus more on self-delivery and with God’s grace 70% delivery business we are generating is directly, and these are big orders. At times, we have to switch-off aggregators’ app as our own orders are enough. Since we don’t have to share margins on our own orders, so we are able to give extra value to our customers who in turn repeat direct orders with us,” says Chef Bhasker Mishra of Sassy Canteen in Gomti Nagar. In all self-delivery mechanism, it’s the customers that is gaining in portion and packing quality while restaurants provide are happily getting better margins, he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/food-joints-focusing-more-on-direct-delivery-101626034779607.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||OTT platforms give new lease of life to regional language authors||Shailesh Bharatwasi, the founder of Hind Yugm, a publishing house, which has launched many young Hindi writers in the last few years, is busy writing pitches for production houses. After the success of the recent Grahan, a web series on Hotstar, inspired by Chaurasi, a novel Bharatwasi published three years ago, he has been flooded with requests from production houses to suggest books from his current and backlist that can be adapted into films and web-series for OTT (over-the-top) platforms.“I have already sold the rights to nine novels in the past year and conversations are at an advanced stage for another four,” says Bharatwasi. The Delhi-based Hind Yugm has so far brought out 300 titles, nearly all of them by young, first-time writers. “They are telling the sort of stories that these platforms need”.Also read| Girl power on rise: Female-led stories rule the roost on OTT spaceThe growing popularity of OTT platforms during the pandemic and their search for fresh content has given a boost to writers and publishers, not just in English, but also in regional languages — a trend that publishers say has the potential to significantly shore up revenues and bring into the spotlight young writers in regional languages and introduce their work to a new readership.Their work has got a further fillip, thanks to the advent of several OTT platforms such as Hoichoi, Addatimes, Aha, and Ullu, which focus on regional language content. The OTT platforms’ search for content has also given rise to ‘book story agents’, who act as intermediaries between publishing houses, writers and OTT platforms and production houses.Satya Vyas, the author of the Hindi novel Chaurasi (Eighty-Four) says these platforms have opened up new avenues for writers like him.“Selling the rights to my books has brought me money I never dreamt of and, more importantly, it will encourage more youngsters to write in Hindi and give the language the recognition it deserves,” he says. Vyas’s other books, including Dilli Darbar, Benaras Talkies, and Baaghi Ballia, are also being adapted for the small screen.The Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival organises ‘Word to Screen Market’, an event that brings writers, publishers and production houses under one platform. The film festival’s art director, Smriti Kiran, says that in 2019 , the event, which could not be held last year because of the pandemic, saw the participation of 40 production houses, 23 publishers and as many authors writing not just in English, but also Hindi, English, Malayalam, Tamil, Marathi, Kannada, and Assamese.“In all, the writers and publishers pitched about 600 projects, and there was staggering interest in regional language books. In India, unlike in the West, there was no system regarding how writers, publication houses and production houses can work together. There was no standardisation of the contract format, how to make pitches or how much money a writer should get for selling the rights to their book. But this is changing,” says Kiran.Interestingly, publishers say the books most in demand are the ones set in smaller towns — tales of crime, love, revenge and politics.Naveen Choudhary, a writer of Hindi fiction, who recently sold the rights to his book Janta Store, his 2018 bestseller about student politics in Jaipur, to a production house for a web series, says OTT platforms are looking for authentic stories set in small towns because a majority of their subscribers are based there.“No one can tell these stories better than authors from small towns writing in Indian languages, whose works evocatively capture the social-cultural realities of these places,” says Choudhary, whose book was published by Rajkamal Prakashan, a prominent Hindi publisher. He has already got a six-figure advance for his next book.Govind Deecee, who heads the copyrights and acquisitions division at DC Books, a leading publisher of Malayalam books, says OTT are targeting a specific audience in a specific location.“They have to keep their subscribers and are trying to look for different kinds of content to cater to a variety of tastes. It suits publishers as we also bring out books in different genres and it is easy for us to suggest books from particular genres to them,” says Deecee, adding, “Recently, a production house approached us to ask if we could give them a crime story set in Kerala. Malayalam films have evolved a lot and there is a lot of potential to increase cooperation between publishers and production houses, which are looking for not just crime thrillers, but also literary fiction”.Akshay Bardapurkar, founder, Planet Marathi, a platform that focuses on content in Marathi, says OTT is “the writer’s medium”.“The story is the real star in a web series and so we are always looking for stories that can be binge-watched, and we believe that publishing houses are a good place to find them. The Marathi literature is a minefield of stories, and we have already tied up with a prominent publisher for regular book-to-screen projects,” says Bardapurkar.Ajit Thakur, chief executive officer of Aha, an OTT platform that focuses on Telugu content agrees.“The books make for great web series as their stories are already validated, have a large sweep with multiples characters and so can easily be turned into a web series. Besides, we save about three months, which it takes to develop a story. Currently, we are in talks to adapt at least five Tamil and Telugu books into web series.”Hoichoi, an OTT platform with content primarily in Bengali, has been ahead of the curve in adapting web-series from books, having already brought to screen many popular classics such as Byomkesh Bakshi (a character created by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay, Charitraheen (a novel by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay), and Taranath Tantrik by Bibhutibhushan and Taradas Bandyopadhyay. It has also adapted lesser-known publications like Eken Babu and Damayanti. “We are also looking at works by young writers, and already have a few lined up. Some will be announced in September, and others will be announced next year,” says Mahendra Soni, co-founder, Hoichoi.“The book-to-screen adaptation deal can fetch anything between ₹10 to 25 lakh on average and up to a ₹1 crore in some cases,” says Siddarth Jain, who launched The Story Ink, which helps writers and publishers sell the rights of their books to production houses and OTT platforms.So far, he says his firm has facilitated over 150 such deals.“There is a woeful lack of screenwriters in production houses, which is why they are now looking outside the industry for stories. In books, they get ready-made, relatable, stories. There is a lot of demand for thrillers, mysteries and real stories,” says Jain. “When I set up the company in 2017, I sold only three books [to production houses]. But for the past two years, I have sold 40 to 50 books a year on an average. The demand for books in a regional language is also growing fast.”Interestingly, Jain has started soliciting unpublished manuscripts from writers and publishers. “There is always a possibility that what may not be good enough for a book is good for the screen,” says Jain, who receives about 50 books in a month from publishers and writers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ott-platforms-give-new-lease-of-life-to-regional-language-authors-101626033893218.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s private hospitals fear losses as takers for paid vaccine dwindle||Availability of free vaccine at government centres has left slots for paid vaccination at city’s private hospitals vacant.Witnessing the daily footfall gradually shrinking, owners of the hospitals are worried about financial losses as they have already sourced vaccine stock from the manufacturers and its shelf life is limited to nine months.As many as 12 private hospitals are providing Covid-19 vaccines in Chandigarh apart from 79 government centres.“We received 5,000 doses of Covishield vaccine, directly from the Serum Institute of India (SII), in June. Initially, over 150 people were visiting the hospital daily, but now, the number has dropped to less than 40. If the vials remain unused, we’ll suffer great financial loss,” said Dr Kuldeep Singh, owner of a city-based private hospital, adding that the primary reason for people not showing up was increase in government centres offering vaccination.Dr Neeraj, another city-based doctor, said only 40-60 beneficiaries were visiting his hospital on an average daily. “Earlier all slots used to be booked in advance, but now we have few takers. If people don’t step in regularly through the day, doses get wasted,” he said.Private hospital owners also blame repeated changes in central government’s policies for the slow pace of the vaccination drive.“The Centre is making frequent changes in the vaccine procurement policies for private hospitals. Also, the price of vaccine doses has changed multiple times in the past six months. This leaves people confused and even several private hospitals are also disinterested in participating in the drive due to complex procurement policies,” said Dr RS Sethi, former national vice-president, Indian Medial Association.Of the over 6,00,000 doses administered in Chandigarh since the commencement of the vaccination drive in January, private hospitals account for around 52,000 (or 9%) doses, data available with the UT health department shows. City’s immunisation officer Dr Manjeet Singh said, “People are preferring government facilities over private ones as vaccine is free and easily available. But those who can afford the paid vaccines must take the jab from private hospitals as they have enough doses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-private-hospitals-fear-losses-as-takers-for-paid-vaccine-dwindle-101626033158913.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Violation of Covid norms: Himachal police deploy extra force on hotspots||After reports of large gatherings, violation of Covid norms and incidents of hooliganism involving tourists, the Himachal Pradesh Police have decided to deploy additional force to enforce norms and maintain law and order at the key tourists hotspots.The move comes against after a recent meeting convened by the HP chief minister Jai Ram Thakur wherein he had raised concerns over the crowding and flouting of norms at hill resorts and ordered strict action against the visitors who were found violating the guidelines.Tourists have been thronging the hill stations of Himachal Pradesh ever since the state government lifted curbs on entry. Shimla, Dalhousie, Dharmshala and Manali are witnessing heavy influx from the northern Indian states, including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttarakhand. The tourist rush doubles on the weekends. Nearly 10,000 vehicles crossed the interstate barrier in Parwanoo on Saturday. However, visitors could be seen flouting SOPs at the most of the tourist places and at some instances, also create ruckus when asked to adopt Covid-appropriated behaviour by locals and police.Recently, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had also warned that the crowding at tourists places and violation of norms by visitors may result in a lethal third wave in the country.Himachal’s director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu in a circular has asked the Indian Reserve Battalions (IRBN) in the state to provide force to be deployed at tourist places to ensure enforcement of Covid protocols.“The deployment will be till August 31 and maybe extended if the situation doesn’t improve,” said Kundu.He said the one company from 6th IRBN Kollar will be deployed at Shimla and another at Kasauli. Three reserves — one male reserve, one female reserve from 5th IRBN Bassi and one reserve from 1st IRBN Bangarh — will be deployed at Dharamshala and McLeodganj. One company from 3rd IRBN Pandoh has been sent to Kasauli and one reserved to Rohtang Tunnel. One reserve from 4th IRBN Jangalberi has been sent to Dalhousie.The SSPs of districts concerned have been asked to provide stay of the force at a safer place and the commandants of the battalions will coordinate with district police authorities for their smooth deployment. The state police from October 2020 till the first week of July have issued 88,369 challans for violation of Covid norms and realised more than ₹5 crore as fine.Last year, from March to November, 32,670 challans were issued and over ₹1.35 crore was collected as fine.Himachal logs 63 fresh cases

12-07-2021||Chandigarh||HC grants bail to 4 of family in abetment to suicide case||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted bail to four members of a Phagwara-based family who were named as accused in an abetment to suicide case.The four were arrested after a taxi driver first poisoned his son 9-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter and later consumed the substance himself, resulting in the death of all three. The reason behind the step was stated to be dispute with his wife. The FIR in this connection was registered against his wife’s family members at the Goraya police station in Jalandhar district on March 5 this year.The high court bench of Justice Manoj Bajaj allowed their bail plea observing that the challan had already been presented and that the court is of the opinion that further custody of the petitioners, who are presently in judicial custody, may not be necessary as the trial is likely to take considerable time to complete. “The material witnesses are either close relatives of the victim or police officials and there does not seem to be any possibility of their being won over,” the court said. The accused include the victim’s father-in-law, mother-in-law and brothers-in-law who had approached the high court in May following their arrest in March. As per the FIR, the victim had a dispute with his wife who was living at her parental house for some time. In January, a compromise was effected between the couple but she refused to go with her husband. The petitioners had told the court their daughter was married 12 years back and had matrimonial dispute with the victim since December 2020. A claim for maintenance too was filed against the driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-grants-bail-to-4-of-family-in-abetment-to-suicide-case-101626032979933.html

12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Mandi Board in dire straits as RDF not released by Centre yet||The Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board, also known as the Mandi Board, is facing a severe financial crunch as the rural development fund (RDF) charged by the state government on grain procurement has not been released by the Centre for the rabi season (wheat harvesting) yet.Also, the fund amount for the last year’s kharif season 2020 has been curtailed. The Centre owes Punjab ₹760 crore RDF for the rabi season and ₹500 crore for the 2020 kharif crop when only 1% accrual was allowed against 3% charged by the state government. In the absence of funds, loans raised by the board are piling up and development works, particularly in the rural areas of Punjab, have come to a halt. The worries of the once cash-rich board, which funded a variety of expenditures of the state government, are mounting as the Union food and public distribution ministry is in no mood to release the funds anytime soon. As a result, loans to the tune of ₹3,000 crore, including ₹120 crore in interest, have piled up for the board. The loans are part of the ₹3,976 crore raised by the board by pledging future fund accruals for the state government’s debt waiver scheme launched in 2018. “We have no funds to repay loans and start development works,” said a board officer. The RDF is managed by the rural development board which has chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh as its ex-officio chairman. The upkeep of nearly 66,000 kilometre roads in the rural belt is done from the fund. “Our coffers have dried up as we don’t have funds for future works and to service the debts. We are supposed to pay half-yearly installments to repay debt. Our last installment of ₹325 crore was paid by the state finance department,” said the board official. The board had availed loans for waiving ₹4,600 crore as debt of 5.5 lakh farmers as part of the state government’s farm waiver scheme with ₹1,800 crore still pending. Also, ₹520 crore is to be paid to 2.85 lakh landless labourers. To repay the loans raised by pledging RDF, ₹26 crore is given on monthly basis and ₹625 crore after every six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-mandi-board-in-dire-straits-as-rdf-not-released-by-centre-yet-101626032921582.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy sowing: Punjab agri dept misses target to double area under DSR technique||The Punjab agriculture department has failed to meet the target of doubling the area under direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique for paddy sowing this kharif season against the last year’s 5-lakh hectare mark even as the overall acreage increased slightly. Pre-germinated seeds are directly drilled in the fields with a tractor-powered machine under the water-conservation technique with no nursery preparation or transplantation unlike the conventional methods of sowing. The farmers have to level the land which has to be irrigated just once before sowing starts. Agriculture department joint director (extension) Gurvidner Singh said of nearly 23 lakh hectare area under the PR (parmal) varieties this season, 6.5 lakh hectares were sown using the DSR method. “For this kharif season, the department had set the target of sowing non-basmati varieties on 10-12 lakh hectares using direct seeding. Though the paddy growers surpassed the last season’s total area, we fell short of achieving our target. The lesser area under DSR means a gross loss to natural resources to irrigate water-guzzling varieties of non-basmati crop,” he said. Till Saturday, rice had been sown on 28-lakh hectare area and the department expects another 2 lakh hectares will be covered under the basmati varieties in the next fortnight. “Of the expected 30 lakh hectares for the kharif crop, nearly 23-lakh hectare land is under the PR varieties. The basmati varieties will be sown on the rest of the 7 lakh hectares,” said the joint director. Farmers like Baldev Singh of Bathinda’s Bajak village are worried as scanty rainfall may impact the yield. “Paddy sowing begins in June and the first two months are quite crucial to the crop when transplanted paddy needs huge quantities of water. Delayed monsoon and poor electricity supply resulted in inadequate irrigation in the fields under direct seeding. Losses may be minimised if the state witnesses rain as predicted in the next week,” said Singh. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) principal agronomist MS Bhullar said the paddy cultivation situation is not critical and field studies say rice cultivated through the DSR is standing firm even as irrigation was inadequate. Bhullar said farmers who sowed paddy through the DSR after the recommended period of May 25 will hardly face any major challenge whereas the early sown crop may encounter problems. Even if some farmers experience marginally lesser yield their net income would not be affected as the DSR saves significantly on water and makes it less labour intensive, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-sowing-punjab-agri-dept-misses-target-to-double-area-under-dsr-technique-101626032920648.html

On Saturday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi had blamed the Haryana government for the water woes in the national capital, and the next day Delhi Jal Board vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha threatened to move the Supreme Court against the Haryana government for not releasing Delhi’s “legitimate share” of water. “The people of Delhi are facing scarcity of water as there is less water in the Yamuna due to the delayed monsoon and due to poor water management in Delhi,” the Haryana government said in a statement. “Though there is 40% less water in the Yamuna, Haryana has been supplying Delhi its share of water,” the government said. The state government, in a release, said Delhi gets 719 cusecs of water at Munak from Yamuna and Ravi- Beas waters and 330 cusecs extra Yamuna water is being released at Munak as per Supreme Court orders. “Due to delayed monsoon, Haryana is facing heavy water scarcity, but we are still maintaining water supply to Delhi without any reduction,” the spokesperson said. Referring to a report of the Economic Survey- 2017 of the Delhi government, the Haryana government spokesperson said 20% of the drinking water in Delhi was wasted due to mismanagement. “It is a matter of great regret that the Haryana government is being criticised by Delhi, despite making positive efforts and following the orders of the Supreme Court,” the spokesperson said, adding that the Upper Yamuna River Board has already verified its position. In May, Delhi had filed a petition in the Supreme Court saying that Haryana was not providing the full share of water to Delhi. This petition was disposed of on the basis of a report by a committee chaired by secretary, ministry of Jal Shakti. Similar petitions filed by Delhi earlier were also disposed of by the Supreme Court, the spokesperson said, adding “shortage of water in Delhi is totally internal mismanagement of Delhi and Haryana has no role in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/supplying-more-than-allocated-water-to-capital-khattar-govt-101626031598858.html

As a result, the victim was getting phone calls from unknown people for more than a month, an officer from the cybercrime police station in Salt Lake said on condition of anonymity.The victim registered her police complaint on June 12. “She mentioned that Kundu is one of her former classmates. The accused went into hiding. We tracked him down by monitoring the tower location of his mobile phone,” an officer said on condition of anonymity. Non-bailable sections were added to the first information report on July 10, he added.The accused, son of Dipak Kundu, a junior leader of the TMC from Uttarpara in Hooghly district, was remanded in police custody for two days when he was produced in court on Sunday afternoon. Police seized two mobile phones from him.Dipak Kundu could not be contacted.“I am thankful to the police administration for taking action,” the victim told the media on Sunday evening.

The Punjab government has also already allowed universities and colleges to reopen on the condition that the staff and students have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.Physical classes at the varsity have remained suspended since March last year when the pandemic first broke out. Teaching for the 2020-2021 academic session was conducted online and semester exams were also held online. As the beginning of the next academic session in August nears, uncertainty still remains over whether classes will continue to be held online. So far PU has allowed only PhD scholars with pending work to stay at the campus hostels. “The semester exams are going on and the admission process will start soon. University will take an appropriate decision after that,” said VR Sinha, PU’s dean university instruction.NSUI suggests phased reopeningLast week, members of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) had submitted a memorandum to the varsity, advising phased reopening. They suggested that initially postgraduate students, who had thesis and project works pending, should be allowed to return. In the second phase, students of technical courses, dental college and departments where campus placements take place should be called in, before the rest of the varsity reopens.Former PU senator Rajat Sandhir said it was high time that PU reopened the campus for students. “It can be done in a phased manner with proactive vaccination of students and staff, so that teaching can resume in physical mode,” he said.“Practical sessions cannot be conducted virtually. The university must take advantage of the declining number of Covid cases to resume physical teaching and examinations. Research has also been impacted adversely due to lack of scholars on the campus,” Sandhir added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-yet-to-chalk-out-plan-to-reopen-campus-for-students-101626031358953.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity’s daily Covid cases plunge to 10 after 13 months||The Covid-19 pandemic’s downward trajectory continued on Sunday as 10 people tested positive in the tricity, a first in nearly 13 months.Mohali was the biggest contributor to the drop as it logged only three cases, its lowest since June last year. Chandigarh also hit a new low of six cases, a number it also last recorded only a year ago, while Panchkula logged just one case, for the second time in the past week.The lone fatality on Sunday was reported in Mohali, for the fifth consecutive day. Both Chandigarh and Panchkula have confirmed only one death each since the beginning of July.Amid the devastating second wave, tricity’s daily cases had peaked to 2,612 on May 10, while the highest single-day deaths, at 38, were recorded on May 5.Following a slew of lockdown restrictions across the tricity through May and early June, the number of cases and deaths started declining steadily, now down by 99% and 97%, respectively.From the record 24,201 active cases on May 12, now 210 people are recuperating in the tricity.

12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers target BJP’s meetings across Haryana||Hundreds of farmers under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha were confronted by the police on Sunday as they tried to disrupt party meetings of the Bharatiya Janata Party at Fatehabad, Jhajjar and Panipat on Sunday.The farmers waved black flags and raised slogans against state cooperatives minister Banwari Lal and Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal when they reached the party office in Fatehabad. They also protested the visit of Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal in Jhajjar.The farmers broke through the barricades amid heavy police security in Fatehabad and tore posters put up by BJP workers. Lashing out at BKU leaders Rakesh Tikait and Gurnam Singh Charuni, Dalal said, “Those leading the protests have been rejected. They are spreading lies about the three farm laws, which have been brought to uplift the farmers.”Farmers detained in Panipat In Panipat, a group of farmers was detained for holding a protest outside the venue of a district executive meeting of the BJP, which had state BJP in-charge Vinod Tawde, education minister Kanwar Pal and local MP Sanjay Bhatia in attendance.Farmers also removed the party’s flags from the main entrance of the venue. Later, the police detained the group and removed them from the spot in a Haryana Roadways bus. Satyawan Narwal, a farmer leader from Panipat, said that they will continue to hold protests against the leaders of the ruling BJP-JJP government and will not be deterred by the use of police force. He also slammed the Opposition for not supporting the farmers’ agitation. Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal said that the protesters were not farmers and the agitation was politically motivated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-target-bjp-s-meetings-across-haryana-101626030938781.html
12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali becomes a hotbed of protests||Ahead of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections scheduled early next year, Mohali has become a hotbed of protests, keeping the cops of both Chandigarh and Mohali on their toes for the last two months.UT cops have been permanently deployed at the border of Mohali and Chandigarh to deter protesters from entering the union territory. As per record, around 96 protests, organised by various outfits, have been held in Mohali in the last two months.Protests are also being held near the farmhouse of Punjab chief minister (CM), Captain Amarinder Singh, near Siswan in Mullanpur, forcing the authorities to permanently depute police force at the site. Only last week, both Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held a big protest against power cuts near the CM’s farm house.Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh said, “It is the democratic right of the people to hold protests, but we make sure no untoward incident happens and deploy adequate police force.”Currently ongoing are protests by Punjab’s contractual unemployed teachers, outside Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) building. For the last three weeks, the temporary teachers have been demanding regularisation of their jobs and enhancement in their salaries. There have been several clashes between the protesting teachers and Chandigarh Police, amid use of lathi charge and water cannons.Even patwaris and kanungos in the district have been on strike since June 22, and revenue work has taken a severe hit. They are protesting over the non-fulfilment of their long-pending demand to fill over 2,800 vacancies.The members of the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA) have been holding protests since June 18 against the implementation of the 6th Pay Commission by the Punjab government. The doctors’ protests have affected OPD services and other elective surgeries in government hospitals of the district. The Punjab government has decided to decrease the non-practising allowance of doctors from 25% to 20%, and delinking it to the total salary calculation will actually decrease the salary of already overburdened government doctors.Also protesting the implementation of the 6th Pay Commission are the members of the Punjab State Ministerial Services Union, Mohali, who are regularly holding pen-down strikes in the district. The members of the union are employees of the DC office, PWD office, excise and taxation department, health department, water supply and sanitation department, and others. With this protest, the common man is at the receiving end as no work is being done.Meanwhile, for the last six months, farmers have been regularly protesting outside Bestech Mall in Sector 66, Sohana gurdwara and at various chowks, demanding rollback of the three agri laws.General secretary of the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association, Dr Manohar Singh, said, “The government must understand the feelings of the people and work towards improving the system, so that people may not be forced to hold protests against the state.”President of the Elementary Teacher Training-Teacher Eligibility Test (ETT-TET) Qualified Unemployed Teachers’ Union, Deepak Kamboj, said, “It is not easy to protest in the soaring heat. We are helpless as despite our requests, they are not paying heed to our demands. Most of the female teachers have left their families and are protesting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-becomes-a-hotbed-of-protests-101626030879328.html

Our main demand is that schools don’t charge any re-admission fee or any extra charges from parents. Even though the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed private schools to only charge tuition fee, parents are still being compelled to pay other charges. Moreover, children whose parents have not been unable to pay these charges are being barred from attending online classes.” Anjali Singh, a parent from SAS Nagar, said, “Due to the pandemic, several parents have lost their jobs, faced losses in business and are unable to pay the hefty school fee. Schools had been closed due to the pandemic, but still school authorities are imposing annual charges etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/parents-bodies-stage-3-hour-protest-at-ladhowal-toll-plaza-101626030820096.html

This includes some big names. It would be too early to reveal their names. But they are soon going to formally join the AAP,” claimed Cheema.Hitting out at the ruling Congress on the issue of power crisis in the state, Cheema said that traders and industrialists are exasperated by the costly and erratic power supply and rampant corruption in government offices. He said that many industrial units are shifting to other states. Cheema alleged that while the GST return of the industry was pending, the state government has started VAT recovery.On the issue of offering free power to the people of the state, Cheema said that currently, the Congress regime is “doling out money to crony capitalists”. He said, “Those objecting to AAP for offering 300 units free to the people of the state must answer that why in the last few months, ₹6,000 crore was given to private power companies in lieu of power that was not even used. We want to benefit the common man of the state, not crony capitalists.”He said that if the AAP came to power, it will first scrap the power agreement made by the previous government, led by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD- BJP), with the private power companies and also put an end to mining mafia.He added instead of offering crores of rupees to private power companies, the benefit will be transferred to people of the state.Cheema also took an overt jibe at the Congress for protecting Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjit Singh Bains. “It is indeed shocking and saddening that despite the directions of the court, Ludhiana police is reluctant to register a case against Bains who is facing serious allegations of power misuse and physical exploitation of a woman,” said Cheema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-infighting-in-cong-bjp-big-names-set-to-join-aap-cheema-101626030100282.html

The doctors are protesting over the report of Sixth Punjab Pay Commission that recommends delinking of their non-practicing allowance (NPA) from their basic pay. “The inflexible attitude of the state government against the reasonable demands of Covid frontline warriors is condemnable. The exemplary services rendered by the doctors’ at a phenomenal risk, during the Covid pandemic, disregarding the safety of their own families, must be acknowledged by the government with modesty,” he suggested. He added that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had provided an alarming information that 776 doctors lost their lives in the second wave of Covid; in the first wave, according to IMA figures 748 had died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govts-inflexible-stance-on-npa-condemnable-bir-devinder-101626030038716.html
12-07-2021||Other||Ludhiana police lags behind in filing chargesheet in sexual assault cases||The Ludhiana police commissionerate has been lagging behind in filing chargesheet in sexual assault cases, giving a free pass to the alleged offenders in these cases.This even as the district has the grim distinction of having the highest number of sexual assault cases in the entire state. Of the total 2,556 sexual assault cases registered in Punjab between January 2016 and December 2020, as many as 1, 031 (40.3%) were from Ludhiana. Of these, police managed to file a chargesheet in only 822 cases (79.7%).Their counterparts in other districts seem to be doing much better. Of the 1,525 sexual assault cases registered in all other districts, chargesheet has not been filed only in 20 cases.Advocate Gaganpreet Singh, president of the Help Organisation, said that if the police don’t file the chargesheet on time, the accused can get bail from the court. “In cases where the provision of imprisonment is less than 10 years, police have to file a chargesheet within 60 days if the accused is in police custody. In cases, where the imprisonment is more than 10 years, police have to file a chargesheet within 90 days,” said Singh. Ludhiana police officials say the main reason behind lag is lack of cooperation from victims and their family members, many of who moved to their native places after the crime. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, head quarters) Ashiwini Gotyal said, “Ludhiana, being an industrial city, has a large chunk of migrant population. In most such crimes, children of labourer are the victims. The labourers leave their kids alone at home while they go off to work in factories, leaving them vulnerable to such crimes. It is often seen in such cases that the families leave for their native places once such an incident occurs. We are trying to trace these victims and convince their families to pursue the case.”Advocate Parupkar Singh Ghumman, former president of the district bar association, said that in cases where the complainant and witnesses do not record their statements, police remain helpless. He added that if migrant labourers go back to their native places, police should try to trace them using technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-police-lags-behind-in-filing-chargesheet-in-sexual-assault-cases-101626029918958.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: DRI busts ₹32 crore gold import racket||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) busted a gold import racket and allegedly seized a consignment of 100kg of gold potassium cyanide (GPC) worth ₹32 crores at the Air Cargo Complex in Mumbai. The agency arrested two persons on Saturday who were allegedly involved in the racket of exporting the material. Both were produced in court and remanded in judicial custody till July 21.The agency claims that they suspected that the buyers are spread across big cities in India. GPC is also known as potassium dicyanoaurate and its primary application is in the electrolytic gold plating of metals. The seized consignment was being exported to Dubai by a Mumbai-based firm, the DRI mentioned in the press release. The people who are part of the racket claimed that the GPCs they tried to export was made of duty-free imported gold for post-value re-export. The GPC attempted to be exported, was falsely declared to be the resultant products made from the duty-free import of gold that the Mumbai based firm was permitted to bring in as input against an Advance Authorisation (AA) license. The DIR mentioned in the release that, “the Mumbai based exporter never manufactured any products out of the duty-free for export from gold which was permitted to import by his company. Instead, it diverted the imported duty-free gold to the domestic market at a profit, by melting and recasting it. This effectively led to the violation of the ‘actual user condition” imposed under the AA Scheme. After selling the gold in the open market, the Mumbai-based exporter procured GPC from a connected firm based at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, and inaccurately claiming it to be a resultant product made of the imported gold brought in duty-free under the AA, mentioned in the press release.The official suspected after finding the Gandhinagar company is engaged in a solar energy solution that has nothing to do with gold. The Gandhinagar firm imported GPC last week from Indonesia by claiming a 0% tariff concession benefit available under the ASEAN India Free Trade Agreement (AIFTA).The documents and other evidence collected indicated that the GPC exported to Dubai was relocated to Indonesia and returned to Mumbai through the Gandhinagar office. The same produced entered and exited the country regularly. As per the investigation, the estimated duty evasion is ₹338 crores. The arrested accused were controlling and operating illicit schemes. The DIR did not disclose their names as the investigation is going on, said the DRI officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-dri-busts-32-crore-gold-import-racket-101626029798179.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Doctors root for jabs from second trimester of pregnancy||The ministry of health and family welfare has approved Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant women underlining that the benefits of vaccination outweigh their potential risks. The only condition that the ministry has put forward is that the pregnant women should be informed about the risks of exposure to Covid-19 along with the risks and benefits associated with the three vaccines – Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V – available in India. Mumbai is set to roll out vaccinations for pregnant women this week. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said they are in the process of training the staff and are likely to start the vaccinations from Thursday. While the Centre’s guidelines allow women to get vaccinated at any point during the pregnancy, some doctors said it is advisable to take the jab after the first trimester – from conception to 12 weeks of pregnancy. The first trimester is when the process of organogenesis or formation of organs takes place. Medical experts do not prescribe any drug or vaccines during this period to avoid any interference in organ development. “The Covid-19 vaccines are completely safe, but I would be reluctant to prescribe them during the first trimester,” said Dr Kiran Coelho, gynaecologist, from Lilavati Hospital. “I would prefer that my patients take it after 12 weeks when the organogenesis is complete and the baby is simply growing in size,” she said. PLACENTAL BARRIER The mechanism used by the three available vaccines is such that there is no possibility of viral infection crossing the placental barrier in pregnant women. Covishield and Sputnik V are ‘viral vector vaccines’ that use a harmless adenovirus to deliver the genetic material from the Covid-19 virus to the host and induce immunity. Covaxin is a ‘killed virus vaccine’ which uses inactivated or killed genetic material of Covid-19 to induce immunity in the host. “The vaccines we currently have produce antibodies in the host and few studies have also found that these antibodies could be passed on from the mother to the baby, which would shield them from the infection,” said Dr Arun Nayak, head of gynaecology at the civic-run LTMG Hospital in Sion. “Live virus vaccines are a contraindication for pregnant women as there would be a risk of the viral infection crossing the placental barrier. But none of the vaccines available in India are live virus vaccines,” he said. Nayak too said it would be advisable for pregnant women to take the vaccines after the first trimester. “It is a universally known precaution followed by all gynaecologists. We don’t prefer prescribing anything to pregnant women during the first 12 weeks,” he said. VACCINES ARE SAFE The Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) was the first body to push for vaccination for pregnant women. A position statement issued by FOGSI in April said there is no available evidence about any teratogenic effects caused by the vaccines. In medical terms, a teratogen is an agent that can disturb the development of the embryo or foetus. FOGSI, however, said women who get vaccinated in early pregnancy should not panic or should not be advised to terminate their pregnancies. They should be counselled that the risk of congenital anomalies does not rise above the baseline risk. At that time, FOGSI’s statement also said that “it would be prudent to defer vaccination in the first trimester as there is no substantial available data to establish the absence of teratogenicity.” “Other countries that have opened vaccinations for pregnant women are allowing the jabs at any point during the pregnancy. We are also of the same opinion,” said Dr Alpesh Gandhi, the immediate past president of FOGSI. “We have been actively involved with the centre before it came out with the guidelines for pregnant women and there is consensus that women can take the jab at any point during the pregnancy,” he said. BOX Higher ICU admissions, fatality, among pregnant women in the second wave: study There was eight-fold rise in the case fatality rate of pregnant women with Covid-19 during the second wave, a study carried out by doctors from civic-run BYL Nair Hospital and the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) has found. Published in the American Journal of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the study analysed outcomes of 1,143 pregnant women with Covid-19 who came to BYL Nair between April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 (considered as the period of first-wave by the researchers) and 387 pregnant women with Covid-19 who sought treatment at the hospital between February 1 to May 14, 2021 (second wave). The case fatality rate among pregnant women jumped from 0.7% in the first wave to 5.7% in the second wave, an eight-fold rise. “The rates of severe Covid-19, admission to the intensive care unit or high dependency unit, case fatality rate, and maternal mortality ratio was higher during the second wave. The preterm birth rate and stillbirth rate were not statistically different,” the study said, adding that nearly 93% of maternal deaths were due to Covid-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure. The study noted a higher frequency of severe Covid-19, intensive care unit or high dependency unit admission, and maternal deaths during the second wave. Researchers said the highly virulent B.1.167 variant could have a role to play and underlined the importance of vaccination for pregnant and lactating women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doctors-root-for-jabs-from-second-trimester-of-pregnancy-101626029739133.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai to see smooth Covid-19 vaccination drive today||Mumbai received 85,000 vaccine doses on Saturday night, which will facilitate a smooth vaccination drive on Monday, across all vaccine centres in the city. While this stock will likely suffice for only two days - Monday and Tuesday - Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expecting more doses to arrive on Monday or Tuesday night.On Monday, vaccination will take place between 9am and 5pm.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department said, “We received 84,000 vaccine doses on Saturday night. These will be sufficient for two days at most, depending on the turn-out at vaccine centres. We are expecting more vaccine doses to come by Monday or Tuesday.”“Mumbai can vaccinate 150,000 beneficiaries per day. So we put in demand with the state government for doses to vaccinate up to 100,000 beneficiaries per day. However, since the state government has not been getting enough vaccine doses from the Centre, based on available stock, Mumbai receives its share,” Kakani added.Presently, Mumbai has 401 vaccination centres, of which 283 are BMC centres, 20 state government-operated, and 98 are private. While the vaccination centres take 50% of beneficiaries by appointment, and 50% through on-spot walk-ins registrations.Among these seven vaccine centres are administering the Covishield vaccine to citizens travelling to other countries for jobs, education, or the Tokyo Olympics. The second dose of the vaccine is available only at these seven centres for these beneficiaries, 28 days after taking the first dose. The 29 other vaccine centres are administering the second dose for Covaxin, with 100 doses available per centre.On Saturday, 48,393 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 34,901 received their first dose, and 13,492 received their second dose. So far, 4,735,541 beneficiaries have been vaccinated with their first dose, and 1,273,484 beneficiaries have been vaccinated with their second dose||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-see-smooth-vaccination-drive-today-101626029678678.html

While responding to a question on Patole’s allegations, the NCP chief said he need not react to comments by “small people”.“These are small people. Why should I react? If Sonia Gandhi says something, I will give my reaction,” said Pawar during his interaction on Sunday at Baramati, his hometown. Patole while accusing the allies in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had asked Congress workers to transform hardships into strength while reiterating his stance of going solo in the upcoming electionsCommenting on complaints from workers that Pune district guardian minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar was not helping them with their work, Patole during his interaction with party workers at Lonavla had asked them to keep calm and instead convert the anger into strength.“The guardian minister is from Baramati. Whose work he is doing? Is he getting work done for our members? You need to convert this hardship into strength. Do not treat this hardship as mental weakness,” said Patole.The MPCC chief had also accused both the MVA allies of not fulfilling the promises.“It’s fine that they are not giving us our share, it will come to us. But you need to take a vow that one day, the guardian minister here will be from our party. If they do not want to compromise and backstab while being together, then we won’t say anything but transform our hardships into strengths.”Reacting to the post of speaker, which is with Congress as part of an arrangement among MVA allies, Pawar said, “Our decision is clear and the post of the speaker is with Congress. Whomever they will decide will be the speaker.” On fighting elections solo, Pawar said every party has the right to expand the party base and there’s nothing wrong. “There shouldn’t be misunderstanding even leaders of all three parties say that their parties will fight polls alone. We are together in the government but not running parties together,” he said. Patole on Friday had said, “I am not going to backtrack on what I said about fighting elections solo.

12-07-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: What does a consistent low repo rate mean for various loan borrowers?||Borrowers inclined to take a loan were in for a pleasant surprise as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced that its repo and reverse rates would remain unchanged at 4% and 3.5%, respectively. The decision, taken at the monetary policy review meeting last month, means that interest rates are likely to remain static in the coming months, which is an advantage to borrowers, both existing and new. Of course, the extent to which a borrower would benefit depends on other factors, including agreements signed before loan approval. Let’s take a look at some of them. Home loan Home loans, usually taken over a prolonged period, result in a lot of interest outgo. A fall in interest rate can have a considerable impact on the total interest paid. Most lenders approve home loan applications charged on floating interest rates. In a circular passed by the RBI in October 2019, it is compulsory to link all floating rate loans to an external benchmark from the several benchmarks included in the circular. With most banks choosing repo rate as the benchmark for their loans, the continued fall in repo rates spells a good sign for borrowers as they will spend less money on repaying their loans through equated monthly installments (EMIs). Existing home loan borrowers who had sought loans on a fixed interest rate basis have to continue repaying them at the same rate. However, borrowers with loans more than three years old must check if they have benefited from the reduced interest rate. For this, they must check the benchmark under which their loan had been sanctioned. Those who had not linked their loans to any external benchmark may have to continue paying high interest on loans. However, they may also ask their lenders to switch their loans to external benchmark-linked loans in lieu of nominal charges or shift their loans to other banks. Vehicle loan Vehicle loans are mostly taken for five to seven years, and are approved on a fixed interest rate basis. Seeking one now means getting the loans financed at considerable low-interest rates that will remain fixed over the tenure. Borrowers will benefit from low EMIs throughout the loan tenure due to the fixed nature of the loan. Those with an existing loan can escape the burden of paying more interest by shifting the loan to another lender. However, one must check details regarding foreclosure charges regarding loan prepayment. If foreclosure charges are considerably low and there is a lot of time left for loan repayment, it makes sense to benefit from the lower rate charged by another lender. Personal loan Personal loan rates are higher than other loans due to their unsecured nature. Seeking personal loans now at the current interest rates means prolonged savings on interest payment with a hike in interest rates unlikely in the near term. However, personal loan borrowers must be aware of their credit score as it has an effect on the interest rates offered to them and whether the lenders charge interest on a fixed or floating interest rate basis. Those with existing personal loans, however, may be in for a bit of an unpleasant surprise if they had sought the loan on a fixed interest rate basis. Borrowers can ask for a switch if they realize a huge difference between their loan rates and the current interest rates. Those in the first cycle of their loan repayment will benefit most as these loans are allowed for three to five years only, thus, resulting in good savings. This is because a major portion of the EMIs paid during the first half of the repayment period consists of the interest amount.

12-07-2021||Other||Farmers’ groups oppose farm bills tabled by Maharashtra govt||Organisations representing farmers have opposed the three farm bills tabled in the state legislature on July 6, stating that the proposed laws would not serve the interest of the farmers and the move is in fact an “attempt to crush” the ongoing agitation on the borders of Delhi. Accusing that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state has acted under pressure from the corporate lobby as well as the Centre, the farmers’ groups have threatened to launch a statewide protest to oppose the state’s bills. MVA government – comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress – had tabled the three bills proposing amendments to the Central farm laws, in both the houses of state legislature. The government has invited suggestions from the farmers, citizens and their organisations on the bills in the next two months before passing them in the winter session in December. The bills were said to be amendments negating the objectionable provisions that are against the farmers’ interest in the Central laws. Famers’ groups, however, have said that introducing the amendment bills is betraying the farmers and their ongoing protest as all the three ruling parties had extended their support to the stir. “We had demanded an unequivocal resolution in the monsoon session to demand repealing of the Central farm laws. Instead of that, MVA introduced amendment bills,” a statement by All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella body of farmer groups supporting the ongoing protest at Delhi border, read. Ajit Nawale, state general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha, said that the bills tabled by MVA government are not going to serve any purpose and the act of bringing them in haste was a suspicious one. “In fact, the state government’s bills are more stringent than the laws passed by the Centre. There is no protection given to farmers from getting exploited by middlemen or ensuring that farmers get minimum support prices (MSP). Further, the bill replaces the sub-divisional magistrate as the appellate authority with competent authority, but does not clarify about the authority,” he said. More than 100 organisations representing farmers have come together in the support of the farmers’ protest and have announced to launch a similar agitation if the bills were not withdrawn by MVA government. According to the farmers’ associations, the state government has made a provision of penalty of up to ₹5 lakh and the imprisonment up to three years for harassment of farmers, but the definition of ‘harassment’ is loose ended. The trader is at the liberty of denying the produce, delaying the transportation of the goods, not abiding with rates agreed upon as these do not lead to the harassment. The bills say MSP will be applicable only if the contract is done for two years, which is not the general practice in Maharashtra. “The existing APMC (agricultural produce market committee) has a provision of stricter action against such traders by attaching his property and booking him under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 29(1)(IX) of the APMC Act has powers to market committees to take action against such traders,” said Nawale. Agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse said, “The laws have been tabled in the state legislature and are open for suggestions and objections by farmers, their organisations and citizens. We are not claiming that the laws are fool proof or what we have proposed is final. There are two months for deliberations over the bills and organisations opposing them should raise their concerns on an appropriate forum.” Pratibha Shinde of another organisation, Loksangharsh Morcha, said the outfit does not want the amendment bills tabled because it does not approve them. “All the three ruling parties have supported the ongoing farmers’ agitation on the Delhi border and had opposed the Centre’s farm laws. Our question now is why did they bring laws which are a replica of the Central laws, with only some minor corrections. The move by MVA government is uncalled for as the Central laws have been stayed by the Supreme Court and are unlikely to be implemented immediately in the country. If MVA so serious about the interest of the farmers, it should have amended the APMC Act, 1963, which also was amended in 2005,” she said. Shinde said that they doubt if it was a backdoor political move to crush the ongoing farmers’ agitation. “Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar welcomed Maharashtra government’s move, while leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly said the laws are similar to the Central Acts. This clearly indicates that the bills tabled by state government may help the Modi government in crushing the agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-groups-oppose-farm-bills-tabled-by-maharashtra-govt-101626028718038.html
12-07-2021||Other||ED case against Deshmukh: Ex-Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze’s statement taken again||Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers on Sunday recorded the statement of dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze at Taloja jail in connection with the money laundering case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh, which the agency is probing.Vaze is in judicial custody after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested him for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare case and the murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran.This is the third time that the agency has recorded Vaze’s statement and quizzed him about other alleged financial irregularities linked to Deshmukh. Earlier, his statement was recorded in the jail on May 19 and 21. Earlier, on the basis of Vaze’s revelations, the central agency had arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and assistant Kundan Shinde on June 26. ED has alleged that Deshmukh misused his position as minister, and collected ₹4.7 crore from orchestra bars in Mumbai for their “smooth functioning” through Vaze. The money was sent to two Delhi-based brothers who operated bogus companies, said the agency. The money was channelised into Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan – a trust controlled by the Deshmukh family – under the garb of donations, at the behest of the former minister’s son Hrishikesh, the agency has claimed.ED has claimed that while collecting money from bar owners, Vaze told them that a part of the amount was to be divided among a certain “No 1”, the crime and the social service branches of the Mumbai Police. The anti-money laundering agency alleged that Vaze had claimed that Deshmukh had called him to his official residence and instructed him to collect ₹3 lakh from all bars and restaurants in the city. He was allegedly also given a list of the establishments.ED has identified 24 private entities that are directly and indirectly controlled by the Deshmukh family and found that huge sums of money had moved among them without any rationale. “From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers and can thus be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had stated. The agency also stated that Palande, during interrogation, admitted that a meeting was held on March 4 with police officers in which a discussion over imposing the Covid-19 restrictions on bars had been taken. Palande said Deshmukh had a role in the transfers and postings of police officers, especially those of the IPS (Indian Police Service) rank. During the meetings on transfer of police officers, an ‘unofficial list’ used to be prepared. However, the defence lawyer had refuted the allegations.In the various petitions filed against Deshmukh in the Bombay high court, several allegations were made over his involvement in the alleged cash-for-transfer racket. During the investigation, the names of some ministers and other persons were revealed who had played a role in the transfer of police officers.The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered based on a first information report (FIR) by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him on April 21. CBI had started the probe after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh had accused the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader of running an “extortion racket” in Mumbai and instructing some police officers to collect ₹100 crore for him every month from various establishments. Deshmukh had called the allegations false and claimed that Singh levelled accusations only after he was shunted out from the Mumbai Police chief’s post for his “poor handling” of the Antilia explosives scare and Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-case-against-deshmukh-ex-mumbai-cop-sachin-vaze-s-statement-taken-again-101626028599349.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants pre-arrest bail to rape accused||The Bombay high court (HC) recently granted anticipatory bail to an engineer from the public works department who was booked for raping a woman constable attached to Pune Rural police under the pretext of marriage. The constable later killed herself in February. While the police did not name the engineer in the suicide case, the accused approached the court apprehending arrest in the rape case. HC allowed the application after it was informed that the physical relationship between the two was consensual. The single judge bench of justice PD Naik, while hearing the application of Ajay Bansode, 53, was informed by senior counsel Manoj Mohite that the applicant was booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code for repeated rape, unnatural sex and cheating a woman on the pretext of marriage in January, 2021. Mohite stated that Bansode was going through a divorce proceeding when he got into the physical relationship with the constable. The bench was further informed that the constable was aware of his client’s pending divorce proceedings and still agreed to the physical relationship, hence it was consensual. Mohite added that the complaint was lodged by the constable after she came to know that Bansode had received another proposal for marriage and refused to marry her till the divorce proceedings were completed. In light of these submissions, Mohite said that there was no need for custodial interrogation of his client, and hence he should be granted protection. The two had allegedly met in January 2020 and had a physical relationship. However, later Bansode told the constable that he had got a marriage proposal from another woman. After this, Mohite claimed, the constable started threatening Bansode to marry her, failing which she would lodge a complaint. He said the applicant promised to marry her after the divorce proceeding, but the constable lodged a complaint of rape and cheating in January 2021. She later killed herself in February 2021. In light of the submissions, the court reached the conclusion that the physical relationship between Bansode and the constable was consensual and hence custodial interrogation was not required. While allowing the application, the court ordered that in the event of arrest, Bansode would be released on furnishing a personal bond of ₹25,000 and sureties and he would have to attend the investigation at Worli police station and also surrender his cell phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-rape-accused-101626028600060.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai youths make shelter for street dogs using waste plastic||A group of youngsters from Navi Mumbai used their free time for environment and made a shelter home for street dogs, by using innovative ideas such as using plastic to make bottle bricks. Once the first one was made, they started collecting more plastic waste and installed several similar structures, especially in view of the monsoon. Vasundhara Gupte, 18, and her friend Khushi Shah, an environment lover, created a group called Urvari to conduct social environment-related activities. They started in 2019 by planting 10 trees every weekend, but their work stopped due to the lockdown. Brainstorming over how to continue their work even amid the restrictions, this group came up with the idea of making shelter homes for street dogs in the vicinity in July last year. After trying out a few experiments, the group posted on social media, urging people not to waste plastic bottles and instead send it to them.Gupte said, “We have taken up small eco brick projects last July to make a shelter home for street animals in heavy monsoon. Accordingly, we posted on our social media urging people to give their plastic waste to us. We were making plastic bottles by stuffing 300 grams of plastic waste wrappers and other things in each bottle. We mostly approached college students via social networking sites to prepare eco bricks at home and drop in at any of our drop stations across the city. More than 100 such bricks have been received from donors. We need around 150 such bottle bricks to build a shelter. Once it was ready, we kept t at Rajiv Gandhi Udyan, Sector 29, Vashi with the permission of the corporator of the area. Now, we are conducting this project on a much larger scale and are going to build a few more shelters in the next few weeks.”Shah said, “Every day tonnes of plastic goes to waste without being recycled, and street animals eat this plastic or the waste related to it when they get hungry. So, we urge all residents to donate their plastic to us and we will use the same for a good cause. Earlier, we made dustbins and several other usable things in daily life using waste plastic. This shelter home is our gift to these animals who do not get shelter during heavy rains.”Shashikant Raut, corporator of Vashi sector 29, praised the youth and made available four-five areas near gardens under his jurisdiction to install the shelter homes. Raut said, “I am really amazed after watching the efforts these children have taken to build this innovative shelter home. I have five parks in my area with Rajiv Gandhi Udyan being the biggest one. More than seven street dogs stay in that garden and during monsoon they hide under benches. Most of the time people kick them off the bench. Therefore, I have asked these youths to keep their shelter in the garden for these dogs. We have plans to keep five of such shelters in different areas in the gardens in future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-youths-make-shelter-for-street-dogs-using-waste-plastic-101626028598834.html

12-07-2021||Lucknow||If voted to power, we’ll get Covid management audit done in Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh next year, his government will get an audit of Covid-19 management done in the state and take strict action against officials for allegedly concealing data related to deaths. The former UP chief minister also accused the state government of hiding Covid death figures and claimed that it hid data as it did not want to help the people. “After the assembly elections in the state and the formation of the SP government, an audit (of Covid-19 management) will be done and officials who had concealed information will face stringent action. During the pandemic, there was a time when it was felt that there was no government in UP. People were left to their fate ,” Akhilesh said while addressing his first press conference after the onset of the second wave of pandemic at the party headquarters here.“The government did not give the statistics pertaining to the Covid deaths, nor any help was given to them (victims). They (UP government) did not give the statistics as they did not want to help (the people),” Yadav told reporters.Akhilesh also alleged that people struggled for beds, medicines, oxygen. Many people lost their lives for want of these things. “Had those facilities been available, those people would have been alive. If anybody is responsible for all this, it is the BJP government,” he alleged.The SP chief also talked about the issue of teachers who allegedly died during panchayat poll duties in the state. “When the teachers went on (panchayat poll) duty, it was said that only three teachers died (on poll duty due to Covid). Later, when teachers’ organisations and we raised questions, the government had to admit that actually how many lives were lost,” he said. (With Agency Inputs)UP govt should thank officials for helping it rig rural polls, says SP chief Hitting out at the UP government, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav said the BJP government “should have thanked the state police and administrative officers for helping it rig the zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat polls”.“The BJP thanked many for their victory in the polls but they did not thank the police and administrative officers who aided BJP’s goondagardi (hooliganism). Had the police and administrative officers not worked for the BJP, the poll results would have been different,” he said at the press conference. “When BJP on Saturday celebrated the victory in the block pramukh polls, we saw how they (chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh shared ladoos) after violating the democracy,” he said.“How when the people voted in the direct panchayat polls (first phase in April), Samajwadi Party won the elections and BJP got defeated but when the indirect elections happened for the zila panchayat chiefs and then for the block pramukhs, the BJP won,” Akhilesh added.“I have till now resisted using the word goondagardi (hooliganism), but now I say that no party can surpass BJP in goondagardi”, he alleged.Reiterating that the SP was preparing a list of all the police and administrative officers who aided BJP in the elections, he said, “We will take action when our party returns to power in 2022 as people are restive to oust BJP from power in the state.” “I have BJP’s 2017 election manifesto in my hand and I am reading out from it that says BJP will double the income of farmers by 2022. Now I am asking the BJP when and where the income of the farmers had doubled,” the SP chief said.On the 2022 UP assembly polls, he said, “The Samajwadi Party will form the government in UP 2022. We will take small parties along and talks are going on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/if-voted-to-power-we-ll-get-covid-management-audit-done-in-uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-yadav-101626028478904.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||How vaccination scam unfolded in Mumbai||Between April and June, as the city was hit with a second wave and a lockdown, at least 4,055 residents of Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai found themselves faced with another unfolding catastrophe: the first shot of Covishield vaccine that they had received was fake, and for a few weeks, they had no idea what liquid had been injected into their veins.The scam broke on June 14, when residents of Hiranandani Society in Kandivli realised something was amiss after the CoWin platform generated certificates that got two crucial details wrong: the date of the vaccine drive and the name of the hospital they thought they had tied up with. It turns out that the certificates, like their vaccine doses, were fakes.The national vaccination drive’s third phase guidelines that opened up vaccination to all adults starting May 1 permitted private hospitals to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers and administer them to people at a higher cost. At the time, only the Centre was buying vaccines from the manufacturers – Serum Institute of India (SII), which produced Covishield, and Bharat Biotech, which produced Covaxin – and distributing these across states. The state governments in turn would distribute a section of these vaccines to private hospitals. The new guidelines allowed states, and private hospitals, to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers who, in turn, increased the price of their vaccines for the market. To make matters easier for citizens who could afford to pay for their vaccines, several housing societies across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region tied up with private hospitals to conduct the vaccination drive.BMC came out with its standard operating procedure (SOP) for housing societies a week back. As per the new guidelines, nodal officers appointed by the housing society or the office management will ensure that private Covid-19 vaccination centres (PCVC) or private hospitals engaged with vaccination are registered on the CoWin portal. The nodal officers have to contact and verify the authenticity of the PCVC with the local health authority. Hiranandani Society’s committee members organised a vaccination camp over two days, on May 30 and June 1, after Mahendra Singh approached them with the offer of inoculating the residents (390 in all) with Covishield. Singh said that the vaccines would be procured from Versova’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital. On May 30, the first day of the drive, 390 people received their first shot. Upon receiving their vaccine certificates through email from different hospitals, the residents found crucial details were incorrect. What’s more, they began to receive calls asking for their CoWin platform OTP, an indication that they had not done the due diligence and registered on the platform before vaccination. The society members also had not taken a no objection certificate from BMC to conduct the drive; they did not know and were told it was taken by the accused.Hiranandani Residents Association filed a first information report (FIR) on June 15, and investigations by Kandivli police revealed that this was just the tip of the iceberg.Scam comes to light In all 10 FIRs have been registered in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai – the latest was registered on July 2. Among the victims are commercial establishments, a school [Podar School] and a housing society [Hiranandani Heritage]. Also a branch of Bank of Baroda. At the heart of it, the scam was a way of making quick money, and it was the brain child of Shivam Hospital owners Dr Shivraj Pataria and his wife Neeta. They roped in Dr Manish Tripathi, who runs Knowledge Centre for Educational Planning (KCEP) Institute, a training centre for nursing students and ward boys in the hospital premises. In all, the police estimates that the trio managed to earn ₹5 crore through the unsuspecting victims.Shivam Hospital, located in Kandivli, was a private vaccination centre registered with the BMC. It had the permission to conduct a vaccination drive till April 30. The hospital received over 20,000 vials from the BMC, but police officers said, not all of them were used at the hospital. The doctor-couple kept the empty vials, which were then filled with saline water and used in the scam.Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (Law and Order) said at a press conference that the accused administered the leftover vials as well as saline water injections in the camps that they conducted before April 23. The trio contacted Rajesh Pandey, an employee of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. Pandey, who worked in marketing department of the Hospital earlier, directed people approaching his hospital to go to Shivam Hospital for ₹200 as his commission. Tripathi reached out to Mahendra Singh, an event organiser, who with some acquaintances contacted business establishments with an offer to organise private vaccination camps for their employees and their families. “Singh asked that they contact business establishments with at least 200 employees,” said an officer from the Kandivli police station who was part of the investigating team.“Since the trio did not have the vaccine stock, they decided to administer saline water to the recipients and decided to give the certificates stamped by Shivam Hospital when they had acquired the desired amount and were in a position to purchase vaccines for the hospital,” the officer added. “Pandey was the face of the fake camps as he was an employee of a reputed hospital who met the prospective clients and convinced them that the camp was government authorised and legitimate,” the officer said.It was a resident of Hiranandani Heritage society – a trustee of Aditya College in Borivli -- who introduced Singh and Pandey to the society members. “Housing societies were not initially the target of the gang but when 390 residents showed interest in the vaccination camp, the gang went ahead with the camp,” said the officer.The entire amount was deposited in Tripathi’s bank account.The trio however had not anticipated that the recipients would ask for certificates immediately. Tripathi came to their rescue -- many of his students were placed at the Nesco jumbo Covid centre in Goregaon and even the Bandra Covid centre to assist civic and government employees in the vaccination drive. Tripathi took the help of some of them involved in data entry on the CoWin application. He asked them to get the login ID of the app and password so that they could use it to forge certificates. In all 14 persons, including the three doctors at the centre of the plot, event organisers and associates, including data entry operators, have been arrested. Investigation is still going on, as police are yet to record statements of some the witnesses in the case.A spokesperson of Tips Music, which registered an FIR at the Khar police station, said that they gave all facts to the police and were in touch with the civic body for further action, including cancelling the fake certificates their employees received. Spokespersons of other affected companies, including Matchbox, (FIR registered at Versova police station), Kwan Entertainment (FIR registered at Amboli police station), Intercontinental Diamonds (FIR at Samta Nagar police station) and Inter Gold India Pvt ltd (FIR at MIDC police station) refused to comment.At least 468 employees of two private companies in Thane and Navi Mumbai have also been victims of fake vaccination drives in the past two months.An FIR registered at Naupada police station, Thane, on June 25 names Mahendra Singh, Shrikant Mane, Sanjay Gupta, Seema Ahuja and Mohammed Kareem Akbar Ali. It was filed on a complaint by Arnav Dutta, a manager with RenewBuy Dot Com, a health and motor insurance company. Dutta, in his complaint, stated that on May 26 this year, the five accused held a vaccination drive at the company’s Thane office in Shreeji Arcade near the Nitin Company. The vaccine, at a cost of ₹1,000 per head, was administered to 116 employees.On July 2, Kalpesh Patil, an administration manager of Atomberg Technologies Private Limited filed a complaint with the Turbhe police. The FIR names Dr Manish Tripathi and Mohammed Kareem Akbar Ali among others. According to Patil’s complaint, a camp was conducted on April 23 and 352 employees of the industrial unit were administered vaccines after paying ₹4.24 lakh. Two of the employees received certificates that named Nanavati Hospital as the vaccine centre, and had the wrong date. None of the other workers received any certificate.“We are still clueless on what we received in the name of vaccine. While the police is investigating the case, we are in touch with the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation and discussing if we can get a first dose again at some authorised vaccination centre. The NMMC would get back to us soon they said,” Patil said.Vax scam began in April Kandivli resident Ritu’s Bangude’s 54-year-old mother took her first dose of Covid-19 vaccine on April 3. Though her mother developed fever – a side effect of the vaccine – she did not receive a certificate. Even the CoWin platform showed her as being un-vaccinated. An antibody test revealed that her mother had none. She had received her jab at Shivam Hospital.Three months on, Bangude, 19, said that other vaccination centres refuse to allow her mother to take a jab after learning that she had received one from Shivam Hospital, as investigation revealed that it was at the centre of the scam. “I have nowhere to go. Neither the BMC not any state officials have contacted us. I am confused and worried a lot,” said Bangude.Hardik Shah, the chief executive officer of a private firm, lost ₹5.14 lakh because of the scam, but he said that the loss he feels is far greater. “I don’t trust any vaccination camps now. I don’t know whether the vaccine given now will be real or fake,” the 38-year-old stock broker said.Shah was approached by Seema Ahuja and Shashikant Mane, claiming that the doctors who ran Shivam Hospital offered to organise a vaccination camp -- all he had to do was to pay money and provide a space. Shah wanted to get his employees at Mansi Share and Stock Advertisers, vaccinated at the earliest, and agreed to the offer. On May 27, he paid ₹5.14 lakh and the camp was held at Chikoowadi area in Borivli on May 27. They received 100 (forged) vaccine certificates. Shah’s 80-year-old mother was also vaccinated. After the scam came to light Shah’s first reaction was fear. “We did not check with the others if they had side effects like fever. We just thought that we were among those who didn’t have any symptoms at all,” said Shah. “I blamed myself but everyone else assured me it was not my fault. I was cheated too,” he said. BMC officials reached out to Shah and told him to get antibody tests done, and if the result is negative, to receive their first vaccination.Gopal Sura, 62, one of the committee members of the Hiranandani Heritage society, said that the residents were scared and wondered what was injected in their bodies. Many were worried about possible side effects of what had been administered to them. The police probe eventually revealed that saline water had been injected instead of the vaccine. “Now, we have made a WhatsApp group which includes BMC doctors, police officers investigating the case and the residents, to keep all parties updated with the developments in the case,” said Sura.Fresh vaccinationThe society members claimed that they have been contacted by BMC officials and civic doctors who have asked them to get an antibody test conducted, and if the test shows low antibody count, to approach any government-affiliated centre and get their first shot, as all of them are still shown unvaccinated on CoWin portal. “We are in discussion with BMC to get the (forged) vaccination certificates, issued by the gang to some of our members, cancelled,” Sura, a member of the Hiranandani Heritage society committee, said.The BMC, however, is waiting for the police investigation to conclude before going ahead with vaccinating all 3,087 victims. “We have given full cooperation to police in the investigation. We are now waiting for their investigation to conclude. In this, we may come to know how many were actually given fake vaccine and how many were given genuine vaccine. After this, we will go ahead with vaccination of those who have been given fake vaccines,” Additional Municipal Commissioner of BMC Suresh Kakani, said.According to BMC officials, they will also have to write to the central government to nullify vaccination certificates issued on CoWIN portal.Thane Municipal Commissioner Abhijit Bangar agreed that the victims in the vaccination scam couldn’t be considered as having received their first dose. “They will have to arrange a workplace camp from an authentic hospital. In case of the two who have got their certificate, which they got after probably the accused procured the login and password of the CoWIN portal, we will have to approach the government to understand what can be done as it is a complex issue. We will soon be issuing guidelines for the housing societies and companies to follow while having any vaccination drive at their place.”(With inputs by Anamika Gharat, Raina Shine and Mehul Thakkar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-vaccination-scam-unfolded-in-mumbai-101626028418834.html
12-07-2021||Mumbai||Six Maharashtra districts still await rainfall for sowing crops: IMD data||Nearly a month into the monsoon and just four days before the usual sowing window for kharif crops runs out on July 15, six districts across Maharashtra’s Khandesh and western Vidarbha region are showing what experts have called a “significant deficit” in seasonal rainfall. These include Nandurbar, Dhule, Nashik, Jalgaon, Buldhana and Akola where impending showers may bring some relief in the next week.Across this belt where the primary cash crops include cotton, wheat and corn, Nandurbar and Akola show the highest seasonal deficit at -57% and -50% respectively, followed by Dhule at -46%, Nashik -37%, Jalgaon -29% and Buldhana -24%. This is based on rainfall data from June 1 to July 11, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) hydromet division in New Delhi.“Even if the situation in these districts improves over the next week, an entire month has gone by with little rains which is likely to impact agricultural productivity, given how important June and July monsoon is for kharif crops. The deficits are significant and indicate an emerging meteorological drought. The specific districts may not yet be facing hydrological, agricultural or socio-economic drought, but the trend certainly warrants attention from officials and policymakers,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD candidate at the University of Reading.IMD officials, on the other hand, were not alarmed by the trend and seemed confident that the expected spell of heavy rains from Monday will make up for the deficit in these districts. Dr Jayanta Sarkar, head of IMD’s regional meteorological centre in Mumbai, said all four meteorological subdivisions in the state have so far recorded normal or excess rains, despite erratic frequency of the monsoon.“The more spatial detail you go into, the more variations you will find. Some places will show deficit while others show excess. I cannot comment on the outlook for agriculture, but meteorologically speaking, there is still time for the seasonal average rainfall to be made up. Besides, in terms of meteorological subdivisions, all of Maharashtra has recorded normal to excess rainfall,” Sarkar said.Dr Kripan Ghosh, head of agricultural meteorology division at IMD Pune, said, “There are still a few days to go before the sowing window runs out for regular kharif crops. However, as good rains are expected during next week, farmers should be able to undertake sowing in unsown areas in most parts of Maharashtra. It is still too early to make any speculations on how crops may be affected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/six-maharashtra-districts-still-await-rainfall-for-sowing-crops-imd-data-101626028418148.html
12-07-2021||Other||Exam schedule uploaded on Agra varsity website||Agra Officiating vice chancellor of Dr BR Ambedkar University ( DBRAU) of Agra Prof. Alok Kumar Rai reviewed the ongoing preparations for university exams which are scheduled to begin from July 24. The VC stressed on compliance with Covid protocol during the exams and said the schedule had been uploaded on the varsity website. “Preparations for final exams of Dr BR Ambedkar University of Agra are nearing completion. All exam centres being asked to follow Covid protocol for which strict instructions have been issued,” he said. Prof Rai, who is also the vice chancellor of Lucknow University, listed timely exams as his priority when he took additional charge as vice chancellor of Dr BR Ambedkar University earlier this month after the then DBRAU vice chancellor Prof Ashok Mittal was sacked by UP governor Anandi Ben Patel on charges of irregularities. On Sunday, Prof Rai held a review meeting at guest house on Khandari premises of the university. Presiding over the meet, he informed that exams would be held in three shifts, with full Covid protocol. “The schedule for exams has been uploaded on the official website of Agra university. The examination centres are being marked out. The colleges which were centres last year are being repeated this year. However, the centres debarred because of foul practices are not being included this year, he said. “Yet, to maintain the transparency, objections for making a particular college as centre are being invited and these objections would be analysed so as to rule out possibility of copying,,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exam-schedule-uploaded-on-agra-varsity-website-101626028240489.html
12-07-2021||Kolkata||TMC plans to reorganize district units; more people may play leadership role||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) is planning to create more organisational units in the 23 districts, including Kolkata, of West Bengal and create more posts in a bid to decentralise the present structure, leaders aware of the development said on Sunday. Election strategist Prashant Kishor and chief minister Mamata Banerjee met in Kolkata on Friday afternoon to discuss the proposed changes. The meeting, which continued for three hours, was held at the chief minister’s residence at Kalighat in south Kolkata. Her nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee was also present. According to the proposed plans, the TMC wants to split its current district units into several parts and set up new committees with a president heading each of these. “This is being planned to ensure smooth operation and stop infighting over leadership control, something that has affected the party’s image as well as the results in some recent elections,” said a senior TMC leader who did not want to be named. The changes are being made in view of the civic body election, which are overdue, as well as the 2023 panchayat polls and Lok Sabha polls in 2024, he added. “The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a similar organizational structure in the bigger districts. It has two units in Murshidabad and Nadia. Each of these is headed by a president. In North 24 Parganas, which has 34 assembly and five Lok Sabha seats, the BJP has four units. The BJP refers to these units as organizational districts. We plan to do this more extensively. It is not possible for one president to manage an entire district,” said the TMC leader. TMC leaders said that following Kishor’s advice, Mamata Banerjee wants to firmly enforce the one-man-one-post policy and give more importance to young leaders to shake up the rank and file. Some announcements are likely to be made next week by the TMC chief. Over the past two years, the TMC has replaced several senior leaders with younger people. This led to infighting and defections to the BJP in some districts. The TMC will also relaunch Jago Bangla, the party mouthpiece. Abhishek Banerjee announced on Twitter on Saturday that the mouthpiece will undergo a transformation.TMC leaders said the relaunch is likely to take place on July 21, which is observed as martyr’s day by the party every year in memory of the 13 members of the Youth Congress who fell to police bullets in Kolkata in 1993. Mamata Banerjee was a Youth Congress leader in 1993. She led an agitation on July 21 against the then Left Front government. Over the years, the martyr’s day rally emerged as a symbol of the TMC’s struggle since its birth in 1998 and serves as a platform from where Banerjee sends out messages to party workers and declares future plans. Held at Esplanade in the heart of Kolkata, the rally is a big crowd puller. However, like last year, it will be held virtually because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Banerjee will address people on social media. Giant screens and monitors will be installed in public places and TMC offices across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-plans-to-reorganize-district-units-more-people-may-play-leadership-role-101626028239344.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||390 apply for Delhi government’s Covid aid||The Delhi government on Sunday said around 170 people have applied for one-time financial assistance of ₹50,000 and 220 have applied for monthly assistance of ₹2,500 for deaths in their families caused by Covid-19.Delhi’s social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said in a statement, “Our representatives will go door-to-door and help in filling the application form.”On May 18, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the Delhi government will provide one-time cash relief of ₹50,000 to the families of people who died of Covid-19, a monthly pension of ₹2,500 to the families which lost their only earning member, and free education and a monthly payment of ₹2,500 for children who lost their parents or only surviving or legal parent to the disease until they attained the age of 25 years. On July 6, the government launched a drive under which officers are to visit families who lost relatives to Covid-19 and help them in claiming financial assistance.“The scheme was approved by the Delhi cabinet and notified for implementation in June. The city government has planned to set aside around ₹170 crore in this financial year for this scheme,” said a senior government official.State records showed that Covid-19 has claimed 25,015 lives in Delhi. “The government is yet to process applications concerning children who lost their parents to Covid-19,” said another senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/390-apply-for-delhi-government-s-covid-aid-101626027339325.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi water crisis: AAP volunteers protest outside city BJP chief’s house||A group of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteers protested outside the residence of Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta in central Delhi’s Patel Nagar, alleging that the shortage of water in the Capital has been caused by the BJP-led government in Haryana not releasing adequate water into the Yamuna.“The BJP-ruled Haryana government is not giving about 100 MGD of water to Delhiites, which they are entitled to. Due to this, there has been a shortage of water in Delhi for a few days, but the members of the Bharatiya Janata Party are busy doing politics. Yesterday, we gave BJP 24 hours’ time to solve this water problem but the BJP has not taken any step so far,” said the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak.Dismissing the allegations as “baseless”, Gupta said, “We will keep exposing corruption and failures of the AAP government. We will not be deterred by such violence.”The Delhi unit of BJP alleged that the protesters damaged a water pipeline in the area.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “We strongly condemn the incident and the AAP for sending a large contingent of party workers to attack the residence of the Delhi BJP president. It is sad that the AAP workers damaged the water pipeline serving the entire block in which Mr Adesh Gupta lives, affecting hundreds of other families.”The AAP denied the allegations of damage to the pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-water-crisis-aap-volunteers-protest-outside-city-bjp-chief-s-house-101626027278133.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Despite dip in caseload, state narrows focus to dense areas||Over the last two weeks, Delhi has reported 82 new Covid-19 cases per day on an average, and a large proportion of these cases surfaced in few pockets, several of them located in Shahdara, West Delhi and South Delhi districts, a senior Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) official said, adding that most of these residential pockets are densely-populated areas.Covid-19 cases in Delhi have witnessed a decline from the peak seven-day average of 25,294 new cases a day recorded in the city for the seven days ending April 23 to an average of 76 new cases a day for the week ending Sunday. “But the number has been oscillating between 80 and 100 cases in 24 hours for quite some time now, even though we have been trying to bring it further down,” said a senior official in the DDMA who asked not to be named.State government data shows that Delhi has been reporting an average of 82 new cases for the past 14 days.The DDMA official said a large proportion of the new cases recorded in these 14 days have surfaced in 40 pockets, located in areas including Ambedkar Colony, Gautam Nagar, Neb Sarai, Nihal Vihar, East Babarpur, B-Block Paschim Vihar and Tahirpur.Some other localities which have few such pockets are sectors 15&18 in Rohini, Auchandi village, Barwala, Lampur village in Narela, Vasant Gaon locality, Samalkha, Rajokari, Naraina Vihar, Dakshinpuri, area near Nanda Hospital in Chhatarpur, CRS complex Chhatarpur, C block Bhati Mines, Deoli, Khanpur transit camp, Raju Park, Prem Nagar, Madipur and East Punjabi Bagh, said the official.Some more such pockets are in East Rohtash Nagar, J and K blocks in Dilshad Garden, the bazar area in Meet Nagar Road, B1 block in Nand Nagri, Ambedkar Basti in Maujpur, Pratap Nagar, Harsh Vihar, Shalimar Park, Rajgarh Colony, Mandoli, Sundar Nagri and Harijan Basti in Patel Vihar, the official said.Between July 1 and 10, at least 60 containment zones were notified in these pockets, government records showed.A district surveillance official with the revenue department, who did not wish to be identified said: “Most of these pockets have two common links. Either the vaccine coverage is low or they were not severely affected during the recent wave of the pandemic, so a large number of residents are not immune to infection yet. In some of these areas, vaccine coverage for at least one dose was lower than 20%, against Delhi’s overall current coverage of 45%. Also, at least 10 of these pockets saw no cases during the recent surge. Several hardly saw a case or two.”Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said the city is out of the risk zone but the government has not let its guard down and is working to bring new daily cases to zero. “Delhi currently is out of the risk zone. However, we will still appeal to people to not let their guards down. We are working hard towards bringing new cases close to zero per day… We are also keeping an eye on possible mutations and new strains. Delhi thankfully has its own genome sequencing laboratories now. The government is taking all precautions against a potential third wave of the pandemic,” Gahlot said.When asked about specific measures being taken in these localities where most new cases are emerging, Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said the government is taking up micro containment efforts and carrying out focused vaccination drives. “Recently, we have formulated a Graded Response Action Plan using a data-driven approach to trigger restrictions on movement as soon as epidemiological parameters breach certain predefined levels. Through this concerted approach, our target is to bring down the daily new cases in Delhi down to zero.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said it was a matter of concern that the number of new cases surfacing in Delhi is oscillating between 80-100 per day for more than two weeks now. “It shows that local transmissions are taking place in certain pockets. The government has to ensure that the 80-100 new cases per day does not become the beginning of a new potential surge in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-dip-in-covid-19-caseload-authorities-in-delhi-narrow-focus-on-densely-populated-areas-101626026078081.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||School auditoriums get nod to open with 50% capacity||With the city’s Covid-19 caseloads at levels not seen since the early days of the pandemic in April last year, the state disaster management body in an order issued on Saturday allowed auditoriums and assembly halls in the city’s educational institutes to hold training and meetings with a 50% seating cap from Monday, even as the Delhi government on Sunday said it will start preparations to reopen schools in the Capital. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in its order, however, reiterated that classes will continue online.“Owing to the considerable decline in Covid-19 cases in Delhi and overall improvement of the situation, DDMA removed academic and training activities from the list of completely prohibited activities,” the government said in a statement on Sunday. “This decision will give a boost to the Delhi government’s ongoing education projects like teacher training...,” it added.The national capital was locked down from April 19 as a brutal fourth wave of infections spread its footprint in the city, and stretched health care infrastructure to the brink. Over 760,000 people were infected between April and May, and more than 13,100 died.The state government started lifting these restrictions from the first week of June, as cases ebbed and hospital beds freed up.The Delhi government in a statement on Sunday said it will start preparing and planning for reopening of schools in the national capital.Schools in the national capital have mostly been shut since March last year due to the pandemic, and classes and other teaching and learning activities have broadly shifted online in that time.Though the Delhi government allowed in-person lessons in January this year for students due to appear in the Class 10 and 12 board exams, as well for remedial and practical lessons for students in classes 9 to 12, this was cut short as the fourth wave of infections began to spread in the city.The state education department will also hold discussions on the same with stakeholders during the two-week parent-teacher meeting scheduled between July 19 and 31.In order to help parents support their children during the continued online learning this academic session, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on June 30 announced that public schools in the city would hold a two-week special parent-teacher meeting beginning July 19. This would also be a first time when government school teachers would collaborate with their municipal corporation schools counterparts to speak to parents of class 6 students.The DDMA’s order added that all social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious festivals and other congregations will remain prohibited, and cinema halls, multiplexes, and amusement parks will continue to stay shut. Buses and Delhi metro trains will continue to operate at 50% capacity along with restaurants and bars which are only permitted to use only 50% seating space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ddma-allows-halls-in-educational-institutions-to-hold-trainings-meets-101626026018901.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||School remains a struggle despite govt intervention, say EWS children||Despite several interventions by state authorities, parents of several children from Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category continue to struggle after multiple private schools in the city either denied admission to these children or failed to provide EWS students with free textbooks and stationery as mandated under the Right to Education Act.A single-mother of a Class 2 student said she was only able to get a few books despite repeated complaints. “The authorities at New Bal Vaishali Public School (Molarband) said the amount they get from the government for EWS students is not sufficient so I had to pay ₹1,650 for books and stationery as per MRP, which is usually marked at a higher rate,” she said.Reacting to the complaint, principal of the school Vaibhav Sharma said, “The reimbursement allocated for this year has gone down from previous years. Hence, we could only provide books that we could afford from the reimbursement amount.”On July 5, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) also issued a notice to the school asking them to give the students free books and writing material.DCPCR member Ranjana Prasad said, “In the past two months, we have received at least 50 complaints pertaining to the distribution of books and stationery to students. We have also received many complaints about the denial of admission to EWS students in private schools and have been working to resolve the issues,” she said.On June 30, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “The government provides ₹2,260 per month to these schools for each EWS student towards their fee and other expenses. We are ordering schools that they conduct EWS admissions even if there have been no general category admissions. The government will reimburse them accordingly,” said Sisodia.Under the prevalent practice, schools admit one EWS student for every three students admitted under the general category.Sharma and several other private schools in the city said they were finding it difficult to provide free books and stationery after the state directorate of education (DoE) revised the reimbursement amount this year and fixed it at ₹250 for books, ₹1,100 for uniforms, and ₹300 for writing material for students of classes 1 to 5. For classes 6 to 8, the reimbursement rates have been revised to ₹400 for books and stationery each and ₹1,400 for uniforms. Till last year, schools were getting ₹1,100-1,400 annually for uniforms and ₹2,200 for textbooks, stationery, and tuition fees per student.Ekramul Haque, founder of the organization Mission Taleem which works with EWS children, said they have forwarded at least 50 such complaints related to the distribution of books.“Dozens of parents have approached us saying they have not received books or stationery from the schools this year. These parents have either lost jobs during the lockdown or faced financial hardships,” he said.A senior official of the education department pointed to a DoE circular released on Friday. “If some school requires exemption, they need to seek permission from the respective deputy director education as mentioned in the circular. If schools violate norms despite this order, we will start taking action against them,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/school-remains-a-struggle-despite-govt-intervention-say-ews-children-101626026018095.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||Two who robbed realtor’s home held after shoot-out||Two men -- who, along with two others barged into a property dealer’s residence in Uttam Nagar, and robbed the house after taking the man’s family hostage on July 7-- were arrested after a shoot-out that took place on a road just two kilometres away from the crime scene on Sunday morning, police said.One of them was hit in his leg and a constable was shot at in his bulletproof vest during the exchange of fire, police said. The duo’s interrogation led to the arrest of another suspect--the realtor’s employee who provided information about cash and jewellery kept at the businessman’s house, said police.The robbery was captured in a CCTV camera installed inside the realtor’s house. The video footage was widely circulated on social media.On July 7, when Vinod Shorey was in his office, four men barged into his fourth-floor flat in G-block Uttam Nagar. Shorey’s mother, Savitri Devi, wife Seema Shorey, two children and Seema’s brother Sachin were inside the house, when the suspects gained entry after telling Seema that they were electricians and have come to fix an electrical fault.As soon as the door was opened, the four men, who were wearing caps and masks, took out a pistol and three knives, and threatened to kill Seema and other family members if they raised an alarm. They tied Seema, Sachin and Savitri with adhesive tape and ransacked the entire house. They took away ₹8 lakh cash, gold jewellery, two mobile phones and other valuables worth lakhs of rupees.The occupants of the house untied themselves and informed Shorey, who alerted the police. A case of robbery was registered and several teams were formed to nab the robbers. After scanning CCTV footage, checking mobile phone data and further investigation, the police identified the suspects and began tracking their movements.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said on Sunday around 5 am, the police teams spotted two suspects near the Uttar Nagar bus terminal and asked them to surrender. However, they fired at the police team and tried to flee. One bullet hit a constable in his bulletproof vest.“Our raiding team retaliated. One of the assailants was hit in his leg. He was identified as Ankush,23. His associate, Mukul, 24, was also caught. A pistol and a knife were recovered from them, along with three cartridges,” said DCP Meena.Police said the interrogation of the two suspects led to the arrest of Deepanshu alias Vaashu (25), who is Shorey’s employee who told the robbers about cash and jewellery.Ankush and Mukul also confessed to their involvement in two more robberies, including one in Sadar Bazar area on June 26. Both of them have previously been in jail for different crimes. Ankush was released from jail in February this year, and Mukul came out more than a year ago, the DCP said.“We are now looking for other suspects involved in the robbery and recover the stolen items,” Meena added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-men-held-for-uttam-nagar-robbery-101626025838590.html
12-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board moves SC against Haryana over water shortage||The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Sunday filed a petition in the Supreme Court, seeking directions to the Haryana government to release the national capital’s legitimate share of water in the Yamuna, the water utility’s vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said.“DJB has just now filed the petition in Hon’ble SC seeking discharge of Delhi’s legitimate share of water by Haryana which was decided by SC itself in 1995-96. Tough times in Delhi because Haryana has withheld Delhi’s water in an outright contempt of SC’s existing order,” Chadha tweeted.Chadha, also the Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Rajendra Nagar, said Delhi is witnessing an “all-time low water levels in Yamuna” because the city’s water share is being withheld by Haryana. Several areas in the Capital had to go without regular water supply, as residents relied on DJB tankers.On Saturday and Sunday water supply in areas such as Civil Lines, Karol Bagh, Greater Kailash, Prem Nagar, Old and New Rajendra Nagar, Punjabi Bagh, Moolchand, Jahangirpuri, Sangam Vihar and Tughlakabad remained severely affected.Chadha said the level of the Yamuna at Wazirabad pond in Delhi has dropped from 674.5 feet to 667 feet, owing to the ongoing shortage.Because of the low water levels in the river, which is a major source of water for Delhi, the capacity of the Chandrawal water treatment plant has come down from 90 million gallons per day (MGD) to 55MGD, at the Wazirabad plant the capacity is down from 135MGD to 80MGD and at Okhla Plant treatment capacity has reduced from 20MGD to 12MGD, Chadha said.“Delhi is a landlocked state and does not have any water body of its own. It has always been dependent on neighbouring states to fulfil its water needs,” the DJB vice-chief said.“The SC has been issuing directions regarding this to neighbouring states, in which it cited that the Uttar Pradesh government will be releasing a designated amount of water from the Ganga, Haryana government from the Yamuna, and the Punjab government from the Bhakra Nangal Dam. These have been signed and agreed upon by the state governments. And under these, water is supplied to Delhi till date,” he added.Responding to Chadha’s allegations, Haryana government officials said that the Delhi government should take measures to plug leakages in their water supply chain instead of blaming them for the water shortage in the Capital.“The Delhi government has moved the Supreme Court on a number of occasions in the past as well but the apex court never said Haryana was not supplying water to Delhi as per the allocation. Keeping in view the fact that Delhi is the national capital and a populous city, not only the present government but successive regimes in Haryana have released more than the Delhi’s allocated share in Yamuna. There is no question of not releasing Delhi’s allocated share of water,” said Vinod Mehta, principal media advisor to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.In a separate statement, the state government said the water level in Yamuna is low because of the delay in monsoon. “The people of Delhi are facing scarcity of water as there is less water in the Yamuna due to delay in monsoon and due to poor system of water management in Delhi. The truth is that despite 40% less water in the Yamuna, Haryana has been supplying Delhi’s share,” the Haryana government said.The state government said Delhi has a share of 719 cusecs of water at Munak canal from Yamuna and Ravi Beas waters and 330 cusecs extra Yamuna water is being released by Haryana at Munak as per Supreme Court orders.The Yamuna and the Ganga are Delhi’s two major sources of water, together accounting for nearly 90% of the city’s water supply. The rest is covered by ground water. Of the 10 treatment plants run by DJB, the Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi WTPs in east Delhi get raw water from the Ganga through pipelines originating in Muradnagar in UP, while eight others rely on the Yamuna and ground water supply.Residents said the crippling shortage of water hit them hard, a problem exacerbated by the humid spell of weather in the Capital, which has yet to receive any monsoon showers.Karan Singh, a resident of old Rajendra Nagar, said the area has not received water supply since Saturday morning. “We are a group of IAS aspirants staying together, and it becomes very difficult to survive without water with so many roommates. The weather is also such that you need more water to get through with your daily routine. We had to call for a tanker on Sunday evening because we ended up finishing all our stored water,” Singh said.Mithilesh Pradhan, a resident Khanpur’s Jawahar Park, said, “We are facing an acute water shortage for the last five days. This is the national capital, and even here we have to struggle for our basic needs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-jal-board-moves-sc-against-haryana-over-water-shortage-101626025838034.html

The state government also formed a committee headed by TN Munde, then chief engineer, Pune irrigation division, to find reasons behind the breach in the wall. The committee had mentioned a lack of maintenance and burrowing animals as the cause of the incident.According to the Khadakwasla irrigation division, it had found 14 dangerous spots over 28km on the Khadakwasla dam to Hadapsar stretch, in the PMC limits. The total length of the canal is 202km, from Khadakwasla dam to Indapur taluka. H V Gunale, chief engineer of the water resource department, Pune division, said, “BGM technique was used in the Pench water project in Vidarbha region and has given good results. So, water resources ministry has instructed us to incorporate techniques in canal and dam construction. We have also decided to use BGM to stop leakage of the Mutha right canal and strengthen it.”“As per our report, water leakage from the canal is 2.25 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) per year. We have started a survey of the canal and identified a vulnerable stretch for water leakages. After the report, we will use BMG techniques to stop leakages,” he added.TN Munde, director of Maharashtra Krishna Valley development corporation (MKVDC), said, “As mentioned in committee report, due to water leakages and earthen embankment of canal, burrowing animals creates holes in the embankment and the piping action busted the canal.”“We recommended lining the canal to stop leakages. Mutha right bank canal wwhich was constructed in 1960 and it is a mono-zone type manually constructed canal. BGM is an easy, time-saving technique. It is ready-made sheets of BGM. We have to just lay the BGM layer. Traditional concrete laying takes time,” he added.Benefits of BGM-BGM, or the bituminous geomembrane, is a specialty geomembrane with composite layers that make it stronger, more watertight and more durable than resin- based geomembranes.-It prevents burrowing animals from making holes in the embankment of the canal. -It also stops erosion of soil and weeds. -It is durable and enhances water carrying capacity. -It is cheaper than traditional cement concretisation layers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/irrigation-division-to-use-the-bgm-layers-to-stop-leakage-from-mutha-right-bank-canal-101626025658051.html
12-07-2021||Pune||Maharashtra’s co-op movement will not be affected by new ministry: Sharad Pawar||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president, Sharad Pawar, has rejected the idea of any adverse impact on Maharashtra’s cooperative sector after the Centre formed a new cabinet portfolio, the ministry of cooperation, headed by Amit Shah. Speaking to reporters at Baramati on Sunday, Pawar refuted reports which claimed that the newly-formed ministry of cooperation may “hijack the cooperative movement” in Maharashtra. The NCP chief said that while the concept is not new, forming a ministry at the Centre cannot interfere with the cooperative sector in Maharashtra, which has a strong network of such institutions, with politicians from the Congress and NCP relying on these networks to retain their clout. “As per the Constitution, cooperative institutions registered in a state come under the (jurisdiction of that respective) state,” Pawar said, days after leaders from Congress and NCP were suspicious of the move. Earlier last week, deputy chief minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar had said, “The intention of the Central government is yet to be clear, but they may have something in their minds. It will be known only after the new legislations are introduced for the sector, just like the three contentious farm laws over which farmers are now protesting for the past eight months.” According to Pawar senior, the Centre’s newly-formed ministry is about multi-state cooperative institutions. “A state cannot control a cooperative institution registered in more than one state, which is called multi-state, and the central government has control over it,” said Pawar, whose party shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra. The cooperative sector has been a catalyst in the economic development of western Maharashtra with senior politicians controlling sugar and milk cooperatives. As the sugarcane growers and milk producers are part of these institutions as shareholders, politicians have used them as base to enhance interests. Pawar said taking a decision on such a multi-state cooperative institution comes under the central government’s cooperation department. “This is not a new decision as such. It was there when I was in the central government. But, unfortunately, the media is painting a different picture that the Centre’s ministry of cooperation may hijack or end the cooperative movement in Maharashtra,” he said. The new ministry for cooperation earlier was a small department in the ministry of agriculture and farmers elfare. Union minister Amit Shah, who has been given charge of the newly-created ministry, on Saturday said that the government is determined to make cooperatives and all cooperative institutions more empowered. To a query on the Uniform Civil Code, Pawar said, “I can’t comment on it till the central government takes a decision. We are waiting for the central government’s take on it. Once they clear it, only then we can say something.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtras-co-op-movement-will-not-be-affected-by-new-ministry-sharad-pawar-101626025598576.html
12-07-2021||Pune||Covid-19 infected mums likely to transfer antibodies to unborn babies, claims study by Pune hospital||A study conducted by paediatricians on Covid-19- positive pregnant women showed that the post- delivery, the children tested positive for antibodies in 75% of the cases sampled.The babies tested positive for IgG positives, exhibited neutralising potential, suggestive of protection in early life. The study also confirmed increased preterm deliveries in mothers with the Sars-CoV-2 infection. Doctors also found that in rare cases there was vertical transmission of the infection per say.At Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital, a team of eight doctors conducted a study on 57 pregnant women with Sars-CoV-2 and 59 neonates born between June and September 2020, when the city was facing its first wave. The study found that 10 out of the 57 Covid-19 positive mothers were symptomatic. The duration between Covid-19 diagnosis and delivery was less than seven days in 82.4% of the cases. The study also found that it was rare, in 3.6% cases, based on samples collected from the nasal swab and blood, vertical transmission of the infection or antigens were found. With regards to antibodies, which provide protection against infections, the study found that in 21.6% of the cases IgG anti-Sars-CoV-2 was found to be present, providing protection for the child in the long term. Predominant asymptomatic Sars-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy led to an effective transfer of antibodies in 51% neonates. Close to 75% of the IgG positives exhibited neutralising potential, suggestive of protection in early life. For the control group, the study sample also included 39 neonates born to Covid-19 negative mothers, in which 20 (51%) were positive for IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 and none for viral RNA. Transfer of maternal antibodies was studied using ELISA and PRNT.The study also showed that the preterm deliveries were higher in Covid-19 positive mothers than in Covid-19 negative mothers. Respiratory distress at birth was higher among neonates of Covid-19 positive (20 of 59 babies which is 33.9%) than Sars-CoV-2-RNA-negative mothers (3/39 which is 7.7%)The study was published in the peer-reviewed European magazine, “Infection’” on July 7. The authors of the study included Dr Nandini Malshe, Dr Suprabha K Patnaik, Dr Sanjay Lalwani, Dr Pradeep Suryawanshi, Dr Ruta Kulkarni, Dr Suhas Mhaske, Dr Akhilesh Chandra Mishra, and Dr Vidya Arankalle. Dr Pradeep Suryanvanshi said, “We will now take this study further by including more samples from all strata of societies. Also this a small number to generalise anything, but before these cases were reported about vertical transmission and babies testing positive for antibodies, there was no study per say. This study indicates that there is evidence of transmission of antibodies from the mother to the baby which is higher among asymptomatic mothers than symptomatic mothers. Further research will help understand why it is so. Also to know that if vaccinated mothers can help pass on the protection to the unborn baby we need more such studies.” Dr Suryanvasnhi also said that it is rare, for only three of 100 babies born to Covid1-9 positive mothers that the baby faces fetal inflammatory response syndrome. He said, “The infection in the mother is passed on to the child in rare cases. However, in Covid-19, the transmission of antibodies is higher compared to other infections.” Dr Suryavanshi said, “Out of the 57 mothers who tested RT-PCR positive out of which 18 % saw preterm birth, 3% Neonate RT PCR Positive and 21% tested antibodies positive. This above mothers were compared with 39 RTPCR negative in the month of December. Even though they were RTPCR negative at the time of delivery - 51% babies had antibody, that means mother might be asymptomatic COVID during pregnancy.” Dr Aarti Kinikar, head of the paediatric department, BJ Medical College said, “We had reported a similar case which was the first case of vertical transmission in the country, back in May 2020. In the case we had found that the baby had tested positive for antibodies, which we tested after the baby got serious post-delivery and needed to be admitted in the ICU. We could successfully treat and discharge the baby. The presence of IgG antibodies provides long term protection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid19-infected-mums-likely-to-transfer-antibodies-to-unborn-babies-claims-study-by-pune-hospital-101626025538658.html

12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Farmers manhandle BJP leaders, hold them ‘hostage’||Situation in Rajpura town remained tense since Sunday morning as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders faced the protesting farmers’ wrath. What started with the disruption of a district-level meeting in the morning culminated in a dozen BJP leaders being holed up in a house as farmers laid siege to it, not ready to relent.Deputy inspector general of police Vikramjit Duggal and Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit rushed to the spot to start a dialogue and defuse the situation, but stalemate continued till the filing of this report around midnight. In the morning, farmers protesting against the contentious agricultural laws disrupted the BJP meeting that was being chaired by state general secretary Bhupesh Aggarwal at the Bharat Vikas Parishad building near the new grain market. As the number of protesters kept increasing, more police force was rushed to the venue to rescue the BJP leaders. Aggarwal, district rural unit head Vikas Sharma and some other leaders were taken to an adjoining house, from where a panicked Aggarwal released a video claiming danger to his and party workers’ lives.Police managed to take him and others to further safety, but local councillor Shanti Swarup was not as lucky. In another video of the incident shared on social media, protesters could be seen chasing and manhandling him and even tearing his clothes, while he was being taken away by cops.The party leadership rushed state general secretary Subhash Sharma to Rajpura, who later addressed a press conference. Laying the blame on chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, he alleged that “Congress goons are trying to intimidate the minority Hindus in Punjab”.As farmers came to know about the press conference being held at the Lions Club, they reached the venue and began another demonstration. Police again managed to take Subhash Kumar to safety.However, later, Aggarwal made a statement that the BJP will hold a meeting in the area as planned. Following this, Aggarwal along with Subhash Sharma, Vikas Sharma, district president Harinder Kohli and half a dozen other local leaders gathered at a house in Arjun Colony for a meeting. Farmers reached there in large numbers and laid siege to it. Police was rushed to the spot and managed to surround the house to ensure security.In a video released from the house, Subhash Sharma alleged that the Congress had sent its workers to gherao the place. “It’s like terrorism days in Punjab. Police are not acting against goons,” he said.Farmer leader Prem Singh Bhangu said that Aggarwal had provoked farmers by using threatening language. He said that the morning incident started as Aggarwal’s bodyguard pointed a pistol at the peacefully protesting farmers. He demanded an apology from the BJP leadership.Meanwhile, the DC was holding parleys with both parties to defuse the situation. It is learnt the state BJP leadership has made frantic calls to the home department and senior police officials. Earlier in the day, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said: “This is an attack on democracy, and not BJP. There is complete lawlessness in Punjab, as police have become mute spectators.”Farmers have been targeting BJP leaders and events in the past few months. On June 30, Rajya Sabha member Shwait Malik, who had arrived at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bathinda, had to face the farmers’ wrath. Earlier, in Fazilka, clothes of a BJP legislator were removed, while the convoy of Ashwani Sharma was attacked in Ferozepur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-manhandle-bjp-leaders-in-punjab-s-rajpura-101626016118310.html

On average, there were 328 new confirmed and probable cases daily over the past week, up from 208 as of June 28.That’s a far cry from spikes this year when city officials reported thousands of cases per day, and the positivity rate is below the national level of 3.4%. But the trendline is concerning, given the possibility of variants spreading in pockets of the city where fewer residents are vaccinated.“The spread of the delta variant means that it is perhaps the most dangerous time to remain unvaccinated,” Dave Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said at a virus briefing Monday. “That’s why we have ensured that our vaccination efforts are proceeding with as much urgency as possible.”Mayor Bill de Blasio failed at his goal of vaccinating 5 million New Yorkers by June. By mid-July, only 4.4 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, or 53% of the population. Meanwhile, the inoculation rate has plummeted to around 16,000 doses a day from more than 100,000 in April.Staten Island has emerged as a miniature hot spot, with its seven-day positivity rate averaging 2.34% as of July 8, well above the citywide average. The borough’s Great Kills and Silver Lake/St. George neighborhoods had the highest hospitalization rates in the city in the latest 28-day period reported, May 31-June 27.Chokshi said younger, unvaccinated people in Staten Island are a primary cause. Less than half of the population is fully vaccinated, as is the case in Brooklyn and the Bronx.About 26% of cases tested over the past 4 weeks were classified as B.1.617.2, or delta, a highly contagious variant that was first detected in India and is now the dominant strain in the U.S.De Blasio said the city was watching the data carefully, and the low hospitalization rate was a good sign. On average, about 20 patients have been hospitalized daily citywide, some of the lowest rates since the beginning of the pandemic.Nationally, the U.S. is reporting an average of about 37 cases per day per 100,000 people, with New York City at about 21. Missouri and Arkansas have the highest rates, at more than 160 per 100,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-in-nyc-rising-as-delta-variant-surges-vaccinations-slow-101626111496786.html

We receive a lot of queries from people who say they have taken one [dose] and are planning to take another one (doses). It’s a little bit of a dangerous trend here. We are in a data-free, evidence-free zone as far as mix and match,” Swaminathan said in an online briefing earlier in the day.CLARIFICATION: The WHO has clarified that public health agencies, not individuals, should make decisions on mixing and matching COVID vaccines, based on available data. We are deleting other tweets that lack context https://t.co/r3u0FKgvhb pic.twitter.com/ITjGM1PvPDMixing and matching of Covid-19 vaccines is a method of immunisation using two doses of the shot from different manufacturers. Most vaccines currently in use, including those of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, University of Oxford-AstraZeneca, Bharat Biotech as well as the Russian Sputnik V, are all required to be administered in two doses with the prescribed intervals between the shots differing for each vaccine. Sputnik V also has a single-dose vaccine named Sputnik V Lite and the jab by Johnson & Johnson is a single-dose vaccine too.Also read | 'Submitted all documents to WHO for EUL of Covaxin as of July 9': Bharat Biotech“There is limited data on mix and match. There are studies going on, we need to wait for that. Maybe it will be a very good approach. But, at the moment we only have data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, followed by Pfizer. It will be a chaotic situation in countries if citizens start deciding when and who will be taking a second, a third and a fourth dose,” she said.WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the global gap in Covid-19 vaccine supply is "hugely uneven and inequitable." "Some countries and regions are actually ordering millions of booster doses before other countries have had supplies to vaccinate their health workers and most vulnerable," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Swaminathan also stressed the need for equal distribution of the vaccine globally. “We have four countries that have announced booster programs and a few more that are thinking about it. If 11 high and upper-middle-income countries decide that they will go for a booster for their population, or even sub-groups, this will require an additional 800 million doses of vaccine,” she said.She also said that there is no scientific evidence that a booster shot is definitely needed, especially immediately after the inoculation of the two doses. Instead, she said that the medicine needs to be distributed via the COVAX program to countries that are yet to immunise their front-line workers and the elderly and the vulnerable populations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixing-and-matching-covid-19-vaccines-dangerous-trend-who-s-chief-scientist-soumya-swaminathan-101626110838092.html

"We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime," Biden said in a statement.The unprecedented anti-government protests erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union and the recent record surge in Covid-19 cases, with people denouncing shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the authorities' handling of the coronavirus pandemic. They chanted "freedom" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down."The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected," Biden added. "The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves," he said.Diaz-Canel on Monday blamed the historic protests on what he called was the US "economic asphyxiation" and social media campaigns by a minority of counter-revolutionaries. "In the last few weeks the campaign against the Cuban revolution has increased in social media, drawing on the problems and shortages we are living," Diaz-Canel said in a televised address, according to news agency Reuters."They threw stones at foreign currency shops, they stole items ... and at police forces, they turned over cars - a totally vulgar, indecent and delinquent behaviour," he said blaming counter-revolutionaries of fomenting unrest.Diaz-Canel did not directly address the US statement but slammed what he called Washington's hypocrisy for expressing concern when it was fueling the crisis in Cuba with its trade embargo. "Is it not very hypocritical and cynical that you block me ... and you want to present yourself as the big saviour?" Diaz-Canel said. "Lift the blockade .. and then we will see what this people, that has achieved an immense social work despite what is practically a war economy, is capable of."Cuba has been under US sanctions since 1962. The US tightened the sanctions on Cuba under Donald Trump, including restricting key remittances in the middle of the pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cuba-blames-unrest-on-us-as-biden-says-he-stands-with-cubans-101626107737547.html

Miller has been the top commander in Afghanistan since his appointment to the role in 2018.Marine Gen Frank McKenzie, another four-star general, took over from Miller and would operate from the central command headquarters in Tampa, Florida. He will assume command and continue the airstrikes in defence of the Afghan forces at least until the US pulls out all its troops by August 31, the Associated Press (AP) reported.During the flag-passing ceremony at the Resolute Support headquarters at the heart of Kabul, Miller remembered the US and Nato troops along with the thousands of Afghan nationals who were killed during the war. He said he told Taliban officials that “it’s important that the military sides set the conditions for a peaceful and political settlement in Afghanistan... But we know that with that violence, it would be very difficult to achieve a political settlement,” the AP further reported.Also read | Afghanistan situation to figure at 3 meetings in Central Asian statesHamdullah Mohib, National Security Advisor of Afghanistan, said that the withdrawal of US and Nato troops has left the Afghan forces stranded on the battlefield without resupplies, the AP reported. Mohib also expressed concerns about the lack of aircraft for supporting and resupplying the troops.Following US President Joe Biden’s earlier announcement that all American troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, the Pentagon said that the process is 90 per cent complete. Biden said that it was the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people to decide the future of the country. “Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritising the safety of our troops as they depart,” Biden said on July 8. He said that his government would continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance.The Taliban have claimed that they now control 85% of the country, which has not been verified independently, news agencies reported.

12-07-2021||World||Afghanistan situation to figure at 3 meetings in Central Asian states||Three meetings to be held in the Central Asian states of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan this week will allow external affairs minister S Jaishankar to compare notes on the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan with interlocutors from several key countries. Jaishankar will visit the Central Asian states against the backdrop of growing concern in the region over the Taliban’s violent campaign aimed at capturing territory while stalling on peace talks aimed at finding a political settlement. He will visit Tajikistan during July 13-14 at the invitation of foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin to participate in a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). On the second day of the visit, he will take part in a meeting of the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan. Jaishankar will then travel to Uzbekistan to participate in a conference on regional trade, transport and connectivity in Tashkent during July 15-16. He is expected to meet several key interlocutors on the margins of the conference with the theme “Central and South Asia: Regional connectivity. challenges and opportunities”. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi is set to attend all three events, but people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that no bilateral meeting with Jaishankar has so far been lined up. Though the main item on the agenda of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting is the preparations for the SCO heads of states’ meeting to be held in Dushanbe during September 16-17, the people cited above said the situation in Afghanistan is expected to figure prominently in the discussions. Afghanistan has observer status with the SCO, which includes India, Kazakhstan, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar is expected to participate in both meetings in Dushanbe. Though the focus of the conference in Uzbekistan is on regional trade and connectivity, the presence of top leaders will provide opportunities for the Indian side to discuss the situation in Afghanistan on the margins of the meeting. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is expected to attend the meeting in Tashkent. The Uzbek government was keen to rope in the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers for the meeting in Tashkent, but the two countries will be represented by their foreign ministers. Representatives of China, Russia, Iran, the European Union and the US are also set to participate in the meeting. India has expressed strong concerns about the levels of violence in Afghanistan and Jaishankar asserted the need for a legitimate government in Kabul during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow last week. Russia has its own concerns about the violence in Afghanistan spilling over into the Central Asian states. Tajikistan has been concerned over the worsening security situation, especially after more than 2,000 Afghan troops crossed over into its territory this month to escape assaults by the Taliban. Many of these Afghan troops have since returned to Afghanistan. Amid the drawdown of US forces in Afghanistan, the Taliban have also seized border crossings with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, which last month began a large-scale military exercise to assess the readiness of troops along the Afghan border. External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar will also participate in the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan that will meet on 14 July 2021 with the participation of the Afghanistan government. Ahead of the SCO Summit in September, several meetings of the ministers of defence, justice and finance of the member states are scheduled. Last month, national security advisers of SCO states met in Dushanbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-situation-to-figure-at-3-meetings-in-central-asian-states-101626104210134.html
12-07-2021||World||WHO calls for all studies involving human genome editing to be made public||The World Health Organization issued new recommendations Monday on human genome editing, calling for a global registry to track “any form of genetic manipulation” and proposing a whistle-blowing mechanism to raise concerns about unethical or unsafe research.The UN health agency commissioned an expert group in late 2018 following a dramatic announcement from Chinese scientist He Jiankui that he had created the world's first gene-edited babies.In two reports Monday, WHO's expert group said all studies involving human genome editing should be made public, although the committee noted that wouldn't necessarily stop unprincipled scientists.“In the field of stem cell research, unscrupulous entrepreneurs and clinics have deliberately misused clinical trial registries by registering procedures they plan to undertake as if they were properly sanctioned clinical trials,” the group said, calling for WHO to ensure that all genetic editing research registered in their database are reviewed and approved by an ethics committee.When Chinese scientist He announced he had altered the DNA of twin babies to prevent them from catching HIV, he said the university where he worked was not aware and that he had funded the work himself. He was later sentenced to three years in jail for conducting “illegal medical practices.”WHO's expert group also said the UN agency should develop ways to identify any potentially concerning gene editing trials, saying a mechanism should be developed “for reporting violations of research integrity.”Robin Lovell-Badge of the Francis Crick Institute, one of the experts on the committee, cited several instances where scientists in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey planning controversial genetic editing experiments were pressured not to proceed and called for a more formal whistle-blowing mechanism.Still, the group acknowledged that as gene editing techniques become cheaper and easier to use, the ability of WHO to monitor such research is limited. The UN agency also has no authority to compel countries to cooperate, even during a public health emergency.During the coronavirus pandemic, for example, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has repeatedly criticized rich countries for not sharing their vaccines, warning in January that the world was on the brink of a “catastrophic moral failure.”But rich countries have made little effort to immediately share their doses with poor countries, even as Covid-19 spikes across Africa and Southeast Asia. Of the more than 3 billion vaccines that have been administered globally since then, fewer than 2% have been in poor countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-calls-for-all-studies-involving-human-genome-editing-to-be-made-public-101626097152547.html
12-07-2021||World||EU to delay plan for new levy on digital services||The European Commission will delay its plan to put forward a new levy on digital services later in July, a spokesman said on Monday, following intense pressure from the US administration.Some European officials have also questioned the value of the EU executive's planned tax after the world's 20 largest economies agreed on Saturday on a global reform of corporate tax.The US administration is wary of the EU's initiative as it wants existing national digital service taxes to be repealed as part of the global overhaul of cross-border corporate taxation."We have decided to put on hold our work on our new digital levy as a new EU-own resource," EU commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie told a news conference in Brussels.The EU will reassess the situation in the autumn, he said.On Saturday, EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni had said that the EU's priority was to implement the G20 deal when asked whether the digital services levy plan may be postponed."Successfully concluding this process will require a final effort from all parties, and the Commission is committed to focusing on that effort," Ferrie said, referring to the global tax deal, whose final details have to be agreed in October, before national approvals by the over 130 countries that have so far endorsed it.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has met top EU officials in the last few days and meets EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels on Monday. Before the meeting a source close to the EU had said it was a priority for her to derail the new digital levy.The United States also feared that the EU plan, if proposed in July, could undermine the global deal and complicated its approval in the US Congress. Even within the Commission there was opposition, with one European official echoing the view that the new levy could hurt the broader global agreement.The EU has been trying for years to impose its own digital levy and was aiming to put its proposal forward this month to raise revenues to finance its huge economic recovery plan in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-delay-plan-for-new-levy-on-digital-services-101626089317573.html
12-07-2021||World||European consumer organisation lodges plaint against WhatsApp, says privacy policy breached multiple consumer rights||The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) on Monday lodged a complaint against Facebook-owned WhatsApp messenger over the company’s latest privacy policy updates. In January WhatsApp introduced a new privacy policy, according to which, some data of the users could be shared with its parent company Facebook Inc and other firms owned by the group. However, WhatsApp also said that the changes would not affect private conversations of the users.Many users globally criticised the new policies of the company and rival messaging applications such as Telegram and Signal messenger also saw their user base expanding due to many switching from WhatsApp.Criticising this policy change, the BEUC along with eight of its members, lodged a complaint with the European Commission and the European network of consumer authorities aimed at WhatsApp for “multiple breaches of consumer rights.” The complaint focussed on how the company has left no choice for its users but to accept the changes. “The content of these notifications, their nature, timing and recurrence put an undue pressure on users and impair their freedom of choice. As such, they are a breach of the EU Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices,” the BEUC’s complaint said.Also read | WhatsApp will put policy on hold till data law is enactedAlso, it pointed out that the new terms of use have not been explained in simple and plain language by the company. “It is basically impossible for consumers to get a clear understanding of what consequences WhatsApp’s changes entail for their privacy, particularly in relation to the transfer of their personal data to Facebook and other third parties,” it said, noting that the ambiguity amounts to a breach of EU’s consumer laws.In an accompanying report with the complaint, titled ‘What’s Up With WhatsApp - an assessment of WhatsApp’s practices in the light of EU consumer protection rule,’ the BEUC said the data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook has increased incrementally with various amendments to the privacy policy of the messaging platform by the parent company.Meanwhile, Facebook, in its response, said that the BEUC has misunderstood the purpose of the terms of service. “BEUC's action is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the update to our terms of service,” news agency Reuters quoted a spokesperson from the company.“The update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook, and does not impact the privacy of your messages with friends or family, wherever they are in the world. We would welcome an opportunity to explain the update to BEUC to clarify what it means for people,” they further said, Reuters reported.BEUC, an umbrella group of 46 independent consumer organisations from 32 countries, urged the European network of consumer authorities and network of data protection authorities “to work in close cooperation” regarding the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-consumer-organisation-lodged-plaint-against-whatsapp-says-privacy-policy-breached-multiple-consumer-rights-101626090000500.html

The bench comprised four other senior most justices -- Dipak Kumar Karki, Mira Khadka, Ishwar Prasad Khatiwada and Dr Ananda Mohan Bhattarai -- at the apex court.President Bidya Devi Bhandari had dissolved the 275-member lower house for the second time in five months on May 22 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli and announced snap elections on November 12 and November 19.Last week, the Election Commission had announced the schedule for mid-term elections despite the uncertainty over polls.As many as 30 petitions, including one by the opposition alliance led by the Nepali Congress, were filed against the dissolution of the House by the President.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).On February 23, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives, in a setback to embattled Prime Minister Oli who was preparing for snap polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-sc-orders-to-appoint-sher-bahadur-deuba-as-pm-within-next-28-hours-101626077841170.html

South Korea, which is currently witnessing the fourth wave of the pandemic, has so far recorded 1,69,146 cases and 2,044 deaths due to the viral disease.According to the new regulations, private social gatherings of three or more people will be prohibited after 6pm, churches and night clubs will be closed, and visitors will not be allowed at hospitals and nursing homes. All types of rallies have been banned and only family members can attend funerals and marriages.On Sunday, 1,100 people tested positive for Covid-19, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). This is the sixth consecutive day that the daily infections were above the 1,000 mark. However, the fourth wave of the pandemic has brought fewer serious cases and deaths than the earlier ones and many senior citizens along with vulnerable people have been vaccinated, news agency Reuters reported.On the other hand, health authorities and experts have warned the situation might worsen as a rising number of young patients have not been vaccinated yet and the threat of the highly infectious Delta variant is still looming.A report by the Washington Post on July 9 said that during the earlier period of the pandemic, South Korea had received global recognition for controlling the viral disease by carrying out robust testing and contract tracing and while also avoiding a strict countrywide lockdown.The report added that authorities might have given an incorrect signal to the public with the “premature lifting” of Covid-related restrictions. Choi Jae-wook, a medical professor at the Korea University in Seoul, told the Washington Post that as the delta variant of Covid-19 is spreading globally, authorities should have tightened and not eased the restrictions.The fourth level of social distancing restrictions starting Monday has also put the country’s industrial sector into an ‘emergency mode’. Industries are now focusing on reducing cases among their employees by expanding the spectrum of telework, which in simple terms means working from home, and have also upgraded their in-house quarantine guidelines, according to news agency ANI. Samsung has asked its employees to refrain from visiting karaoke, nightclubs and bars and get tested for Covid-19 before returning to work if they visited such places. LG Electronics, meanwhile, is imposing a total ban on business trips, training and external meetings.(With inputs from agencies, The Washington Post)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19south-korea-s-seoul-faces-strictest-distancing-curbs-as-virus-spreads-101626074594528.html

The storm is moving towards the direction of the earth and is expected to batter parts of the planet.According to website Spaceweather.com, the storm is approaching the Earth at a speed of 1.6 million kilometres. It originated from the Sun's atmosphere and can have a significant impact on a region of space dominated by Earth's magnetic field.Due to solar storms, the outer atmosphere of the Earth can be heated which can have a direct effect on satellites. This can cause interference with GPS navigation, mobile phone signal and satellite TV. The current in power lines can be high, which can also blow transformers.What do we know about solar storm?In May this year, millions of tons of super-heated gas shot off from the surface of the sun and hurtled 90 million miles toward Earth. The eruption, called a coronal mass ejection and when it hit the Earth’s magnetic field it triggered the strongest geomagnetic storm seen for years, reported Bloomberg.In March 1989, a solar storm over Quebec caused a province-wide outage that lasted nine hours, according to Hydro-Quebec’s website.To head off such a catastrophe, US President Barack Obama’s administration laid out a strategy to begin raising awareness of the dangers of massive solar storms and to assess the risks they pose. Last year, President Donald Trump signed the ProSwift bill into law, which aims to build up technology to improve forecasting and measurement of space weather events.How does a solar storm form?Solar storms have their roots in an 11-year cycle that shifts the polarity of the Sun’s magnetic field. The magnetic forces at work on the sun get tangled during the process and can punch out through the surface, sending the sun’s plasma into outer space and potentially triggering storms on Earth.The most powerful geomagnetic storm ever recorded resulted in the 1859 Carrington Event when telegraph lines electrified, destroying operators and setting offices ablaze in North America and Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highspeed-solar-storm-may-hit-earth-today-all-you-need-to-know-101626068079285.html
12-07-2021||World||Sydney records 112 new Covid cases as Delta outbreak worsens||Sydney recorded 112 new coronavirus cases on Monday, as the locked-down Australian city battles its largest outbreak since beating back the first wave of the pandemic more than a year ago.“We just want people to stay at home. The virus won’t spread if people don’t leave home. That is the bottom line,” New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney on Monday. At the weekend, Australia’s most-populous city recorded its first death since April after the delta-strain leaked into the local community in mid-June.The city of 6 million people has been in lockdown since June 26, and faces being increasingly isolated from the rest of the nation after Berejiklian indicated that the current stay-at-home orders may need to be extended beyond Friday. On Sunday, Victoria state implemented a hard border with its neighbor, and plans for an Australia-Singapore travel bubble have been delayed until at least the end of the year.The outbreak is highlighting the problems nation’s tardy vaccine roll-out, which has been hit by supply-chain hold-ups from contracted drug-makers amid accusations from political rivals that Prime Minister Scott Morrison failed to secure enough doses from a wide-enough range of suppliers.Alongside other so-called “Covid-zero” nations such as China and Singapore, the persistent outbreaks show the limits of Australia’s strategy to beat the pandemic with closed international borders and rigorous testing. The Labor opposition says the delta variant is responsible for more than 20 virus leaks out of the nation’s quarantine hotels.The Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker shows Australia has administered enough doses for just 17.8% of its population, compared with the U.K. with 60.4% and the U.S. with 52.2%In a bid to encourage more Australians to get the jab, Morrison’s government has launched an televised advertising campaign featuring a young female actor struggling to breath. Bill Bowtell, an adjunct professor in infectious diseases at the University of New South Wales, described the ad -- which has received a barrage of criticism on social media -- as “not honest or truthful or authentic.”Economic engine room“We are facing a terribly serious problem in Sydney -- the worst health crisis in 120 years,” Bowtell told an Australian Broadcasting Corp. interview Monday. He’s calling for tougher stay-at-home restrictions to be imposed in Sydney so the city can exit lockdown sooner, similar to what Melbourne endured last year in one of the world’s longest and most stringent lockdowns. “Businesses are being smashed. People are being laid off.”Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney, agreed that the repercussions of the lockdown to businesses were going to be serious, with New South Wales the nation’s economic engine room.“It’s going to be the longest lockdown we’ve had since Victoria back in the middle of last year,” he said in an interview Friday. “The longer they go on, the more permanent economic damage they do -- businesses having to close and people changing their behavior and it then takes longer to recover from that.”The testing, tracing and quarantining system in New South Wales, which accounts for 32% of national gross domestic product, is being heavily tested by the delta variant, HSBC Global Research said in a note on Monday.“The lockdown in Greater Sydney will weigh significantly on economic activity for as long as it is in place, at least initially mostly impacting” the third quarter, it said, adding that New South Wales Treasury estimates that each week of lockdown wipes A$850 million ($637 million) from the growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-records-112-new-covid-cases-as-delta-outbreak-worsens-101626071380326.html

12-07-2021||World||US, Canada hit by new round of scorching hot temperatures||Millions of people across the western United States and Canada were hit Sunday by a new round of scorching hot temperatures, with some roads closed, train traffic limited and new evacuations ordered.In Canada, with wildfires continuing to spread -- including 50 more blazes erupting in the past two days -- the government announced new emergency measures aimed at preventing further fires.Sweltering conditions hit much of the Pacific seaboard and as far inland as the western edge of the Rocky Mountains over the weekend."A dangerous heat wave will affect much of the western US, with record-breaking temperatures likely," the National Weather service said on its website Sunday, while Canadian meteorologists predicted highs approaching 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) in parts of western Canada -- well above seasonal norms.Las Vegas on Saturday matched its all-time record of 117 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) -- a temperature recorded in the desert entertainment city once in 1942 and three other times since 2005.Sunday was expected to be only a few degrees cooler there, while Death Valley, California -- often the nation's hottest spot -- was headed for a high of 126 degrees Fahrenheit.Forecasters issued an excessive heat warning for several other urban centers including the southern city of Phoenix and San Jose, the center of the Silicon Valley tech industry south of San Francisco.The weekend's hot weather follows an earlier heat wave that struck the western United States and Canada at the end of June.The scorching conditions saw the all-time record daily temperature broken three days in a row in the Canadian province of British Columbia.Warming temperatures Canadian transport minister Omar Alghabra on Sunday announced new emergency measures aimed at preventing further wildfires in the tinder-dry region, including steps to slow or limit train traffic.Trains are a common cause of wildfires, often when their spark-arresting devices are poorly maintained.Several roads and highways in the area have been closed as the government rated the wildfire risk in much of the province as "extreme." A dozen towns or locales remained under evacuation orders.The Canadian government has sent investigators to the town of Lytton, 150 miles (250 kilometers) northeast of Vancouver, to see whether a passing cargo train might have caused a late June fire that destroyed 90 percent of the town.The overall death toll in British Columbia was not yet known but is thought to run into the hundreds.As of Sunday morning, the number of wildfires across British Columbia was continuing to rise, hitting 298, authorities said.In the US state of Oregon, the Bootleg Fire more than tripled in size between Friday and Sunday, gaining more than 100,000 acres, according to the US Forest Service.Last month was the hottest June on record in North America, according to data released by the European Union's climate monitoring service.Human activity has driven global temperatures up, stoking increasingly fierce storms, extreme heatwaves, droughts and wildfires.The World Meteorological Organization and Britain's Met Office said in May there was a 40 percent chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily surpassing 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures within the next five years.The past six years, including 2020, have been the six warmest on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-canada-hit-by-new-round-of-scorching-hot-temperatures-101626056692671.html

They reached an altitude of about 88 kilometers over the New Mexico desert - enough to see the curvature of the Earth. The crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness before making a gliding descent back to Earth."I am so incredibly honoured to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all," 34-year-old Bandla tweeted days before the flight."When I first heard that I was getting this opportunity, it was just... I was speechless. I think that that probably captured it very well. This is an incredible opportunity to get people from different backgrounds, different geographies and different communities into space," she said in a video posted on the Twitter handle of Virgin Galactic on July 6.The primary objective for Unity 22 was to serve as a test flight for future commercial passenger flights by Virgin Galactic.Bandla, who was born in Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh and brought up in Houston, was astronaut No 004 and her flight role was Researcher Experience. The other crew members were two pilots and three other crewmates, including billionaire Branson, who turns 71 in a week.She became the third Indian-origin woman to fly into space after Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams. Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma is the only Indian citizen to travel in space. The former Indian Air Force pilot flew aboard Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme.Bandla moved to the US when she was 4-year-old and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University in 2011. She finished her Master of Business Administration degree from George Washington University in 2015.Bandla wanted to be an astronaut for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, her poor eyesight meant she could not meet the requirements to become a pilot or an astronaut.When she was at Purdue University, a professor told her about an opportunity in the field of commercial space flights.Virgin Galactic - the business Branson started in 2004 - aims to fly private citizens to the edge of space. The trips are designed to permit passengers to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and observe the curvature of Earth.Sunday's test flight was telecast live.The gleaming white space plane was borne with a twin-fuselage carrier jet VMS Eve (named after Branson's mother).Branson has earlier stated that the entire flight will be about 90-minutes long and can be broadly divided into four portions: ascent up to launch position, release, flight to space and glide back to Earth for a runway landing at Spaceport America.The Virgin Galactic carrier can launch up to eight people (two pilots and six passengers) on the Unity 22 flight, but on Sunday there were only six occupants (two pilots and four passengers).The four mission specialists evaluated different experiences that Virgin Galactic has promised its future customers, many of whom have already reserved trips to space with the company at USD 250,000 a seat.Bandla tested the experience of performing experiments aboard Unity during different phases of the flight, including the weightless period.This was the 22nd flight of Unity, but only its fourth launch to space.VSS Unity is the company's second SpaceShipTwo after the first, VSS Enterprise, broke apart during a 2014 test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another.Virgin Galactic has made numerous safety upgrades to prevent such an accident from happening again.If one has booked a trip with Virgin Galactic early, he may get your chance to fly in space as early as 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sirisha-bandla-becomes-3rd-indian-american-woman-to-fly-into-space-101626056465092.html
12-07-2021||World||Woman infected with two variants of Covid-19 at the same time||A 90-year-old woman who died after falling ill with Covid-19 was infected with both the Alpha and Beta variants of the coronavirus at the same time, researchers in Belgium said Sunday, adding that the rare phenomenon may be underestimated.The unvaccinated woman, who lived alone and received at-home nursing care, was admitted to the OLV Hospital in the Belgian city of Aalst after a spate of falls in March and tested positive for Covid-19 the same day.While her oxygen levels were initially good, her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died five days later.When medical staff tested for the presence of any variants of concern, they found that she was carrying both the Alpha variant, which originated in Britain, and the Beta variant first detected in South Africa.“Both these variants were circulating in Belgium at the time, so it is likely that the lady was co-infected with different viruses from two different people,” said molecular biologist Anne Vankeerberghen from the OLV Hospital who led the research.“Unfortunately, we don’t know how she became infected,” she said.Vankeerberghen said it was difficult to say whether the co-infection played a role in the fast deterioration of the patient.The research, which has not yet been submitted to a medical journal for publication, is being presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases.While Vankeerberghen said in a press release that there had been “no other published cases” of similar co-infections, she added that the “phenomenon is probably underestimated due to limited testing for variants of concern and the lack of a simple way to identify co-infections with whole genome sequencing”.This is because of limited testing for variants of concern, she said, calling for an increase in the use of fast PCR testing to detect known variant mutations.Researchers have also previously found evidence of people becoming infected with multiple variants of influenza. The cases suggest co-infection might be more common than currently known.In January, scientists in Brazil reported that two people had been simultaneously infected with two different variants of the coronavirus, but the study has yet to be published in a scientific journal.In comments reacting to the research, Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, said it was not a surprise to find an individual infected with more than one variant.“This study does highlight the need for more studies to determine whether infection with multiple variants of concern affects the clinical course of Covid-19 and whether this in any way compromises the efficacy of vaccination,” he added.Such instances also raise questions over how much protection vaccines can provide. With the rapidly spreading Delta variant now the dominant variant in many places, including the UK, drugmakers are rushing to test their shots against variants and create new versions that could provide a better defence.Countries are also mulling whether to offer booster shots this winter to guard against diminishing responses from vaccines.Belgium, like much of the European Union, faced vaccine delivery problems early in 2021 and its vaccination programme started slowly, although the EU has now delivered vaccines to cover 70% of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-infected-with-two-variants-of-covid-19-at-the-same-time-101626049152477.html

The organisation has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group, the news outlet reported.It was painted in front of Palo Alto City Hall in June of 2020 following George Floyd's murder that created the Black Lives Matter movement in the US against racial injustice.He was killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes, which was captured on video footage in May 2020 and triggered nationwide demonstrations for racial justice.Later Chauvin was convicted for murdering Floyd and has been sentenced to 22.5 years in prison.Meanwhile, Molly Stump, the city's attorney, told the news outlet that Palo Alto has not been served with the lawsuit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-cops-sue-palo-alto-city-over-black-lives-matter-mural-101626049114210.html

The measure will last throughout the Olympics and end on August 22.The government has requested bars and restaurants not to offer alcohol as part of efforts to prevent infections, reported NHK World.Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato Katsunobu said on Sunday that the government will consider providing subsidies more quickly to make it easier for pub owners to cooperate.The emergency declarations and focused anti-infection measures are scheduled to continue through August 22.The duration includes the Tokyo Olympics between July 23 and August 8 and the Obon holiday period in mid-August when many people usually visit their hometowns or tourist spots, reported NHK World.The government is urging people to take thorough anti-virus measures out of concern that an increase of people's movement could spread infections. Officials are also concerned about the spread of the Delta variant.The government also extended the state of emergency for the south-western prefecture of Okinawa and intensive anti-virus measures for Tokyo's neighbouring prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa, as well as the western prefecture of Osaka, reported NHK World.The government has been pushing ahead with its vaccination drive to curb infections and reduce the risk of patients becoming seriously ill.It plans to consider lifting the emergency declaration earlier if the situation improves and the strain on the medical system is eased.Tokyo reported 614 new infections on Sunday, up 96 from a week ago.New daily cases in the capital have been up week-on-week for 22 straight days, reported NHK World.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-tokyo-to-enter-4th-state-of-emergency-from-today-101626047599142.html

There were a few arrests and scuffles.A Reuters reporter witnessed police pepper spray a few protesters and hit others with batons, but there was no attempt to directly confront the thousands chanting "Freedom" as they gathered and marched in the city center. Their shouts of “Diaz- Canel step down” drowned out groups of government supporters chanting "Fidel."The protests broke out in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana, with video on social media showing hundreds of residents chanting anti-government slogans and demanding everything from coronavirus vaccines to an end of daily blackouts.“I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,” local resident Claris Ramirez said by phone.“They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine,” she added.Diaz-Canel, who had just returned from San Antonio de los Banos, said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and “mercenaries” on the ground, and warned that further “provocations” would not be tolerated.There were protests later on Sunday hundreds of miles (km) to the east in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba, where social media video showed hundreds marching through the streets, again confirmed by a local resident.“They are protesting the crisis, that there is no food or medicine, that you have to buy everything at the foreign currency stores, and on and on the list goes,” Claudia Perez said.ECONOMIC CRISIS"We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations," Diaz-Canel said in his broadcast remarks.The Communist-run country has been experiencing a worsening economic crisis for two years, which the government blames mainly on U.S. sanctions and the pandemic, while its detractors cite incompetence and a Soviet-style one-party system.A combination of sanctions, local inefficiencies and the pandemic has shut down tourism and slowed other foreign revenue flows in a country dependent on them to import the bulk of its food, fuel and inputs for agriculture and manufacturing.The economy contracted 10.9% last year, and 2% through June of 2021.There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths this year, with a record 6,900 cases and 47 deaths reported on Saturday.Cuba has two vaccines and has begun a mass vaccination campaign, with 1.7 million of its 11.2 million residents vaccinated to date and twice that many at various states of the three-shot process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-protesters-take-to-the-streets-in-cuba-against-vaccine-shortage-101626047064464.html

12-07-2021||World||Wildfire pushing California toward the brink of blackouts||A wildfire raging uncontrollably across southern Oregon has knocked out three electrical lines so critical to the stability of grids in the western U.S. that California has warned of rotating blackouts and Nevada faced a power emergency.The fast-moving Bootleg fire crippled a key transmission system known as the California Oregon Intertie that the Golden State has depended on for years for electricity imports.Making matters worse: The takedown of the intertie has had a knock-on effect on another key import hub known as the Pacific DC Intertie that brings in electricity from the Pacific Northwest, California’s grid operator said in a media briefing Saturday. In all, California has lost 5,500 megawatts of power-import capacity -- enough to light up roughly 4.13 million homes.After days of pushing state residents to conserve energy with the risk of rolling blackouts, the grid operator said conditions are expected to be stable with no flex alert planned Sunday -- for now. The transmission lines knocked out by the Bootleg fire are still out of service, affecting power supplies.The fact that a single wildfire has brought America’s most populous and affluent state to the brink of blackouts is among the most powerful demonstrations yet of how vulnerable the world’s power grids have become to the effects of climate change.Extreme heat, drought and dry conditions globally have shrunk hydropower reserves, driven up electricity demand to record levels and touched off some of the worst wildfire seasons in modern history.Climate change is “forcing us to do things we never imagined” at this time of the year, said Elliot Mainzer, who took over as chief executive officer of grid manager California Independent System Operator nine months ago. The agency is “anticipating what could be a very long and hot summer,” he said.California has emerged as the epicenter of climate disasters in the U.S. Wildfires burned an unprecedented 4.3 million acres across the state last year, killing 33 people and scorching nearly 10,500 structures.In August, California suffered its first rolling blackouts since the U.S. West energy crisis two decades ago because of extremely hot weather. And in a foreshadowing of what was to come: Days before this year’s summer officially began, high temperatures forced the California ISO to make an unusually early call for conservation, allowing the region to duck another round of rotating outages.“Bottom line is we took everything we learned from last summer, and we still came into this summer thinking our issues were going to primarily be associated with August and September,” Mainzer said, but “we had the first major heat wave four days before the official beginning of summer.”On Friday evening, the grid operator took the rare step of ordering a Stage 2 emergency -- one step away from rotating blackouts -- to cope with the loss of import capacity. Energy conservation helped the state avert a crisis. But as temperatures rose yet again and supplies fell off the grid Saturday, Mainzer said, “We’re going to need more. Honestly, I think we are going to need more response than we saw last night.”The grid operator issued an all-clear at about 9 p.m. local time Saturday. Earlier in the day, Governor Gavin Newsom also signed an order to free up more energy capacity to help alleviate the supply crunch.California wasn’t the only state facing power woes. Nevada’s power system was among those in the region that also faced emergency levels on Friday evening, said Mark Rothleder, California’s ISO’s chief operating officer. On top of managing California’s grid, the agency serves as a reliability coordinator and is responsible for monitoring conditions across the western region.Nevada utility NV Energy Inc. said it wasn’t forced to resort to blackouts, but the company was calling for customers to conserve over the weekend.Exactly when the Bootleg fire would subside enough to re-energize the California Oregon Intertie remains to be seen. Mainzer said it was possible the lines would return to service on Sunday at midnight local time, but the grid operator was operating under the assumption that the system would remain down.The Bootleg fire had burned through 76,897 acres of southern Oregon and zero percent of it was contained as of Saturday afternoon, forcing evacuations in Klamath County and shutting sections of a national forest, according to an update from the U.S. Fire Service. Meanwhile, the agency said, it has no timeline available for the restart of the intertie lines.Temperatures across California were forecast to remain high into Sunday, with Sacramento set to reach 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius), before cooling down slightly Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfire-pushing-california-toward-the-brink-of-blackouts-101626036009111.html

It’s partly driven by the more transmissible Delta variant and partly by increased social mixing with the easing of lockdown rules. New cases now stand at over 34,000 a day.Yellen ‘very concerned’US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday she was “very concerned” about the risk that new variants could pose to the global economic recovery from the pandemic.“We are very concerned about the Delta variant and other variants that could emerge and threaten recovery,” she told reporters following a G20 meeting in Venice. “We are a connected global economy, what happens in any part of the world affects all other countries.”In Thailand, beauty contestants who took part in a pageant last month could face criminal charges for not wearing masks, police said on Sunday, after a cluster of 22 infections emerged from the event.Thirteen contestants and nine others associated with the Miss Grand Samut Sakhon pageant, which was held at a Bangkok venue late June, have tested positive for the virus, officers said.Thailand is grappling with a deadly third wave of Covid-19 infections with 9,539 new cases announced on Saturday and 86 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-masks-now-expected-beyond-july-19-101626030429410.html

This has led to conflict, war, terrorism, refugees, among other complications that still persist today,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. “The US, in disregard of its responsibilities and obligations, hastily withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving a mess and turmoil to the Afghan people and regional countries.”Separately, Pakistan-based News International has reported that Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi is set to discuss the Afghan security situation with counterparts from Russia, India, Pakistan and several Central Asian countries at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation next week.Anti-missile system set up at Kabul airportAfghan authorities said on Sunday that they have installed an anti-missile system at Kabul’s main airport to counter incoming rockets, as the Taliban pressed on with a blistering offensive across the country.Washington and its allies are due to end their military mission in Afghanistan at the end of next month, even as the insurgents claim that they now control 85% of the country’s soil.“The newly installed air defence system has been operational in Kabul since 2am on Sunday,” the country’s interior ministry said. “The system has proven useful in the world in repelling rocket and missile attacks.”Afghan security forces spokesman Ajmal Omar Shinwari said the system was given by “our foreign friends”. “It has complicated technology. Our foreign friends are operating it while we are trying to build the capacity to use it,” he said.The Taliban fighters have been regularly launching rockets at government forces across Afghanistan.‘Pakistan can facilitate peace, not guarantee it’Pakistan said it is prepared to deal with the spillover effect it may face in case a civil war unfolds in Afghanistan, the country’s army spokesman said, insisting that Islamabad is only a “facilitator” of the Afghan peace process, not a “guarantor”.“Pakistan is only a facilitator of the Afghan peace process, not a guarantor,” Babar Iftikhar told ARY News. “Pakistan has no favourites among the Afghan stakeholders. The Afghans have to choose their leadership.”He said Pakistan was well aware that the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating and that measures were taken to deal with it. He also said the security on the border has been tightened. Over 90% of the 2,611km border has been fenced. Pakistan is “very well prepared” to handle the current situation, the spokesperson said, adding that there were fears of a fresh wave of Afghan refugees heading towards Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-us-for-afghan-crisis-101626030047818.html

His legal team approached the Dominica high court last week seeking relief on the ground that his health was deteriorating and he needed urgent medical attention.“Dominica courts finally upheld the rule of law and rights of a human to be treated in the medical facilities of his choice. And all attempts by various agencies did not bear fruits. There is solace in saying that all clever foxes end up as fur coats,” Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal told HT on Monday.Meanwhile, the proceedings against him in the illegal entry case filed by Dominica police have been adjourned.As reported by HT, Choksi also approached the high court last week seeking a judicial review of the criminal case against him alleging that he had been abducted from Antigua and Barbuda and brought to Dominica as part of collusion between the two island nations and the Indian government.The allegations have been rejected by all three governments.Choksi went missing from Antigua on May 23 and was found in Dominica the next day.The Indian government has sought his deportation directly from Dominica as he is an illegal citizen there, while in Antigua, he enjoys constitutional and legal protection.The businessman, who fled India in January 2018 after cheating Punjab National Bank of $952 million, is currently facing extradition proceedings, as well as revocation of citizenship proceedings, in Antigua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strictly-for-treatment-mehul-choksi-gets-interim-bail-can-travel-to-antigua-101626106131772.html

12-07-2021||India||Customs dept plans to move Kerala gold smuggling accused to another state||The customs department probing the Kerala gold smuggling case is planning to move the main accused in the case to a neighbouring state alleging intervention from many quarters, HT has learnt.Last week one of the accused, PS Sarith, gave a statement before a court that he was pressurized into taking the names of the Congress and BJP leaders.Five main accused are in jail under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (Cofeposa). One of them, Sarith, deposed before a court alleging that jail authorities were torturing him and forced him to take names of Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders to implicate them in the case. Later, central jail authorities in Thiruvananthapuram denied this and filed a counter-complaint against him and another accused KT Ramees saying they regularly flout jail norms and discipline. “It is a serious issue. We are planning to move the High Court with a plea to shift these accused to another jail. Threat to Cofeposa detainees is really serious and we also have informed the central government about this,” said a senior customs officer who did not wish to be named.He said the Centre can also move the Supreme Court to shift all cases relating to the gold smuggling to another state if the situation continued.Earlier, the mother of another accused named Swapna Suresh also alleged that her daughter was facing threat to her life for not changing her statements. She alleged that many in the CM’s office were aware that the smuggling was done through the consulate office. Then consulate head used to visit the CM quite often, she alleged. The Congress and BJP deplored the alleged move to implicate its leaders. “The ruling CPI(M) will have to pay a heavy price for this,” said state Congress chief K Sudhakaran. “Desperate, the government wants to sully the image of opposition leaders,” said BJP state president K Surendran. At least four central agencies (customs, revenue intelligence, enforcement directorate (ED) and NIA) are involved in the gold smuggling probe. The sensational case came to light on July 5 last year after 30 kilograms of gold was seized from a consignment that came to the United Arab Emirates consulate in the state capital camouflaged as a diplomatic consignment.The central agencies and state government locked horns several times over the case. The government filed a case against the ED last year and later constituted a judicial commission against it saying it was trying to implicate many state leaders including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-dept-plans-to-move-kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-to-another-state-101626102588650.html

The results are expected to be announced by July 31.The AICTE calendar was approved by a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose who said that an exception is being made to the schedule only on account of the pandemic.While dates of the entrance examination by various institutions are yet to be announced, AICTE has asked all technical institutions to complete the first round of counseling by September 30, and second round by October 10. Those who wish to seek cancellation of seats in the first semester will get a full fee refund if they apply before October 15. Institutions will have time till October 20 to fill up these vacancies.In standalone institutions providing post-graduate diploma in management (PGDM) or certificate courses in management, the last date for admissions will be August 11. For open and distance learning courses or courses taught through the online medium, admissions will close on September 10 for the first session and February 1, 2022 for the second session, as per the AICTE’s revised schedule.The revised calendar for the present academic session 2021-22 was presented to the top court in an application by AICTE through advocate Harish Pandey. Admission to engineering and technical courses follow an academic calendar fixed by the Supreme Court back in December 2012 that cannot be modified without permission of the top court.As per this order, classes for engineering and technical courses are to commence from August 1 every year and vacancies, if any, are to be filled up by colleges/institutions before August 15.Last year also, this schedule could not be followed as admissions were delayed due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The AICTE revised the schedule thrice during the previous year – first in August, then in October and lastly in November. Eventually, the deadline for commencement of classes last year was December 1 and students were allowed to seek cancellation of admission with full fee refund till November 30, 2020.This year, the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic forced AICTE to submit a revised calendar for approval to the court. Appearing for the AICTE, additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj told the apex court that technical institutions were able to commence classes for 2020-21 only in January 2021 and even the second semester exams got delayed due to the pandemic.For fresh admissions, the results of the Class 12 Board exams, generally out by June first week, have been delayed till July 31, ASG Nataraj said. Due to lockdown in several states, AICTE could not complete inspection of institutions that sought grant of approval or affiliation.The court allowed AICTE time till July 15 to grant approval to technical institutions, standalone PGDM institutions and other institutions offering open, distance learning and online medium courses. The deadline for approving affiliation by any university or board to any technical institution was also extended to August 10, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/classes-in-engineering-tech-institutes-to-begin-25-oct-says-aicte-s-new-sked-101626101328567.html

Tourist bonanza, pilgrimage travel, religious fervour, all are needed, but can wait for a few more months,” the IMA said. “Opening up these rituals and enabling people without vaccination to go scot-free in these mass gatherings are potential super spreaders for the Covid third wave,” it added.Also read | RT-PCR reports, hotel bookings: Check guidelines issued by Uttarakhand govt for touristsThe IMA’s warnings came amid several reports emerging of large tourist gatherings at hill stations like Manali, Nainital and Mussoorie without following norms across the country.

The state government has now made it mandatory for tourists to carry a negative RT-PCR certificate and proof of hotel bookings made before their arrival in Uttarakhand.

He cautioned tourists that they will not be allowed entry without registration, RT-PCR test and hotel bookings.Also Read: Amid tourists’ rush, Dehradun, Nainital hotels to run at 50% occupancyUttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami ordered authorities to cap hotel occupations at famous tourist spots of Nainital and Dehradun at 50 per cent. “We have issued an order regarding 50% occupancy capping in Nainital, Dehradun hotels. Challans are being issued to those who are not wearing masks. We are making all efforts to make people follow the Covid guidelines,” Dhami said.Tourists have been arriving in large numbers over the past few days at Mussoorie, Nainital, Haridwar, Rishikesh. Mussoorie's circle officer Narendra Pant told news agency ANI that tourists are being stopped at Kuthal Gate to check if they have registered on the smart city portal and are carrying a negative Covid-19 test report with them. Recorded messages urging people to abide by Covid-19 preventive measures are being played in Mussoorie. This has caused the footfall to decline in comparison to last week, Pant added.Authorities in Nainital have banned the entry of tourists to the city lake during the day over weekends.Tourism dependent states have opened up for visitors and visuals of maskless crowds thronging tourist spots have been doing the rounds on social media.Experts have been cautioning state governments against doing away with Covid-19 restrictions too soon. Union ministry of health and family welfare joint secretary, Luv Aggarwal, has warned against pandemic fatigue and cautioned that the coronavirus disease is still “among us” even though the restrictions have been lifted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also urged countries to control social mixing as the Delta variant rages through the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtpcr-reports-hotel-bookings-check-guidelines-issued-by-uttarakhand-govt-for-tourists-101626095734435.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have said they are closely monitoring the situation in Himachal Pradesh and assured chief minister Jairam Thakur of all possible help.Here's what you need to know about a cloudburst:(1.) Britannica.com describes cloudburst as a "sudden, very heavy" rainfall, which lasts only for a short period of time and is extremely local in nature.Also Read | IMD alerts: Heavy rainfall to continue in Himachal, Uttarakhand for 2 days(2.) Cloudbursts usually occur in connection with a thunderstorm. During these thunderstorms, a large amount of water may accumulate at high levels and, if the upward currents are weakened, the accumulated water comes down at one time, causing flash floods.(3.) Mountainous areas witness cloudbursts on a regular basis. This explains why hill states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are frequently affected by this phenomenon. The frequent occurrence of cloudbursts in such areas takes place probably because the warm air currents in a thunderstorm tend to follow the upward slope of a mountain.(4.) Cloudbursts cause great devastation in hilly areas because the water gets concentrated in gullies and valleys. The flash floods due to mountain cloudbursts are "sudden" and "destructive."(5.) Uttarakhand in particular has seen devastation due to cloudbursts. The Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA) has listed several cloudburst-related incidents on its website, including the June 2013 flash floods.(6.) The agency has also listed several measures to mitigate the effects of a cloudburst. It suggests that instead of valleys, people should live in areas on slopes with firm ground for safety reasons. In areas where ground fissures have developed, appropriate steps should be taken to check the infiltration of rainwater and surface water. It also suggests banning "indiscriminate" and "unscientific" construction works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flash-floods-in-himachal-pradesh-what-is-a-cloudburst-and-what-causes-it-101626092258660.html

The order, however, stays for tourists who will continue to have to produce a Covid negative certificate even if they have been fully vaccinated. The matter of allowing similar exemptions for tourists will be considered during the next hearing on August 5.Hearing an application filed by the Goa government which sought modification of the court’s earlier orders, by which it was made mandatory to test negative 72 hours prior to entering the state, the high court bench of justices MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar said, “We modify our order dated 06.05.2021 and permit entry to fully vaccinated persons, belonging to the undermentioned categories without such persons having a Covid negativity certificate,” the high court ordered. Among the categories of persons who will be excluded are those coming to the state for work, business, residents who have been stranded outside Goa because or the pandemic, and residents who are required to travel outside and return after a few days. The court said those who received the final dose of vaccine over two weeks ago and have not shown any symptoms of Covid will be considered fully vaccinated.Also Read | GBSHSE Goa Board SSC Class 10 Result 2021 declared, pass percentage is 99.72%The high court also asked the state to work out a mechanism to ensure that only those falling in the above categories are granted exemption. The state government had initially proposed that all those who are fully vaccinated be exempted from having to produce a Covid negative certificate. However, the court pointed to the situation in states such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand with videos of people flocking to the tourist hot spots, raising an alarm among the administration. “The state should clarify whether it seeks entry of tourists or others not covered in the categories exempted above, in the state of Goa without Covid negativity certificate. So also, the Central Government in the light of the experience it has gained from the reported incidents of rush at tourist places, to offer its say in this matter by filing an affidavit before the next date. This is because there were some reports of warnings issued by or on behalf of the Central Government about the relaxation of Covid safety protocols in states where the tourist influx is substantial,” the bench said. Goa has 1,848 active Covid cases, and has recorded 3,097 deaths till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nontourist-vaccinated-travellers-don-t-need-covid-test-to-enter-goahc-101626093827785.html

They will be wasting an entire year of their life if the counselling is not held. Imagine the loss caused to India as these doctors are not being allowed to join service of patients,” said a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hrishikesh Roy. Also Read | Write clear, short judgments that litigants can understand: SCThe court posted the matter for hearing next Monday and said, “We expect an expeditious decision to be taken and the court be informed on when the government intends to conduct counselling for MDS-NEET, results for which were announced on December 31. We hope the government of India is conscious of the consequences of the long delay in holding the counselling.” Additional Solicitor General (ASG) KM Nataraj appeared for the Centre before the court representing the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and said that the government was committed to holding counselling, but the delay was on account of a decision by Madras high court to grant reservation in postgraduate medical and dental admissions. Nataraj informed the court that on July 27, 2020, the Madras high court directed the formation of a high-level committee to implement reservations for other backward classes (OBC) in state-surrendered seats under all-India quota for PG-NEET 2021 and MDS-NEET 2021. In October last year, the Supreme Court confirmed it could be done year. Pursuant to this, the government filed an application in the top court seeking clarification on implementing the reservations this year. Not happy with the explanation, the bench remarked, “The government is just dilly-dallying over this issue. This judgment was in October 2020 and we are now in July 2021. This is a red herring that you are postulating before us. If you wanted to seek clarification, you had to do it immediately. You have to hold counselling immediately.” Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing the petitioners, told the court that counselling can be held virtually and does not require physical presence of candidates. The petition by the nine MDS aspirants drafted by advocate Tanvi Dubey said that nearly 30,000 BDS doctors took the MDS-NEET examination for admission to 6,500 MDS seats. They even filed repeated pleas under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to know the reason for delay but got no clear response from either the Centre or the Medical Counselling Committee under the Directorate General of Health Services. Having wasted six months of their career, the petitioners were left with no option but to move the top court. Once results are declared, counselling for MDS admissions begin by March every year, the petition stated. One of the RTI replies received from the government prior to filing of the petition stated that a “proposal for conducting separate counselling for the allotment of MDS seats is under consideration with the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and after consultation with the Dental Council of India, the final outcome shall be available on the official website of Medical Counselling Committee.” On July 2, the top court issued a notice to the Medical Counselling Committee, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Dental Council of India and National Board of Examinations seeking a response to the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/provide-pg-dental-counselling-schedule-within-a-week-sc-to-govt-101626090887339.html
12-07-2021||India||Lightning strikes in north India: All you need to know about phenomenon||More than 60 people have been killed due to lightning strikes in three states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh in the last 24 hours. Condoling the loss of lives, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an ex-gratia of ₹2 lakh for family members of the deceased and ₹50,000 for those injured. Compensation has also been announced by the respective state governments.What is lightning?National Geographic describes lightning as an “electrical discharge caused by imbalances between storm clouds and the ground.” This “imbalance” is created between storm clouds and objects on the ground; the lower reaches of the storm clouds are “negatively” charged while objects on the ground are “positively” charged. This imbalance leads to the passage of current between the two opposite charges, which is called lightning.Why is lightning strike dangerous?The same National Geographic report states that around 2000 people lose their lives due to the phenomenon every year. Death due to a lightning strike takes place when the lowest lightning bolt comes within 150 feet (46 metres) of a positively charged object on the ground. This contact leads to a surge of positive electricity, called a “streamer,” which can impact a building, a tree, and even a person.Those who survive lightning strikes might suffer from various lasting symptoms. These include memory loss, weakness, dizziness, numbness etc. These can also cause cardiac arrest and severe burns.Dos and don’ts during a lightning strikeThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has listed various dos and don’ts to be followed during a lightning strike. Here are some basic dos and don’ts to be followed:(1.) If the weather forecast is for thunderstorms, postpone or delay your activity(2.) Go inside a safe shelter when you hear thunder. Safe shelters include concrete homes, concrete buildings, or hard top vehicles with their windows rolled up.(3.) Follow the 30/30 “Lightning Safety Rule.” This rule states that one should rush indoors if after seeing lightning, they cannot count to 30 before hearing thunder. Additionally, it states that one should listen to a flash of thunder, and go outdoors if no other flash is heard for 30 minutes.(4.) Avoid elevated areas like hills, cliffs, mountain ridges and peaks. One should also immediately get out of and away from a water body.(5.) Do not lie flat on the ground, instead get into a position of “lightning crotch.” In this position, one should squat, wrap their arms around legs, keep feet together, head lowered, ears covered and eyes closed.(6.) If the hair on the back of one’s neck stands up, this could be an indication that a lightning strike is “imminent.” Keep away from lines and objects that conduct electricity, and immediately unplug all electrical appliances.(7.) Taking shelter under trees is strictly prohibited as these are conductors of electricity. If trapped in a group, avoid standing close to each other to reduce the number of injuries.(8.) Continue listening to local radio and television stations for updated information or instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lightning-strikes-in-north-india-all-you-need-to-know-about-phenomenon-101626089538009.html

I look forward to collaborate with Laxmi Narayan Tripathi in providing equal opportunities to the transgender community in India,” tweeted Poonawala, the chief of the company which manufactures Oxford-AstraZeneca developed vaccine Covishield.I have always believed that healthcare and dignity should be fundamental human rights. I look forward to collaborate with @ImLaxmiNarayan in providing equal opportunities to the transgender community in India. pic.twitter.com/spxi1XCZ78Till June, only 11.45% of the transgender population was partially vaccinated with one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Their population as per the last Census is estimated to be around 490,000, however, the community estimates the figure to be around 1.8 million. The measly vaccination numbers, say experts, are due to a combination of factors like digital divide, vaccine hesitancy, and a general distrust in the public healthcare system.Thane Municipal Corporation had organised a vaccination drive for transgenders on June 19. Vaccination was opened for individuals in the age group of 30-44 but with prior online appointment even though no identity cards were needed.Aqsa Shaikh, India’s first transgender nodal officer of a Covid-19 vaccination centre at the Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, told Hindustan Times that her community is deserving of the same rights as others.Many cities are launching drives to vaccinate members of the transgender community but the concerted effort by the states seems to be lacking so far. The community has also been financially impacted by the second wave of coronavirus.Amrita Sarkar of the India HIV/AIDS Alliance in Delhi told Hindustan Times that transgenders are in dire need of vaccination because they have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS-related infections which leads to a compromised immunity and renders them more susceptible to coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adar-poonawalla-joins-laxmi-narayan-tripathi-to-provide-equal-healthcare-rights-to-trans-community-101626089131058.html

The leaders decided to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government on issues related to unemployment, price rise and law and order.The meeting involved leaders from the party's advisory council and the working group on strategy and planning for the state. Congress' Uttar Pradesh unit chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, senior party leaders Salman Khurshid, Rajiv Shukla, Pramod Tiwari and Rashid Alvi, among others, participated in the virtual meeting.Priyanka Gandhi reportedly said at the meeting that the people are troubled by soaring inflation and “sky high” prices of petrol, diesel, mustard oil, fruits and vegetables. She also raised the issue of violence during the panchayat elections while alleging that BJP workers indulged in stone-pelting and firing.The assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh are slated to be held in 2021 where the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government looks to secure a second consecutive term in office.

12-07-2021||India||Facebook did not violate rights: Bombay HC rejects right-wing org’s claim||The Bombay high court in Goa on Monday rejected a plea by Hindu extremist group Sanatan Sanstha to have its pages, which were taken down by social media company Facebook, restored. The Sanatan Sanstha claimed in its appeal before the high court that Facebook’s action was high handed, arbitrary and violated their constitutional rights. It also said that Facebook blocking its pages amounted to usurpation of powers that are only vested with the state.The high court, however, rejected the claims and said that blocking or unblocking of pages hosted on Facebook, would at the most be a contractual dispute. “The dispute regarding blocking or unblocking of the petitioner’s (Sanatan Sanstha’s) Facebook pages, appears to be governed by the contractual relationship between the petitioner and respondents (Facebook) and normally purely contractual disputes between private parties cannot be adjudicated in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,” the high court bench comprising justices MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar, said. Also Read | Acted against 133 posts and 18,000 profiles: TwitterThe Sanstha had told the court that it used these pages to spread the essence of their spirituality and allied matters, and Facebook’s action disabled it from communicating or propagating [its] philosophy and disabling its followers from accessing information that it posted on such pages.Facebook told the Sanstha that as per the terms of service they have the right to permanently disable access to any account that breaches its community standards. This, the Sanstha alleged, was being violative of their fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution.In response, advocate for Facebook Darius Khambata told the court that the petition was not maintainable because Facebook Inc and Facebook Online Services India are “neither a ‘State’ under article 12 of the constitution nor are they discharging any public functions.”“The issue of blocking the Facebook pages, is a matter governed by contract and the petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is not maintainable to address a dispute over a contractual relationship between two private parties,” he said. “The petitioner has no right to seek hosting or transmission of its information or its philosophical views on the platform provided by Facebook. Such a right is neither granted by Section 79 of the Information Technology Act (protection granted to intermediaries) nor for that matter, any other provision of the Information Technology Act,” Khambata said. “All these matters are in the realm of contract and if at all the petitioner has any grievance, they will have to seek redressal before any appropriate forum which is empowered to adjudicate disputes between the two private parties,” he added. The high court said that there was neither any assertion that Facebook answered the definition of ‘State’ under Article 12 of the Constitution nor were there any serious to establish that these respondents indeed answer the definition of ‘State’ under Article 12 of the Constitution, or otherwise, discharge some public functions. “Based on the sketchy and unclear pleadings in this matter, however, there is no case made out for grant of any declaratory relief in this petition. Even, otherwise, Adv (Shirish) Punalekar (advocate for Sanatan Sanstha) was unable to point out any provision under the Information Technology Act, based on which the petitioner could insist on maintaining a Facebook page on the platform provided… without agreeing to be bound by the contractual terms that may have been proposed,” the high court said. “If there is some breach of contractual relationship involved in the blocking of the Facebook page then, it is for [them] to take appropriate steps before the appropriate forum to secure redress. But, a Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India may not be an appropriate remedy for this purpose,” the bench said. The controversial organisation Sanatan Sanstha, that is headquartered in Goa and has a significant presence in Maharashtra, is on the radar of investigating authorities in the murders of rationalists Govind Pansare, Narendra Dabholkar and MM Kalburgi as well as in the murder of Gauri Lankesh. Operatives of the Sanstha were also accused of attempting to plant a bomb at a crowded religious place in Margao in 2008 which exploded prematurely killing two persons who were ferrying it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-did-not-violate-rights-bombay-hc-rejects-right-wing-org-s-claim-101626086321135.html
12-07-2021||India||Assam CM tables cow protection legislation in assembly||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tabled a legislation to protect cattle in the state on the first day of the budget session of the assembly that started on Monday. Termed the Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021, the legislation aims to ban interstate transport of cows through Assam in order to control their smuggling to neighbouring Bangladesh. The Bill seeks to stop the transport of cattle from any place within Assam to places outside the state “where slaughter of cattle is not regulated by law”. The transport of cattle from places outside Assam to any place within the state will also be banned by the legislation. Further, movement of cattle from one place within the state to another located in Assam will also be restricted. “The competent authority may issue permit for transport of cattle for bona fide agricultural or animal husbandry purposes as prescribed in the rules framed under the Act,” states the Bill. Also Read | Assam’s cow protection law move raises concerns in MeghalayaThe cattle, permitted to be transported for agricultural and animal husbandry purposes, will have to be transported by following rules laid down by the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Bill has certain exemptions on transportation of cattle. No permission would be required to carry cattle to grazing field or for agricultural or animal husbandry purposes within a district. “No permission shall be required for transportation of cattle to and from registered animal market for the purpose of sale and purchase of such cattle within the district,” the proposed Bill states. Assam is the main gateway to the northeast region and apart from cattle all other goods coming from other parts of the country enter through the state. The cow protection Bill is likely to affect supply in several Christian-majority states in the region where beef is consumed. While Nagaland and Mizoram have not reacted yet to Assam’s legislation, Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma said last week that it will take up the issue with Centre is the new law affects supply of beef to the state. The Bill also seeks to regulate the sale of beef in Assam by restricting it to certain places. Once enacted, beef would be allowed to be sold only in places permitted by the new legislation. Beef won’t be allowed to be sold in areas which have a predominant population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and other non-beef-eating communities or within a radius of 5km of any temple, ‘satra’ (Vaishnavite monastery) “or other religious institutions belonging to Hindu religion or any other institution or area as may be prescribed by the competent authority”. Violations of the provisions of the Bill could lead to imprisonment for three to eight years and fine between ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh. Consumption of beef is not illegal in Assam and the Assam Cattle Preservation Act, 1950 allows slaughter of cattle above 14 years of age with proper approval by local veterinary officers. Once enacted, Assam would join other BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which have similar legislation to protect cows. Reacting to the legislation, opposition parties in the state and minority organisations said that the Bill could led to communal tensions and also affect the livelihood of many involved in the cattle trade business legally. “The Bill is aimed at targeting a particular community. Why don’t states like Goa, Meghalaya and Nagaland where BJP is part of the government bring in such legislation? The Assam government wants to polarise people through this Bill. We will oppose it and bring in amendment resolutions,” said Md Aminul Islam, an All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA. “We have asked our legal department to see whether the Bill hurts the fundamental rights of a certain community. Interpretation of such legislation is a contentious issue and could lead to attacks on communities that consume beef. We will seek adequate and appropriate amendments in the proposed Bill,” said Congress Legislative Party leader Debabrata Saikia. The All Assam Minority Students’ Union (AAMSU) said that clauses such as ban on the sale of beef within 5km radius of temples seem illogical and were included with the intent to target Muslims. “If such a ban is imposed for beef, some could suggest similar restrictions on the sale of pork near mosques. This sort of things could lead to tension among communities. The government shouldn’t interfere with food habits of people. The ban on transportation would affect the lives of many and would also affect government revenue collection from the sale of cattle,” said AAMSU adviser Ainuddin Ahmed. The session, which is the second one for the new BJP-led coalition, will witness a woman finance minister present the state’s annual budget for the first time in Assam’s history. Finance minister Ajanta Neog will present the budget on July 16.

State health minister Ma Subramanian, on Sunday, said that fumigation measures were intensified to prevent the spread of Zika and dengue in the state.Also read | As Zika virus spreads in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka step up vigilMeanwhile, three more people tested positive for the Zika virus in Kerala on Sunday, taking the overall cases to 18 so far, news agency PTI reported.

12-07-2021||India||Mehbooba Mufti says only motive behind Article 370 move seems to loot J&K||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti hit out at the Central government on Monday over the economy of the Union territory and the recent dismissal of government employees.She said abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution that granted special status to the erstwhile state seemed to have been carried out to rob Jammu & Kashmir of its resources. “It seems the only motive behind the abrogation was to loot J&K. People from outside are being given top positions at Chenab Valley Power Projects. Our water and electricity are going outside. Our transporters are in trouble. They have to pay toll taxes and more,” the PDP chief, who is on a tour of the region, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI."There is no benefit for the people, including those belonging to Jammu division. People are suffering since the scrapping of Article 370. Many new orders are coming up everyday, including the recent one on ending the 'darbar' move. Our identity is at stake," she said, adding the attempts are being made to turn Jammu to a hub of liquor mafias. Speaking further on the Darbar move, she said this was not related to business, but only provided an opportunity to the people of Jammu and Kashmir divisions to interact and have cultural ties. Its scrapping was disappointing. Mufti said articles 370, 35 (A) of the Constitution and other domicile laws were not granted by any foreign country, but introduced by the then ruler Hari Singh. “Even before the nation gave us these, the Maharaja had brought it to protect the identity of people of J&K. When people decided to be a part of India, he said that we have these laws that have to be upheld,” Mufti said. The two articles were scrapped by the Narendra Modi-led government in August 2019 and the state was bifurcated into two Union territories.Mufti said she would not take part in the electoral process until all decisions of August 5,2019, are not revised. "It is an emotional issue for me," she said. Regarding the delimitation process, she asked why was there such a hurry to carry out the exercise. "There is something suspicious in this process," she said.The former chief minister said there is no policy to restore the UT’s economy. “There is unemployment and inflation are rising. There is no future for educated youth here. Earlier, they used to say that Jammu & Kashmir is backward, but we were ahead on several indices. But if their onslaught over economy continues, our situation will become worse than Gujarat as far as poverty is concerned,” Mufti said.She said the BJP government at the Centre has no policy for even the Kashmiri Pandits. "They are part and parcel of Kashmir and must be rehabilitated in the valley, there looks like there is no policy for them either."When asked about her comments on the sacking of 11 government employees, including two sons of Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin, she said she did support anybody but children cannot be held responsible for their father’s deeds. Mehbooba said on Sunday the dismissals done on flimsy grounds was criminal and the Centre was continued “disempowering” the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the “garb of pseudo nationalism by trampling” the Constitution.“I'm not supporting anyone. You cannot hold a child responsible for actions of his father unless and until you have proof. These are not 11 people. They have sacked about 20-25 people this year,” Mufti said.“I have said this again and again. You can capture a man but not an idea. You have to address the idea, as Vajpayee ji did. Witch-hunting, criminalisation of dissent is taking our nation back,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-says-only-motive-behind-article-370-move-seems-to-loot-jk-101626084334587.html

He said this while taking stock of preparations for the upcoming session.The timings of the session will be from 11 am to 6 pm for both the Houses, he added.With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, the session will be held in both the Houses pf Parliament with all necessary protocols and arrangements are being made to accommodate members of Parliament (MPs) on a social distancing basis.Birla said all members and media will be allowed in accordance with Covid-19 rules. "RTPCR test is not mandatory. We will request those who have not undergone vaccination to undergo test," the speaker said.Earlier, it was reported that the MPs would be able to attend the session without going through an RT-PCR Covid-19 test if they have received even one dose of the vaccine against the virus.However, those without having received a jab would be made to undergo the compulsory test at a gap not exceeding every two weeks and this would have to be followed not only by MPs, but anybody entering the Parliament premises.So far, 444 members of the Lok Sabha and 218 members of the Rajya Sabha have reportedly been vaccinated against Covid-19. Some MPs have not been able to take their second jab yet as they were affected by Covid-19, a top functionary told HT. “Another 30 MPs have not sent us any communication. We are trying to contact them to know their vaccination status.”Parliament sessions have been affected ever since the pandemic hit the country last year forcing early closure of last year’s budget and monsoon sessions and this year’s budget session. The 2020 winter session was skipped completely due to the public health crisis.

Chawla, through her lawyer, wants the court to "reject" the petition instead of "dismissing" it.Justice Sanjeev Narula recused from hearing the actor's plea and directed that it be listed before another bench on July 29.Last week, Justice J R Midha had directed that the application be placed before Justice Narula after the deposit of previously imposed fine of ₹20 lakh.Chawla's lawyer argued that the plaint, which “never went up to the level of suit”, could only be rejected or returned in terms of the Civil Procedure Code, and not dismissed.The actor moved the high court in May seeking to challenge the setting up of 5G network in the country, expressing concerns over its impact on animals and children. Chawla claimed in her petition that once 5G is implemented, no one will be able to avoid exposure.The high court dismissed the petition on June 4 and slapped a fine of ₹20 lakh on the actor, saying the plea was "only for publicity".After the petition was dismissed, Chawla posted a video on her Twitter account in which the actor said she is not against the 5G technology and only wanted the government's certificate that it is safe."In the hullabaloo of the past few days, I could not hear myself and the main message got lost," she said in the video.The Cellular Operators' Association of India also said that 5G in India is safe, claiming that the radiation permitted in the country is one-tenth of what is globally accepted.The country's leading telecom operators are holding trials before commercially launching the 5G services in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hearing-on-juhi-chawla-s-plea-on-5g-deferred-by-delhi-hc-judge-recuses-101626076939108.html
12-07-2021||India||Assuring to note Twitter’s steps to comply with new rules: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Former Union minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday lauded his successor Ashwini Vaishnaw for asserting the need to comply with the social media and intermediary guidelines, while also highlighting that Twitter was taking steps to follow the rules. “Greetings to the new IT Minister @AshwiniVaishnaw for firmly reiterating that the new IT Rules are designed to empower the safety & security of users against misuse and redress their grievances,” Prasad wrote on Twitter. He added that it was “assuring to note that Twitter too has taken some steps to comply with the new Rules”. The former Union minister had been locked in an escalating battle with the social media company over compliance with the new guidelines, even going so far as to say that Twitter was not entitled to protection under the IT Act’s safe harbour clause. Vaishnaw, the new minister for electronics and information technology, held a review meeting on Saturday to discuss the controversial social media and intermediary guidelines, and was updated on the status of compliance, Hindustan Times reported on Monday. Also Read | Acted against 133 posts and 18,000 profiles: Twitter“Reviewed the implementation and compliance of Information Technology Rules, 2021 along with my colleague Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar Ji. These guidelines are empowering and protecting users and will ensure a safer and responsible social media ecosystem in India,” Vaishnaw posted on Koo, the domestic alternative to Twitter, on Sunday. Barely hours after he took charge on Thursday, Vaishnaw said that the law of the land is supreme, and Twitter will have to fall in line with the new social media and intermediary guidelines. A ministry official said the Vaishnaw was apprised on the status of compliance of each social media firm, as significant social media intermediaries, which have five million users or above, having to appoint a grievance redressal officer, a nodal contact person and a compliance officer. The official, however, declined to comment on the status of Twitter’s compliance with the new guidelines. “The issue of Twitter was discussed, as was every other social media firm,” the official said. The microblogging platform, which has been at odds with the Central government, over compliance with the new rules that came into complete effect on May 25 on Sunday, posted the details of its grievance redressal officer on its website. It appointed Vinay Prakash as its resident grievance officer. Twitter’s interim resident grievance officer Dharmendra Chatur stepped down from the post last month, barely four weeks after his appointment. To be sure, the ministry said that Chatur’s appointment was not in keeping with the new guidelines as the lawyer was not an employee of the company. The company informed the Delhi high court that it had made new interim appointments and sought eight weeks to make permanent ones. It also published its first grievance redressal report saying that it actioned 133 posts for reasons ranging from harassment to privacy infringement and suspended over 18,000 accounts for “child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity”. Twitter fell foul of the government after it refused to take down posts that carried a controversial hashtag regarding the Prime Minister earlier this year. The government sent Twitter two non-compliance notices, threatening penal action if it failed to block the accounts. The company, in turn, raised concerns regarding the new rules and the safety of its employees. This prompted a strong response from the government, which warned the firm against attempting to dictate terms. Twitter reduced to cede space on the implementation of its policies, as it said it was defending free speech and marked posts by prominent BJP politicians Sambit Patra and Vinay Saharasrabuddhe as manipulated media. It also locked out the Union minister over an alleged incident of copyright infringement, in keeping with US law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assuring-to-note-twitter-s-steps-to-comply-with-new-rules-ravi-shankar-prasad-101626076300300.html

He said members of the outfit would continue to serve the public as part of Rajinikanth Fan Club Association."I have decided to dissolve Rajini Makkal Mandram. Its office-bearers would continue to be part of the Rajinikanth Fan Club Association that will involve itself in public service," he said.About an hour ag, he had said he would speak to office-bearers of Mandram to take a call on whether he would enter politics, about six months after he walked away from the scene following a period of sickness. He said 'questions' about his entering politics, a topic of debate for over two decades in Tamil Nadu, lingered among the Mandram functionaries on the forum's future.RMM was previously considered a launch vehicle for the actor's political entry. However, last December the actor said he would not join politics and had cited factors like his health condition, him undergoing kidney transplant in 2016.The south superstart, who returned from America days ago after a health check-up, earlier said, "Should the Makkal Mandram be continued and if so, what will be its functions and these are questions among the functionaries and fans.On 3 December, 2020, the actor had said that he would launch his party in January 2021 ahead of the Assembly elections.

However, police allowed entry to only those with negative RT-PCR test reports and proof of confirmed accommodation.Uttarakhand has been witnessing a massive influx of tourists from across northern India after the state government eased the movement within the state with an aim to revive the tourism industry.Such instances of overcrowding have led to fears that the upcoming third of the pandemic in the country might be more severe than earlier imagined.Moreover, many tourists were seen thronging the already crowded town without wearing masks and adhering to the physical distancing norms necessitated to reduce the spread of coronavirus.Visuals shared by news agency ANI on its Twitter handle showed a large number of people gathering at a congested marketplace in Nainital.#WATCH | Uttarakhand's Nainital witnessed a massive footfall of tourists as #COVID19 restrictions ease pic.twitter.com/zZ7UyyOVXrThe district magistrate of Nainital Dhiraj Singh Garbyal last week announced fresh norms for tourists, in which anyone coming to Nainital will have to register on the Smart City portal and carry a negative report of RT-PCR test conducted not less than 72 hours before their arrival.There is also a ban on the entry of two-wheelers to Nainital during weekends to reduce traffic congestion and restrict the number of travelers to the lake city.Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had also ordered a capping of 50% occupancy at hotels in popular tourist destinations like Nainital, Dehradun and Mussoorie, after visuals of unruly travelers taking bath at Kempty Falls with zero regard for Covid-19 induced safety norms went viral on social media.The move came close on the heels of the Centre voicing concerns over overcrowding at tourist destinations across India. Visuals of overcrowded streets emerged on social media from Manali which showed people defying physical distancing norms. The Union health ministry then issued a warning against what it called ‘revenge travel’ and crowding of these tourist spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nainital-draws-crowd-of-tourists-amid-restrictions-covid-19-third-wave-101626070278435.html

The party that has been trying to spread its base across the country had bagged 6.27 per cent votes. It was also said to have harmed the Congress that had won the highest number of seats but failed to come to power after the late Manohar Parrikar managed to stitch ties with smaller parties and became the chief minister. However, the present Pramod Sawant-led BJP government in the state has been facing a lot of flak over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, especially during the second wave.As part of AAP’s renewed bid to create a national presence, beyond Delhi and Punjab, Kejriwal and his team has been on a campaign spree in poll-bound states over the past few months. On Sunday, the Delhi CM promised free electricity to people of Uttarakhand if voted to power in the next assembly election to be held in 2022.Last month, he visited Gujarat and declared that AAP would contest in all 182 Assembly seats in the state in the election to be held next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/see-you-in-goa-kejriwal-promises-change-honest-politics-as-election-nears-101626070322422.html

It had presented interim results from Phase-III clinical trials in over 28,000 volunteers. The study is said to have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the interim data.The data has shown that ZyCoV-D is safe for children in the age group of 12 to 18 years, said the company, which is planning to manufacture 100-120 million doses of the vaccine annually.The study was carried out "during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 (in India), reaffirming the vaccine's efficacy against the new mutant strains especially the Delta variant," Zydus said in a statement.The second indigenous jab after Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, ZyCoV-D is a three-dose vaccine. According to Zydus Cadila, the three doses of ZyCoV-D are to be administered on day 0, day 28, and day 56. The company is also said to be working on a two-dose vaccine.The DCGI had granted Cadila Healthcare Limited permission to conduct human trials for ZyCoV-D back in July last year, when the company had said its vaccine will hit the markets by June 2021.Once Zydus receives approval, ZyCoV-D would become the fifth anti-Covid vaccine authorised for use in India, after AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India's Covishield, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Sputnik V that is being developed by Russia's Gamaleya Institute and Moderna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-s-3-dose-covid-19-vaccine-for-kids-may-take-more-time-for-approval-101626066116177.html

12-07-2021||India||Diesel drops for the first time in 3 months, petrol costlier by 28 paise||State-run oil retailers slashed diesel price by 16 paise per litre on Monday, the first auto fuel rate reduction since April 15 even as petrol became costlier by 28 paise, the 39th hike since May 4, a day after the results of five assembly polls were declared.The first diesel price reduction in about three months came after international benchmark Brent crude fell by $1.61 a barrel or 2.06% at the Friday close, compared to its peak of $77.16 last Monday. Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with their respective international benchmarks of previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates. International oil markets do not operate on weekends.According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, companies have already recovered their past revenue losses on diesel like the one they suffered for 66 days from February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union Territory.The revenue losses on petrol waere higher compared to diesel, hence its saw a higher price surge in the last 70 days, they said requesting anonymity. So far, petrol prices have jumped by ₹10.79 a litre in 70 days, while diesel prices have jumped by ₹8.99 after factoring in first rate cut by 16 paise on the fuel.Also Read | Indians offload gold heirlooms as coronavirus deepens financial painPetrol is now priced at ₹101.19 per litre and diesel at 89.72 a litre in New Delhi. While fuel rates of state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies. Petrol prices have already crossed ₹100 per litre in five metros – Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.The cost of one litre of petrol in Mumbai is now ₹107.20 a litre and diesel, ₹97.29. The highest fuel rates have been recorded in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar where pumps are selling petrol at ₹112.53 per litre and diesel at ₹102.98 a litre.Surging international oil rates and exorbitant domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps.International oil prices showed extreme volatility last week. While an inconclusive meeting of producers’ cartel -- the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) – over restraining output last Monday pulled down crude prices initially; falling US inventories and indications of strong demand from China and India saw prices rising again in the last two days of last week.Benchmark Brent that surged $77 16 a barrel on the first day of the previous week, its highest since October 2018, fell over 4.8% in the next two sessions. It, however, gained 0.94% or 69 cents on Thursday and rallied 1.93% further on last Friday to close the week at $75.55 per barrel, still lower than the week’s high on Monday, July 5.More downward price revision of auto fuels are expected if international oil prices soften further, executives mentioned above said. Brent that opened about 0.3% high at $75.79 a barrel on Monday, fell 0.2% to $75.4 during the early trade.The diesel price reduction came at a time when India’s fuel demand show rapid recovery after the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic that hit the country in April and May months. Petroleum consumption in June recovered at 16.33 million tonnes, about 1.5% year-on-year growth and over 8% jump compared to the previous month. Demand of petroleum products had plunged a nine-month low in May 2021 at 15.11 million tonnes due to the lockdown in various places to contain the second wave.While international oil prices impact pump rates of auto fuels because India imports more than 80% crude it processes, exorbitant taxes are the other reason for high rates of petrol and diesel.In Delhi, central levies account for 33.29% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.07%, according to an official data of July 1. On diesel, central taxes are over 35.66% while state taxes are about 14.62%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic.The unrelenting upward movement of fuel rates since May 4 already saw petrol crossing ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in states and UTs of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Laddakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Nagaland.Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram, Mohali, Darjeeling, Dantewada and Kohima.The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— controls almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diesel-drops-16-paise-litre-for-the-first-time-in-3-months-petrol-costlier-by-28-paise-101626065560056.html

As many as 724 fatalities were reported in the last 24 hours, the bulletin showed, adding that 39,649 people recovered from the infection.After Monday’s numbers, the death toll and total recoveries in India due to Covid-19 now stands at 408,764 and 30,014,713, respectively. The active cases have also came down to 450,899, and account for 1.47 per cent of the overall caseload.The situation is an improvement from Sunday's tally when 41,506 cases and 895 fatalities were reported. The total recoveries too have gone down 1,877 in comparison to yesterday's data.Over the last few days, travellers were seen thronging the popular hill states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, with most of them flouting Covid-19 norms such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance. This comes at a time when the fear of a third wave of Covid-19 looms. The health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have already cautioned the tourists about revenge travel, with ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava terming the tourists’ rush as “frightening”.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla also chaired a meeting on Saturday that saw the attendance of Niti Aayog member VK Paul, police chiefs, chief secretaries, and principal secretaries of eight states as well. After the meeting, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) in a statement said that while the decline of the Covid-19 second wave is at “variable stages” in different states and Union territories (UTs), the case positivity rate in certain districts of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand is “over 10 per cent, which is a cause for concern”.According to the statement, states and UTs were also asked to follow the “five-fold strategy of Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate” along with Covid-19-appropriate behaviour.Meanwhile, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jairam Thakur recently appealed to the tourists coming to the state to follow Covid-19 rules. “We are concerned about the number of tourists coming to the state,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.His remarks came after visuals of travellers roaming around Manali, without wearing masks and maintaining social distance, surfaced on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-caseload-dips-to-37-154-724-deaths-reported-story-101626062867671.html
12-07-2021||India||The life and death of Father Stan Swamy||On July 5, at around 2.30pm, a two-judge bench of the Bombay High Court (HC) took up the matter of Father Stanislaus Lourduswamy’s bail application when senior advocate Mihir Desai interrupted them. Father Stan Swamy, as the Jesuit priest was popularly referred to, was the country’s oldest prisoner charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, (UAPA) for his role in what the National Investigative Agency (NIA) contends was an alleged Maoist conspiracy that led to caste clashes near the Bhima Koregaon village four years ago. Swamy’s health had worsened considerably since he was held in judicial custody in Taloja jail since last October. His lawyers had repeatedly moved court for bail which the state opposed and the special NIA court refused. On May 28, aided by a HC order, he was finally admitted to a charitable hospital in Bandra. “It is with a heavy heart that I have to inform you that Father Stan Swamy has passed away,” said Dr Ian D’Souza, the medical director of Holy Family Hospital in Mumbai where the priest was being treated, after Desai spoke. D’Souza informed the bench that the cleric had suffered a cardiac arrest in the wee hours of July 3 and was on ventilator since then; an hour earlier, he was pronounced dead, the doctor said. “We are shocked,” the bench observed. “With all humility, we are sorry to know that he has passed away.” “I only have two things to say. We have no grievance against Holy Family Hospital nor against the court. The high court bench ensured that the best medical care is given to him. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about the NIA and jail authorities,” Desai said and requested the court to not dismiss the priest’s bail application. Also Read | Shiv Sena asks Centre if Father Stan Swamy was capable of overthrowing state“Our main grievances are against the NIA and jail authorities for not being sensitive towards the condition of Father Stan Swamy though he was an elderly man having medical problems. (The 84-year-old suffered from Parkinson’s Disease, a progressive nervous condition; he had also contracted Covid during his stay in the jail.) We hope to make suggestions to the HC to bring about changes in the Prison Manual while dealing with such inmates,” Desai later said. “Father Stan Swamy was a human rights activist and his concerns about the conditions in the jail were not only for himself but for other prisoners as well. Though he was not keeping well, his efforts were to highlight the apathy of the jail authorities so that the medical facilities in the jail were improved,” said Father Frazer Mascarenhes, a friend of Swamy who was permitted to meet him during his stay at hospital. Swamy would have approved of Desai’s request. He had spent much of the past decade fighting for the rights of under-trial prisoners from the adivasi and indigenous communities in Jharkhand. As a prisoner in the last two years of his own life, he wrote movingly in personal correspondence, of the prisoners in the crowded jail who helped him walk, wash and eat as these functions became increasingly impossible for him to perform. Becoming Father Stan Born on April 26, 1937 to Lourdusamy and Kiteriyammal in Tamil Nadu’s Tiruchirappalli, Swamy had five siblings. He lost his father at a very young age; so it was his older brother TPL Irudayaswamy who took up farming to raise his brothers and sisters.“Swamy was self-reliant and reserved since he was a child,” recalled Irudayaswamy. “He spoke very little. He was devoted to the church and his studies. Later, he was completely devoted to the struggles of the Adivasis. He felt so much pain for them and he used to tell me so many stories whenever he came home.” The house where Swamy grew up was built in 1890; it is where 89-year-old Irudayaswamy still lives with his wife, children and grandchildren. Swamy’s 26-year-old grandnephew Benito Prabhu, now based in Chennai, was the last family member to have met him in February. “He was fearless,” said Prabhu. “He said as long as he is alive he will continue to fight.” Swamy, who attended St Joseph’s school in Trichy, was exposed to the work of Jesuit priests at an early age. Inspired by them, he undertook religious studies in 1957. In 1965, he spent his regency — when trainee Jesuits spend two years taking up works of the order — at St Xavier’s High School Lupungutu, Chaibasa in west Singhbhum. According to an article by his associates, Tony PM and Peter Martin on the news site, scroll.in, it was this experience that left a lasting impression on Swamy. Also Read | For undertrials in India, the fight for liberty“He used to go to the weekly bazaar in Chaibasa on Tuesday (the Mangal-haat) with his students and saw for himself how the outsider merchants and their agents cheated the adivasis. ‘I felt pain but could not do anything about it,’ he said. On holidays, he visited his boys and their families in their villages. It gave him a sense of their culture. The values they held deeply impressed him,” they wrote in the October 2020 piece. Two years later, Swamy went to Philippines to study theology, where he also acquired a post-graduate degree in sociology. On his return in 1971, he was given the responsibility of the Catholic Relief Services charity in the Jesuit Jamshedpur Province. During the same period, he attended a three-month course on community development at the Indian Social Institute (ISI), Bangalore (now Bengaluru). He later went on to work at the ISI for 15 years, from 1975 to 1990, along with educationists such as Duarte Baretto, and trained the young people from marginalised communities. The institute’s three-month course on community organisation and social analysis became very popular and had attendees from across the subcontinent. Baretto died in April at his Bengaluru home. In a blog post dedicated to him, labour activist John Edoor wrote that the team at institute in the 1970s “was instrumental in challenging the belief systems and thought processes of an array of young people and guided them to ideas of liberation theology and Marxian tools of analysis to study and intervene in social, political and economic systems and processes. Many of them took leadership positions in Dalit, adivasi, fishing community, agrarian and labour movements and entities all over the country.” People’s rights crusader The timing of Swamy and Baretto’s work was crucial, for the decades leading up to liberalisation of the economy witnessed immense social upheavals: the Naxalbari movement from the late 1960s onwards, the Emergency years of 1975-77, and the JP Narayan movement, each of which galvanised the young in different ways. “When he was in Bangalore, at that time, his interest was to promote opportunities for children from the poorer sections to get an education. I remember his criticism of Jesuit schools itself, pointing out that much of their admission was for the elite (sections of society). He did research to demonstrate that the more deserving students are not getting an opportunity to get into Jesuit educational institutions,” Professor Babu Mathew of the National Law School, said. Also Read | From Bhima Koregaon to the death of Stan Swamy, a timeline of key eventsIn 1991, Swamy returned to Jharkhand and set up base in Chaibasa. He became involved in the Jharkhandi Organisation for Human Rights (JOHAR), which took up matters pertaining to displacement of adivasi communities on account of development projects. By the end of the century, he moved to Ranchi and with the help of the Jesuit society and intellectuals and activists such as Ramdayal Munda and Xavier Dias, he set up Bagaicha, a research institute, in 2006. The idea, Swamy said during an interview, was to “focus on these two issues, land alienation and displacement caused by developmental projects like mining, dams and creation of townships without the consent of the people… and it was often such people who were at the receiving end. It became our task to … work with (young people of the Dalit and adivasi communities) and help them to understand scientifically the issues they are facing. And if this is the issue, what will be the nature of the people’s movements and people’s organisations, and what could be the strategies that need to be worked out.” Part of the work Swamy undertook was also advocacy of the legal rights of adivasi and Dalit communities granted by laws like PESA (1996), which ensured self governance through gram sabhas for people living in Scheduled Areas; the Forest Rights Act (2006), which recognised the rights of forest-dwelling communities to forest resources; and the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, which guaranteed the rights to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition, and the need for the assent of gram sabhas. “It was also in 2014-15 when a lot of young people were simply being picked up and put in jail — anyone who resisted unjust displacement, was thrown into jail,” Swamy said, in the same interview which is available for public viewing on YouTube. “It was happening in all the tribal-dominated states, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and the western part of Bengal. In 2017, I gave a call to whoever I knew, social activists, human rights organisations, civic organisations and said, come, let us sit together and see what we can do. We cannot be bystanders to this.” Also Read | Philosophy is a non-negligible part of being a human being: Amartya SenThe result was a group that called itself the Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee, which brought together several lawyers in these states. Swamy filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Jharkhand HC, seeking information on under-trial prisoners across these various states, most of who belonged to adivasi communities. Swamy’s work with imprisoned adivasi youth, in fact, was already well-known. In 2015, a study carried out by Bagaicha researchers across 18 districts in Jharkhand found that of 102 under-trial prisoners accused of being Maoists and out on bail, only two actually had any affiliation to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist); the rest were youth who had resisted displacement through legal, non-violent means. “Fieldwork for this study was undertaken from early March to the end of June 2015 by paying personal visits to families and villages of arrested persons presently out on bail and those incarcerated for long. These persons have been alleged as Naxalites and foisted cases mostly under section 17 of the Criminal Law and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 2004,” its introduction read. “This study discloses several undisclosed, striking realities about alleged ‘Naxalite’ under-trials in Jharkhand. Disproportionately large numbers of adivasis, Dalit and other backward castes (generically referred to as adivasi-Moolvasis) have been trapped in several false cases especially when they try to assert their constitutional and human rights that are often violated by those who consider themselves ‘upper’ castes/ classes and the state system (…)” “His idea of life was so inspirational. He has worked tirelessly for tribals and youths in Jharkhand for several decades. I have come across very few people like him,” said Siraj Dutta, an activist who worked with Swamy. Not everyone thought this way. In 2017, Swamy was charged with sedition by the Jharkhand state for a Facebook post, written in support of the Pathalgadi movement (started by an adivasi community and which sought self-governance). The charge was only revoked with a change of regime, when Hemant Soren’s Jharkhand Mukti Morcha came to power in 2019. And then, in August 2018, his one-room home in the Bagaicha campus was raided by the Pune police, this time in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence. Judicial custody and failing health In the first raid, the Pune police, which was tasked with investigating the case, seized his computer, cell phone, books and some music cassettes. They conducted another on June 2019. Both times, Swamy extended full cooperation and denied having any role in anti-national activities. In January 2020, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs transferred the probe to the NIA, and in July, the Jesuit priest was interrogated in Ranchi for almost 15 hours.

Apart from my bio-data and some factual information, several extracts allegedly taken from my computer implicating my connection to Maoist forces were placed before me. I told them all these are fabrications stealthily put into my computer and I disowned them,” Swamy said in a video message that he released around the time. On September 30, 2020, the NIA asked Swamy to come to Mumbai for further interrogation, but his health was frail, and the country was in the grip of a pandemic. He refused citing these reasons, and the NIA arrested him on October 8. The special NIA court remanded him to judicial custody and he was sent to Taloja jail where some of the other accused in the case were already lodged. The NIA then filed a charge sheet against eight of the accused, including Swamy. He applied for bail on medical grounds in the special NIA court on October 18, but it was rejected. As his condition worsened, he moved the special court to provide him a straw sipper through which he could eat as the jail authorities had failed to provide him one despite repeated requests. The cleric applied for regular bail in the special NIA court in November, but the court only decided the matter in March 2021. It refused to grant him bail. The Taloja jail hospital had no qualified allopathy doctors, so though Swamy had been moved to the hospital by this time on account of his failing health, his condition did not improve. In April, his lawyers moved the HC against the rejection of his regular bail by the special NIA court. “Fr Swamy kept requesting for being tested for Covid but the jail authorities did not heed him,” said Father Frazer Mascarenhes, Swamy’s close associate. “It was only after senior advocate Mihir Desai informed the HC about the apathy of the jail authorities did the court direct that he be taken to Sir JJ Hospital for being tested for Covid and be treated for other ailments.” On May 19, Desai informed the HC that the priest was in bad shape and had become so weak that he was unable to do anything on his own. The court the directed that Swamy be brought before the court through video conference on May 21. During the interaction with justice S J Kathawalla, Swamy told the court that he wanted to go back to Ranchi and would prefer to die in the jail rather than being admitted to the Sir JJ Hospital. The court observed that Swamy needed to be hospitalised. Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare and the NIA, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, opposed this on the grounds that shifting him to a private hospital would set a wrong precedent and Sir J J Hospital was well equipped to take care of the 84-year-old. Also Read | India needs big investment in health workforce“Fr Swamy was very much attached to the people he lived and worked with in Ranchi and had made it clear to the high court during the May 21 hearing that he desired to go back to Ranchi and be with his people,” said Mascarenhes. On May 28, the court directed that Father Stan be shifted to Holy Family hospital the very same day for 15 days, provided that he bore the cost of hospitalisation. Swamy tested positive for Covid, and two days later, he was moved to the Intensive Care Unit. The hospital also treated the priest for heart-related ailments, and the court monitored his health closely, extending his stay till July 5. On July 2, Desai moved the court for an urgent hearing of the bail application, but the court adjourned the hearing to July 6 due to a paucity of time. The following day, Swamy suffered a cardiac arrest and was put on ventilator. For the past few years, Swamy’s family had been asking him to come home or live in one of the guest houses for Jesuit priests. They wanted him to stop his decades-long fight owing to his old age and ill health. More crucially, they were scared about his safety after human rights defenders were jailed. “He told me that the authorities were somehow trying to trap him after police raided his house in Ranchi in 2018,” Prabhu said. The funeral and the protests Father Stan Swamy’s last rites were conducted at St Peters church in Bandra on July 6 and it was attended by fewer than two dozen people, mostly from the Jesuit order and the nuns and medical staff who took care of him at the hospital. It was, however, livestreamed and at one point of time, at least 21,000 people viewed the service. Since his death, several gatherings have taken place, both online and in various cities. Students congregated at Chaityabhoomi, the memorial of Dr BR Ambedkar in Mumbai, the day after Swamy’s funeral. A meeting was also organised in Bagaicha, by the Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, a coalition of rights groups. The United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet and human rights officials of the United States and European Union (EU) expressed concern at his death. Bachelet’s spokesperson Elizabeth Throssell said that the office has raised the issue of the 15 other human rights defenders associated with the Bhima Koregaon case with the Indian government over the past three years and sought their release from pre-trial detention. “In light of the continued, severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is even more urgent that States, including India, release every person detained without a sufficient legal basis, including those detained simply for expressing critical or dissenting views,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Also Read | Nearly 5 decades after demolition, Urdu medium school awaits a new building“We stress, once again, the High Commissioner’s call on the Government of India to ensure that no one is detained for exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, of peaceful assembly and of association,” Throssell said. Both Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, and Nadine Maenza, chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), contended that Swamy had been held on “false” charges of terrorism. They were joined by Eamon Gilmore, the EU special representative for human rights, in expressing concern at his death. The ministry of external affairs however, responded to the criticism by saying “due process under law” was followed in Swamy’s case, and that India remains committed to promoting and protecting the human rights of all citizens. A statement by the ministry contended that he was arrested and detained by NIA “following due process under law”, and his bail applications were rejected by courts because of the “specific nature of charges against him”. Authorities “act against violations of law and not against legitimate exercise of rights”, and all such “actions are strictly in accordance with the law”, the ministry said. In life, Stan Swamy, who traversed the long journey from his village in Tamil Nadu to Jharkhand to Philippines to Bengaluru and then back to Jharkhand and finally a jail and hospital in Mumbai, dedicated himself to the most dispossessed and marginalised. And with his death, he brought the focus back on fundamental rights of all Indian citizens, the legal architecture that curtailed these rights, what it meant for those who worked with communities, at the grassroots, through legal and non-violent means, and the conditions of prisons. In his life and death, Swamy left lessons for India.

12-07-2021||India||Rain deficiency looms large as monsoon revival remains sluggish||Monsoon revival, after a hiatus of ten days, has been very slow, according to India Meteorological Department. It has started raining in some parts of the country, specially in central and peninsular India but the northern limit of the monsoon (NLM) has continued to be in the same position for 22 days since June 19.The NLM is the northernmost limit of monsoon up to which it has advanced. On Sunday, NLM continued to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar, which means the monsoon is yet to cover the entire country. It should have covered the entire country by July 8.The sluggish revival of monsoon is due to several large-scale features, scientists said. While IMD is expecting good rain in the next two weeks which is likely to cover the rain deficiency, overall July rain is expected to be "below normal" over several parts of northwest India and some parts of south peninsula, central, east and northeast India.As on Sunday, there is an 8% deficiency in rains with 23% deficiency over northwest India; 6% deficiency over east and northeast India and 9% deficiency over central India. There is 7% surplus over south peninsula.Delhi has a large rain deficiency of 64%; Gujarat 47%; Haryana 37%; Punjab 41%; Kerala 39%; Odisha 20%; Manipur 62%; Arunachal Pradesh 23%, among others.Also Read | Central Delhi most rain-deficient district in India, shows IMD dataThe slow revival has also led to inaccurate forecasts of monsoon onset over Delhi. IMD, for example, forecast that monsoon would advance to Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana on July 10. It is now likely to make onset only by the morning or afternoon of July 12. “Monsoon revival is very slow. While easterly winds did set in over Delhi, clouds did not form until Sunday. The easterly winds bring a moist air parcel but for clouds to form there has to be vertical ascent of this air which did not happen. Also, there was isolated rain in Rajasthan and Punjab but spatial distribution of rain was limited on Saturday. Now it seems like monsoon is likely to make onset on Monday over Delhi,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Farmers have had to deal with very unusual weather conditions in July due to the slow revival of monsoon. “Temperatures have been very high and there is no rain. This is unexpected in July. Diesel consumption has increased to run our pumps which has led to higher costs to farmers. There are power outages too. In some places, the paddy crop couldn’t sustain so it has to be sown again,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union.“There are local and global factors which influence the advance of monsoon. While the break monsoon phase was mainly due to the Madden Julian Oscillation being in an unfavourable position which has gradually resolved. The slow revival of monsoon may be due to negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in combination with neutral El Niño/Southern Oscillation conditions,” explained OP Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD Pune.“Normally negative IOD with La Niña brings good rain. But due to the impact of negative IOD with neutral La Niña, we are expecting rains to be below normal in some parts of the country. Overall, however, rains may be normal over the country during July,” Sreejith added.The Indian Ocean Dipole is defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between two areas– a western pole in the Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean) and an eastern pole in the eastern Indian Ocean south of Indonesia, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. IOD affects the climate of Australia and other countries that surround the Indian Ocean Basin, and is a significant contributor to rainfall variability in this region.The next two weeks will be critical for monsoon. Lower level easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal have further extended northwestwards, reaching up to Delhi, Haryana and East Rajasthan since Sunday. Low level relative humidity has also increased over the region. Hence, the conditions continue to remain favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over Delhi, remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan during the next 24 hours. Conditions are also becoming favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over remaining parts of the country during the subsequent 48 hours.Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rainfall is very likely over northwest India during next 4-5 days and isolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand during July 11 to 13; over Punjab, Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh during July 11 to 13; over east Rajasthan during July 11 to 12.A low pressure area has formed over westcentral and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal off north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha coasts and an east west shear zone is running in middle levels across Central India. Under their influence, widespread rainfall very likely over central India (Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh and Odisha) during next 4-5 days and isolated heavy rainfall very likely over West Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on July 11.Due to strong southwesterly winds from Arabian Sea; enhanced rainfall activity with isolated heavy to very heavy rain is very likely along the west coast and adjoining peninsular India during next 5 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-deficiency-looms-large-as-monsoon-revival-remains-sluggish-101626058780024.html

Sangli (2.7%), Solapur (2.6%), Satara (2.4%), Sindhudurg (2.4%). Case fatality rate is the number of cases leading to deaths out of the total number of reported cases of a particular infection.According to state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, the administration has taken a twin approach. “We are identifying the hotspots in these districts, say some particular area and mass testing the population there.

The Congress is looking to make a comeback in the state after more than 30 years.The meeting holds significance in view of the party's dismal performance in the recently concluded block pramukh elections. Congress-supported candidates managed to win only two of the 825 seats. The elections were swept by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is aiming to retain power in the state.Earlier, the UP Congress held training camps for block presidents, district-city presidents and state officials which concluded on July 10. The focus during these camps was to discuss strengthening the organisation, booth constructions and several social media campaigns.According to news agency PTI, Priyanka Gandhi's meeting with the party leaders will take place at 10am where discussions will be held on preparations for assembly elections, and devise strategy to energise the cadre.Monday’s meeting comes just a day after Priyanka Gandhi met Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday. Baghel is likely to play an important part in preparing the Congress for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, focusing on strategising and booth management, according to the news agency.Baghel had earlier served as an observer for the Congress in this year’s Assam assembly elections, where he was tasked with the responsibility of replicating the party’s success in the 2018 Chhattisgarh elections. Congress, which was a part of the Mahajot alliance in this year’s assembly elections in Assam, won 29 seats of the total 95 contested.Meanwhile, UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu had last on July 4 stated the party had the capacity to fight the assembly elections without forming an alliance, adding under Priyanka Gandhi’s leadership, the Congress would make a comeback in the state. Lallu’s comments come days after Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party eliminated the possibility of forging any major alliance for the elections.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-to-meet-up-congress-leaders-today-2022-polls-on-agenda-101626057105156.html

Many part of north India have received rain, but national capital Delhi is still waiting for the arrival of the southwest monsoon.According to IMD data, Central Delhi received only 8.5 mm rainfall against the normal of 125.1 mm since June 1, when the monsoon season starts, thus recording a shortfall of 93 per cent.Overall, Delhi has received 64 per cent less rainfall than normal so far, putting it in the category of "large deficient" states.The maximum temperature in the national capital settled at 39 degrees Celsius, three notches above the season's average, while the minimum settled at 28.8 degrees Celsius, a notch above normal.The IMD, meanwhile, is hopeful that Delhi will receive rain on Monday. "The conditions continue to remain favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over Delhi, remaining parts of west Uttar Pradesh, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan during the next 24 hours," the IMD said in its forecast on Sunday.The Southwest Monsoon has reached almost all regions of the country but has stayed away from parts of north India. It is yet to reach Delhi, Haryana, parts of west Uttar Pradesh and west Rajasthan.The IMD had predicted that monsoon is expected to cover these parts by June - a little less than a month back, but its predictions are yet to come true.The IMD expects a revival in the next two weeks, but the overall July rainfall is expected to be "below normal" for several parts of northwest India and some parts of south peninsula, central, east and northeast India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-delhi-most-rain-deficient-district-in-india-shows-imd-data-101626055184116.html

"I went there to meet the Paswan family including Chirag Paswan," news agency ANI quoted Rajak as saying.आज नई दिल्ली स्थित 12 जनपथ आवास पर आदरणीय बड़े भाई स्व॰ रामविलास पासवान जी की धर्मपत्नी श्रीमती रीना पासवान जी व उनके पुत्र व सांसद श्री चिराग पासवान जी से शिष्टाचार मुलाकात किया। pic.twitter.com/DBKUHfbBXxA day before meeting Paswan, Rajak met RJD chief Lalu Yadav, which led to further speculation about the LJP leader's future plans.Asked whether Chirag is welcome in RJD or not, Rajak said after the meeting on Saturday, "All those who want to take forward the ideology of Lohia and Ambedkar are welcome, be it Chirag Paswan or anyone else."ANI further reported that Paswan also spoke to Lalu Yadav and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on phone.The development comes amid a bitter political fight between Chirag Paswan and his uncle Pashupati Paras over the control of LJP, which was founded by Ram Vilas Paswan.A rebel group in LJP has chosen Paras as their leader; the Chirag-led faction, also played a counter move by removing his uncle from all party posts. Chirag has vowed to fight for his father's legacy. He also sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after induction of Paras in the Union Cabinet following a reshuffle.पार्टी विरोधी और शीर्ष नेतृत्व को धोखा देने के कारण लोक जनशक्ति पार्टी से श्री पशुपति कुमार पारस जी को पहले ही पार्टी से निष्काषित किया जा चुका है और अब उन्हें केंद्रीय मंत्री मंडल में शामिल करने पर पार्टी कड़ा ऐतराज दर्ज कराती है।Chirag Paswan has blamed Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for orchestrating the split in the party and accused him of scuttling the chances of his own partymen by sending Paras to the Centre.The fallout between Paras and Chirag has been attributed to a range of issues including the former's dissatisfaction with his nephew's decision to break away from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Bihar Assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chirag-paswan-meets-rjd-s-shyam-rajak-speaks-to-lalu-yadav-101626052195421.html

The Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) said that the two arrested men - Minhaz Ahmed and Maseeruddin - were planning explosions, including using "human bombs" at several places in state.While Ahmed is a resident of Lucknow’s Dubagga area, Maseeruddin lived in Madiyaon area of the Uttar Pradesh capital, said the police. A huge amount of explosive was seized from their houses, Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar told reporters.They were planning to "unleash terror activities before August 15 (Independence Day) in different cities of the state, including Lucknow," Kumar said. According to the police official, members of this module are not only from Lucknow, but also from Kanpur in the state.The accused were working on the instructions of Umar Halmandi, the head of the Uttar Pradesh module of Al-Qaeda, the ADGP added.The ATS is conducting raids at different places to catch the associates of the two terrorists, who escaped before Ahmed and Maseeruddin were arrested.Both the Al-Qaeda operatives will be produced before a court, and then taken into police custody.Ahmed's father runs a motor workshop in the area where the family lives; they have been staying there for the past 15 years, said a policeman on condition of anonymity.

12-07-2021||India||Section of rice exporters to get a 6-month breather on pesticide inspection||The government has given fresh six-month breather to pandemic-hit exporters by allowing them exemption from mandatory inspection of pesticide residue before exporting both basmati and non-basmati rice to European destinations, barring the European Union (EU) and four other countries in the region.While government’s certificate of inspection is already compulsory for exporting rice from India to 27 EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland; its mandatory requirement for remaining 23 European countries have been extended from July 1, 2021 to January 1, 2022, an official said requesting anonymity.Thus, exporters get a six-month breather to export rice without the certificate of inspection by Export Inspection Council (EIC) or Export Inspections Agency (EIA) for European countries, such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Monaco, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom (UK) and Vatican City, he said.EIC is India’s official export certification body that ensures quality and safety of products prior to export. It also provides mandatory certification for various food items such as fishery products, dairy products, honey, egg products, meat and meat products. It also certifies other food and non-food products on voluntary basis. EIC has global acceptance and it is assisted by EIAs.“To ensure adherence to EU norms on pesticide residues, EIC/ EIA certification has been made mandatory for Basmati/ non-Basmati rice export to EU countries and 4 other European countries – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland,” a commerce ministry spokesperson said.The need of inspection was felt after some consignments of rice to EU were rejected because of pesticide residue mainly because EU in January 2018 imposed stringent norms for chemicals such as tricyclazole and buprofezin. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) had made EIC testing mandatory for rice exports to EU in November 2019, which led to decrease in the number of alerts.The inspection was to be made mandatory for other European countries, but it was deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “EIC/ EIA certification for exports to the remaining European countries was to become mandatory from July 1, 2020. However, due to Covid-19 situation, the date was first extended to January 1, 2021 and later to July 1, 2021. The date has now been further extended to January 1, 2022 in view of the disruption caused by 2nd wave of pandemic,” the spokesperson said.Gurnam Arora, rice exporter and a member of All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA) said exporters wanted extension from the inspection requirement for non-EU countries in Europe due to technical reasons as well as cost of compliance. He is not in favour of over-regulation. “Industry is self-disciplined as any rejection would mean loss to the exporter,” he said.Exporters also want that pre-shipment inspection should not be limited to EIC and EIA laboratories. “It is noteworthy that for export to EU pre-shipment inspection mechanism has been operative for quite some time and testing could be done through any NABL [National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories] accredited laboratories,” Arora said.Former president of AIREA, Vijay Setia said instead of over-regulation, educating farmers would be more fruitful in the long run.The commerce ministry has already taken initiative in this direction, the first official said. “As a result of constant follow-up by the commerce department, the Punjab government imposed a ban on sale of nine chemicals, including tricyclazole and buprofezin, during the Kharif season 2020, which helped Indian rice to pass stringent pesticide residue norms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/section-of-rice-exporters-to-get-a-6-month-breather-on-pesticide-inspection-101626048199112.html
12-07-2021||India||Number theory: How to read today’s inflation numbers||The National Statistical Office (NSO) will release the June numbers for Consumer Price Index (CPI), India’s benchmark retail inflation measure, on Monday. A Reuters forecast of economists expects CPI to grow at 6.58% on a year-on-year basis in the month of June. If true, this will be the highest inflation number since the November 2020 value of 6.9%. This will also make June the second consecutive month when retail inflation will be higher than the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance band of 6%. Here are five charts that can help make sense of the latest inflation numbers.1. What is happening to core and non-core inflation?Fuel prices have dominated the discussion around prices in the recent past, and for good reason. Petrol prices crossed ₹100/litre in all four metropolitan cities on July 7. However, the headline inflation number is indicative of much more than just fuel prices. In fact, the fuel and light category has a weight of just 6.84% in the CPI basket. Given the fact that both food and fuel prices tend to have larger volatility, economists often apply the distinction of what is called core and non-core inflation while looking at prices. Core inflation refers to the non-food non-fuel component of the inflation basket. The respective weights of core and non-core categories in India’s CPI basket are 54.1% and 45.9%. Episodes of inflationary spike in India have often been driven by a sharp jump in non-core inflation. Both core and non-core inflation increased in May 2021 compared to the April 2021 levels. Core inflation in May was at 6.5% and the non-core component was at 6%. While a jump in non-core inflation is to be expected given the hike in fuel prices, an increase in core inflation will underline broad-based inflationary pressures in the economy.Also read: Delayed monsoon hits sowing of kharif crops2. The other oil which is driving India’s food inflationWhat was remarkable about the May inflation numbers was the sharp spike in food inflation, which increased from 2% in April 2021 to 5% in May. It needs to be kept in mind that these numbers come on a high base. Food inflation was 9.2% in May 2020. However, what has changed between May 2020 and May 2021 are the factors which are driving food inflation. The contribution of cereals, milk and products and vegetables, the three most important sub-components of the CPI food basket, has gone down in May 2021 compared to May 2020. But the role of edible oil in fuelling food inflation has increased significantly. Because India is a net importer of edible oils, and international edible oil prices are at an all-time high, any immediate relief is unlikely on this front. To be sure, international inflation for edible oil seems to have peaked in May 2021. However, heavy rain in parts of the country during June could add to a spike in vegetable prices, generating additional tailwinds for food inflation.3. Services inflation could increase as the economy unlocks and demand picks upThe miscellaneous category of CPI has a weight of 28.3% in the CPI basket. This largely includes the prices of services and includes the sub-categories of household goods and services, health, transport and communication, recreation and amusement, education, stationery, etc., and personal care and effects. The inflation for the miscellaneous category grew at 7.5% in the month of May 2021, the highest value since March 2013. As the economy unlocks and demand picks up for these categories, there could be additional inflationary pressures going forward.4. The role of global commodity pricesRetail inflation also depends on what is happening to producer prices, which are captured in a better way by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The WPI will be released later this week. It crossed the 10% mark in the month of May 2021 to reach 12.94%.The sharp spike in WPI is also a result of the rise in commodity prices in the international market as demand picks up with revival of growth in advanced countries. A look at the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM), however, shows that international prices peaked in the month of June. The BCOM, which is a weighted index of energy, grain, industrial metal, precious metal, livestock and sugar, coffee and cotton prices, reached a value of 95.02 on June 10, 2021, the highest since July 23, 2015. It was valued at 93.06 on July 9. The question is whether prices will stay at present levels, which are quite high compared to historical standards, or come down further. A stickiness or reversal in the declining trend in the last one week could generate additional headwinds on the domestic inflation numbers.“A closer look revealed a faster rise in the (May) CPI inflation momentum compared to WPI inflation, likely led by more pass-through of higher input costs, higher oil prices and logistical disruptions due to the lockdowns. As the lockdowns ease, these disruptions will likely abate, pushing CPI inflation back below 6% (by July/August). That is the likely story of 1HFY22”, said a research note by Pranjul Bhandari and Aayushi Chaudhary at HSBC Capital Markets and Research. However, the note warned that upside risks to inflation could re-emerge in the second half of the fiscal year, likely driven by two factors: corporates likely feeling more confident about passing on higher prices to consumers as vaccination reached critical mass and demand side pressures fuelling service inflation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-how-to-read-today-s-inflation-numbers-101626045486853.html
12-07-2021||India||Greenpiece: Key steps that can help promote green travel||Electric and hydrogen cars are widely written about today. But who can afford an electric car? Someone with minimum ten lakh rupees plus and easy access to a charging point: a rich person. The rest still use what they can afford. To make a real shift, we need safe, affordable, reliable public transport run on clean technology. The question is what is clean?Let’s start with electric. We need a robust system to handle the spent batteries. India has a terrible record so far. Not only have manufacturers of lead-acid batteries evaded their responsibility for years, so have other battery and cell manufacturers. What we need is not just a law, but deep disincentives to violate it and public transparency in implementing it. Hydrogen critics have red-flagged the issue of flammability and electric shocks. Both can be addressed by refined tech.But, a study by Logan et al from the UK says hydrogen buses at full capacity result in 1.8 times less emissions per person than a car. Yet, it says, electric buses produce less emissions than hydrogen. Luckily, Indian states are veering towards electric buses. What more can they do?That apart, charging any bus or car requires electricity, mostly polluting. That needs to be urgently addressed. We need the cycle to be green, not only the road emissions.Indian states can lead this transformation. Many have begun procuring electric buses. Now, lets procure green energy and expand charging stations with national standards, so we can genuinely travel green.(The writer is Founder and Director Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/greenpiece-key-steps-that-can-help-promote-green-travel-101626042166342.html

A descriptive analysis was later conducted to quantify the incidence of adverse events following immunisation on both occasions.“Our results, albeit preliminary, suggest that Sputnik V has a high tolerability profile in the population aged ≥60 years in terms of short-term AEFIs. This preliminary analysis suggests a higher or equal tolerability profile of the Sputnik V vaccine in the 60+ age group, after both doses, as compared with other widely adopted Covid-19 vaccines,” said the statement.The results were published in EClinicalMedicine, an open access clinical journal published by The Lancet.“Our results also align with the findings of phase 1 and 2 previously conducted studies, then confirmed by phase 3 of the vaccine trial, in terms of overall safety and tolerability. No hospitalizations or deaths were reported. Nearly all reported AEFIs were mild or moderate and/or lasted less than 2 days,” the statement added.Sputnik V was the third vaccine to be granted an emergency use authorisation in India on April 12, 2021 after indigenously developed Covaxin and Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-sputnik-v-shows-strong-safety-profile-among-elderly-says-rdif-101626031584305.html
12-07-2021||India||Cong demands judicial probe into corruption allegations against CM BSY||Bengaluru Lashing out at chief minister Yediyurappa for his alleged involvement in wide scale corruption, BS Dinesh Gundu Rao, senior Congress legislator and former state president of the party, on Sunday demanded a judicial probe into the possible involvement of the chief minister in corruption cases and said that the latter has no moral right to remain in the top post after such allegations. Rao who is in-charge of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Goa and All India Congress Committee spokesperson, Prof. Gourav Vallabh, while addressing the media on Sunday demanded Yediyurappa’s resignation over corruption charges. “Mr. B.S. Yediyurappa has no moral right to remain the chief minister after allegations of such serious nature and of direct involvement. Karnataka chief minister Mr. B.S. Yediyurappa should resign immediately from the post of CM,” Rao said in a statement on Sunday. He added that a judicial probe must be initiated under the supervision of the chief justice of Karnataka to uncover the “entire matter” and send the culprits behind bars. “We urge central agencies like CBI, ED and IT authorities to carry out an exhaustive investigation and uncover the truth. They should not be just lap dogs of the BJP, they should act independently and these are serious allegations, serious revelations made by a very responsible individual and this has been happening at a very-very regular interval and these things are in the notice of the BJP leadership, national leadership, but, they are not acting, they are not doing anything, the biggest question is ‘Why’?” Rao said. The Congress has been piling on the pressure against the 78-year-old CM who already faces uncertainty over continuing in the top post over allegations of corruption, levelled by his own colleagues from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “The Yediyurappa government and the CM himself, there have been so many exposes on him, right from the time when the coalition government was being toppled. There were audio recording which Mr. Yediyurappa admitted that it was his own voice, where he is trying to bribe the opposite party MLAs offering huge sums of money, also speaking about how he can manage Supreme Court Judges, how he can manage speaker and this is on record on the audio tapes and the CM had admitted that it was his own voice,” Rao further added. Multiple cases of corruption have been resurfacing against Yediyurappa in recent times which are likely to add to the challenges of the chief minister who wished to remain in power for the next two years until the 2023 assembly elections. Questioning why the BJP at the centre are quite on the issue, Rao said, “BJP Government in Karnataka headed by CM B.S. Yediyurappa is allegedly involved in the most brazen acts of corruption and misuse of power. The undue interference in day-to-day administration by his maverick younger son B.Y. Vijayendra and other close relatives are allegedly involved in many cases. Despite facing embarrassing situations arising from serious allegations made by the aggrieved sections who have dragged the CM and his family members to court seeking justice, there is no sign of either remorse or repentance on the part of CM B.S. Yediyurappa and his kith and kin.” Rao alleged that a qualified senior engineer had to cough up ₹9.75 crore to “satisfy the greed of the CM’s close relatives”. There was no immediate reaction from the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-demands-judicial-probe-into-corruption-allegations-against-cm-bsy-101626029858184.html

The husband belongs to an upper caste while the wife belongs to the Valmiki community, classified as a scheduled tribe, the police said.“The incident occurred on July 8 in Ron Taluk, roughly 385km from Bengaluru. The husband’s relatives had gotten into a fight with the couple, and the wife was injured during the incident. On July 9, we booked a case under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (SC/ST Act). Further, the investigation is on,” a police official said on condition of anonymity.The incident has highlighted a sharp spike in atrocities against marginalized communities in the state. Between April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, there have been 2,327 cases of murder, exploitation and other cases against members of the SC/ST community in Karnataka, according to data from the state government.This shows an increase of over 54% since the previous year, in which there were a total of 1,504 cases registered, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau.The cases include murder, exploitation, burns and other crimes against the members of the community.In the last month alone, Karnataka witnessed at least three victims of “honour” killing, including several others, that include name-calling, denial of services and conflicts between groups that rarely make it to the books.Two teenagers, a Dalit boy and a Muslim girl were killed in Saladahalli village in Devara Hipparagi taluk in Vijayapura district by the girl’s family, who smashed their heads with rocks, Hindustan Times reported on June 24.In another case in Baragur village in Koppal district, a boy who belonged to the Madiga community was murdered by the family of the girl, who was from the dominant Kuruba community for being romantically involved.Activists are taking out a rally in protest against the continued atrocities against Dalit groups in the Koppal district on July 19.Activists said that there are skirmishes almost daily in rural Karnataka that exposes the dark belly of a state that is globally known for its prowess in technology, startups, aerospace and biotechnology among other attributes.However, data suggests that the reporting of cases are low, but the conviction rates are even lower.

But we find that judgments are becoming more complex and verbose,” said a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy in a postscript to its judgment allowing Delhi Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee to summon Facebook as part of its proceeding in relation to the communal violence in the Capital in February last year.The six-page postscript was added to the judgment by the three judges who felt strongly about making judgments meaningful to the common man.“The purpose of our postscript is only to start a discussion among the legal fraternity by bringing to notice the importance of succinctly framed written synopsis in advance, and the same being adhered to in course of oral arguments to be addressed over a limited time period and more crisp, clear and precise judgments so that the common man can understand what the law is being laid down. After all, it is for ‘the common man’ that the judicial system exists,” stated the postscript.While judges have a big role in this, the bench said that lawyers share an equal responsibility by making time-bound arguments and supplying brief, precise synopsis of arguments and laws. “Instead of restricting oral arguments it (court) has become a competing arena of who gets to argue for the longest time.”In the recent past, complex cases decided by the Supreme Court have invited bulky decisions. The decision in September 2018 declaring Aadhaar card valid with riders numbered 1448 pages. The Ayodhya title suit dispute decided in November 2019 was 1045 pages thick. The Court decision declaring right to privacy as fundamental right in August 2017 had 547 pages while the September 2018 ruling decriminalising gay sex ran into 495 pages. The Court also rued that precious judicial time is consumed to decide routine matters, bail pleas and interim orders in civil matters that have no precedential value.Currently, the pending cases in the top court as on July 2, 2021 are 69,212 of which 447 cases are before Constitution benches with composition of five, seven and nine judges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/write-clear-short-judgments-that-litigants-can-understand-sc-101626029583380.html
12-07-2021||India||Gehlot sworn in as 19th guv of K’taka||Bengaluru Former union minister, Thawarchand Gehlot, on Sunday took oath as the 19th Governor of Karnataka in Raj Bhawan. Ghelot replaces Vajubhai Vala who has been the head of the state since September 1, 2014. “I am today sworn in as the Governor of Karnataka, committed to the protection and immunity of the Constitution and Law of India and the service and well-being of the people of Karnataka,” Gehlot said in a post on Twitter in Kannada. “Attended the swearing ceremony of Hon’ble @TCGEHLOT Ji who took oath as the 19th Governor of Karnataka and extended my greetings & wishes to him. Hon’ble Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court Shri Abhay Srinivas Oka, outgoing Governor Hon’ble Vajubhai Vala ji were present,” BS Yediyurappa, the chief minister of Karnataka said in a post on Twitter on Sunday. Leaders across party lines were seen sharing a laugh and holding conversation during the swearing in ceremony that, at least for a day, saw political rivals using the opportunity to set aside their differences. Siddaramaiah, the Congress’ leader of the opposition, referred to Karnataka chief minister as a “friend” and stated that he took a break from politics and “enjoyed it”. “Congratulated the newly appointed Governor of Karnataka Shri. Thawar Chand Gehlot. I wish him the best for his new responsibility,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition said in a post on Twitter. Vala had presided over the state during one of its most turbulent political times in which there were four chief ministers in a span of seven years. Gehlot takes charge at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command is contemplating replacing Yediyurappa who has been under pressure over allegations of corruption, management--or mismanagement--of covid-19, non-performance and charges that his son BY Vijayendra running a parallel government under the aegis of his father. Most of the criticism has come from within the BJP who have predicted even the date of the replacement and even accused Yediyurappa and his family members of embezzling thousands of crores to remain in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-sworn-in-as-19th-guv-of-ktaka-101626029739707.html
12-07-2021||India||Spotlight on 2015 caste census ahead of K’taka polls||Bengaluru Almost six years since the commissioning of the “Socio-Economic and Education Survey”, better known as caste-census, by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2015, a section of leaders from some of the most marginalised groups in Karnataka are attempting to take the legal route to get chief minister BS Yediyurappa release the findings, HT has learned. With just two years to go before assembly elections in 2023, making the report public is likely to have a significant impact on the complex caste equations in a state where dominant communities like Lingayats and Vokkaligas have ruled the narrative.The newly formed Athi Hindulida Jagruti Vedike (Kannada for extreme backward classes awareness forum) has now approached former chief minister Siddaramaiah and the Congress to make the report public.“The reservation that is being given out today is based on unscientific data and there are extremely backward classes who have no representation economically, socially or politically to raise their voices,” Mukyamanthri Chandru, former legislator and popular Kannada cinema actor told Hindustan Times on Sunday. Chandru is also the honorary president of the newly formed forum.The forum is targeting to file a petition of Mandamus (judicial writ to command to order to perform a public or statutory duty) by July 16 or coming Friday.“The commission conducted the survey directed by the government which was their mandate. They (backward classes commission) have collected all the data and the report is also ready as they have shared it under RTI,” AS Ponanna, former Additional Advocate General of Karnataka and senior counsel said.The senior counsel added that ₹162 crore of the state’s money has been spent on this purpose and this information should be available to the public.Siddaramaiah, from the backward yet politically formidable Kuruba community, attempted to conduct the caste census in 2015, the first since 1931 anywhere in the country, as a way to challenge the dominant caste theory in Karnataka.Successive governments, including the one that commissioned it, have steered clear of considering the sensitive nature of the information that has the potential to review the perceived size of caste groups which have allowed a few communities to have better bargaining power compared to others.Siddaramaiah, who stormed to power in 2013 riding on the support base of AHINDA (acronym for Muslims, backward classes and Dalits) is hoping the release of the data would also help his claim to the top post from within his party to rule out the likes of state Congress president DK Shivakumar among others if the Congress returns to power in 2023.To be sure, the forum has also approached Shivakumar for his support.Karnataka’s political landscape has been ruled by the Lingayats and Vokkaligas, believed to be the two largest communities in the state, which has been challenged in the past by smaller groups who are fighting to get the same kind of representation.These small communities, who account for no more than a few thousand in each constituency, are also key for political parties as they can become the deciding factor in close contests.The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa, a Lingayat, has doled out handsomely for caste-specific programmes as a way of reaching out to groups that are not known to support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Though Yediyurappa is known to be the tallest leader of the Lingayats, some of the bigger sub-sects like Panchamasalis are demanding that one of their own be considered for the top job, should the BJP high command enforces a replacement of the chief minister.The chunk of most benefits of reservation in Karnataka and other states in the country are often taken up by the large communities, experts said, leaving hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller groups with no representation or benefits.There are at least 36 caste groups in Karnataka who have been waiting for almost a decade to get the government to look their way for better reservation opportunities, Hindustan Times reported on February 15. The recent reservation-related demands by Panchamasali, Kurubas, Vokkaligas and Valmikis among others, have added to apprehensions of smaller communities, with scattered populations across the state, of further injustices. All three major political parties in Karnataka, BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), have a core-caste or community support base which has allowed them to remain politically relevant in the south Indian state. BJP enjoys the backing of the dominant Lingayats while Dalits, communities that come under other backward classes and minorities are seen to back the Congress. Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and his former chief minister son, HD Kumaraswamy-led JD(S) relies heavily on the Vokkaligas, another dominant and politically influential community found largely in the Old Mysuru region. The leaked findings of the caste census, which were not authenticated by the then Siddaramaiah-led government in 2015, indicate the downward revision of the percentage of Lingayats and Vokkaligas from its earlier believed figures of around 17% and 14% respectively to just around 10%. But his plan to get the support of the Lingayats backfired when he, on the advice of ministers like MB Patil among others, mooted to accord the community the status of a separate religion just before the 2018 assembly elections, demonstrating the nature of deep-rooted caste-based politics in the state. “Hundreds of crores have been spent for Caste-based census. Hence, leaders from the backward class met me and said it should not go to waste. There is nothing wrong in their demand,” Shivakumar said on Sunday.He added that he was unaware of the contents but said that he will discuss the same with other party leaders.“First, we shall learn what is BJP’s stand on this. When asked, they’ve replied that the report hasn’t been submitted and they were unaware of this,” he said. According to people aware of the developments, the state backward classes commission has already submitted the report to the government, which is yet to take a call on its release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spotlight-on-2015-caste-census-ahead-of-k-taka-polls-101626029678118.html
12-07-2021||India||Kanimozhi dismisses reports of TN division||Chennai: Dismissing reports that the Union government plans to bifurcate Tamil Nadu’s western region into ‘Kongu Nadu’, the ruling DMK and its allies said that nobody can divide Tamil Nadu and it is a ‘figment of imagination’. “Nobody can divide Tamil Nadu. No one needs to worry about such things, the state is now under a safe government,” DMK MP Kanimozhi told reporters on Sunday. While Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) chief K S Alagiri termed the demand for Kongu Nadu as a “figment of imagination”, senior Congress leader Thirunavukuarasu said, “There is no chance for this. Though it has happened to other states there is no necessity for it here in Tamil Nadu for now.” Taking a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the reports, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader G Balakrishnan said that the BJP was attempting this for political gains. “This is dangerous. People of Tamil Nadu will not allow this. Such actions by the BJP to enter Tamil Nadu through the backdoor will only cause severe repercussions for the party,” Balakrishnan said on Saturday. AMMK chief T T V Dhinakaran called this a divisive measure along caste lines and urged chief minister M K Stalin to clear the issue. The speculation that the Government of India would carve out this region into either a separate state or a union territory began after profiles of the new cabinet minister were released on July 7. The profile of Tamil Nadu’s outgoing BJP chief L Murugan, who was inducted into the union cabinet, referred to him as hailing from ‘Kongu Nadu, Tamil Nadu’. BJP leaders in the state have spoken in favour of such a move if that’s what the people desire. “Why are they (DMK) scared about this?” BJP legislative party leader, Nainar Nagendran, asked reporters on Sunday, adding that several places in Tamil Nadu end with a ‘Naadu’. “But one must keep in mind Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were divided into two. If that (bifurcation) is the desire of the people of the state, then the government must fulfil it.” BJP state general secretary Karu Nagarajan also echoed the same view. “There is even a political party named after Kongu Nadu so it’s not a wrong word. I think calling it Kongu Nadu is the desire of the people from that region,” Nagarajan said.On June 10, a vernacular daily published a report that the Centre was planning a bifurcation as a befitting response to the DMK government referring to the Narendra Modi-led government as ‘Ondriya Arasu” in Tamil meaning Union Government and not the Central government. On the same day, BJP national president of the ‘Mahila Morcha’, Vanathi Srinivasan, on her Facebook page quoted ancient Tamil texts to support the claim that Kongu was a separate geographical region. Srinivasan hails from the western region and is an elected MLA from Coimbatore which is a part of the region. The western regions has been the bastion of the AIADMK and two MLAs from BJP were elected from here in the election results that were announced on May 2. The AIADMK-led alliance with the BJP won 33 of the total 50 seats. While the DMK combine swept other regions in the state, the AIADMK alliance registered its best performance in the Kongu region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanimozhi-dismisses-reports-of-tndivision-101626029498093.html
12-07-2021||India||Kerala:Zika tally reaches 18 with three fresh cases||Three more Zika virus cases were detected in Kerala on Sunday, taking the toll of total cases to 18, said state health minister Veena George. Among the infected are a health worker, a mother and her two-year-old baby. All cases are from the Thiruvananthapuram district. The minister said now at least four laboratories will have the facility to test the virus and it will save enough time. Currently, the state is sending samples to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, which takes enough time. The minister said a state-wide vector control programme has been launched and sought people’s help to destroy the breeding ground of Aedes mosquitoes that spreads the virus. “We are doing everything possible to contain it,” she said. A 24-year-old pregnant woman from Parasala in Thiruvananthapuram district was first to test positive for the Zika virus on Wednesday and two days later, 14 more people were added to the list. The Union health ministry then rushed a team of experts to the state to help contain the virus. Zika cases surfaced at a time when the state is struggling with a heavy caseload of Covid-19 cases. For more than a month, the state has topped the Covid-19 charts in daily caseload and test positivity rate. On Sunday, the state reported 12,220 new cases with a TPR of 10.48 per cent. It also reported 97 deaths. Experts said unlike Covid-19, Zika is not a major malady and it can be controlled with effective vector control programmes. The virus is spread mostly through mosquitoes but it can also be transmitted through casual sex and the fatality rate among patients is very low and only one in five develops symptoms, they said. The symptoms of the disease, first identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 and among humans in Nigeria in 1954, include joint pain, fever and headache. In May 2015, it was reported in Brazil, where it spread rapidly. The virus can cause shrunken brain in children and a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome, experts said, adding it was first reported in the country in Gujarat in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralazika-tally-reaches-18-with-three-fresh-cases-101626029018105.html
12-07-2021||India||Expelled AIADMK leader joins DMK||Former AIADMK minister Thoppu Venkatachalam, who was expelled from the party, joined the DMK on Sunday with hundreds of his supporters.Besides Venkatachalam, former AIADMK MP and MLA PR Sundaram and others joined the DMK in the presence of its president and Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin, the party said in a release here.It is a boost to the ruling party trying to strengthen its base in the western region ahead of the local body polls slated for later this year. The Supreme Court has set a deadline for civic polls to be conducted in nine districts before September 15. Venkatachalam’s joining the DMK follows an exodus to the ruling party of AIADMK functionaries expelled for their truck with the ousted VK Sasikala. A senior AIADMK leader admitted that since their loss in the assembly elections, they have been worried about their cadre joining the DMK. “People moving was expected especially after the DMK gave cabinet berths to former AIADMK members,” the leader said. He said deputy leader of opposition O Panneerselvam addressed the issue at the AIADMK meeting held on Friday.According to the leader, Panneerselvam said people left the party after MG Ramachandran’s death and after J Jayalalithaa lost the 1996 elections. “But the true cadre will remain and that is the AIADMK’s strength,” he said. “We are starting preparations for local body elections. The leaders will have a meeting with each district secretary in the coming days.”Venkatachalam was the minister for environment and revenue in late Jayalalithaa’s cabinet from 2011-2016. He wasn’t given a ticket in this year’s assembly election, so he contested unsuccessfully as an Independent that led to his expulsion. He said that more than 900 cadre from other parties and organisations have joined him. Venkatachalam hails from Erode, a part of Tamil Nadu’s western region, which has been the AIADMK’s citadel. In this year’s elections, the DMK that swept all other regions couldn’t win over the western region, where the AIADMK-led alliance with the BJP won 33 of the total 50 seats. “I will change Erode into an unshakable fort of the DMK,” Venkatachalam said in DMK leader MK Stalin’s presence. He said he would bring in 25,000 functionaries from the district if Stalin approves.On Thursday, actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan’ lieutenant R Mahendran, who quit the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), joined the DMK. Mahendran has been the MNM’s best performing candidate in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the Coimbatore constituency. While addressing the new inductees on Thursday, Stalin said that if Mahendran had joined earlier, they could have performed well in Coimbatore, which is part of the western belt otherwise known as the Kongu region. “Though we got enough seats to form our government, we did not win the expected numbers in Coimbatore and Kongu region,” Stalin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expelled-aiadmk-leader-joins-dmk-101626028958046.html
12-07-2021||India||Acted against 133 posts and 18,000 profiles: Twitter||In its first grievance redress report mandated under the new social media and intermediary guidelines, Twitter has said it took action on 133 posts for reasons ranging from harassment to privacy infringement and suspended over 18,000 accounts for “child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity”.The social media firm is in a standoff with the government over compliance with the new guidelines. It told the Delhi high court that it has appointed an interim grievance officer, nodal contact person and compliance officer. “In addition to the above data, we processed 56 grievances which were appealing Twitter account suspensions. These were all resolved and the appropriate responses were sent. We overturned 7 of the account suspensions based on the specifics of the situation, but the other accounts remain suspended,” the report released on Sunday said. The report covers the period from May 25 to June 26.Also read: Twitter appoints grievance officerTwitter became the third major social media firm, after Facebook and Google, to release a report in keeping with the rules that the government has asserted it is in violation of, even going so far as to warn that the company has lost immunity from prosecution for third party content.“In compliance with Rule 4(1)(d) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, Twitter is required to publish a monthly compliance report which includes the details of complaints from users via the India grievance mechanism and action taken on them, as well as information related to Twitter’s proactive monitoring efforts under the IT Rules. This inaugural report covers the reporting period from May 26, 2021 through to June 25, 2021. Going forward, we will be publishing this report on a monthly basis, and we are committed to making improvements over time, based on feedback received from the government, or in accordance with internal changes that allow for us to provide more granular data,” Twitter said.Twitter suspended 18,385 accounts for child sexual exploitation and 4,179 for promotion of terrorism. “Proactive monitoring refers to content proactively identified by employing internal proprietary tools and industry hash sharing initiatives,” the firm said in its report.Facebook removed a little over 30 million pieces of content – posts, profiles pages – between May 15 and June 15 in India, the company said in a first action-taken disclosure.The links taken down related to content that was violent and graphic, contained adult nudity and sexual activity, and suicide and self-injury. The report released on Friday is an interim disclosure and the company said it will publish details on July 15.Facebook-owned Instagram said it took action on two million links across nine categories in the same period. Another Facebook company, WhatsApp, has challenged the IT rules over the traceability clause.“Facebook’s India-specific numbers are more detailed than offered to other countries,” a person familiar with the matter said. “The list of categories is not exhaustive”. According to the social media firm’s last quarter transparency report, from January 2021 to March 2021, it took action on 31.8 million URLs for adult nudity, while in India the number stood at 1.8 million for the month.In terms of graphic and violent content, the company proactively took down 34.3 million posts, pages and profiles, of which India’s number for May 15 to June 15 was 2.5 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acted-against-133-posts-18k-profiles-says-twitter-in-first-compliance-report-101626028898759.html
12-07-2021||India||Kerala may withdraw its plea in assembly violence case: Counsel||Thiruvananthapuram: After a series of setbacks in courts, the Kerala government is planning to withdraw its petition seeking quashing of the case related to the violent incidents in the state assembly in March 2015, said a senior counsel close to the government. Last week the Supreme Court had slammed the government for seeking permission to withdraw the case against six legislators and adjourned its petition for further hearing on July 15. According to the counsel, the government fears that more adverse remarks are likely during the hearing stage and it got legal advice that it is better to withdraw the petition and proceed with the case in the trial court. But legal experts said even if the government wants to withdraw the petition at this juncture, it needs permission of the apex court. Earlier the chief judicial magistrate court in Thiruvananthapuram and the Kerala high court had turned down the government’s plea to withdraw the case. The government later moved the Supreme Court, which also passed serious observations. While hearing the plea, the apex court said it can’t condone destruction of public property by legislators in the House and asked the petitioner what message it will give it to people. The case also ruffled feathers of one of the allies of the ruling Left Democratic Front, Kerala Congress (Mani). During the hearing of the petition in the apex court, the counsel for the Kerala government had reportedly said protests on the floor of the House was a natural one against a corrupt politician, a reference to then finance minister KM Mani. But later CPI(M) leaders pacified the agitated KC (M), saying a section of the media misquoted the counsel. The Kerala assembly had witnessed violent incidents in March 2015 after then opposition LDF legislators tried to prevent then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the state budget, alleging his role in the bar bribery case. Angry members snapped mikes, threw chairs, destroyed furniture and damaged lights in the melee, and two legislators were later hospitalised. The session was live when violence took place in the House. Then Speaker N Sakthan later filed a police complaint against six LDF legislators, and one of them, V Sivankutty, is the education minister in the Pinarayi Vijayan ministry and KT Jaleel is a sitting member. In his complaint, the Speaker said property worth ₹2.20 lakh was damaged and the legislators brought shame to the House. After the LDF came to the power in 2016, it tried to withdraw the case, but a local court rejected it. Then the government moved the high court, which also turned down its plea. The government had invoked the privilege of legislators to justify its decision to withdraw the case, but the high court rejected it, saying privilege was not a licence to carry out violent activities in the House. During a discussion in the assembly last year, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had blamed the Congress-led UDF for dragging an assembly issue to the court. Later former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also joined the case as a party. After the death of KM Mani in 2019, his party split and his son took the major faction to the LDF camp. A predominant Christian party, Kerala Congress (Mani)’s foray into the LDF had helped it win many seats in Christian-dominated areas, but now the CPI(M) is forced to swallow its earlier charges against KM Mani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-may-withdraw-its-plea-in-assembly-violence-casecounsel-101626028838099.html
12-07-2021||India||UP ATS: Major attack averted with arrest of 2 Qaeda-linked terrorists||The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on Sunday claimed to have foiled plans for major terrorist attacks in crowded areas of Lucknow and other cities in the state with the arrest of two operatives of the Al Qaeda-linked Ansar Ghazwatul Hind.“The ATS has arrested two active members belonging to Al qaeda-supported ‘Ansar Ghazwatul Hind’. Minhaz Ahmed, a resident of Lucknow’s Dubagga area, and Maseeruddin, a resident of Lucknow’s Madiyaon area, have been arrested. Explosive material has been recovered from them,” said UP police additional director general (ADG), law and order, Prashant Kumar.Kumar said Ahmed and Maseeruddin, along with their accomplice Shakeel, were planning attacks in Lucknow and other parts of the state ahead of the Independence Day. “They were planning explosions at important places, memorials and crowded places, and also to use human bombs. For this, they were collecting weapons and explosives,” said Kumar. The accused were working on the instructions of Umar Halmandi, the head of the Uttar Pradesh module of Al Qaeda, he added.The ATS teams are carrying out searches at different locations in Lucknow as some more members of this module have escaped before the arrest of two accused, said Kumar. Late on Sunday,the ATS team arrested another suspect from the Chamanganj area in Kanpur.A senior police official privy of the investigation, who did not want to be named, said Ahmed’s father runs a motor workshop near his house at Sita Bihar colony on Dubagga bypass, where they have been living for the past 15 years. During the nearly six-hour raid, the ATS team found several incriminating evidence, including two semi-prepared IED-based pressure cooker bombs, explosive materials and a pistol, following which the property was sealed, the official added.The police have also detained two people from Ahmed’s house, while two others managed to escape, the official said.Another team carried out searches at the home of Maseeruddin, who is aged about 50, in Lucknow’s Madhiau and found a large amount of explosives and a cooker set to be used as a crude bomb, an NDTV report quoted officials as saying.The two arrested are set to be presented in court where the police will request their custody, it added.Meanwhile, security has been beefed up at all vital installations in the state, including airports. Checking at highways and bus stations has been intensified.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-ats-major-attack-averted-with-arrest-of-2-qaeda-linked-terrorists-101626028779279.html

12-07-2021||India||Chaos shrouds the hills amid influx of tourists||Thousands of tourist vehicles have been turned away from hill stations close to Delhi over the last few days for not meeting travel document requirements linked to Covid-19, with traffic snarls being reported in popular destinations because of a heavy rush of visitors amid a heatwave in the northern plains and a significant decline in infections, officials said on Sunday.The Union health ministry said last week that a spurt in travel after lifting of Covid-19 restrictions — the government termed it “revenge travel” — led to “frightening” scenes of overcrowding in hill stations that could lead to increased outbreaks of the infectious disease. Visuals from tourist destinations point out violations of Covid-appropriate behaviour, with people not wearing masks or ensuring social distancing.Heavy traffic jams have been reported on highways in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh over the last few days. Records of the Uttarakhand Police show that close to 4,000 vehicles were denied entry to hill stations, an official said, asking not to be named. The official said those who did not have negative Covid-19 test reports and advance booking confirmation for hotels were being turned away as per “well-publicised” protocol for visitors.“We are stopping tourists who do not have a negative test report, online hotel booking confirmation and registration on smart city portal,” Mussoorie Police station incharge Rajeev Rauthan said. About 3,900 tourist vehicles were not allowed into Mussoorie and nearby areas, and 550 were stopped in Nainital, according to official records reviewed by HT.Visuals showed tourists being stuck in traffic as a long queue of vehicles choked a key road in Mussoorie on Saturday. Similar snarls were reported on Sunday.Ramesh Talwar, a resident of Green Park Extension in New Delhi, said: “My family has been stuck in our apartment for the past one year... When we have reached the outskirts of the town, the police didn’t let us enter the town... We had made a booking in a hotel.” However, the police said Talwar did not possess a negative Covid-19 report, an urgent requirement to allow travel.While Uttar Pradesh resident Pankaj Rathore said he was turned away because he had a negative rapid antigen test report (RAT) and not one conducted with the RT-PCR method, official documents detailing the guidelines said RAT reports were permitted for travel.As the tourist influx increased in Uttarakhand, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Friday said the state government issued an order to allow only 50% occupancy at hotels in Nainital and Dehradun.Many hoteliers and travel companies in hill stations say this is a make-or-break summer for them as their revenues have taken a hit since March last year, the first time travel restrictions came into effect to control the spiralling spread of Covid-19. Health experts warn that non-compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour at this juncture could result in a dangerous third wave of infections. The second wave, which has peaked but is still lingering, overwhelmed the health care infrastructure across the country, prompting many states to clamp lockdowns.Ashok Kumar, director general of police (DGP), Uttarakhand, said the restrictions have been put in place to ensure that the Covid-19 precautions are strictly implemented. “Some tourists faced some inconvenience after being turned back but it is necessary to ensure the health safety of people...”Dinesh Chandra Sah, president the Nainital Hotel and Restaurant Association, said with police returning tourists, many are calling to find out if they will be allowed to enter Nainital. “Many have also cancelled hotel bookings but there are also many who couldn’t come as they were stopped,” he said.In Himachal Pradesh, the growing rush of tourists, particularly during the weekends, has pushed the state government to deploy additional police personnel in hill stations. “More than 1.3 million tourists have visited Himachal Pradesh since May. Of them, about 600,000 came to the state since June-end, when Covid-19 restrictions were eased,” said state tourism director Amit Kashyap. Close to 10,000 vehicles crossed the Parwanoo border on Saturday, he said.“Hotel occupancy in Himachal Pradesh, which was almost nil when the pandemic was raging, has now gone up to about 80%,” he added. The state government has not imposed any limit on hotel bookings in the state and, but it has not made negative Covid-19 test reports mandatory for visitors.Ajit Kumar, a resident of Shimla, said: “It’s true that our economy is dependent on tourists but they should follow Covid protocol...”Images on social media of tourist frenzy at Atal Tunnel in Manali, at Kempty Falls in Mussoorie and several other tourist locations in the hills have led to concerns among health experts and officials over a possible rise in cases of Covid-19 again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chaos-shrouds-the-hills-amid-influx-of-tourists-101626028658077.html

12-07-2021||India||Covid-hit doctor airlifted to Hyderabad for lung transplant||A resident doctor at the gynaecology department of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences here, who has been battling for her life since Covid-19 caused irreparable damage to her lungs in April, was on Sunday airlifted to Hyderabad for a transplant.30-year-old Dr Sharda Suman was taken in an ambulance from the RMLIMS campus at around 10.40am. “She will undergo lung transplant surgery at the Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) hospital,” said Dr Srikesh Singh, spokesperson for the institute.Dr Sharda reached KIMS hospital and was admitted to Medical ICU4 (MICU4)..., said the RMLIMS administration in a press statement in the evening. “Her condition is stable as per medical details received,” said the statement issued at 6.30pm.The state government sanctioned ₹1.50 crore for the transplant, Dr Srikesh Singh said.Dr Sharda was on duty in the Covid ward despite being pregnant and had tested positive for Covid in April. Later, her condition worsened. She had to be put on ECMO (extra corporeal membrane oxygenation) support,which works as artificial lungs. Dr Sharda Suman later tested negative for Covid. An expert panel recommended lung transplant. A team from KIMS reached RMLIMS on July 10 and prepared for her shifting, said Dr Srikesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covidhit-doc-airlifted-to-hyd-for-lung-transplant-101626028178172.html
12-07-2021||India||UP, Assam’s population control policies in line with RSS demand||The announcement by two Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states, Uttar Pradesh and Assam, about their intent to introduce a population control policy is in line with the demand of the party’s ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, for a nationwide policy to check what it calls “demographic imbalance”.On Sunday, UP, the most populous state in the country with an estimated 220 million population, announced a new policy that will incentivise population control. A draft bill of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill, 2021, has been created by the state’s law commission with the intent to incentivise those with two children through preference in government jobs and social schemes such as free or subsidised ration.In Assam, a similar policy is being discussed. In the state with an estimated population of 36 million, the government is also considering a two-child policy for access to government schemes. In 2017, the government introduced the Population and Women Empowerment policy that mandated government officials to abide by the two-child norm. Notably, SC and ST communities and tea garden workers in the state will be exempt from this policy.For long, the RSS has advocated a pan-Indian law that would be uniform for all communities and override religious or social restrictions pertaining to family planning. The policy, the Sangh functionaries explain, will check the “imbalance” in total fertility rates (TFR) or the average number of children a woman will have during her childbearing years, claiming that even in states with the ideal TFR of 2.1 such as Kerala, there is a mismatch among communities.In 2018, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat pitched for a common law to ensure “demographic balance”. He said there should be a population policy applicable to everyone and implemented without exception.While the opponents of the RSS and the BJP perceive the population control policies as coercive and intended against minority communities, senior functionaries of the Sangh say the intent of a uniform law is to bring uniformity in the TFR rates and in turn stabilise India’s burgeoning population.“In 2015, when the RSS, passed a resolution seeking a population policy, it clarified that the policy should be drafted keeping in view the availability of natural resources...,” said an RSS functionary, asking not to be named.The clarification notwithstanding, the resolution makes a pointed reference to the Sangh’s concerns about what it calls “severe demographic changes” brought forth by its analysis of the religious data of Census 2011. “Vast differences in growth rates of different religious groups, infiltration and conversion resulting in religious imbalance of the population ratio ... may emerge as a threat to the unity, integrity and cultural identity of the country,” the resolution had said.Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, while speaking in Rampur on Sunday defended the policy and said population control is the need of the hour.SY Quraishi, former chief election commissioner and author of the book, The Population Myth: Islam, Family Planning and Politics in India, however, said 25 of the 29 states have already reached the ideal TFR of 2.1 without coercion, and any forced intervention will lead to a backlash from all communities. “The population of Muslims is not increasing any faster than that of Hindus. Muslims are increasingly adopting family planning measures faster than Hindus and 20 years ago if Hindus had one child and Muslims had 2.1 that difference has now come down to half a child,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-assam-s-population-control-policies-in-line-with-rss-demand-101626028058192.html
12-07-2021||India||Delayed monsoon hits sowing of kharif crops||Planting of kharif or summer-sown crops has been hit by patchy rains in many parts of the country as the southwest monsoon showed a seasonal deficit of more than 5% for the first time this year on July 10.Forecasters said the rain-bearing system should reactivate soon. But the total acreage of kharif crops stood at 49 million hectares, nearly 11% less than 55 million hectares sown during the corresponding period last year, data from the agriculture ministry showed.Monsoon for the season was 7% deficient between June 1 and July 10, latest available data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed.While rains were plentiful after their onset in the first week of June, the rain-bearing system entered a hiatus around June 19 driven by unfavourable weather patterns.The monsoon is critical for Asia’s third largest economy, as nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area doesn’t have irrigation access and half of the country’s population depends on a farm-derived income. The rains also replenish more than 100 nationally important reservoirs, critical for drinking water, power supply and irrigation.Millions of farmers depend on the rains to sow a range of summer crops, such as rice, oilseeds, pulses, millets, sugarcane, and cotton. Driven by robust showers during the 2020 kharif season, sowing of kharif crops had picked up sharply, exceeding normal levels in June 2020.As on July 10, 2021, the area under rice, a key driver of farm incomes, stands at 11 million hectares compared to a normal area of 11.6 million hectares during the corresponding period. Acreage of total coarse cereals, which includes millets such as jowar, has been estimated to be 7.3 million hectares so far compared to a normal of 8.7 million hectares, the ministry’s data showed.On June 25, total sown area was 21% lower compared to the area cultivated in the same period a year ago.The rains turned deficient from June 21, IMD data shows. The week ending June 30, rainfall for the whole country was 30.2% below the “long-period average”, which is considered the normal level.The IMD has forecast normal rainfall for July, saying that the monsoon should pick up by mid-July. “Monthly rainfall for July 2021 over the country as a whole is most likely to be normal (94 to 106 % of Long Period Average),” its latest bulletin for July rainfall stated.Meteorological subdivisions such as east Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, east Rajasthan, west Rajasthan, parts of Gujarat region, Saurashtra, Kutch, Vidarbha, Madhya Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, coastal Karnataka, and south interior Karnataka received lower than average precipitation, the data showed.“July rainfall is the most critical during the four-month kharif season. In areas where irrigation is not available, there will be impact in sowing..,” said Jeet Singh Sandhu, vice-chancellor of the SKN Agricultural University, Jaipur.Till July 9, the actual cumulative monsoon rainfall received in the country stood at 223 mm against a normal of 234.5 mm between June 1 and July 9.An agriculture ministry official said sowing was less than normal in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab due to erratic rain or little rain during the monsoon period so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delayed-monsoon-hits-sowing-of-kharif-crops-101626027938709.html
12-07-2021||India||Yogi unveils policy to curb population growth in Uttar Pradesh||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday unveiled a population policy which is aimed at stabilising the state’s population and reducing maternal and infant deaths.The Uttar Pradesh Population Policy 2021-2030, unveiled on the occasion of World Population Day, also aims at bringing down the gross fertility rate among women to 2.1 by 2026 and to 1.9 by 2030.Calling the rising population a “hurdle in development”, Adityanath said, “Our first job is to create awareness among the masses to control population growth.”“Population control is directly connected with awareness among the people and poverty,” he said.The announcement has come days after the a draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill was put up on the website of the UP State Law Commission inviting suggestions from the public by July 19.The policy proposes to make people with more than two children ineligible for government jobs, disentitle those already in service to promotions and exclude them from benefits of 77 schemes.Under the policy, people who have more than two children will be prohibited from contesting local body elections or receiving any kind of subsidy. It also proposes incentives such as tax rebates for those with up to two children.Unveiling the policy on Sunday, Adityanath said, “Across the world, concerns have been raised from time to time about increasing population being a hurdle in development. Discussions on it have been going on for the four decades.”“The countries and states which have made efforts in this direction have seen positive results. However, more efforts are needed,” he said, adding the Uttar Pradesh government was implementing this policy keeping in mind all sections of the society.Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous state with a population of around 220 million.The chief minister also linked the gap between the birth of two children to malnutrition and the child mortality rate. The health of a mother and her child have to be linked with this, the CM said.The policy also proposes to ensure better facilities for the elderly and better education, besides health and nutrition for adolescents between 11 and 19 years.The state’s health minister Jai Pratap Singh said, “It is estimated that our (India’s) population will overtake China by 2027. If we implement the new population policy, then it is estimated that the population of this state will stabilise by 2052.”The population policy and the draft bill for population control have become a political flashpoint in the state where elections are slated to be held early next year.Questioning the timing of unveiling the policy, Congress leader Priyanka Gupta said, “Why did the BJP get reminded of bringing this policy when barely six months are left for the election? The government must ensure that the policy does not have any adverse impact on the poor. Till now, no awareness programme has run... they (BJP government) came up with this only to divert the attention of the people from the serious issue of unemployment. It wants to send the public a message that it is the population which is responsible for unemployment, and not the government.”Hitting out at the BJP government over its draft population control bill, Samajwadi Party MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq asked where will India get manpower in case of war if people are not allowed to procreate. “As far as Yogi (Adityanath), PM (Narendra) Modi and (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat are concerned, do not have children... This (draft population control bill) will prove to be a loss-making deal,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-unveils-policy-to-curb-population-growth-in-up-101626027938020.html
12-07-2021||India||Allies may be key for BJP in V-P and presidential polls||The upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, the forthcoming Rajya Sabha biennial polls, and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s equations with its allies and other parties will be crucial for the party’s performance in the presidential and vice-presidential elections scheduled to be held next year, according to people aware of the developments.As on date, the BJP doesn’t have the required majority to push its presidential candidate alone. The ruling party has 474,102 votes of the total 1,098,903 in the presidential electoral college. The halfway mark is 549,452 votes.The President is elected by votes of MPs and MLAs in accordance with the system of proportional representation where each vote is given weightage proportionate to the population represented by the lawmaker. An MLA of Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state, carries the highest weightage of 208. The value of an MP’s vote is 708.The BJP faces two big elections in UP and Punjab before the presidential election is declared in July next year. In the UP assembly, it currently holds 305 seats, which translate to 63,440 votes in the electoral college. In Punjab, on the other hand, the BJP has just two MLAs.Apart from a good performance in these two elections, the other factor that can help the BJP improve its standing in the presidential race would be the forthcoming Rajya Sabha biennial polls.Between now and June 2022, 41 Rajya Sabha seats, including six nominated ones, would see elections. These seats are distributed over 13 states, including Assam, Tripura, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh.Any gains made by the BJP in these polls will further improve its chances in the presidential and vice-presidential polls.The party is focusing on retaining Uttar Pradesh as the outcome in the state can have a major impact on its strength in the Upper House. “Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur have limited impact by way of their respective House strength, and in Punjab, the party is not expecting to do well owing to the mood on the ground about the farm legislation. That leaves only UP to focus on,” said a BJP member who asked not to be named.In the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP is the single largest party, it is still short of majority that would reduce the party’s dependence on allies and friendly parties for passage of key and controversial bills and for eliciting support for its candidates for the presidential and vice-presidential elections. In the VP poll, only parliamentarians are entitled to a vote.Nominated members are barred from participating in the presidential poll as they are selected by the President, but in the past seven years, many nominated MPs have given up their independent status and joined the ruling BJP, making them eligible for voting in the presidential elections.As on date, the BJP has 94 members in the Upper House of Parliament and is hopeful of bagging more after the biennial elections are held in 2022, though it appears unlikely that the party will reach the halfway mark of 123.It requires National Democratic Alliance partners as well as supporting parties such as AIADMK, Naveen Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal, Jagan Mohan Reddy’s ruling YSR Congress Party and K Chandrasekhar Rao’s Telangana Rashtra Samithi.The party has also begun working on its ties with its allies. Parties such as the Janata Dal (United), Republican Party of India, Apna Dal, Lok Janshakti Party have found a place in the Union council of ministers in an attempt to strengthen ties and address their concerns of not being given their due. The party has also made a concerted effort to smoothen ties with parties that are not NDA allies but are considered friendly parties such the YSRCP, AIADMK, BJD and TRS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allies-may-be-key-for-bjp-in-v-p-and-presidential-polls-101626027638068.html
12-07-2021||India||Twitter appoints grievance officer||Twitter has appointed a resident grievance officer, days after designating a chief compliance officer, as it also released its first transparency report with regard to the new IT rules on Sunday, a day when new minister for electronics and information technology Ashwini Vaishnaw held a review meeting to discuss the social media and intermediary guidelines.The new guidelines, which were rolled out in February and that demanded extra due diligence from social media intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter, have been at the centre of a debate recently. The rules also brought digital news media outlets, including websites of traditional news media platforms, and over-the-top content providers such as Netflix and Amazon, under the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.“Reviewed the implementation and compliance of Information Technology Rules, 2021 along with my colleague Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar Ji. These guidelines are empowering and protecting users and will ensure a safer and responsible social media ecosystem in India,” Vaishnaw posted on Koo, the domestic alternative to Twitter. Chandrashekar is minister of state for MeitY.The new minister was briefed about the status of the compliance of each firm, an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The move to bring in the new rules saw pushback from many stakeholders, with eight different legal challenges being lodged in various high courts. Though some intermediaries complied with the guidelines, the government has been locked in an escalating conflict with Twitter.The US social media company’s website has listed Vinay Prakash as the new grievance officer, providing contact details and procedure for users to report potential violations of its rules and terms.Twitter previously appointed Dharmendra Chatur as its interim grievance officer for India after the new IT rules came into force. However, Chatur stepped down within weeks of taking over. California-based Jeremy Kessel was named as India’s grievance redressal officer, on the platform’s website – although the appointment did not meet the requirements of IT rules that mandate key officers – grievance officer, chief compliance officer and nodal officer – to be resident in India.Twitter’s website on Sunday showed Vinay Prakash as the resident grievance officer (RGO). Users can contact him using an email ID listed on the page. “Twitter can be contacted in India at the following address: 4th Floor, The Estate, 121 Dickenson Road, Bangalore 560 042,” the page said.Prakash’s name appears along with Kessel, who is the Global Legal Policy Director, and is based in the US. Twitter did not share additional details of the new resident grievance officer.The company previously informed the Delhi high court that it made new interim appointments and sought eight weeks to make permanent ones.A ministry official said Vaishnaw was apprised on the status of compliance of each social media firm, as significant social media intermediaries, which have five million users or above, have to appoint a grievance redressal officer, a nodal contact person and a compliance officer. While most of the prominent social media firms such as Google, WhatsApp and Facebook have made the key appointment, whether or not Twitter is fully compliant is unclear. The official declined to comment on the status of Twitter’s compliance with the new guidelines. “The issue of Twitter was discussed, as was every other social media firm,” the official said, asking not to be named.The social media company also published its first grievance redressal report, saying that it actioned 133 posts for reasons ranging from harassment to privacy infringement, and suspended over 18,000 accounts for “child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-appoints-grievance-officer-101626026918050.html
12-07-2021||India||India pulls its staff out of Kandahar for now||India evacuated about 50 officials and security personnel from Kandahar in an air force aircraft following intense clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters who seized key areas near the city in southern Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.The evacuation was done on Saturday, just four days after India said there were no imminent plans to close its mission in Kabul and consulates in the cities of Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif. However, officials previously said India is closely tracking the deteriorating security situation across Afghanistan and all steps would be taken to ensure that Indian officials and nationals were not put in harm’s way.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “The consulate general of India in Kandahar has not been closed. However, due to the intense fighting near Kandahar city, India-based personnel have been brought back for the time being.” He didn’t give details of the evacuation.“India is closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan. The safety and security of our personnel is paramount,” Bagchi said.He described the evacuation as a “purely temporary measure until the situation stabilises”, and said the consulate “continues to operate through our local staff members”.Arrangements are being made to ensure continued delivery of visa and consular services through the Indian embassy in Kabul. “As an important partner of Afghanistan’s, India remains committed to a peaceful, sovereign and democratic Afghanistan,” Bagchi said.Among those flown out to New Delhi were diplomats, support staff and guards from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. They added that a very limited number of officials remained at the consulate.The presence of hundreds of terrorists from Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand provinces is believed to have been a factor in India’s decision to pull out officials and security personnel from the city.According to a recent estimate by Afghan security agencies, more than 7,000 LeT fighters are believed to be fighting alongside the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.Kandahar city and the areas around it have witnessed a spike in fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces since last week, with reports saying the militants entered the city on Friday after capturing key districts surrounding it.The strategic district of Panjwai fell to the Taliban last weekend, just days after US forces abandoned the Bagram airbase near Kabul.Taliban fighters seized houses in Kandahar city’s seventh police district on Friday, triggering fierce clashes that continued till Saturday. The Afghan military said about 70 Taliban fighters were killed in fighting in the seventh police district and nearby Dand district.About 2,000 families from the seventh police district were displaced and forced to take refuge in other parts of the city.Kandahar, the second largest city in Afghanistan and the capital of the province of the same name, has for long been of strategic and commercial importance. It served as headquarters of the Taliban from the mid-1990s till 2001, when the group was ousted from power by the US invasion.New Delhi has been working on plans to ensure the safety of diplomats and some 3,000 Indian nationals in Afghanistan in view of what officials have described as a “fluid and dynamic” situation because of the fierce fighting across the country. India is also keeping a close eye on steps being taken by key countries such as the US for the safety of diplomats as it weighs its options.The Indian side also doesn’t want to take any steps that will be perceived as abandoning the Afghan government or ceding space to Pakistan-backed elements.In April last year, India shuttered its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad, ostensibly because of the spread of Covid-19, though some reports suggested security was a factor in the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pulls-its-staff-out-of-kandahar-for-now-101626026858185.html
12-07-2021||India||Delhi: Monsoon late by another 24 hours, says IMD||Another day went by without monsoon rain in Delhi.Monsoon forecast by the India Meteorological Department was off the mark for the fourth time this season on Sunday as the southwest monsoon did not arrive in the national capital.On Saturday, IMD’s daily bulletin said monsoon rain will take “another 24 hours” to reach the Capital. The bulletin repeated this on Sunday.This is the second most delayed monsoon onset in Delhi since IMD began documenting the arrival dates in 1920. The only time that the arrival of the monsoon was later than this was on July 19, 2002. The usual onset date for Delhi is June 29.“This century’s most delayed monsoon arrival in Delhi was in 2002 when it arrived on July 19. The monsoon has breached the July 9 mark, which has made it the second most delayed in this century,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD student at the University of Reading in England. He added that the 2002 record is unlikely to be broken.An initial rapid advance of monsoon across India last month raised hopes of a Delhi onset by June 15. That would have been the earliest that monsoon showers hit the city since recordings began, weather scientists said.Instead, unfavourable weather conditions and an unusual “break” spell slowed the progression, prompting the weather department to shift the forecast to a June 29 arrival, and when that didn’t happen, a July 10 arrival. IMD officials said on Sunday that easterly winds are blowing into the national capital, increasing humidity levels and creating “favourable conditions” for the onset, but it is waiting for the city to record a considerable spell of rainfall for at least 24 hours to declare the arrival.“While easterly winds did set in over Delhi, clouds did not form until Sunday. Easterly winds bring moist air, but for clouds to form air must rise, which didn’t happen. Now it seems the monsoon is likely to make an onset on Monday over Delhi,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at national weather forecasting centre, IMD.“As per the standard operating procedure, monsoon onset is declared based on rainfall reported during the last 24 hours, ending at 8.30 hours IST (Indian standard time) of the day. Hence, though it is forecasted to rain today (Sunday), we may be able to declare monsoon arrival officially by Monday,” said a senior IMD official, who asked not to be named.On Sunday, some parts of the city received sporadic rainfall. The forecast said that gusty winds and light rain were expected over Delhi-NCR on Sunday night and Monday morning, which means monsoon arrival may be officially declared on Monday, IMD scientists said.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, said that the monsoon trough is on the south of Delhi, which is causing heavy rain in parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring areas.“In Delhi, all the conditions are favourable for the onset of the monsoon — we have easterly winds, humidity is high and the temperatures are also decreasing — but we are only waiting for rain. If it rains on Sunday night and through Monday, then we can declare monsoon onset by Monday evening,” said Palawat. He added that Delhi may receive patchy rainfall until Wednesday.The maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, considered representative for the city, was 39°C on Sunday, three degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 28.8°C, a notch above normal. Humidity levels hovered around 70%.IMD scientists said rainfall has begun in central and peninsular India but the advance of the monsoon has been slow.The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) — the northernmost point until which the weather system has progressed — is roughly on the same position since June 19.On Sunday, NLM continued to pass through Barmer (Rajasthan), Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Dholpur (Rajasthan), Aligarh (Uttar Pradesh), Meerut (Uttar Pradesh), Ambala (Haryana) and Amritsar (Punjab).This sluggish pace is likely to result in deficient monsoon rain in the month of July despite heavy showers expected over the next two weeks. Until Sunday, there was an overall 8% deficiency in rain in the country, with 23% shortfall in northwest India, 6% in east and north-east India, and 9% in central India. Only in the southern peninsula was there a surplus of rainfall of 7%, according to IMD data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-late-by-another-24-hours-says-imd-101626026798100.html

12-07-2021||Today's||In India, one hundred years of plenitude||It is the first year of the third decade of the 21st century of the Common Era. And we should be at the midpoint of the decadal census. We are not, and there will be a price to pay, for indispensable data which will be denied to analysts and planners in every sector and industry. We may rue what we miss, but censuses offer learning and insight, even decades after they were concluded.With that spirit, our mind’s eye takes us back exactly a century. To 1921.1921 was a remarkably interesting year, all around the world. Sahir Ludhianvi was born that year. As was Satyajit Ray. And then there was the dour figure of Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao, who dismantled decades of economic consensus and triggered liberalisation. The world was rather busy as well. Adolf Hitler became leader of the German Nazi Party. The United Kingdom morphed into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And Coco Chanel launched Chanel No 5, a fragrance which continues to have cachet in the world of fragrances.Here, in India, we had our fifth consecutive decadal census. The second decade of the 20th century cost our population dearly, taking away millions of people in their prime, first on account of World War I and then, much more grievously, the Spanish Flu of 1918. It is easy to imagine the sombre mood of enumerators as they fanned out across the great landmass of British India, from Sindh and the restive Khyber province in the far west to the dense forests of Burma on the eastern frontier.It must have taken the next half-a-decade before all the painfully-gathered and meticulously tallied population numbers produced the census tables. The results were sobering. India’s population of 252 million in 1901 had shrunk over the decade by a million, to just over 251 million. But the devil was in the detail.4United Provinces (UP), rechristened post-Independence to Uttar Pradesh, suffered grievously. Its population of 46 million at the beginning of the century, had been reduced by almost 1.5 million, or by 3%. Put another way, UP had lost twice as many people to the decade as the entire country had. Among the large states, Rajasthan, or Rajputana as the province was then known, suffered the worst, losing over 6% of its population.In contrast, medium-sized Assam was remarkably fecund, recording a solid 14% bounce. Tiny Tripura was even more productive, increasing its small population by almost a fifth during the period.The gut punch UP took in the second decade doesn’t really tell the whole story. The state had already seen a decline in the previous decade too, losing about 1.4% of its 1901 population by 1911.Indeed, the actual scale of the tragedy is severely occluded in the decadal totals as the pandemic of 1918 is estimated to have claimed anywhere between 12 and 18 million people. Just the swing in population change, from +13.7 million between 1901 and 1911 to -0.8 million, a swing of -14.4 million, is closer to quantifying the actual pain and personal tragedy which our forebears had to absorb. While we continue to grieve, rightly, for the pain inflicted by the Partition of 1947, the scale of the decadal decline of the second decade is a tragedy unparalleled in our recent history.The 1921 census also throws up other larger insights.One, UP saw immeasurable tragedy in the first 20 years of the last century. Whole families would have been decimated, entire generations wiped out, as wave-upon-wave of disease and pestilence scythed through the vast state. Elders, traumatised by losses they had witnessed, would have urged their surviving family members to reproduce copiously; after all, who knew what destiny might have in store for them? Low life expectancies, quite unsurprisingly, correlate with high reproductive rates. The collective consciousness is unable to shed its traumas, so these propensities persist generations after the hazards have passed. If Uttar Pradesh in 2021 is still the state with India’s highest reproductive and fertility rates, we must look back a century for the genesis of this reality.Two, population gains and losses do not offset one-for-one. Typically, the life lost is of an adult; the life added is an infant. Economically productive people drop out and new dependents arrive to add new strains to an already stretched national delivery pipeline.Three, as life expectancy lengthens, the incentive to breed diminishes. But this effect operates with a lag. During the interregnum, some communities will see growth spikes which will impose, often unsustainable, burden on all kinds of facilities, from maternity care, through neonatal care, leading into early, middle and higher education, then the employment marketplace and finally, senior and end-of-life care. We are already seeing these burdens rise all across India.Physicists talk about the ubiquitous echo of the Big Bang, over 13 billion years later. Populations are like that. The echoes of the last century’s teen years are still resonating through India circa 2021.Paritosh Joshi is a media professional with a keen interest in audience measurementThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-india-one-hundred-years-of-plenitude-101626101816346.html
12-07-2021||Today's||Let the market for data collection bloom; tap private sector capabilities||In recent weeks, some scholars, including respected voices such as Jean Dreze, have criticised the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)’s Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) for its alleged inadequate inclusion of poor households. In their view, the CPHS survey execution inadequately covers households who inhabit the outskirts of villages and since the poor reside there, the sample underrepresents the poor. We have explained elsewhere that this is not possible and so there is no case for underrepresentation of the poor.Nevertheless, to ensure that we do not err, and to dispel all doubts we have decided to investigate the matter and make corrections, if warranted, by April 2022.The issue has also led to a larger question, raised in an editorial in this newspaper — on whether the private sector has sufficient incentives to collect adequate data about the poor. We believe, and it is our experience, that there is a market for honest data on the poor like there is a market for the rest.Also Read | Unemployment rate falls as Covid-19 curbs easeAll our current revenues from CPHS work come from the academic world where the interest in the poor is particularly high. Given that CPHS is funded entirely out of subscriptions to the database by researchers who want to study it, CMIE will be seriously hurting its own business if it ignores the poor. This business interest, at the very least, will drive CMIE to take academic critics seriously. And CMIE cannot ignore the non-academic markets either.As poverty reduces, the investment required to find the poor in adequate numbers in a sample survey increases. The sample needs to get larger and the execution needs to go deeper. In this respect, it helps that the CPHS sample is at least 60% higher than the official sample. Economic shocks don’t announce their arrival. Only a continuous survey can measure their impact when they happen. It helps that CPHS is a continuous survey. The government has been unable to expand its sample size for decades. And by design, it conducts its surveys only in “normal” years.It is not necessary anymore to assume that only the government can provide data on unemployment, consumption expenditure or even poverty and inequality. CMIE demonstrates that at least capabilities and investments are not a problem. Markets are solving these problems that the government seems unable to.But we need to retain the public goods nature of some data. An estimate of the unemployment rate of India, for example, cannot be the private property of CMIE. It just does not seem right. CMIE therefore makes this available freely as a public good with no restrictions, no fees or strings attached, except the courtesy of an acknowledgement of the source. CMIE continues to remain responsible for the underlying data and the computations.If the private sector produces public goods, what is the role of the government? There is lots of data to be collected yet, and the government cannot do it all. It is best for the government to acknowledge available capabilities in the private sector and divide the job of data collection with it. If the privately produced data is of acceptable quality, then the government can use it.Also Read | The key to getting all eligible Indians vaccinatedIt would be an interesting world with competing estimates of unemployment, inflation or even GDP, for example. That would be better than a monopoly that is unable to produce useful timely data except to somehow satisfy the elementary needs of the International Monetary Fund’s SDDS.A public-private partnership, where the government issues tenders to invite private sector to collect data on its behalf, is a bad idea for all. It limits the potential of the Indian Statistical Service cadre. And, the private sector would not be able to innovate under such arrangements except in optimising operations for profit maximisation.But, society needs to tap into private sector innovations far beyond such profit maximisation. Let’s unshackle the statistical system from being a government monopoly and still retain the character of some data being public goods. Let that market for data collection bloom and the government, like others, can go shopping to buy some of the data it needs. There is no reason to assume market failure here.Mahesh Vyas is managing director and CEO, CMIEThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/let-the-market-for-data-collection-bloom-tap-private-sector-capabilities-101626071620322.html
12-07-2021||Today's||What India should do in Afghanistan||With the withdrawal, for justified security reasons, of home-based personnel from its Kandahar consulate, India’s footprint in Afghanistan has shrunk further. The Jalalabad and Herat consulates have not had Indian officials for over a year by now. All three are, thus, effectively non-functional because representational offices are not merely visa application collection centres. If the Taliban begin to threaten Mazar-e-Sharif, the consulate there too will have to operationally shut down.All this would be to Pakistan’s immense satisfaction. It actively lobbied Afghan authorities in 2002 against granting permission to India to open consulates in the country. Pakistan argued that the nature and potential of India-Afghan relations did not justify an extensive Indian presence. It asserted that Indian consulates would be utilised to foment problems in its territory. Pakistani well-wishers in the Afghan system supported its views. It took deft diplomatic handling to overcome the misgivings of some top Afghan leaders to get permission open the consulates.There is no doubt now that none of the four consulates can become functional till the uncertainties accompanying the withdrawal of United States (US) and NATO forces are resolved. The rapid Taliban military advance in north-eastern, and parts of western and northern Afghanistan, has taken most of the world by surprise.Also Read | From 1996 to 2021: A personal chronicle of the Taliban in AfghanistanIt is even now unclear if the Taliban has abandoned the idea of participating in an interim government. If it does so, it would seek to dominate it and control its security component. The momentum of current military events though is making the possibility of an interim government slimmer. In any event, the Taliban will now be a most significant if not the decisive political factor in Afghanistan.At his recent joint press conference in Moscow with his Russian counterpart external affairs minister S Jaishankar remarked, “At the end of the day, who governs Afghanistan has a legitimacy aspect of it. I think that is something which cannot and should not be ignored”. Earlier, he had stressed the need for a “double peace”— in and around Afghanistan. These ideas are fine in principle but are ineffectual, for India can hardly influence the unfolding situation in Afghanistan in any meaningful and sustained way.Despite all the recent US talk of not accepting a government formed by force in Afghanistan, the international community will not revert to its 1990s anti-Taliban approaches. The Taliban is also playing the diplomatic game skilfully. Recently, a Taliban spokesperson assured China that Uighur militants will not be allowed space in Afghanistan. Iran and Russia have been in close contact with the Taliban for many years, and would have undoubtedly worked out arrangements to ensure their real security interests in the region remain secure. Thus, even while pressing the Taliban against repeating the horrors of 1990s Islamic Emirate, many important countries are unlikely to deny it legitimacy.In sum, India will have to deal openly with the Taliban in the near future. It has avoided doing so till now, though there are recent reports of out-of-sight contacts. Instead of being ahead of the diplomatic curve in respect of the Afghan situation, India has been well behind it. It decided to put its eggs in the Hamid Karzai basket earlier and later, more surprisingly, in that of the mercurial Ashraf Ghani. For quite some time, it even allowed its contacts built over years in Kabul to get interrupted but later worked to undo the damage.Ironically, while Karzai and Ghani were in contact with the Taliban for years, India decided to shun the group. Taliban’s close relations with Pakistan were undoubtedly an inhibiting factor, even though the group was signalling for many years that India should not consider it as a Pakistani puppet. In their meetings with Indians, Taliban representatives emphasised that it had not sought to harm Indian projects in Afghanistan. It had also avoided taking strident positions on sensitive Indian concerns.Some Taliban elements, at Pakistan’s behest in all likelihood, indulged in violence against Indian diplomatic entities. While these actions need redressal and justice for lives lost, did not diplomacy demand, at least since early 2017, that the door be not kept shut in the Taliban face? Great powers maintain a persistent focus on their interests and adopt flexible approaches.There is little doubt that Pakistan is asking the Taliban to keep India at arm’s length. This can also be inferred from Pakistan national security adviser Moeed Yusuf’s comment, during a recent TV show, that India “kept having the Taliban killed daily and kept giving funds for operations against them”. So, Yusuf asserted, for India to seek an opening with the group was a matter of shame instead of a strategic move. This is, of course, so much balderdash. Pakistan will now assiduously work for the reduction of the Indian presence in Afghanistan and, as part of this process, seek to ensure that the Indian consulates are denied functionality, if not closed, by any Taliban-dominated government.Indian security interests demand not the public repetition of pious sentiment and holding to policy illusions but adapting to the evolving Afghan situation. India needs to work on the Taliban so that the group does not look at it through the prism of its relations with Pakistan. This is doable without weakening current Delhi-Kabul ties or compromising on principles on gender issues and minorities.Vivek Katju is a retired diplomat who has served as India’s ambassador to AfghanistanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/what-india-should-do-in-afghanistan-101626070360433.html
12-07-2021||Today's||From 1996 to 2021: A personal chronicle of the Taliban in Afghanistan||My first trip to Afghanistan was in September 1996, a few days after the Taliban stormed into the Presidential Palace in Kabul and established their hold over the country. Thousands of Talibs had driven into the capital city and strung the pro-Soviet President Najibullah from an electric pole. It was also the first time I saw automatic weapons being decorated with roses.Sensing the advent of the Taliban, the staff at the Indian embassy had upped and left. Twenty-five years later, India has flown out its diplomats and security personnel from Kandahar and handed over the consulate to local staff. The trip in 1996 remains one of my most claustrophobic assignments. On the very top of the suitcase lay a burqa and other long-sleeved garments that are a must in Taliban territory. Being an Indian, and more importantly, being a woman were huge disadvantages and the suffocation was not just a physical one. Also Read | Afghan forces repel Taliban assault on provincial capital, says governorThe Taliban had come a long way from the madrasas in Pakistan, from where they were first recruited. The armed gunmen were accustomed only to mosques and battlefields and walked the silk carpets of the palace and the ministries with trepidation. Arabic translations of the United Nations charter were available but the Taliban had neither the time nor the inclination for diplomatic nuances and international political norms. They had their own code of governance and soon got down to the task of implementing it.The press was soon to get a taste of the Taliban’s style of functioning. Invited to witness what they called a “bottle smashing ceremony”, we gawked as a tank rolled its blades into a heap of brandy and beer bottles. There were other ways of banning liquor but the Taliban did it their way. They made their point forcefully — which is the way they always do. Just like they did to the Bamiyan statues — strapped them with explosives and blew them up.India – and the world – is once again watching the strides the Taliban is making to take control of a war-ravaged country. The terror organisation, which claims to have captured 85% of Afghan territory, is racing through provinces, brandishing weapons and fighting pitched battles along the way. Also Watch | Taliban forces India to empty Kandahar consulate; Biden’s US abandoning allies?In 1996, the Afghans had both fear and hope. There was hope that, once in power, after defeating the Northern Alliance, the Taliban would get down to the business of governing. What ensued was a reign of terror — women were banned from working and girls forbidden from attending school. Men were forced to grow beards and many who went against the edicts, were stoned to death or hanged in public. The Taliban continued the way they had begun and now, with the United States (US) troops withdrawing after two decades of occupation, there is no reason to believe that the warriors will be any different. They are wedded to violence and know no other way. Unsurprisingly, I got a taste of their attitude to women when asked to leave the roundtable around which I was sitting with other journalists waiting for a press conference to begin. A newly appointed minister was to address us but he would not do so until the women reporters got up and stood at the far end of the room and “no questions please...women can’t look men in the eye”, we were told. This, I must confess, was mild compared to what was yet to come and it is here that the story starts to get dangerous.Once outside, I decided to head for Panjshir where the Taliban were staving off an attack from the just-defeated Northern Alliance. Out there, in the battlefield, the Taliban were talking through the barrels of their guns and dodging splinters which poured like metallic rain.Here, in the midst of the battleground, they didn’t have a problem looking me in the eye or talking to me. Except for one Taliban soldier who walked away when he learnt that my photographer colleague accompanying me was neither my husband nor my brother. “You are not supposed to be out with strange men,” my translator told me, beginning to get nervous.“Have you heard about Kashmir?” I asked out of sheer curiosity and was not just surprised but taken aback with what I was told: “Heard about Kashmir! I’ve been there and back,” said one and then another. So many of them had added to the list of “foreign mercenaries”, a noting that had begun appearing in army and Intelligence Bureau files since 1994 when “guest militants” had first been welcomed into the Valley.“I trained and worked with Maulana Masood Azhar and Nasrullah Langriyal,” one of them said. Happy to hear that I was a frequent visitor to Kashmir — where he said he would return for the jihad once their hold over Afghanistan was complete— he wanted me to request the Indian government to release the two he described as “Islamic preachers”.Masood Azhar is well known. Arrested in the Valley in February 1994, he was released in Kandahar in exchange for passengers aboard the hijacked IC-814 flight. Langriyal, a senior member of the Harkat-ul-Jehad-e-Islami, was lodged in an Indian jail and was involved in various acts of terror in which he killed at least nine BSF men.I had laughed then, on hearing the young Taliban soldier’s request. It is hitting me now. Masood Azhar and Langriyal were both trained in camps in Afghanistan. They are well known to the Taliban. The cauldron, in fact, had been brewing for years. Omar Sheikh, another militant who was released in Kandahar, is supposed to have wired $10,00,000 to Mohammed Atta, one of the suspected hijackers who crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center.I remember how the young Taliban soldier had even offered to take me to the training camps in Kosht.As reports now come in of an unholy alliance between the Taliban, the Jaish and the Lashkar-e-Mohammad, India is assessing the impact it will have on its internal security, particularly in Kashmir which underwent sweeping changes in August 2019. Unlike in 1996, when India — like most of the world (barring United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Qatar) — refused to recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan, it has now opened some communication channels with the gun-wielding group with the help of Qatar. But with the Taliban, one thing can be certain: there is neither sincerity nor certainty when it comes to any deal, not even when it is signed in black and white. The US learnt that the hard way, after trying to negotiate with them and even trying to draw a distinction between “good Taliban and bad Taliban”.As India sent a special flight to evacuate its diplomats posted in Kandahar, it can be sure, that it will have to keep its guard up. The Taliban, simply put, is bad news.
