AU PRO Jaya Kapoor maintained that pension process of Prof RR Tewari had got delayed as he had not yet returned some books and other items and owing to which the ‘No Dues’ certificate had not been issued by the department concerned. Professor Tewari, who retired on June 30, 2021 after over 39 years of service, claimed he was being harassed by the university administration.“I have even written to the varsity to deduct the amount of the 30 odd books that they claim were issued to me from my pension but nothing has been done till date,” he said.Prof Tewari has written to the VC Prof Sangita Srivastava, registrar Prof NK Shukla and head of department of electronics and communication Prof RS Yadav on the issue as well. In his letter Prof Tewari claimed that the committee set up by the department to look in to his case was harassing him and was not even ready to receive the items of the department that he wanted to handover to the university. He claimed that he had returned 81 additional items to the varsity. Usually, all pension related work of a retiring teacher or employee is completed in the last three months of their service period itself. The pension book should be handed over to the employee so that the pension starts immediately after his retirement.Professor Tewari was appointed at AU on January 10, 1982 and retired on June 30, 2021 said that he was greatly disturbed by the delay in his pension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/former-vc-accuses-allahabad-university-of-delaying-pension-varsity-says-return-books-first-101626632960653.html

Officials said on Sunday that about 6,800 litres per minute (LPM) oxygen has been arranged for 800 intensive care unit (ICU) beds available in the six government health care facilities in the district. GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, said that the medical oxygen plants have been set up on the premises of four government hospitals and two block-level health centres in the district. “The 800 ICU beds can be converted into paediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Besides, we are also making efforts to provide oxygen concentrators in the rural areas, with more oxygen cylinders. The health department has been asked to ramp up bottling facilities for these cylinders and conduct a regular oxygen audit of the hospitals in the district,” he said. The DM further said that keeping the safety and well-being of children in mind, the district administration is planning to create a paediatric task force for effective treatment of infected children in different government and private hospitals in the district. “We have also decided to develop a system based on technology in the integrated Covid-19 control room in Sector 59, which can keep a close tab on oxygen supplies on a real-time basis and the audit of its usage,” he said. The six health centres with the oxygen facility are: Covid-19 hospital in Sector 39, Child PGI in Sector 30, ESIC hospital in Sector 34, Government Institute of Medical Sciences in Greater Noida, community health centre in Bisrakh and primary health centre in Dadri. Meanwhile, GB Nagar chief medical officer, Dr Sunil Sharma, said that the health department has decided to ask all the private hospitals in the district to develop exclusive PICU wards in their facilities. “Though there is no dearth of PICU beds at government facilities, we’ll rope in private hospitals to minimise the crisis. The private hospitals will be asked to create at least 10 PICU beds on their premises. It will definitely reduce pressure on government health centres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/anticipating-third-wave-gb-nagar-arranges-6-800-litres-minute-oxygen-for-800-icu-beds-101626632360759.html
18-07-2021||Noida||Six months on, over 6k Covid warriors yet to take first jab in GB Nagar||After the statewide vaccination drive for Covid warriors began in January, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration identified over 51,000 beneficiaries, including 29,630 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 21,432 frontline workers (FLWs), for inoculation in the first phase. However, even after six months, while over 6,000 of them have yet not taken their first shot, more than 16,000 beneficiaries have not taken their second vaccine doses yet, says data available with the district administration. Of the 29,630 HCWs who registered for the inaugural phase of vaccination in January this year, 3,592 of them have not taken the first jab. Not only that, among the 26,038 HCWs who have at least taken the first shot, 11,578 of them have not turned up to take the second jab, said officials. Dr Sunil Sharma, GB Nagar’s chief medical officer, said despite repeated appeals, many of the HCWs didn’t turn up for the vaccination. “The HCWs are doctors, nurses, paramedics, technical staff and sanitary workers. As per the survey of the district health department, it has been found that the maximum number of beneficiaries not turning up for the jabs drive are from the nursing category. Either they have shifted somewhere else after the lockdown curbs were relaxed or they have left the vocation. Now, we have started intimating all the hospitals in the district to provide the updated details of these absentees. Most of them were associated with private hospitals, medical colleges and nursing training schools,” said Sharma. Giving vaccination details of FLWs, the CMO said of the 21,432 beneficiaries registered for vaccination under the FLW category, 3,034 of them have not taken the first jab. “The FLWs include personnel from state and central police organisations, i.e. armed forces, home guards, prison staff and civil defence volunteers, including disaster management volunteers, municipal workers, revenue officers engaged in containment and surveillance activities. Among the 18,398 FLWs who have taken the first shot, 5,096 of them have not come for the second dose,” said officials. He further said only 31,359 beneficiaries have taken both doses of the vaccine so far, which is a little over 61% of the 51,062 registered Corona warriors. “The rate of taking the first dose was much higher as nearly 87% of them had taken their maiden jab. This dilly-dallying approach has really irked the health department officials,” he saidSuhas L Y, district magistrate of G B Nagar, said almost all the FLWs registered for vaccination have been inoculated. “Most of the absentees have either been transferred to other places or have taken the jabs outside the district. If any FLW in the district is found hesitating to take the shot, we’ll ask them to take it as soon as possible,” he said. Explaining the reason behind the low percentage of vaccination among HCWs, Ajit Kumar, the director (public relations) of Sharda hospital, said most of the HCWs were sceptical about the accuracy and efficacy of the vaccines during the initial phase of the inoculation drive. “Even doctors and paramedics were not very enthusiastic about taking the jabs. But, they seem to have changed their minds after the higher mortality rate observed during the second wave of Covid-19. Now the problem is that the government is not giving free vaccines to private hospitals and the HCWs of our hospital do not want to venture out at public places to get the jabs. As a result, they are paying to take vaccines in the hospitals now,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/six-months-on-over-6k-covid-warriors-yet-to-take-first-jab-in-gb-nagar-101626632301456.html

Riyasat and his associate, Javed, have been arrested; his nephew, Nadeem, is still absconding, the police said.Riyasat told the police that he loaned ₹25,000 to Shahzad on three to four occasions on interest, and that the victim was required to return a certain amount per day over a fixed period, to return the loan and pay the interest. Shahzad last borrowed ₹4,500, and was to return ₹100 daily for two months as part of the loan deal. It meant that apart from the principal amount ( ₹4,500), Shahjad wasto pay ₹1,500 as interest, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram. “Shahzad stopped paying the daily amount after 12 days. When Riyasat demanded his money back, Shahzad picked up a fight with him. To avenge his insult, Riyasat abducted Shahzad with the help of Nadeem and Javed, and took him to Baghpat in UP,” the DCP said.Police said on July 13, a missing person’s report was registered for Shahzad was filed at the Seemapuri police station by his family members. His family told the police that Shahzad left home on July 12, but did not return and his mobile phone was also not reachable. He worked as a house painter.When the police and Shahzad’s family members were looking for him, a headless and decomposed body was found in a field in Baghpat on July 16. The Seemapuri police learnt about it and took Shahzad’s family members to Baghpat, where they identified the body by its clothes and identification marks on the body. The head was missing, the DCP said.“We registered a case of kidnapping, murder and destruction of evidence under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 365, 302 and 201 at the Seemapuri police station and investigation was taken up,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.During preliminary investigation, the police team probed the role of Shahzad’s daughter-in-law and her family members, after learning that she had filed a rape case against him and his brother last year. However, no evidence was found against them. Then, the police came to know that Shahzad used to borrow money from Riyasat, who lived in the same neighbourhood. It was also established that Shahzad was last seen with Riyasat. When Riyasat was questioned, he confessed to the murder and revealed the role of Nadeem and Javed.“We arrested Riyasat and Javed on Saturday night. Riyasat disclosed that he lured Shahjad to Baghpat in his Esteem car in the name of providing him a contract to paint a house and also eat mangoes in a farm. Javed and Nadeem joined them on the way. They offered liquor to Shahzad, and when he was drunk, Riyasat and Nadeem took him to the field and killed him with a meat cleaver. They severed Shahzad’s head and threw it in a canal near Muradnagar while returning to Delhi,” DCP Sathiyasundaram said.Police said they are trying to find the missing body part, and arrest Nadeem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/52yearold-man-s-head-severed-body-dumped-in-field-in-tiff-over-loan-repayment-101626632181221.html

18-07-2021||Delhi||Vegetable prices go up on back of rains, fuel rates||With monsoon setting in across the country last week, and fuel prices on the up, the prices of meat, fruits and vegetables in the national capital have increased over the past seven days, a hike that traders said will soon reflect on the cost of more perishables in the coming days.The retail price of onions touched ₹50-60 per kg on Sunday, against an average of ₹40 a week ago, the price of potatoes went up from ₹25-30 per kg to ₹40 per kg, and price of raw chicken touched ₹240 a kilo in some parts of the city, against last week’s ₹200-220.Prices of fruits and vegetables usually increase as monsoon covers the country, because of transportation and storage hurdles. This year, however, the record prices of automotive fuels, led to a hike in the price of vegetables even before large parts of northern India started witnessing monsoon rains, said traders across agricultural product markets in Delhi.“Soon the price rise will start reflecting in food grains. Edible oil costs more than usual in any case. Any further increase will make things very difficult,” said Ankita Aggarwal, a resident of Delhi’s Indra Vihar neighbourhood.“The prices have increased in the wholesale markets such as Azadpur, Okhla and Ghazipur. So, as a result, retail prices have increased as well. Prices usually go up in the monsoons, but this year prices have witnessed significant increase very soon. They are likely to go further up in the coming days. Prices of most vegetables have gone up,” said Sandeep Gupta, a retail vendor of fruits and vegetables in south Delhi’s Mehrauli market.Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agricultural produce market, said: “There has been at least a 20% increase in transportation costs over the past week. It will obviously reflect in the wholesale and retail prices of fruits and vegetables. The central government should work towards reducing prices of diesel and petrol at the earliest.”Iqbal Qureshi, a poultry trader and vice-chairperson of the wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur, said there was a similar situation in the poultry market. “We are paying higher transport costs for live chicken because of the increase in prices of petrol and diesel. So, retail rates of chicken and eggs have gone up.”On Sunday, the cost of petrol in Delhi touched ₹101.84 a litre, and diesel went for ₹89.87.The unrelenting upward movement of fuel rates since May 4 has seen saw petrol crossing ₹100 mark in various cities, particularly those in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vegetable-prices-go-up-on-back-of-rains-fuel-rates-101626632120624.html

However, the government issued further relaxations, with restaurants, bars and clubs allowed to open for an additional hour, till 11pm.The order pertaining to the Mahamari Alert Surakshit Haryana stated that a night curfew will be in force from 11pm to 5am.As per the latest order, restaurants and bars, including those in malls and restaurants, are allowed to operate from 10am to 11pm with a 50% seating capacity. Earlier, these establishments were allowed to open only till 10pm. Home delivery from restaurants and fast food joints has also been permitted up to 11pm.However, owners of clubs and restaurants sought further extension in timings, as per the licence fees paid by them.Satya Sarathi Mohanty, the director of Waka Waka Club at Bristol Hotel on MG Road said that the government must extend the timing by two more hours, as a large number of clubs have already paid fees for the purpose. “The closing of operations by 10 or 11pm ensures that the patrons have to stop entertainment by 9.30pm. This is causing financial losses to club owners and visitors also don’t enjoy (the experience). Either the time should be extended or fees charged from us should be adjusted in the coming months,” said Mohanty. Clubhouses, restaurants and bars located at golf courses have been allowed to operate from 10 am to midnight, with 50% seating capacity. The members of golf courses must follow Covid-19 safety protocols and they must allow entry of players and visitors in a staggered manner, the order stated.Gyms have also been allowed to operate from 6am to 9pm at 50% of their strength to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour and social distancing.Apart from these directions, the order stated that relaxations announced over the past few weeks would remain in force.The government, last week, extended the cap on at weddings, funerals and cremations from 50 to 100. It also permitted weddings outside of homes and courts, while the number of people allowed to gather in open public spaces was also increased to 200. The order issued by the state chief secretary last week had also allowed the reopening of cinema halls, spas and swimming pools, with reasonable restrictions.“The deputy commissioners of districts concerned are directed to work out the modalities of implementing the above relaxations strictly,” said the order by Vardhan.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that all business establishments must follow the Covid-19 protocols and also follow the timings as stipulated in the lockdown order. “I would also appeal to all citizens to wear masks and follow social distancing. Everyone should also get vaccinated on priority,” said Garg.10 new cases reportedThe district health department of Gurugram on Sunday recorded 10 new Covid-19 cases and eight recoveries, according to the daily health bulletin.

The PPA with five of these plants -- Unchahar-1, Farakka, Dadri 1, Auriya gas, and Anta -- has already crossed its shelf life of 25 years. The Kahakgaon -I plant will attain its shelf life in August, while the PPA with the Dadri plant will expire in April next year,” said a discom official on the condition of anonymity. The move comes in the wake of the Central Electricity Regulatory Authority allowing BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) to exit PPAs with NTPC’s Dadri-1 power plant, which completed 25 years of service on November 30 last year.“The seven power stations are supplying expensive power, above ₹6 per unit, to the BSES discoms. These power plants supply around 830 megawatt (MW) of power to BSES,” said the official. When asked about how the two discoms - -BRPL and BYPL, which supply power to around 4.5 million consumers in Delhi--will meet the growing power demand of the city, the official said it will resort to renewable sources of energy. “Replacing the power supply we get from these plants with substantially cheaper green power, available at around ₹2.50 per unit, will help us save around ₹800 crore annually and ₹20,000 crore over a period of 25 years. There will be no power shortage in Delhi even if we give up on electricity from these plants,” said a second BSES official. This year, the highest peak power demand in the Capital touched 7,323 MW on July 2. The city’s all-time peak demand is 7,409 MW recorded on July 2, 2019. “It is true that the substantial difference in the prices of power will help in neutralising cost increase by absorbing the impact of inflation and other factors, including the cost of coal and gas, and will also ease the pressure on future tariff hikes,” a senior official in the power department said.Besides, the savings may also help in creating headroom for recovery of the past revenue gap (regulatory assets). Due to non-cost reflective tariffs, revenue gaps (regulatory assets) of the Delhi discoms have reached ₹51,646 crore as of March 31, 2020, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bses-plans-to-cut-off-power-purchase-from-6-plants-outside-capital-101626632064110.html

My daughter is unable to sleep and eat for the past week. I need protection for my daughter or the man needs to be arrested at the earliest,” she said in her complaint. A case under sections 294 (obscene acts), 323 (assault) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 8 of the Protection Of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered at the Shivaji Colony police station. In the other case, a 24-year-old man was arrested for trying to rape a seven-year-old girl in Kherki Majra village in the Rajendra Park area.

Last month, the Supreme Court directed the Haryana government and the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad to remove “all encroachments”, consisting of around 10,000 residential units, in the Aravalli forest area, saying “land grabbers cannot take refuge in the rule of law” and talk of “fairness”. On Friday, experts from the United Nations Human Rights Council called on India to halt the eviction of around 100,000 people, including 20,000 children, from Khori village in Faridabad, which began last Wednesday, and said “it is particularly important that residents be kept safe during the pandemic”.In response, the Permanent Mission of India to the Office of the United Nations issued a statement on Saturday, saying, “It is unfortunate that the special rapporteurs have chosen to issue a press release just two days after sending a joint communication to this Mission and not waiting for a response.”The police said that the demolition process remained peaceful. Around 2,000 personnel, including 500 women personnel, were deployed in Khori village on Sunday. The drive started around 10am and went on till 5pm, for which 17 earthmoving machines and five Poclain machines were used.Garima Mittal, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, said the demolition drive was recorded through drone cameras, with the date, time and location stamping on photos and videos done to ensure authenticity.The deputy commissioner of Faridabad, Yashpal Yadav, said, “We have started full-scale demolition and we are implementing the Supreme Court orders in letter and spirit. All structures will be demolished as per the orders and not just those that have been vacated. The drive is being conducted peacefully and we have not faced any challenge so far, except people not cooperating.”Meanwhile, social activists and residents alleged that situation has worsened in Khori village and that there has been no let-up in the demolitions even after the United Nations’ experts raised urged an immediate halt.“On Sunday, demolitions started from the Durga temple side, and the number of police deployed there is much higher than what we had seen until now. They have encircled Khori Gaon from all sides and are restricting movement in and out. Volunteers and residents from Khori who have been distributing food are now stuck in this police blockade. They are not being allowed to leave,” said Neelesh Kumar, a social activist with Basti Suraksha Manch.RehabilitationWith the demolition drive entering the fourth day on Sunday, over 470 people have registered for the rehabilitation scheme, officials of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad said on Sunday. The administration has arranged a temporary shelter for displaced residents of Khori village at Radha Swami Satsang Beas, near Surajkund. However, members of Mazdoor Awaas Sangharsh Samiti, an organisation working for the rehabilitation of residents of Khori village said that residents are not willing to stay at the temporary shelter.Mohammad Salim Khan, a member of Mazdoor Awas Sangharsh Samiti, whose house was demolished on Friday, said, “Of the thousands of houses demolished so far, not even 5% of the people have been given temporary shelter. People are being forced to go to the shelter home, whereas we want to collect our belongings from the debris. Even the registration for rehabilitation is being conducted without any ground survey.”The MCF on Sunday asked residents to collect their belongings from the demolished houses in Khori.Man booked for spreading false newsThe police booked a Khori resident on Saturday for spreading fake news about residents committing suicide. The suspect, identified as Mohammad Abrar, was booked under Section 505 (2) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code by the Surajkund police.The police said that Abrar concocted a story about a Khori resident killing her two daughters and committing suicide after their house was demolished, and posted it on social media platforms.OP Singh, the commissioner of police, warned residents against spreading fake news that may disturb the peace. “A probe in the matter is underway and an Investigating Officer (IO) has been appointed. We are investigating and action will be taken against everyone in accordance with the rules,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-resident-booked-for-spreading-fake-news-as-drive-restarts-on-sunday-101626632061985.html

Welcoming the former SAD leader and his associates on behalf of party supremo Arvind Kejriwal, Chadha said Bagga’s entry had made the AAP stronger in Ludhiana as well the state. Meanwhile, Cheema reiterated that some more senior leaders from SAD and Congress party, “who could relate with AAP’s vision of serving the people” were in talks with the party and are likely to switch sides in the coming days.Bagga said he was unconditionally embracing the AAP, as the rising prices of fuel, electricity and essential commodities were affecting the common man.‘Will not condemn SAD’Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the function, Bagga said he will not condemn the Akali leadership and party just because he has joined AAP. “Earlier, SAD was in alliance with the BJP and now it is in alliance with the BSP. There is no platform where I could serve the residents. So I have decided to bid adieu to Akali Dal and join the AAP,” said Bagga.It may be recalled that Bagga, who was aspiring for a SAD ticket from Ludhiana North constituency in the 2022 assembly elections, was left high and dry when the party reserved the seat for a BSP candidate after brokering an alliance. It is for the second time that Bagga has quit SAD. Earlier in 2017, he had resigned from the party and contested as an independent after SAD got into an alliance with BJP and reserved the seat that he had his eyes on, for a saffron party candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-expulsion-from-sad-bagga-joins-aap-101626631041093.html

Of them, a school principal and a data entry operator have been arrested. Further investigations are underway. More arrests will take place if we come across any other persons involved in the racket,” Kamrup superintendent of police Hitesh Chandra Roy said.

18-07-2021||Patna||Bihar: 5-yr-old swallows battery, saved by IGIMS docs||A five-year-old, who inadvertently ingested a nickel battery of the size of a one-rupee coin, was saved as doctors extricated the cell in the nick of time at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous institute on the pattern of AIIMS, here on Saturday. “The cell, charged after mixing with saliva, was transmitting current. It was embedded in the oesophagus for the last five days. It was corroding the oesophagus and eschar formations (crusty dead tissue that falls off from the mucosal surfaces) were already evident. If not removed, the cell would have perforated the oesophagus and slipped into the bronchus (lungs), which could have become fatal,” said Dr Vinit Kumar Thakur, additional professor and officiating head of the paediatric surgery department, IGIMS, who performed the procedure. The child, who hails from Ara town of Bhojpur district, is stable and recuperating at the institute, he added. “We just hope he doesn’t develop stenosis and stricture (abnormal narrowing of the oesophageal lumen),” said Dr Thakur. The procedure, lasting around 30 minutes, was done under general anaesthesia using the oesophagoscope, a type of endoscopy that doesn’t require incision as the flexible endoscope is inserted through the mouth into the oesophagus. The endoscope uses a charge-coupled device to display magnified images on a video screen. Dr Ramdhani Yadav, Dr Sandeep Rahul, both from paediatric surgery, and Dr Nidhi from the department of anesthesiology, assisted in the procedure. Gorak Nath, a milkman and the father of the child, does not have the faintest clue how his fourth child ingested the battery. “Some years back, my son was operated on for cleft lip and cleft palate. He may have ingested the battery when he went to defecate,” he said. “My son was writhing in abdominal pain since July 11. I took him to the sadar (district) hospital in Ara the same evening, but he did not show any relief the next day. I then consulted two private doctors in Ara who suggested chest X-rays and came to the conclusion that the child had ingested a coin. Without wasting much time, I got him to the IGIMS last Friday and the procedure was done the next day,” said Gorak Nath. “My child is doing better and is responding to hunger and thirst,” he added. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the procedure costs ₹5,000, whereas it could have cost around ₹25,000 in a private facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-5-yr-old-swallows-battery-saved-by-igims-docs-101626624020229.html

There is no confusion in the party and everybody is working together.”However, the meeting gave ample hints for a bigger role for Upendra Kushwaha, whose party Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) merged with the JD (U) in March this year. Kushwaha was later made a member of the state Legislative Council .That Kushwaha is being projected as the party president is apparent from CM Kumar’s lauding the former’s effort to make JD (U) the “number one” party. “Kushwaha’s dream of making JD (U) the number one party in the state is laudable. We will definitely achieve this,” Kumar said, while asking party office-bearers to emulate Kushwaha by going to the people. Joining the meeting from Delhi, party national president and Union minister RCP Singh clarified that he will continue to work as minister and party president diligently. “I became a minister on July 7. I will perform the role of a minister firmly along with working for the organization with the same zeal. But, if the party decides, I will definitely give this responsibility to a strong colleague,” said Singh, hinting at a possible change of guard in JD (U) in the near future.Targeting the Opposition, the CM said the JD (U) was never worried about votes. “Instead, we worked for everybody. What did they (Opposition) do for women, except making tall promises. When they got the opportunity, he (referring to Lalu Prasad) made his wife the CM,” he said.

18-07-2021||Other||BSP back to social engineering, Maya plays Dalit-Brahmin card||Lucknow: The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) plans to replay the ‘social engineering’ formula (Dalit- Brahmin alliance) to regain power in the 2022 assembly elections. BSP chief Mayawati has called upon the Brahmin community to support the BSP in the coming assembly elections. “After forming government, the BSP will take care of their ( Brahmins’) dignity and protect their interests as well,” she said. To win the support of the Brahmin community the BSP has decided to organize Brahmin conferences across the state. National general secretary of the BSP, Satish Chandra Mishra,, considered the Brahmin face of the BSP, will launch the Brahmin conference in Ayodhya on July 23. Riding on social engineering, the BSP had formed majority government in the 2007 assembly elections. Addressing a press conference, the BSP chief said with the support of the Brahmin community the BSP had formed government in the 2007 assembly elections. In the 2017 assembly elections, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) lured the Brahmin community with various promises and the community supported the BJP. The BJP formed government with the support of the Brahmins but instead of working for the welfare of the community, it committed atrocities on them. They were being harassed and exploited and were repenting their support to the BJP , she said. To woo the Brahmins before the coming assembly elections, the BJP was again playing various tricks to misguide them, she said. The Brahmins were now aware of the election stunts of the BJP and they would not fall in the trap set by the saffron brigade. They should know that the BSP was their well-wisher and should stand solidly behind it in the assembly elections, Mayawati said. Reminding the Brahmins of the loyalty of the Dalit community with the BSP, Mayawati said the BJP and other rival political parties used all the tricks in the books to wean away the Dalit community in the 2017 assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP organized ‘khichadi’ feast of their leaders with the members of the Dalit community, as well as a rath yatra to win the support of the Dalits during the 2017 assembly elections. The leaders of the Congress too visited Dalit households with various gifts. The rival political parties tried to win the support of the Dalits with money power, she said. The Dalit community did not fall in the trap, she said. They joined the ‘khichadi’ feast and other programmes organized by the rival parties but in the elections, they voted in support of the BSP. “I am proud of the Dalit community’s support, the Brahmins should also learn a lesson from them and support the BSP wholeheartedly in the 2022 assembly elections,” she said. Mayawati said the Brahmin community supported and tried the BJP for five years. How much would they test and canvass in support of a party that side lined them after the support in the elections? she asked. They should support the BSP for their security, dignity and progress, she said. The BSP chief said, despite defeat in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections, there had been no decline in the BSP vote percentage. The seats of the BSP had declined but its share in the vote was higher than the SP, she said. Expressing solidarity with the farmers, Mayawati said the BSP MPs would raise their voice in support of the farmers and demand withdrawal of the three farm laws in the mnsoon session of the Parliament commencing from Monday (July 19). The party MPs had been directed to raise public issues, including hike in the price of essential commodities, unemployment and slowdown in Covid vaccination, she said. BJP state unit spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said the BSP government in 2007-12 indulged in the policy of appeasement. The upper castes were sidelined and now when the elections were is knocking on the door, BSP chief Mayawati was wooing the Brahmins. The Brahmins were an intellectual community and knew that BJP worked for their welfare and dignity. In the 2022 assembly elections, the Brahmins would again support the BJP, he said. Samajwadi Party state unit spokesperson, bdul Hafiz Gandhi said the SP respected all communities and castes. Mayawati’s attack on the opposition showed her undeclared alliance with the BJP, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bsp-back-to-social-engineering-maya-plays-dalit-brahmin-card-101626623360202.html
18-07-2021||Other||In election year, BJP set to cash in on rural poll win||LUCKNOW: Undeterred by the opposition’s massive criticism about the conduct of panchayat polls, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to play up its first ever sweep of rural elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP) in the run up to the 2022 assembly polls. These wins, party strategists believed, had not only ended the domination of opposition parties, mainly the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, in rural UP but also helped demolish the ‘myth’ that farmers were unhappy with the BJP governments at the centre and the state, a party leader said. The party has decided to felicitate newly elected block development council (BDC) members and gram pradhans or village heads at 825 blocks at the local level between July 26 to 31 and after that it would felicitate district panchayat chairpersons and kshetra panchayat (block pramukhs) chairpersons in the state capital. The wins hailed by top party leadership would also be an integral part of the party’s election campaign and would be mentioned prominently in its meetings, BJP leaders said. The plan for felicitation of rural representatives, including gram pradhans or village heads, was shared by UP BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal before the party leadership at the virtual state working committee meeting on Friday. These newly elected members in rural UP would also be used to spread ‘vaccine awareness’ as well as to ensure that Covid protocol was followed. The party also intends to deploy health volunteers in rural UP. “In each of the nearly 56,000 villages and 12,,000 wards, two health volunteers including a woman, would be deployed. We intend to create ‘swasthya swayamsevaks’ (health volunteers) and these volunteers would be screened and tasked with their responsibilities before July 20,” Bansal said. A village-centric three-day special vaccination campaign would also be carried out from July 23, that would focus on drivers, rickshaw-pullers and vegetable vendors. “They may be working in urban areas, but all of them have a rural background,” a BJP leader said,, explaining that in the run up to 2022 UP polls the party’s rural focus would continue. “As you know,, 299 of the 403 assembly segments have a rural character and that’s why national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh has repeatedly been focusing on concentrating in rural areas,” a BJP leader said, adding it was for this reason that the recent sweep of rural UP was special for the party. “A special booth verification campaign, a drive to ensure that most villagers have access to free ration scheme of the government would also be undertaken,” a BJP leader said. The ruling BJP said candidates backed by the party won 67 of the 75 zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts and 648 of the 825 block pramukh or kshetra panchayat chairpersons’ posts. In 2015, when the Samajwadi Party government was in power, it had won 623 of the 816 seats for the block pramukh polls and 60 of the 74 zila panchayat chairpersons’ post. After SP, BSP had won the most seats in rural UP. That is the reason why the BJP leaders feel that the party’s domination in these rural polls was an important development. As to the criticism of misuse of official machinery and the fact that the party in power usually sweeps these indirect elections to the zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons’ posts, top ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government said a move to provide for direct elections was also under consideration. “It is under consideration,” deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said while targeting Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who had on Saturday visited a Samajwadi Party’s woman worker whose saree was pulled by some people, alleged to be BJP workers, in Pasgawa block of Lakhimpur Kheri. After her meeting, Priyanka demanded cancellation of polls in all such areas where violence was unleashed. The Samajwadi Party had played up the incident as ‘disrobing’ of democracy by the BJP. In January 2020, the then additional state election commissioner Ved Prakash Verma had written to the state government to consider the proposal of amending the clause in the 73rd Constitutional Amendment that provides for indirect elections to these zila panchayat chairpersons’ and block pramukh posts. HT is in possession of the letter written by Verma to principal secretary, Panchayati Raj favouring a proposal for direct elections to zila panchayat chairpersons and block pramukh polls. “That missive was sent in response to a centre’s query of December 30, 2019 to the state on the subject. The point is that only the parliament can carry out an amendment if direct elections are to be held for zila panchayat and block level chief’s posts. And that means it would have to be considered at the appropriate level,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-election-year-bjp-set-to-cash-in-on-rural-poll-win-101626623120211.html

During the second wave of Covid-19, Thakur appealed to people to perform Yagya to purify the environment to get rid of the Covid-19 virus.Thakur, who is spotted without a mask most of the time, said the virus will not attack her due to her vedic lifestyle, including reciting Hanuman Chalisa and performing yagya with cow dung cakes. However, Congress took a jab at her statement. MP Congress Committee spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “BJP has now emerged as a party of businessmen as they see profit and loss in everything. A party worker, who works on the field and helps an MLA in winning the election, now has to give money to take a picture with the same MLA. Such attitude is going to be proved cost dearer for these leaders in the upcoming election.” However, BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Minister Usha Thakur was saying it in a casual mood. People were laughing there. A politician also has a right to crack a joke.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mp-tourism-minister-asks-party-workers-to-pay-rs-100-for-selfie-101626622160746.html

They also broke police barricades on their way to the house. The issue pertains to suspension of the sarpanch, thrice, after he reportedly refused to allow panchayat land to be taken by private players. The protesters also burnt the effigy of the minister and alleged that democratic values were being killed.In a press note, the AAP alleged that sarpanch Gurmail Singh had moved the Punjab and Haryana high court to save 23 acre of village land, which was being given to private players. AAP’s Sangrur unit district chief Davinder Singh Bandesha and youth leader Narinder Kaur Bharaj said, “The party will intensify the agitation against the Congress government and the party will face consequences of its arrogance in next year’s assembly elections.” The minister has previously rubbished all these allegations, claiming that the sarpanch had only four members supporting him and seven against him in village panchayat on all important resolutions. In another protest, scores of government employees hailing from Sangrur, Barnala and Malerkotla districts held a protest opposite the PWD Rest House to oppose the Sixth Pay Commission report and privatisation.

The complaint in this regard was registered with the Chhattisgarh DGP and others on July 12 2021, which will be probed by senior IPS officer Ashok Juneja.Another probe was ordered over the complaint of activist Manjit Kaur Bal, in which it was alleged that the IPS officer had helped one criminal Kamalkant Tiwari by forging documents and also gave him protection. The complaint in this regard was also filed with the DGP on July 12 and will be investigated by Inspector General of Police, Raipur, Anand Chhabra, as per the issued order."My request is to arrest Kamalkant Tiwari, who is the project officer in panchayat office, Durg.

Investigators have claimed to have discovered documents related to movable and immovable assets worth over ₹10 crore during the raids.An ACB statement on July 3 said the documents seized during searches at Singh’s premises established that he allegedly amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and indulged in a “massive exchange of money”.“Singh also allegedly tried to commit money laundering by investing in shell companies,” the statement said.Singh, a 1994-batch IPS officer, served as additional director general of the ACB and the EOW before he was transferred to the state police academy in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-govt-orders-probe-in-3-cases-against-suspended-ips-officer-gp-singh-101626618440594.html

In his affidavit submitted to the Election Commission of India before this year’s assembly election, Barbhuiyan claimed that he graduated from Choudhury Charan Singh University, Meerut in 2019. In the 2016 election, he claimed to have cleared the higher secondary examination in 1987 and passed an engineering diploma in 1990.Responding to an RTI query, Assam Higher Secondary Education Council (AHSEC) revealed that Karimuddin Barbhuiyan appeared for the Class 12th examination in 1987 but did not pass. A case has already been filed against Barbhuiyan in Gauhati High Court and the court will hear the case on August 4.Barbhuiya won the assembly election this year from the Sonai constituency of Cachar district under the AIUDF banner. He also contested the same constituency in 2016 but was defeated by BJP’s Aminul Haque Laskar. In 2016, while submitting the nomination, he revealed that he passed the higher secondary examination in 1987 and completed a diploma in engineering in 1990. But this year, the details of his higher education changed and he said that he graduated from Choudhury Charan Singh University, Meerut, in 2019.Supporters of former BJP MLA and former deputy speaker of Assam assembly Aminul Haque Laskar filed several RTIs regarding Barbhuiyan’s educational qualification. In response to two back-to-back RTIs regarding his higher secondary education, it was revealed that Barbhuiya failed to pass the class 12 examination in 1987.He was enrolled with the Guru Charan College, Silchar for appearing in the examination. An RTI was filed to the college and the college authority in response said that they don’t have Karimuddin Barbhuiyan’s records except for his roll number. With the help of the roll number, another RTI was filed to Assam Higher Secondary Education Council (AHSEC), and in response, the council stated that as per records available with the Council, Karimuddin Barbhuiyan failed that year.Aminul Haque Laskar moved to the Election Commission of India before this year’s assembly election but the ECI didn’t pay much attention to it. Karimuddin Barbhuiyan was allowed to contest and defeated Aminul Haque Laskar after securing more than 70,000 votes. Later, Aminul went to the Gauhati High Court and filed a case against Karimuddin Barbhuiyan for faking documents. The court has asked both Aminul and Karimuddin to appear for a hearing on August 4.Aminul Haque said, “In his affidavit, Karimuddin Barbhuiyan has revealed that he has completed his Graduation in 2019 from Choudhury Charan Singh University. But responding to an RTI, the university has said that Karimuddin Barbhuiya’s name isn’t there among students who graduated in 2019. In fact, he mentioned that he has completed his graduation in distance education mode, but the university does not have a distance education facility. Similarly, his engineering diploma is fake because the institute from where he passed, doesn’t exist. Now, Assam Higher Secondary Education Council is saying that he never passed the 12th class examination. So how can he became a graduate?”Aminul Haque demanded Barbhuiyan’s resignation. He said, “Assam Assembly is a holy place where legends like Gopinath Bardoloi have worked. There were highly educated MLAs and also there were MLAs with less education. But there was never a person who faked his educational qualification. Karimuddin Barbhuiyan has insulted the state assembly. In past, strict actions were taken against MLAs in Manipur and some other states for similar activities. I think Karimuddin Barbhuiyan should resign himself accepting his crime before Gauhati High Court takes the move.”Karimuddin Barbhuiya however didn’t try to defend himself and said he will prove his side in court. Talking to Hindustan Times, he said, “Former deputy speaker Aminul Haque Laskar is trying to defame me because I defeated him in the election. He has done that in the past and I am not surprised that he is doing it again. The matter is in Court and I will present my side with all the documents on the day of the hearing. I believe in the court and I am sure justice will be provided,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-mla-didn-t-pass-class-12th-exam-rti-query-reveals-101626611420467.html
18-07-2021||Dehradun||After HC rap, Uttarakhand govt increases stipend of medical interns from ₹7k to ₹17k||Uttarakhand government on Sunday approved to increase the stipend of interns in medical colleges from monthly ₹7000 to ₹17000, officials said. The approval to the increase in stipend was provided by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. Dhami said doctors and paramedic staff have provided valuable services during the epidemic and to lessen its impact on the state. The decision followed protests by interns and the Uttarakhand high court directing the state government to consider increasing the stipend of the interns. On July 7, the HC directed state health secretary Amit Negi to consider the possibility of increasing the stipend being paid to the intern doctors. “For, on the one hand, according to Amit Negi, it is difficult to attract the doctors to the state, yet, on the other hand, the stipend being paid to the intern doctors is too low as compared to the other states. Therefore, the state government should consider the possibility of increasing the stipend of intern doctors within the state,” said the HC order. The issue of increasing the stipend of interns was raised by advocate Abhijay Negi, the counsel of one of the petitioners in the bunch of PILs filed in the HC on the Covid-19 situation in the state. The July 7 HC order pointed out that “the stipend being paid to the intern doctors is significantly lower than the stipend paid by the other states. “According to him (counsel Abhijay Negi), while the intern doctors in Uttarakhand are being paid a monthly stipend of ₹7,500, the intern doctors in Himachal Pradesh are being paid ₹17,000 and in Chhattisgarh, they are paid ₹17,900/- per month as stipend”. “Thus, according to the counsel, it is essential that the stipend being paid to the intern doctors should be increased so as to motivate them to become a front-line warrior to tackle Covid-19. This is extremely necessary as the third wave is only four weeks away according to the expert opinion. Thus, the counsel suggests that the state must gear up and strengthen its healthcare system to take on the third wave as it strikes the state, possibly in the second week of August 2021,” the order said.Last month, interns at Dr Sushila Tiwari Government Hospital in Haldwani, the main referral hospital, held protests, demanding an increase in their stipend. They warned of boycotting their work in the coming days if their stipend was not increased.Dr Arun Kumar, a junior doctor said, only ₹7500 as a stipend was being given to the junior doctors in the state for the last 12 years, whereas the Central government gives a stipend of ₹23,000 to the junior doctors interning in the hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/after-hc-rap-uttarakhand-govt-increases-stipend-of-medical-interns-from-rs-7k-to-rs-17k-101626610700431.html
18-07-2021||Pune||Higher cutoffs, more competition likely this year for Class 11 admissions in Pune colleges||More students have scored higher marks in the Class 10 exam this year as compared to the previous year. This is likely to fuel more competition for admissions in top colleges in Pune and the rest of the state.As many as 957 students across the state have scored 100 per cent while over one lakh students have scored above 90 per cent, as per the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE).The passing percentage of students this year was 99.95 per cent in Maharashtra which is 4.65 per cent more than last year. As per the board, in 2020, over 83,000 students scored above 90 per cent marks with 242 securing a perfect 100 per cent. Whereas this year, 104,633 students discord more than 90 per cent.Class 11, first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions in Pune are done under the centralised admission system under which each college in the city enrols students.Prof Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, said that the cut off last year for Arts in Fergusson College was as high as 97.6 per cent.“For Science, the cut off was around 97 per cent. This time it is likely that the cut off may increase given a lot of students have scored well. However, our cut off may increase marginally for Science and Arts streams,” said Pardeshi.He also added that around three to four years back, the state government had permitted to increase students capacity by 10 per cent in college. “There is a possibility of that. However, there are limitations to infrastructure like teachers, practical rooms and other factors. These have to be taken into consideration before increasing the intake of students,” he said.In 2020, along with Fergusson College, Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC) also had a cut off of 97 per cent. Popular colleges like Sir Parshurambhau (SP) College had a cut off of 92.6 per cent for Science. Cut off for Modern College was 94.8 per cent as per the Class 11 admission portal.Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, said that prominent colleges will witness a higher cutoff this year as many students have scored good marks.“The education department in the past few years has asked colleges to increase the capacity by 10 per cent. There is a possibility that colleges which can take more students, will apply for the same,” said Zunjarrao.The Common Entrance Test (CET) for Class 11 this time will be held before August 21. And then the results will be declared and the admission process will start by September end. CET for Class 11 admissions is not mandatory as per the board. However, preference will be given to students who are attempting CET. It is likely that students who have scored above 90 marks may not apply for CET as their score is better. Zunjarrao added that there is a possibility that like last year, the admission process may take a lot of time for Class 11 giving only a few months to finish the yearly syllabus for Class 11.“Last year, the admission process was so much delayed that we had only three months to finish the entire syllabus for the year.

However, these farmers found it difficult to find a structured market to sell their produce, a problem that the new app named Raj Kisan Organic promises to solve by providing an interface to farmers and the consumers of organic produce.Individual farmers or farmer groups can register themselves by downloading this app from Google play store and directly sell their products to registered buyers. Till date, 160 farmers and 29 buyers have got themselves registered on this app.Commissioner, agriculture department, Dr Omprakash said that the farmers are also required to enter the details of the certificate issued by relevant authority verifying their credentials in the mobile app before they can upload the details of organic cultivable land, crop name, salable yield, price of produce etc which allows interested buyers to contact the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-develops-mobile-app-for-purchase-sale-of-organic-products-101626603020602.html

The torrential rain that intensified from Saturday night flooded the water purification complex on Sunday, following which the civic body shut the plants down.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said that the plants will be resumed in a few hours as water recedes from the station, but the filtration process will take time to be up and running. Hence, boiling the water will be the best precaution as of now.Follow live updates of Mumbai rains“Efforts are being taken to restore Mumbai’s water supply by restarting the water purification system in the complex, which may take up to a few hours. After water supply is restored, the administration appeals Mumbaikars to boil water before drinking,” BMC said in a statement. After the water purification plant is restarted, the entire system will be cleaned.The city has been receiving record rainfall since Saturday night which led to massive flooding in almost every part of the city. A BMC statement said Vihar Lake, with a storage capacity of 27,698 million litres, has started overflowing following the overnight rain. Vihar lake is the smallest of the water bodies that are part of the supply mechanism to the metropolis, PTI reported. In June, the civic body issued an alert against bacterial disease leptospirosis after heavy rains lashed the city. It was said that people who walk through stagnant water and have injuries in their feet are at risk of contracting this infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/boil-water-before-drinking-civic-body-s-advice-to-mumbaikars-amid-heavy-rains-101626602557748.html

18-07-2021||Mumbai||What caused monster thunderstorm twice Everest's height over Mumbai | 5 points||Parts of Mumbai on Saturday received the heaviest one-day on July in the last seven years which led to landslide and several deaths and injuries. Weathermen have found that a monster thunderstorm is behind the torrential rain, which was not predicted by the system. The thunderstorm had a cloud top height of 60,000 feet above the ground, higher than Mr Everest.Here are 5 points about what happened:1. The height of the thunderstorm is nearly 25,000 feet higher than the cruising altitude of commercial airlines, experts have said.Just look at the cloud top height of this thunderstorm! It has clearly touched a height of around 18 km (around 60,000 feet) above the ground. This is nearly 25,000 feet higher than the typical cruising altitude of commercial airlines. #MumbaiRains pic.twitter.com/eSOhWE8KMzFollow Mumbai rain live updates here2. In a month like July when the monsoon is active in the country, such thunderstorms are uncommon. Experts have compared this to the one that was seen in 2005.3. A monster thunderstorm is a collection of many thunderstorms. One of the reasons could be the increased number of a dry spell at a stretch, which can be linked to an overall rise in the number of unnatural weather events.4. An independent forecaster @IndiaWeatherMan said the monster thunderstorm came up over Raigad district in the evening. Then it slowly moved northward along the west coast towards Mumbai, without losing its strength, which is unique.Also Read: Experts stumped as record-setting thunderstorm hits Mumbai, contrary to forecasts..which will result in further increase in rains for Mumbai. Mumbai’s average July rainfall is 830mm Santacruz already recorded 850mm till now. My personal forecast is Mumbai will get over 500mm till next weekend with 2-3 extremely heavy spells. #MumbaiRains5. For the past few days, Mumbai has been receiving moderate rains, but mostly small-area, isolated downpours, which are "almost impossible" to predict.What will happen next?According to the IMD, an off-shore trough at mean sea level runs from Maharashtra coast to Karnataka coast, which is likely to persist during the next 5-6 days and a shear zone runs roughly along latitude 17 degree north in mild tropospheric levels and may persist for the next two days. Under its influence, Maharashtra will continue receiving heavy to very heavy rainfall during next 5-6 days. Konkan, Goa, part of Karnataka will also receive isolated heavy rainfalls, the IMD has predicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/what-caused-monster-thunderstorm-twice-everest-s-height-over-mumbai-5-points-101626600205975.html

18-07-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board’s water production at all-time high: Raghav Chadha||After nearly a week of shortage, Delhi’s water production on Sunday reached an “all-time high” of 955 million gallons per day, Delhi Jal Board vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said. “I’m pleased to inform that today Delhi’s water production by the Delhi Jal Board is at an all-time high of 955 MGD against the usual 910 MGD. Due to sufficient availability of raw water in River Yamuna as well as engineering solutions, we have managed to push our optimum levels,” Chadha tweeted. Over the last one week, Delhi has been witnessing a “severe water shortage”, which was attributed to Haryana not releasing the requisite water quantity to the Capital. Last Sunday, the DJB also filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking directions for the Haryana government to release Delhi’s share of water. The most affected areas were Old and New Rajinder Nagar, Greater Kailash, Prem Nagar, Punjabi Bagh, Tughlakabad, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar, Okhla, Raja Garden, Tagore Garden, Tilak Nagar and Subhash Nagar. Revealing the data of the water shortage, DJB had said that Yamuna River’s level at Wazirabad pond dropped from 674.5 feet to 667 feet, bringing down the Chandrawal water treatment plant’s capacity from 90 MGD to 55 MGD; Wazirabad plant’s capacity to 80 MGD from 135 MGD and Okhla plant’s capacity to 12 MGD from 20 MGD. The situation worsened on Monday, when the water level in Yamuna fell to its lowest since 1965, according to DJB. In a statement, the board said that Yamuna’s level went down by 7.5 feet because Haryana withheld Delhi’s share of water, which is 120 MGD. Through the week, however, as monsoon hit the national capital and the neighbouring states on July 13, 16,000 cusecs of water was released by Haryana. “Even though water was released by Haryana on Tuesday, it takes a few days to reach our water treatment plants. Till Friday we were monitoring the status of our WTPs very closely and ensuring that free tankers were doing the rounds in the affected areas,” said a senior DJB official. The official explained that the water tankers were being monitored through a water tanker distribution management system (WTDMS), which tracks the tankers in real time every 10 seconds through GPS through their journey. “The WTDMS makes available the date on movement of tankers on any given day along with trip and duty performance report at the click of a button. This has significantly improved the water tanker system in Delhi,” the DJB official added. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also hailed DJB’s efforts and assured that measures were being taken to provide uninterrupted water supply across the city. “Govt is doing its best to provide water to all. Our engineers are working 24x7 against all odds,” tweeted Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-s-water-production-at-all-time-high-raghav-chadha-101626599179965.html
18-07-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai water supply disrupted after heavy rains enter water purification complex||Water supply in most parts of Mumbai was disrupted on Sunday, after heavy rains inundated the Bhandup water purification complex, forcing Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to shut down the water filtration plants at the complex. “Efforts are being taken to restore Mumbai’s water supply by restarting the water purification system in the complex, which may take up to a few hours. After water supply is restored, the administration appeals Mumbaikars to boil water before drinking,” BMC said in a statement on Sunday afternoon. Ajay Rathor, chief engineer of BMC’s hydraulics department said the purification system had to be shut down along with power supply as a precaution immediately after water entered the complex. “We are draining the water, and cleaning the system,” he added.Due to the disruption, the Island city and its western suburbs did not receive the regular municipal drinking water supply on Sunday morning. Water supply to parts of the eastern suburbs was also affected. The BMC statement added that while the drinking water supply system will restart in a few hours, it may take longer for the filtration system to recover. “Therefore, after water supply is restarted, Mumbaikars should boil water and then drink it,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-water-supply-disrupted-after-heavy-rains-enter-water-purification-complex-101626595580335.html

The proposed park is expected to come up under the Mint flyover in the heart of the city, reported Tamil Daily Hindu Tamil. The civic body is planning to utilise the 3 acre land under the flyover identified earlier for Amma Weekly Market, the report further said.The space for weekly market was set aside by the previous government, where it planned to sell commodities at subsidised price.Ever since the pandemic started, Tamil Nadu has reported 25.3 lakh cases in which 24.7 lakh recovered while 33,652 perished, according to government data. The second wave of Covid-19 was very intense and Chennai was among the worst affected districts in Tamil Nadu. More than 8,000 people died in Chennai city limits during the second wave and thousands of people lost their livelihood due to the pandemic’s effect on the economy. Covid-19 left a scar on the city and its people.Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi and Regional Deputy Commissioner (North) D Sneha inspected the proposed spot on Saturday and discussed the possibilities of establishing the memorial park in the area. The officials of the civic body said that they will convene a meeting shortly to discuss the modalities of establishing the memorial park under the flyover.

18-07-2021||Mumbai||The epidemic to follow the Covid-19 pandemic||The last salary that 40-year-old Pushpa Awale earned, working as a member of the housekeeping staff at a private firm received was exactly a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a national lockdown on March 24, 2020 to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, she had only about ₹3000 saved up. Her husband, 45-year-old Avinash who worked in a construction site, earned ₹10,000 a month; she earned ₹1000 less.At first, Awale thought that the Chembur-based sales company where she worked would reopen within a few weeks. Fifteen months on, Awale has still not been called back to work. Avinash’s income too has drastically reduced as the pandemic hit real estate and construction sector. He now works as a daily wage labourer which pays him a few hundred rupees doing odd jobs on certain days of the week. Awales’ sons, aged 19 and 20, are both high school graduates, but neither has been able to find employment this past year.The lockdown started on March 25, 2020 and continued with full restriction till July and with reduced restriction till April 2021, when the restrictions were again increased in the light of second wave of infections. The loss of wages and livelihood is one of the most significant impacts of the pandemic that has infected over 31 million people in the country and killed more than 400,000 till date.The biggest impact of the loss of livelihood is on the Awales’ food intake, indicating that for the most vulnerable in the city, a silent epidemic of hunger and malnutrition follows close on the heels of the pandemic.Study findings“On most days, we survive on dal and rice,” said Awale, who lives in Mandala, a slum pocket in Mankhurd. She makes vegetables only on days she can afford to buy some onions and tomatoes; milk is no longer part of their daily diet and they now drink their tea without it. It’s been a year since they have eaten either chicken or fish. “On some days when my 19-year-old son throws a tantrum, I buy one egg for ₹6 for him for a meal,” she said. Her elder son, who is 20, lives with her mother in the Bainganwadi, in Govandi (also in the same ward) since the lockdown. “It became very difficult to feed all four of us, so I sent him away,” Awale said.The M-East ward is home to over 800,000 people (as per the 2011 census), including a large number of migrants; many work in the informal sector. There are over 250 slums pockets in the ward, 13 resettlement colonies and it is also home to one of the country’s largest open dumping grounds. Human development indices like life expectancy, education and per capita incomes are among the lowest in M-East. Indeed, food insufficiency among its residents is a known fact.A study of 26,000 households conducted over a period of two months, between November and January by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences’ Community-Led Action Learning and Partnership (CLAP) in the city’s M-East ward (Mankhurd, Govandi, Shivaji Nagar, Cheetah Camp, Trombay and Deonar) revealed an increase of 47% in the number of unemployed in the ward, and 12.5% of loss of livelihood opportunities from the job market itself since the restart of economic activities taking the unemployment rate to nearly 12% across 26 bastis spread across the ward. Nearly 58% of males in the informal sector and 25% in the formal sector lost their livelihood during the lockdown as compared to 10% and 6.5% for females. What’s more, the average income of the residents decreased by 47%.“The survey revealed the monthly average income of a household at ₹12500, indicating the hand-to -mouth lifestyle prevalent across the ward. In events like lockdown, where all economic activities were severely restricted, sustaining basic needs of everyday life became a challenge,” the as-yet unreleased report stated.Skipped meals“I skipped many meals to ensure my children could be fed whatever little food we had,” said Sakina Khatun (38) who lives with her three sons, aged 11, 13 and 20, and a daughter-in-law in Mankhurd’s transit camp slum. Khatun worked as a shrimp peeler at the dockyard but lost her job in the lockdown.For every 5kg of peeled shrimps, she would get ₹200. On days, when her hands got too scraped with the continuous shrimp peeling, she would make up to ₹400. “I called my employer many times, but he says there is no work. My eldest son managed to get a temporary job of spraying sanitiser in the ward but he too was left without work during the second lockdown,” she said.The family does not have a ration card through which they could get subsidised rice and wheat under the Public Distribution System. They have an LPG connection but affording a cylinder worth ₹860 became impossible during the lockdown. “I cook on a chulah most days,” said Khatun, adding that she and her daughter-in-law went to bed hungry on many days, to ensure that her “boys” have something to eat.“The pandemic has set the ward and its people back by nearly 10 years,” said Sandeep Wadhe, a resident of a resettlement colony in M-East and a facilitator with the CLAP project.“The daily nutrition of people has been hit the hardest. When the money runs out, the poor first compromise on the food intake,” he said.NGO, volunteer groups, PDS helped someMany non-profits and philanthropic organisations distributed dry rations and cooked meals in the ward, but the access wasn’t equal. “Some people were getting more ration than required, while those who were in dire need could not get access it at all,” said Avinash Madhale, CLAP’s programme coordinator. The survey covered 97,414 people and aimed to understand the impact of the pandemic on education, health, housingrr and water and sanitation, besides livelihood. The initiative has also helped the TISS team to draw out a vulnerability index, mapping the families that were in the worst conditions during the pandemic.“The urban poor were already in a bad shape, struggling to survive. The pandemic has worsened their condition further,” said Mukta Srivastava, the state’s convener for the Anna Adhikar Abhiyan or Right To Food Campaign.A survey carried out under the campaign in March showed that a large number of urban poor depended on the rice and wheat given through Public Distribution System as well as the rations kits distributed through NGOs. “Many people we interviewed said that they could not afford to cook vegetables. Fish and chicken was out of question. As we move ahead, this section of the population will face a long lasting impact on not just their health and nutrition status, but also social, economic and psychological, too,” said Srivastava.“The food insufficiency has blown up to a much bigger problem with the pandemic,” said Jameela Begum, a local resident and facilitator with CLAP. “Not just childhood malnutrition, the cases of adult malnutrition and other diseases are likely to shoot up,” she said.Another study that looked at malnutrition and deteriorating health of residents of the ward – this one brought out by non-profit Praja Foundation in 2018 – revealed that on average 51% of children were malnourished in the years between 2013 to 2016.“On days I have nothing to eat, the local vendor gives me one vada pav. I survive on that,” said Laxmi Dhondu Jadhav (70), a senior citizen residing in Patilwadi in Deonar. Before the lockdown, Jadhav worked in the Dana Market in Sanpada sorting food grains. Post-lockdown, she is unemployed.On days when Jadhav gets a cooked meal, distributed by a non-profit or the civic body, she ensures to save some for the next day.“I may not be well to do, but I have always earned a salary to feed my family. It’s difficult for me to take charity,” said Sudalai Pillai (27), who worked as an assistant to a tennis coach. When Pillai’s salary of ₹13,000 stopped in April 2020, he asked for money from his employer to sustain. The next few months, he sent messages to the parents of the children he coached asking for money. He took up a housekeeping job on a two-month contract.“My worst fear is not being able to feed my three-year-old daughter,” Pillai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/the-epidemic-to-follow-the-covid-19-pandemic-101626589322875.html
18-07-2021||Mumbai||Monster thunderstorm twice Mt. Everest’s height dumps over 250mm rain in Mumbai||The Saturday thunderstorm in Mumbai deposited 235mm of rain at the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) monitoring station in Santacruz. While early Friday’s extreme rainfall totalling 253mm was confined to the western suburbs, on Sunday, more than 204.5mm rain fell in 24 hours, including 180mm to 270mm received across the city. Weather experts were amazed by the monster thunderstorm which, as per the images from the weather department’s doppler radar, had a cloud top height of nearly 18kms, or 60,000 feet.According to the IMD, most locations in Mumbai received well over 150mm of rain in just a few hours ending at 3:30 am Sunday, leading to severe water logging, interruption in water supply and at least 18 deaths. The storm, which was described by expert meteorologists and forecasters as “massive” and “monstrous”, formed initially over Raigad district late Saturday, then slowly moved north along the west coast till it reached south Gujarat.“To have a thunderstorm track northward like that and maintain [its] strength is unique. No forecast models predicted such extreme rains. It was supposed to be [a] normal monsoon day [with] around 20-60mm rains,``tweeted independent forecaster @IndiaWeatherMan.The intensity of rains began to subside between 3:30 and 4am for most parts of the city, as the cloud formation moved on to Palghar district.Sridhar Balasubramanian, an expert tracking weather at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B), attributed the intense spell to an offshore vortex, adding that IIT-B had recorded over 250mm of rain in just three hours (between midnight and 3am), touching 305mm by 7am. “Luckily, this freak event happened during the wee hours when traffic and movement of people were minimal,” he Tweeted.The incident marked the fifth thunderstorm for Mumbai this month alone, pointed out Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University Of Reading, England. “Such thunderstorms are definitely more frequent in June (6.1 days) than in July (2.9 days),” he said.Deoras pointed out that easterly winds in the mid-atmospheric levels are bringing relatively dry air over the warm and moist air conditions in lower levels, which are brought by westerly winds, making the situation ideal for convective instability, which is further facilitated by day time heat. “Further, the vertical wind shear is significant, which is prolonging the lifespan of thunderstorms,” Deoras said.Similar observation was made by another independent forecaster Athreya Shetty. “Upper level winds seemed to be almost absent, hence there was no movement of the thunderstorm system. The winds that were there seemed to be due to a mini temporary circulation over Mumbai Metropolitan Region, hence the net wind movement was negligible,” he Tweeted.The absence of upper level winds further exacerbated the intensity because of the sheer height of the cloud structure which had formed over Mumbai. Images from the IMD’s doppler radar showed that the thunderstorm had a cloud top height of nearly 18kms, or 60,000 feet. “To put in other words, the vertical extent of this monster thunderstorm is approximately twice that of Mount Everest!” Deoras said.As per IMD’s impact based forecast issued at 3am this morning, Mumbai has been placed under a red alert, “indicating heavy to very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated locations” for the rest of the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/monster-thunderstorm-twice-mt-everest-s-height-dumps-over-250mm-rain-in-mumbai-101626588799581.html

18-07-2021||Lucknow||Woman started scuffle with cop to let husband flee, say UP cops on viral video||An inquiry has been ordered by the Uttar Pradesh police into a scuffle between a police officer and a woman in Kanpur, a statement by the Kanpur Rural Police said on Sunday but stressed that the officer, seen holding down a woman in widely-circulated photographs and a video clip, did not initiate the fight.The statement, citing another video clip that has since emerged of the incident on Saturday, said the woman started the scuffle to enable her husband to flee and the officer fell on the woman while trying to stop her.The officer, sub-inspector Mahendra Patel, has nevertheless been transferred to the district's police lines, the statement said.Police said the incident took place when a team of police officers went to Durgadasspur village in Bhognipur locality, about 60 km from Kanpur city, where they found some people gambling. The team caught Shivam Yadav, who according to the police, allegedly threatened a candidate in the panchayat elections a few weeks earlier.His family members attacked the police and managed to let Shivam Yadav run away from custody.His wife, Arti, later cited a photograph and a truncated version of the video clip of the incident, to allege that the police officer dragged her to the ground, sat on top of her, and assaulted her.Soon after, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted a photograph of the incident, to attack the Bharatiya Janata Party government and demanded action against the officer involved.(After perusal of the complete video, this story has been corrected to show that the policeman and the woman fell down in a scuffle initiated by her and that he did not throw her to the ground.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cop-accused-of-beating-woman-sitting-on-top-of-her-in-up-s-kanpur-dehat-101626567052155.html
18-07-2021||Delhi||Light rain in few areas, temp high||Four days after the onset of monsoon, a hot and humid spell continued in the Capital on Saturday as rain stayed away for most of the day and mercury rose to above normal temperature levels once again. Some parts of the city, including few areas in Dwarka and South Delhi, received light rain late evening on Saturday.Weather forecasters, however, said relief is in sight and predicted “moderate to heavy rainfall” across Delhi-NCR on Sunday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an “Orange alert” for Sunday, with heavy rainfall expected in isolated pockets.“The monsoon trough has shifted slightly northwards and is crossing over west Rajasthan, Haryana and east Uttar Pradesh. It is likely to reach close to Delhi late on Saturday night, which may result in light rain overnight. Besides, mostly moderate rainfall across the city with intense showers in isolated pockets is expected on Sunday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD’s head of regional weather forecasting centre.Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather, a private forecaster, said, “Moderate showers are likely to continue till July 20,” said Palawat.The city received strong showers for two days after the monsoon arrived on July 13, albeit 16 days behind schedule.However, the showers mostly halted since Thursday, after which Delhi has seen only traces of rain. Weather experts noted that Saturday was “mostly dry” with just light rain in parts of Dwarka -- southwest and near the sports complex -- and some areas in south Delhi. The maximum temperature touched 38.8°C, four notches above the season’s normal, and the minimum settled at 28.1°C, a degree above normal.A senior IMD official said high temperatures during the monsoon are not unusual: “This is because high humidity levels and inadequate intermittent rainfall causes the mercury to rise. It feels even hotter because of the combined effect of heat and humidity.”Independent weather experts expect July to be mostly dry. The delayed onset of the monsoon in the Capital may mean that Delhi, which usually gets the bulk of its showers in July, receive most of its rain only in August. So far, the rain deficit for July is around 50%. Meanwhile, Palawat said Delhi is likely to cover a large part of its rainfall deficit in the next four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-rain-in-few-areas-temp-high-101626560326791.html

Considering the importance of the issue, it asked all the respondents to come up with their stand on the next date of hearing.The petitioner has challenged the provisions of the fourth chapter of the BCI Rules, 1975 framed under section 49(i)(gg) of the Advocates Act 1961, alleging that the same are ultra vires (beyond the powers) to the Constitution, violating articles 14, 21 and 25. The petitioner has demanded from the court that it should direct the BCI to frame fresh rules for prescribing a new dress code for lawyers across India in view of the country’s climatic condition.The PIL has also sought quashing of a circular framed by the HC administration, which mandates wearing black robes for appearing before the court.Arguing before the bench, the petitioner said the present dress code of wearing a coat and a gown and tying a band around the neck is not suitable for the climatic condition of India.“The advocate’s band is a religious symbol of Christianity and a non-Christian cannot be compelled to wear it,” he submitted.The petitioner also said, “Wearing a white saree or salwar kameez is a symbol of widows according to the Hindu culture and traditions and there was no application of mind on the part of the BCI while prescribing the present dress code for lawyers in the country.” The petitioner added, “Even a mad man will not go for a coat and a gown in summer but sadly, lawyers and judges are wearing those proudly. The black robes prescribed by the BCI and the HC administration is unreasonable, unjust, improper and violative of the fundamental rights of lawyers guaranteed under articles 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hc-issues-notice-to-bci-on-plea-seeking-ban-on-present-dress-code-for-lawyers-101626556588742.html

18-07-2021||Chandigarh||5 held for issuing threats to govt officials, scribes in J&K||J&K Police on Saturday arrested five persons, including a Srinagar municipal corporation official, who were allegedly running an ‘intimidation machinery’ that used to prepare a strategic hit list of government officers, journalists, social activists, lawyers and political functionaries. The police said that incriminating digital equipment were recovered from the residences of the accused.Kashmir Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar termed the arrest a major breakthrough as the arrested persons were “secretly working” for a blog ‘kashmirfight.wordpress.com’.“In a J&K-wide operation, houses and properties at multiple locations, including Sanat Nagar and Raj Bagh in Srinagar, Batpora in Hazratbal, Poonch, Jammu and Hawal in Pulwama, belonging to the accused were searched. Armed with search warrants granted by competent court of law, police teams carried out searches of the suspect premises and recovered a large amount of cell phones, digital storage devices and computing platforms. In one house alone, 32 mobile phones, one tablet, two laptops, four storage devices, seven memory cards and one dongle were found.”The IGP said that the accused are Nazish Yasrab Rehmani and Tabish Akbar Rehmani of Sanat Nagar, Sofi Mohammad Akbar of Rajbagh, Peerzada Raqif Makhdoomi of Batpora, Hazratbal, and Javed Khalid of Poonch.“Kashmirfight.wordpress.com was being run by a white-collar terrorist syndicate whose task was to prepare a strategic hit list of government officers, journalists, social activists, lawyers, and political functionaries who were assessed by the syndicate to be responsible for harming the overarching objectives of furthering and sustaining the Pakistani-supported terrorist programme with the eventual aim of secession of Jammu and Kashmir from the Indian union and its eventual annexation in Pakistan,” he added. IGP Kumar said with the arrest of the kingpins and the discovery of a huge number of digital devices and the analysis of the data therein, it is expected that the ultimate plans behind the murder of journalist Sujat Bukhari, advocate Babar Qadri, and businessman Satpal Nischal would come to the fore.“The blog site had designed a modus operandi wherein the name of the victim was first published, he was profiled by giving detailed justification as to how and why he is a legitimate target for the terrorists and subsequently his actual execution by the terrorists.”Sofi Akbar is working as a secretary at the Srinagar MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-held-for-issuing-threats-to-govt-officials-scribes-in-jk-101626552617843.html

18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Flashflood aftermath: Hotel occupancy in HP’s Bhagsu, McLeod almost drops to nil||Dharamshala tourism industry that had just started limping back to normalcy after pandemic-induced lockdowns and curbs has again been hit hard by the July-12 flashflood incident. The occupancy in the hotels of Bhagsunag and McLeodganj area has dropped to almost zero that was nearly 90% in the preceding weeks. Addressing a press conference, Ashwani Bamba, president of Dharamshala Hotel and Restaurant Association, said the “irresponsible reporting” of a localised incident depicting it as a cloudburst on social media and some news channels has triggered a sense of fear among the tourists and they have been cancelling their bookings. He said the bookings for not only July but August were also cancelled and the hotel industry has suffered losses up to ₹500 crore. He said the Bhagsunag incident was not a cloudburst, but water from a nullah changing its course. He said the nullah was packed with debris and there was no space for free flow of rainwater. “The shuttering of culvert which being constructed on nullah upstream was not removed, as a result of which rainwater changed its course and with great force came on the road and caused damaged,” he added. “But the way this episode was depicted on social media, with the headlines suggesting that entire Bhagsunag has swept away in a cloudburst created an atmosphere of fear and panic,” he said, admitting that encroachment on the nullah and drains by some hoteliers had also led to the flooding. “Visuals of sliding cars at Bhagsunag were merged with increased water level of Gaj rivulet and Boh landslides were shown as that of Bhagsunag only to create sensation,” he said, adding that after a long shutdown due to coronavirus, there was a hope of good tourism and in fact, it had picked up from 40-50% during weekdays up to 90% on Saturdays. “This incident has not only affected tourism in Upper Dharamshala, but in the entire state,” he said. Bamba said the hotels had also called back their staff and if the situation doesn’t improve, they may again be rendered jobless. “We wish to convey to everyone that situation is very much normal in Bhagsunag and other tourist hubs and there is nothing to be afraid of,” he said, assuring the tourists that they will be safe and comfortable. Meanwhile, Dharamshala mayor Onkar Nehria, who was also present in the press conference, said the municipal corporation has issued notices to hoteliers who have encroached upon nullah, and the illegal structures will be demolished. He said some people have voluntarily started demolishing their illegal structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/flashflood-aftermath-hotel-occupancy-in-hp-s-bhagsu-mcleod-almost-drops-to-nil-101626551784160.html

18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Pak bunker mein saamp ki mausi||Around 22 years ago, Indians were left awestruck by the visuals and stories of our soldiers braving impregnable inclines and freezing climes to evict Pakistan Army intrusions from Kargil. Years later, an abandoned Pakistani ‘sanger’ or stone bunker at Point 4355 (14,288 feet) in the Mashkoh LOC sector has come to be reoccupied by a ground lizard species equally adept at braving the vagaries of deep freezes! This bunker, which is located just below Vikram Batra Top, had stymied the Indian Army’s advance up the Safed Nullah during the Kargil War. These are high-altitude skinks, which amaze the observer with their ability to weather tonnes of snow. Not more than 14cm in length, these skinks are cousins of the ‘baamani’ or ‘saamp ki mausi’ – the red-tailed lizards seen slithering in gardens in the plains and sometimes staging a furtive entry into houses.India is home to 62 species of skinks that are a group of carnivorous lizards that gulp down or swallow their prey (insects) just like our house lizards. However, due to ignorance, oftentimes slithering skinks are confused with venomous snakes and killed, though they do not possess a toxic bite. On the other hand, in some Indian cultures skinks are considered a good omen. If a human hand touches their pink or reddish tail, it is supposed to invite good fortune! As I cautiously peered over the parapet of the ghostly bunker at Point 4355 as part of a conducted tour by the Army, gentle wildflowers and shy skinks below me mingled comfortably with danger in this ‘live Kargil War museum’. There was expended machine-gun ammunition, a decaying radio set and a live rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) lying in the bunker’s rubble and an unexploded hand-grenade on the path up to the bunker. No human is allowed into these abandoned bunkers by the Army as there is the additional hazard of Pakistani soldiers having mined and booby-trapped their temporary abodes with covert explosives before retreating across the LoC. Tiny skinks can comfortably crawl over unexploded shells without triggering a blast but were an unwary Himalayan Brown bear to lumber in, a catastrophic outcome is probable. The piles of boulders or stones that the Pakistanis had heaped together to shape the bunker in 1999 were put to effective use by skinks in later years as they hibernate in crevices of moss-covered stones when several feet of snow erase the brief shimmer of summery green meadows. At last, the rocks have returned to one of the utilities Nature had intended them for: as a refuge for creatures rather than for Pakistanis to wage destructive wars at the proverbial heights of madness.My curiosity greatly aroused, I sought a perspective from Kaushik Deuti, a scientist with the Zoological Survey of India and lead author of the seminal volume, Skinks of India. “The skink species in the bunker could either be the Himalayan Rock skink (Asymblepharus himalayanus) or Ladakh Rock skink (Asymblepharus ladacensis). Both species belong to a genus of mountain skinks known as Asymblepharus and are found not only all along the Himalayas but also in the Karakoram and up to Tien Shan mountains, Central Asia. In India, we have four species from this genus. These skinks are adapted to surviving cold and feed on small ground-dwelling insects of high altitudes,” Deuti told this writer.By July, skinks of the ‘wuthering heights’ complete their breeding cycle. Researcher Nitin Jamdar of the BNHS had in 1985 collected eggs of the Himalayan Rock skink at 7,500-8,500 feet. The yellow and pale cream eggs had been placed in two rows of four each by the female and resembled corn grains but with a squarish appearance. During courtship rituals prior to mating, the male skink develops an orange belly to attract females.Deuti drew attention to a fascinating adaptation. “The lower eyelids of these mountain skinks bear a transparent disc (window) through which they can see even with their eyes are closed. The reason for this evolutionary development may be to screen ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can lead to impaired vision. Mountaineers use special sunglasses as the shine from rocks and ice often baffles them. In the same way, these skinks that live inside moss-covered rock crevices may have developed a transparent lower eyelid which they pull up every time they need to venture out of their crevices in search of prey,” said Deuti.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-pak-bunker-mein-saamp-ki-mausi-101626551239658.html
18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: The timeless charm of travel||Isn’t there something enchanting and magical about journeys? I have always felt so. During train journeys, one gets to meet all manner of people, while enjoying the cool breeze at the window seat. When it comes to aeroplane rides, the food and hospitality are unrivaled, as is the systematic way in which everything proceeds. Travelling on water offers a mesmerising view of the ocean, though I haven’t had much experience with this mode of travel. It makes one think isn’t our entire life a journey with its vicissitudes? My most vivid childhood memories are of our family trips to Kasauli. At the outset of the journey, the trip unfolded like a choreographed reel. Dad would unfold his newspaper, and mom would wonder if any important item had been left at home and whether the doors had been bolted properly. My elder brother, who had just stepped into adolescence, would play rap at high volume – much to everyone’s annoyance– while someone or the other would start getting pangs of hunger or thirst midway. The young ones would find a reason to quarrel and would be handed comics – the now quaint Chacha Chaudhary, Pinky and Babloo. Today the young ones are handed a spare mobile instead. The sheer predictability of the journey does nothing to kill the charm. The moments are pure delight as in the heart of hearts everyone is looking forward to the destination. And after all the initial commotion, there is a phase of calmness, too; usually after the home-packed meal has been consumed and the vehicle is filled with the aroma of pickles. At this time, everyone enters a kind of reverie, pondering over his or her life or simply enjoying the passing greenery, or dozing. Here I often feel a bit scared lest the driver also take a nap! Nowadays, the many roadside dhabas and eateries have made carrying ghar ka khanna redundant. The travel party starts seizing these eateries with delight and soon everybody is hungry. As the destination comes closer, an air of restlessness pervades in the car. My father would always take a break at the point as it refreshes everybody and subdues the monotony-induced urge to speed! Finally, upon reaching Kasauli, we would stretch and yawn, get off and collect our bags. Everyone would look at the verdant beauty surrounding us, inhale the fresh air and marvel at the beauty of the mountains as one settled to enjoy a relaxing weekend. This is not to deny that some journeys can be extremely difficult to undertake and challenge us to the core. These too, they say, must be taken up for the growth they bring during the process. But, all in all, journeys have the potential to recharge and rejuvenate us, provided they are taken in the right spirit.As the American novelist Louis L’Amour said, “A journey is time suspended”. With the sweet sounds of chirping birds, with soothing music playing in the car (after prevailing over the brother with Herculean effort) and with my own company to enjoy as I look out of the window – journeys undoubtedly transport me to some other dimension. reemaban@gmail.comThe author is an assistant professor of psychology at Rajiv Gandhi Government College, Saha||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-the-timeless-charm-of-travel-101626550818337.html
18-07-2021||Delhi||ED arrests Punjab-origin Dutch national in money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday said it has arrested an Indian-origin Dutch national from the Indira Gandhi International Airport here in connection with a money-laundering probe initiated against him on the Netherlands government’s request. Originally from Phagwara in Punjab, the accused, Shivlal Pabbi, had migrated to the Netherlands in 1981. He was trying to flee to Paris when he was arrested, the central probe agency said. Pabbi was later produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Mohali that remanded him to Enforcement Directorate custody till July 23, it said. The ED alleged, “Pabbi, who became a Dutch national in 1984, committed cheating and forgery in the Netherlands through fraudulent documents prepared in connivance with his Indian associates. He ran a hawala or banking without a permit in the Netherlands under the garb of trading in readymade garments.” The proceeds of the crime generated by Pabbi were laundered through Pakistani individuals based in Dubai, who transferred the money to him and his brother’s NRE (non-resident external) accounts in Phagwara, it claimed. This money was “invested in the development and construction of Mayfair Resorts and Cabbana Resort and Spa situated in Phagwara on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway”, the ED said. It stated that Cabbana Resort and Spa, spread over several acres, is a renowned venue known mainly for hosting luxurious weddings and corporate events. “The Enforcement Directorate initiated money laundering investigation against Pabbi and others at the request of the Netherlands government,” the official statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ed-arrests-punjab-origin-dutch-national-in-money-laundering-case-101626550637826.html

The Punjab Vigilance Bureau had sought the property’s attachment, claiming it was purchased by Saini using “tainted and black money”, without any sales deed, resulting in losses to the government exchequer.In the detailed orders, the court of additional district and session judge PS Grewal directed the district collector to carry out attachment of the two-kanal house by affixing a notice there and to receive a monthly rent of ₹2.5 lakh from Saini till further court orders.The court also directed the district treasury officer not to release the rent deposited.Also, notices have been issued to Surinderjit Singh Jaspal, the registered owner of the house, and his son Nimratdeep Singh, a serving executive engineer in Punjab, as to why this provisional attachment not be made absolute.According to the bureau’s probe, Jaspal bought the property, but it was actually purchased by Saini, who was retired and was shown to have taken the house on rent after renovations in October 2018.

18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays: Career uncertainty is normal, natural||The growing-up years are sure to be dotted with of a certain amount of uncertainty, ambiguity and unpredictability. The trend and shape of things to come is ever unknown. Life itself is an intricate maze, a mysterious pathway, replete with milestones and speed bumps en route. Who can be sure of what the future holds? And that is verily the essence and the charm of life as well.But at the age of 18 or 19, or even 25, it is normal and natural to feel burdened by parental expectations, peer pressure and self-doubt. None of us who have made even the faintest of marks in life, were confidence personified when it came to the years to come. We had no idea about the contours of the meandering route along which our career would ultimately unfold and undulate. Thus, for those who are worried about exams, results, no exams and no results, in these uncertain times, I have only one piece of advice. Please try and chill a little! One of the early forays in this column of mine was titled, ‘Parents, please take a chill pill!’ The same advice holds good for youngsters as well. While the parents of today must appreciate the fact that piling on the pressure is not the best way to get the best out of their progeny, members of ‘Gen Zee’ must also follow suit by relaxing their minds a little. Or a lot.Prince Charles of the United Kingdom, when he was young, could have been reasonably sure of his ascension to the throne one day, but today, at 72, he is still in the waiting room, so to say! Nothing is certain in this world of ours, and we cannot expect it to be so. What is surely in our hands is the effort we make, the qualities we bring to the table and the determination that we possess, to make successes out of our lives.The results are never in our control, as the scriptures also tell us. Our mandate is to slog and toil, to persevere and persist. I have counselled hundreds of civil services aspirants in the past few years, and I have categorically told them to hope for the best, but to prepare for the worst. And in any case, Plan B is never a bad option. Many people manage to grab an opportunity in life, which is akin to their first or second or third preference as a career option. What is wrong with that? It is only when someone wanted to be a lead actor, but ends up selling tickets at a cinema hall, is he justified in holding a grouse or two!Sundar Pichai, Indira Nooyi, Jeff Bezos, Satya Nadella, Elon Musk, Kiran Majumdar Shaw, PV Sindhu, MS Dhoni, Deepika Padukone and Sunita Williams, all highly successful individuals, could hardly have tom-tommed their success before their careers actually panned out in the resplendent manner that they eventually did. It is another matter that most of these stars of varied skies have proven to be humble, even great, icons, though not all of them.Feeling low at times and worrying a tad more than necessary is a usual for teenagers and even for those older. But to dwell in the realms of anxiety and stress, aided and abetted by a tendency to overthink, is an avoidable manner of living. Lord Alfred Tennyson, in his memorable poem, ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’ wrote the following lines so touchingly- “Ours is not to wonder why, ours is just to do or die.” While Tennyson was alluding to the selfless sacrifice made on the battlefield by the cavalry during the Crimean war, we need not be as fatalistic. Yet, we need to soldier on despite seeming hardships and reverses which are a part of the surprise package of life that we were unwittingly presented at birth.The key, in the ultimate analysis, is to keep at it and to try and improve the prospects for success in our lives and careers. Then, whether we end up in a career of our choice or not, we will have done our bit. Let’s leave the rest to destiny. vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-career-uncertainty-is-normal-natural-101626550278888.html

BMC gets the doses from the Central government. But often due to inconsistent supply of the doses, it faces shortage of vaccines, which is affecting the immunisation programme in the city that has a population of around 20 million. To facilitate the vaccination, corporate companies like Citi Bank and Godrej, through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, are vaccinating the general population through BMC’s free vaccination programme.“Both the Citi Bank and Godrej approached us with the noble intention to vaccinate 100,000 people each. So rather than directly donating the vials to BMC, we have asked them to directly provide free vaccinations to the general public through Co-WIN app. A national drug manufacturing company has also promised to donate 50,000 vials in the coming days,” BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said. Citi Bank along with Jaslok Hospital approached the G-South ward office to vaccinate 100,000 slum dwellers from Dharavi, the biggest slum in Asia.“They have collectively applied to us for free vaccinations. We are also assisting them in beneficiary mobilisation with the help of eight-nine non-government organisations (NGOs). We approached Dharavi Sports Complex, the first quarantine centre in Dharavi, which readily agreed to provide the premises for the drive,” said G-South’s ward officer Kiran Dighavkar.“If everything goes as planned, we will be able to start the vaccination programme by Wednesday,” he added.The hospital did not divulge much information. A senior official of the hospital said, “It is still in the initial stage of planning.”Similarly, Godrej has decided to inoculate 100,000 people at their vaccination camp in Vikhroli through CoWIN app. “People who want to get vaccinated at BMC centres would be directed to Godrej’s camp through the CoWIN app. Despite getting vaccinated in a private centre, these people won’t be charged,” said Dr Gomare.Despite repeated attempts, the company did not respond to HT’s calls and messages over the issue.In June, the Union health ministry declared that the Centre will buy 75% of jabs from vaccine makers for free supply to states, while the private sector will continue to procure the remaining 25%, with the service charge being capped at ₹150 per dose over the fixed price of the vaccine.Private hospitals and corporate companies buy Serum Institute of India’s (SII) locally manufactured Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield at ₹600, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin at ₹1,200 and Russian Sputnik V vaccine at ₹948.Recently, many smaller private companies have also approached BMC to donate vaccines within their capacity. “These private companies don’t have the financial strength to donate 100,000 vaccines. But it is really encouraging to see that they are willing to contribute in the smallest ways by donating doses ranging from 5,000-20,000,” said Dr Gomare.Amid the shortage of vaccines, BMC has administered the first dosage to 54% of the population above 18 years who are eligible for the mass immunisation programme in the city. A total of 6.2 million doses have been administered so far, of which almost 5.8 million doses are of Covishield. There are only 1.1 million beneficiaries who have received both the Covishield doses, while 4.6 million are waiting for the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbais-vaccine-drive-gets-shot-in-arm-as-pvt-firms-donate-doses-to-bmc-101626550217156.html

KG Sharma, dean, training and placement at CCET, said, “Since the online mode was new, a few companies were not very much comfortable with it, especially non-IT recruiters. Placements in computer science engineering, and electronics and communication engineering streams were unaffected during the pandemic and students achieved better opportunities this year.” However, due to the pandemic, companies were hesitant to recruit students of civil engineering and mechanical engineering.Established in 2002, CCET is affiliated to Panjab University and offers bachelor of engineering courses in the four aforementioned streams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-youth-lands-32-lakh-job-with-amazon-101626550101534.html
18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Resurgence of a cult 1961 Hindi novel in English storytelling||It was a cherished dream of mine to study English honours at Lady Shri Ram College for Women in New Delhi. Looking back, I wonder why this preference for LSR over Miranda House, which was the most happening college in the 1970s. Perhaps, it was because several seniors of the smart set in our school in Shillong were studying there and some of my classmates also had their hearts set on the college or it was maybe because the college, which is located in Lajpat Nagar, had been the subject of animated discussion for the goings-on that had inspired Pachpan Khambe Laal Deevaren, the debut novel of the Hindi fiction writer Usha Priyamvada. I was but a child of six when the novel was released, but it seemed to have caught the imagination of my mother, sister-in-law and cousins for striking new ground in telling a woman’s story. Ours was a family that had more books on the shelves than money in the bank and reading was a constant passion.I think it was the poetic name that struck me most about the novel. Even though circumstances at home did not allow my dream to be fulfilled and I went to the Government College of Women in Chandigarh instead, I would always cast longing glances at the red walls and try to count the pillars, as though it was a magic mantra, when our cab or auto-rickshaw passed by the college on our way to my brother’s house in Delhi’s Greater Kailash. All these memories came flooding as I held a mint-fresh copy of the novel, which has been brilliantly translated into English by Daisy Rockwell, in my hands. I stayed awake all night as I read this well-told story, chronicling the dreams and disappointments of the ill-fated love affair of Sushma and Neel set in the vintage Delhi of the 60s.A sense of déjà vuAs one gets immersed in the story of Sushma, a working woman and sole provider for her large family, there is a strange feeling that one has experienced this before not just in literature and cinema but in life as well. This is especially true in the homes of large middle-class families that were ravaged during the Partition. In such circumstances, many women were compelled to seek education and join the workforce, but with strings attached, which kept them trapped despite achieving economic independence. Kamla Dutt, who was witness to the feminine struggle of the 60s mentions the travails of the daughters of Partition at the hands of their own mothers in the poem, ‘City Named After Goddess Chandi’: “It was a bad year for the city/Named after Goddess Chandi/ So many daughters had taken their lives/Mothers of Partition/ with too many daughters/Then had turned hard/ Fury of semi-educated mothers unparalleled/ Their daughters, their rivals/ their shame…”So, it is with Sushma, the protagonist of the novel, who feels trapped in a prison with 55 pillars and red walls, where even her prince charming, Neel, cannot reach her. She introduces herself to him with a touch of bitterness saying: “Age: 33 years; home: poor; Hindi teacher…is there anything else you would like to know?” Behind these red walls, Sushma, in spite of her relative youth and elegance, is resigned to the regimented loneliness of her life until she meets the persistent Neel, but even then the walls and pillars do not make way for her to experience love and togetherness as she is locked in the mental and social paradigms, which her family imposes on her. She must support her younger siblings, even at the cost of her own happiness.Datedness and women’s writingOn the challenge of translating this novel, which is set over half a century ago, the remarkable translator, Daisy Rockwell, says: “The descriptive choice brings fashion to the fore in ‘Fifty-five Pillars’, and attracts the critique of ‘datedness’ to the writing. The clothing styles belong so clearly to the era that we feel we are flipping through an old issue of Femina magazine, circa 1960. And yet, I have no doubt that old issues of Femina also contain valuable clues for the mapping of women’s history!”In fact, Rockwell, with a PhD in South-Asian literature began with translating the works of Hindi writer Upendranath Ashk who hailed from Punjab. A painter-scholar she has also translated from Urdu ‘The Inner Courtyard’ by Khadija Mastoor and ‘A Gujrat Here, A Gujrat There’ by famed author Krishna Sobti. In fact, all three novels could well be dismissed as ‘dated’. Interestingly, even Usha Priyamvada, whose books extremely popular in Hindi were never translated into English, initially dismissed the idea of having this particular novel translated. Now, all of 90 years and long settled in the US, Usha wrote to Daisy saying: “Translate my most recent novel. I fear that one is too dated.” But for a literary scholar like Daisy there was no ‘this’ or ‘that’ and she says: “Fifty-five Pillars gives us readers, more than 55 years later, a window into a particular moment in women’s history, when women with apparent freedom and advanced education struggled for independence and autonomy.”It is a point well made and this novel may prove to be a flagship for Indian Novels Collective as Ashwani Kumar, one of the moving forces behind the collective, says the effort is: “To bridge the gap between the English reader and classics of Indian literature by making available quality translations and building reader communities that celebrate Indian storytelling.” Published with care by Speaking Tiger, it is indeed a cherished addition to the bookshelf of this writer who once longed to know college life beyond those 55 pillars and red walls so enticing in youth!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/resurgence-of-a-cult-1961-hindi-novel-in-english-storytelling-101626550100332.html

She said a team of the archaeological department will visit the site on Monday for investigation after which a decision on the structures will be taken. Stating that the SGPC is committed to preserving the heritage of the site, she said the structures will not be touched until the truth about its history is established. “If it is related to the Gurus or Sikh history, then it will be preserved for the Sangat,” she said. Replying to a query, Bibi Jagir Kaur said, “So far, no concrete historical facts have come to light about the structures, but it is being speculated that these may have been buried during the demolition of the area for the construction of Galiara (corridor) around Sri Darbar Sahib.” She further said some people were deliberately trying to tarnish the SGPC’s image. “I appeal to the Sangat (devotees) to read the facts. In fact, it was the SGPC that brought these structures to light, so there is no question of any historical or Sikh heritage being destroyed by the Sikh body,” she said, adding, “Everyone should wait till the report is received from the archaeology experts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpc-chief-inspects-site-at-golden-temple-where-tunnel-like-structure-were-found-101626549977808.html

A team of the crime investigation agency (CIA) unit of Amritsar police commissionerate that intercepted him had claimed that its members resorted to firing after the 40-year-old tried to run over them at a check-point near the Nijjarpura (or Manawala) toll plaza on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway.The SIT, headed by the then inspector general of police (border range) SPS Parmar, was constituted after the victim’s family moved the Punjab and Haryana high court in March, terming the encounter as a “murder”. The court had asked the probe team to submit its inquiry report as to why no FIR was registered against the accused policemen so far. The HC bench had also directed sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Vikas Hira to submit a magisterial report in the case on April 20.The SIT, in its report to Amritsar rural SSP Gulneet Singh Khurana, stated that it was found that the police party used excessive force by opening fire at the victim to stop his SUV. The victim received two bullets and succumbed to the injuries in the hospital, reads the daily crime diary.Notably, the SIT also got some technical evidence examined by the forensic department. A mobile phone of a farmer, who had shot a video of the incident, was sent for forensic examination for retrieval of the recording that was allegedly deleted by CIA personnel.

Capt and Bajwa broke bread over dinner at the former’s farmhouse in Mohali’s Siswan on Saturday. Punjab assembly speaker Rana KP Singh and cabinet minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi also joined them. Bajwa said he and Capt have forgotten their past differences and come together to strengthen the Congress as the chief minister is working to make good on the 18-point agenda before the state elections. “All original Congressmen who are loyal and wedded to the ideology of the party are coming together for the cause of the party,” said the Rajya Sabha member, who has been a strident critic of Amarinder for most part of his current tenure. Their meeting, which came amid talk of the state unit revamp and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s elevation to the post of the state unit president, is being seen as the beginning of the realignment of forces in the state Congress. While Amarinder has strongly opposed the move to appoint Sidhu as the state unit president and is upset over premature public statements and leaks, Bajwa, a former president of the Punjab Congress, has been advocating that “dyed-in-the-wool” Congressmen should be given their due before the new entrants. Senior leader and MP Manish Tewari welcomed the duo’s dinner meeting. “Good to see @Partap_Sbajwa & @capt_amarinder together along with our Hon’ble Speaker @RanakpINC & @iranaosodhi.

As per initial findings, the medicines were being illegally sold at inflated rates without issuing bills to the patients. The computer records were also allegedly distorted to hide the actual sales. The hand of some officials of the Jan Aushadhi department and a data entry operator is being suspected. As the Jan Aushadhi stores are run by the Indian Red Cross Society, the role of its officials will also be looked into.Earlier on July 12, three pharmacists of the department, Sachin Arora, Baljeet Singh and Amanpreet Singh, had been terminated from services after the Red Cross found that the department had been in losses for long.Rakesh Sharma, chairman of the Employees Welfare Association of the health department, said, “We have requested the deputy commissioner to order a probe into the matter. The audit report and computer records should be checked to see if they match. We found that the data entry operator was the only person who used to sell the medicines even though it was not his job. We don’t know how long this has been going on.”He added, “This is a big scam. Poor people who come here to get treatment at affordable rates but are fleeced while purchasing medicines.”Senior medical officer Dr Chander Mohan said, “After discovering the medicines hidden in the bathroom, we formed a committee to probe how many medicines were pilfered from the Jan Aushadhi department and how many were bought from outside.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jan-aushadhi-medicines-found-hidden-in-bathroom-of-amritsar-civil-hospital-101626549437710.html

Farha was also found guilty of one count of criminal intimidation.On Friday, high court justice Kannan Ramesh held that Kaur’s testimony during the trial corroborated with other evidence of her abuse, including medical reports.He also said the couple’s explanations about the injuries “fly in the face of the medical evidence”, noting that the doctors who testified during the trial also did not accept their accounts.The judge did not accept the couple’s arguments that, among other things, the trial judge wrongfully believed Kaur’s version of events and treated the inconsistencies in her testimony as immaterial.Justice Ramesh noted the couple’s intention to accept their sentences if their appeal was unsuccessful. He allowed Farha to defer her sentence until November 1 - when Tasleem is likely to have already been released from prison - so that at least one of them can take care of their two sons, one of whom is autistic.Tasleem will start his jail term on July 19.Kaur worked for the couple between November 9 and December 31, 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/singapore-court-dismisses-plea-by-couple-convicted-of-assaulting-punjab-origin-maid-101626549317770.html

The school offers vocational courses, science, commerce and humanities streams and to adjust students, we need more classrooms.” District education officer (secondary) Lakhvir Singh, said, “This move will help the schools provide a conducive environment to study. With increase in enrolment in majority of the government schools, more rooms were required and as per the demand of the schools, grants were issued.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/13-govt-schools-in-ludhiana-dist-to-get-65l-for-new-classrooms-101626549198329.html

All officers and employees are expected that during office hours they will wear formal dresses in accordance with the dignity of the state assembly,” said Narendra Kumar Mishra, joint secretary (state assembly) in the office memorandum dated July 15, 2021, sent to all the officers and employees of the assembly secretariat.“There is nothing unusual in the office memorandum. A number of youngsters are being recently seen wearing T-shirts and jeans. Many dignitaries, including foreign delegations, often visit the assembly secretariat. Such an informal dress code does not suit the dignity of a Constitutional institution like the state assembly. We have only advised the staff and there is no penalty. The officers and employees need to uphold the dignity of the institution,” said a senior officer.State assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit also said there was no order and only an advisory had been issued to the staff, asking them not to wear T-shirts and jeans while in office.“This is only an advisory and not an order. It’s not binding on any officer or employee. The Uttar Pradesh assembly is a Constitutional body. The advisory is optional for employees,” said the speaker.Asked whether there would be any such advisory to the legislators as well, he replied in the negative. Others, however, said if employees wore T-shirts and jeans in the secretariat, they would even do the same during the sessions of the house.“There is a dress code (formal) for the staff during the sessions. This is to ensure that the officers and staff present in the house are identified there,” said a retired officer of the assembly secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-assembly-secretariat-advises-staff-not-to-wear-t-shirts-jeans-in-office-101626549018399.html

Soon after development, Bagga announced that he will be joining AAP on Sunday. He also stated that he had already tendered his resignation before the party expelled him.SAD leaders, however, maintained that they had not received any resignation letter and that he was expelled for anti-party activities.Bagga has been elected councillor twice and was given the rank of a state minister during the SAD-BJP regime. Before expulsion, he was serving as the senior vice-president of the trade and industry wing of SAD.As per information, Bagga was aspiring for a party ticket from Ludhiana North constituency for the 2022 elections. However, the seat was reserved for Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) by the high command after the two parties entered into an alliance in the state. Upset over this, Bagga had decided to join the AAP. Earlier too, Bagga had resigned from the SAD after he was denied a ticket from the constituency during the 2017 polls when the seat was reserved for a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate under the SAD-BJP alliance. Bagga contested the assembly elections as an independent and finished fourth in the elections. He had rejoined the SAD ahead of Lok Sabha elections in 2019.Terming Bagga as a ‘traitor’, SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said he was involved in anti-party activities and thus expelled from the party. Meanwhile, Bagga said he wants to serve the people and that cannot be done without a platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bagga-expelled-from-sad-says-will-join-aap-today-101626548957129.html
18-07-2021||Delhi||LG encroaching on Delhi govt’s turf, says Sisodia||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday objected to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal holding meetings with bureaucrats and instructing them on works that come under the purview of the elected government, in a letter that is likely to further intensify the conflict between the AAP dispensation and the LG who represents the Centre.Sisodia called the LG’s actions “murder of democracy” and violative of the Supreme Court judgment.“Over the last few months, you have been calling prominent officials of the Delhi government to your office and issuing directions related to work of their departments. I have also come to know that you are issuing directions to the officials on subjects that come under the purview of the elected government, without even keeping the ministers in the loop, and later officials of the LG secretariat are pressuring the bureaucrats to implement such orders,” Sisodia said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by HT.The deputy CM “humbly requested” Baijal to desist from such “activities”. “Under the Constitution, the Delhi LG can take decisions only on police, land and public order,” Sisodia said, citing the Supreme Court order of July 4, 2018.The LG’s office did not comment on the matter.The four-page letter came a day after the Delhi Cabinet led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal decided that a panel of government-appointed prosecutors will deal with the cases related to January 26 violence during farmers’ tractor rally against three farm laws passed last year, even as Baijal endorsed a panel of lawyers suggested by the Delhi Police.The Delhi government has maintained that appointment of lawyers comes under their purview and that the LG can only give his opinion on the Delhi government’s decision in rarest of the rare cases.Sisodia said that the “pattern” was observed by all Delhi ministers over the past three months, and that it coincides with the time when Parliament cleared the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in Lok Sabha in March.On April 28, the Union ministry of home affairs notified the Act, effectively making the LG in-charge of the national capital. According to the amended law, the elected government will have to seek the opinion of the LG before any executive decision.On April 29, after the notification by the Centre, the LG issued an order asking the Delhi government to seek opinion of the LG before the Cabinet or any of its ministers take any executive action with regard to matters related to land, police, law and order, subordinate legislations, granting of parole, Delhi finance commission, establishment or reconstitution of statutory bodies and matters specified under Rule 23 of the ‘Transaction of Business of the GNCTD Rules, 1993’.Citing the Supreme Court verdict, Sisodia said the LG has no independent decision making powers and he is bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers. However, the deputy CM did not mention the GNCTD Act in his letter.Sisodia described the LG as a “good-natured and well-meaning” person, saying he was writing the letter to him only because it concerned the preservation of democracy and the Constitution “at a time India is in the 75th year of its independence”.“You (Baijal) can use your time in this post to be remembered as someone who was a good person but weakened the democracy, or you can strengthen democracy instead. People will then remember you as someone who did not buckle under BJP’s pressure and left the tenets of democracy stronger than before,” Sisodia wrote.If the Centre-appointed governors and lieutenant governors sideline elected governments to take decision on all matters, it will be the end of democracy which was earned by our freedom fighters and ancestors after a long struggle and many sacrifices, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-encroaching-on-delhi-govt-s-turf-says-sisodia-101626548479801.html

18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Bursting crackers on busy roads may send you behind bars in Ludhiana||Revellers, who are part of wedding processions, can often be seen bursting crackers or indulging in celebratory firing along roadsides, which can lead to road mishaps, and injuries. With easing of Covid norms and the ceiling on guests upped to 200, the Ludhiana commissioner of police on Saturday extended the ban on bursting crackers on busy roads and the ban on carrying weapons to marriage palaces for two months. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal extended the bans under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). He said, “As most of the road is taken over by the procession, bursting crackers on the roads adds to the woes of commuters.”Agrawal also ordered marriage palace owners to make sure that no guest brings weapons to the venue. “If firearms are discharged, we will also book the owner of the marriage palace,” said the police commissioner. Dail down loudspeakers after 10pm The commissioner of police has banned playing loud music between 10pm and 6am. Now, permission must be sought before hiring a disc jockey or blaring loudspeakers at any event between 10pm to 6am. “Playing loud music at night disturbs the elderly and those who are sick as well as birds and animals,” the police said. A 100m silence zone has been created around hospitals, schools, colleges, universities and courts.Install CCTVs at petrol pumps within 30 daysThe commissioner of police has also ordered owners of petrol pumps, LPG gas agencies, marriage palaces and money exchange shops to install CCTVs on their premises within 30 days. “These establishments can be targeted by miscreants. Therefore, we have asked owners to be more vigilant to avoid such instances.” The sale and breeding of the Thai Magur, an invasive fish, has also been banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bursting-crackers-on-busy-roads-may-send-you-behind-bars-in-ludhiana-101626548837573.html
18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Masses in Ludhiana back to brazenly defying Covid norms||Freed of restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the second wave of the novel coronavirus, huge crowds can be seen milling around markets, bus stops and at other public places. Despite experts predicting an imminent third wave, the majority of the residents can be seen forgoing masks and defying social distancing norms.  After months of restrictions, residents could be seen thronging popular markets, especially those in the old city areas such as Chaura Bazaar, Saban Bazaar, Field Ganj, Karimpura, and Akalgarh Market. Despite the government mandating social distancing at restaurants, it is not being practised at most establishments and gym goers can be spotted working out without masks. With the night curfew lifted, the revellers are back at their favourite haunts — the Sarabha Nagar main market, Gol Market in Model town, and Dugri market. This has led to an increase in vehicular traffic in the areas at night and late in the evening. Roadside vendors in Ghumar Mandi, Model Town and other areas are also doing a roaring business in the absence of police checks. Sunday lockdown restrictions had been rolled bacj on June 27, while the night curfew was lifted on July 12 much to the relief of traders, restaurateurs and other businessmen. Chaura Bazaar Shopkeepers Association general secretary Gurcharan Singh Chann said, “Everybody is aware of the guidelines. People should behave responsibly to keep themselves and others safe.” A resident of Field Ganj area Tarandeep Singh says locals have become lax after the number of cases in the district has come down. Fearing another lockdown, which may cripple their business further, traders and restaurant owners are also asking patrons to follow guidelines to prevent a resurgence in infections. Hotel and Restaurant Association president Amarvir Singh says the hospitality sector is reeling under losses since the outbreak and will not be able to survive another lockdown. “Locals should take all the precautions while moving out and about as every sector will be hit if there is another lockdown,” said Singh, adding that hotel owners had been asked not to allow customers without masks to enter their establishments and ensure that their staff is vaccinated. Amarjit Singh, president of Model Town market association, said, “Residents should keep their guard up and avoid travelling to the hills. The positivity rate is low at the moment and we must do our best to keep it that way.” Deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma said, “The administration and police are doing their best to enforce Covid norms and action is being taken against violators. Special vaccination camps have been organised to vaccinate those involved in the hospitality sector. Residents must also behave responsibly. I will also take up the matter with commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/masses-in-ludhiana-back-to-brazenly-defying-covid-norms-101626548668214.html
18-07-2021||Lucknow||Approaching motherhood, this forest sentinel thrives in a male bastion in Uttar Pradesh||The love of nature and readiness to tackle challenges has helped Shweta Rani enter a male bastion as a forest guard in western Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh district.The 29-year-old was the first woman from her native village in Jalesar tehsil of Etah district to go for a government job.A farmer’s daughter, she was one of the 94 women who joined the forest department among the 563 candidates selected in 2016. She is in the seventh month of pregnancy, but revels in her job as a forest guard in Aligarh. The eldest among three sisters and two brothers, she studied in government schools and did her graduation in science from the Government Degree College in Jalesar. She is among the 243 women forest guards who have joined service after clearing competitive exams in recent years, says Ashok Kumar, the chief forest conservator of forest, (human resource department) in Lucknow.Describing herself as an admirer of Swami Vivekananda, Shweta Rani says she is unfazed by the vagaries of the weather that she has to face in the field. “Whatever the weather, working in the field motivates me. We have to look for government land or seek permission if it is a nagar panchayat for plantation. My doctor has advised precaution as I am in the seventh month of pregnancy, but I feel that I can do my job even if the temperature exceeds 40 degrees Celsius,” she says.It was her love of nature that made her not accept a state police job for which she was selected. Instead, she chose the forest department. Her first posting was in Ghazipur in eastern UP where she had to do a 10am-5pm office job which was not to her taste. She got married to Deepak Singh, a policeman, in 2019 and was posted to the social forestry department in Agra. Her husband is posted in Etawah district of western Uttar Pradesh. “Initially, when I joined the forest department in 2016, I was posted in an office. But I always loved a field job and was happy to be part of the plantation drive this year as the authorities chose me to supervise the plantation drive on Gonda Road, Amarpur Rajbagh in Aligarh district,” Shweta Rani says. She is thankful to Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Aditi Sharma, conservator of forests for Aligarh division, and divisional director (Social Forestry) Diwakar Kumar Vasistha for reposing faith in her. Putting Shweta’s position in perspective, Aditi Sharma says, “A woman staffer was tough to be found when I joined the forest department in 2006. The forest department was a male-dominated arena and somewhat continues to be so as it tests one’s strength and agility. But we now encourage women joining the department as their presence rules out the requirement of women police in certain circumstances.”“In fields like social forestry, women are an asset as they have more convincing power in spreading greenery and thus, we motivate girls in our team,” Sharma adds. Sharma says not only are there few women serving as forest guard but also not many are joining the Indian Forest Service as officers in the state. At present, there are 11 Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers in the Uttar Pradesh cadre.“Women officers include the chief conservator at Lucknow and the conservator at Aligarh Division. There are women DFOs in Ayodhya, Ballia, Ghaziabad and Unnao. A senior woman IFS officer is with the forest corporation in Lucknow. Four women IFS officers of the UP cadre are at the Centre on deputation. There are 11 women IFS officers in the Uttar Pradesh cadre at present,” Aditi Sharma says. “In 2006, when I joined the Indian Forest Service, there were only two other women IFS officers joining at the national level. Besides me in Uttar Pradesh, there were other two others in Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh. There is a steady increase in women joining the forest service in recent decades,” Sharma states. “There are not many forest guards who come directly through the State Commission for selection. The women forest guards include those joining service because of the dependent quota for deceased staff. These women take up the job of forest guard after the death of their father or husband,” she says. “Women forest guards in the field are mostly deployed for plantation and nursery, wildlife conservation and forest protection work,” Sharma explains. Ashok Kumar, the chief forest conservator of Forest, (human resource department) in Lucknow, says, “There were 94 women forest guard who joined in 2016 and 149 women forest guards did so in 2019. There are 243 women forest guards coming through selection in Uttar Pradesh.” “Girls like Shweta Rani are joining the forest department, yet their number is low. In Aligarh district, there are only four women staffers including Shweta Rani,” says divisional director (Social Forestry) Diwakar Kumar Vasistha. These women staffers include those who have joined in place of their departed husband. Not all four are in a field job like Shweta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/approaching-motherhood-this-forest-sentinel-thrives-in-a-male-bastion-in-uttar-pradesh-101626548538219.html
18-07-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra allows vaccination of bedridden||The state government on Saturday allowed Covid-19 vaccination of bed-ridden patients. The state public health department appealed to citizens to send details of such patients to covidvacc2bedridden@gmail.com and said such patients would be vaccinated after they are registered online. The patient’s name, address, telephone number as well as a doctor’s certificate declaring that the patient will be in that state for at least the next six months will have to be sent to the email address. The doctor has to certify that the patient can be vaccinated. Also, a relative or caretaker has to give consent for the vaccination, informed the health department. Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 8,172 Covid-19 cases, further proof that cases are showing a constant decline over the past fortnight. From 11,000-12,000 daily cases in June, the caseload has now come in the 8,000-9,000 range. In the first 15 days of July, the total number of Covid-19 cases was 127,884, with 2,298 deaths. In the corresponding period in June, there were 179,579 Covid-19 cases and 4,831 deaths.The daily average cases in July are 8,525, with an average of 153 deaths daily. In contrast, the average cases and deaths in June were 11,971 and 322 deaths respectively.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said it indicated a declining second wave. “The virus has been declining and this trend indicates the same,” said Dr Awate. “The decreasing number is due to various factors like acquisition of natural immunity due to the infection or through vaccination process being undertaken across the state,” he added.Dr Satyendra Nath Mehra, medical director, Masina Hospital, attributed the drop to various reasons. “The large scale vaccination being undertaken has blunted the severity of the virus and hence we are seeing less patients as well as reduced mortality,” said Dr Mehra. “The lockdown was responsible for reducing the transmission, which translated to fewer patients and consequently, reduction in death rate,” he added.The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,205,190, of which Mumbai’s share is 15,690. There were 220,851 tests done on Saturday, while the number of recoveries clocked 8,950. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 100,429, while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 126,851. Pune tops with 16,339 active patients, followed by Thane with 15,793 and Mumbai with 10,672. Pune also leads with 17,615 deaths, followed by Mumbai clocking 15,690 and Thane with 10,630.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-allows-vaccination-of-bedridden-101626548357136.html
18-07-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka meets women victims of nomination day violence in UP’s Kheri, demands justice||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday demanded that the state election commission should countermand the recent block pramukh (kshetra panchayat chief) elections in the Pasgawan block of Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh in view of allegations of violence against women there.Priyanka also demanded that all those behind the alleged nomination day violence on July 8 be brought to book. The election was held on July 10.The Congress leader, who is on a three-day visit to the state, went to Semra Ghat village of Pasgawan block area in Lakhimpur Kheri, about 130 km from here. She met the Samajwadi Party worker (who was party’s block pramukh candidate) and her proposer who were victims of the alleged violence in the elections. The Congress leader said there was no point in providing reservation to women in the panchayats when they were not being allowed to file their nomination.Both these women had allegedly been misbehaved with on the nomination day. The Samajwadi Party worker had alleged that she was not allowed to file her nomination.The authorities had lodged an FIR in the incident and arrested three people. Six police officials, including Mohammadi deputy police superintendent, had been suspended after the government took strong note of the incident. “Filing of nomination (for panchayat election) is her right. This right was taken away from her…She was targeted and attempt were made to pull away her saree and tear her clothes. One can imagine what she went through. She had a small child with her. A 19-year-old boy was also with her. She had her family with her…The circle officer, who tried to save her, has been placed under suspension and the administration is maintaining silence,” said Priyanka, while speaking to media persons after meeting the victims there.“I have come here as a fellow woman to extend my support to her, to assure her that every woman of the state and that of the country is with her in her fight for justice,” she said.She further said, “The violence took place in all the districts (during block pramukh polls). Bomb explosions were there at some places, violence was witnessed at some other and atrocities were committed against the women… I have come here to meet her because she is a woman. She is my sister as well… I demand that the election should be countermanded. Whosoever is occupying such a high position can see this is not the way any election is held and so it should be countermanded.”“Not alone in Pasgawan, fresh elections should be held in all other blocks of the state where such violence took place,” she told reporters.“The purpose of reservation to women in a democracy was their empowerment. However, situations have come to such a level that women are being misbehaved with,” Priyanka said.The Congress leader targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi again for his congratulatory message after the panchayat elections and said, “Re-election is ordered whenever such things happen. Why should re-election not be held? Can anybody be allowed to win election by indulging in violence? We have a video. Everything is clear whatever happened there. The police is seen not helping her. Only one or two persons came for her help. Do you want all democratic norms should be thrown to the winds? Prime Minister Narendra Modi is praising and congratulating the government.”In a social media post, she said she would write to the state election commission to get justice to the victims of panchayat poll violence.“I will write a letter to state election commission to demand justice for all the sisters and citizens who became victim of BJP-sponsored violence,” she said in a tweet earlier on Saturday.A large number of party workers welcomed Priyanka at Bakshi Ka Talab on way to Lakhimpur Kheri. Later, she held meetings with the party’s office bearers from different districts at the UPCC headquarters here on Saturday evening.(With inputs from Deokant Pandey in Lakhimpur Kheri)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-meets-women-victims-of-nomination-day-violence-in-up-s-kheri-demands-justice-101626547398190.html
18-07-2021||Other||PM Modi-Pawar discussed coop banks’ issues, vax drive; Maharashtra CM, Cong kept in loop: NCP||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Saturday has raised speculations in the political circles. The NCP, however, said Pawar met Modi to raise concerns over the Banking Regulation Act amendments – which the party feels could jeopardise the autonomy of cooperative banks – and other issues. The meeting that took place at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) fuelled speculations in the backdrop of political events that have been happening in Maharashtra as well as the national Capital, along with the Enforcement Directorate’s action against NCP leaders Anil Deshmukh and Eknath Khadse. Besides Modi, Pawar also had meetings with defence minister Rajnath Singh and commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal in Delhi in the past two days, ahead of the Parliament’s session that begins on Monday. Incidentally, former chief minister (CM) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis was also in Delhi at the same time. Hours after PM and Pawar’s meeting, party’s national spokesperson and minorities affairs minister Nawab Malik addressed a press conference in Mumbai to clear the air. Malik claimed Pawar mainly discussed the amendments related to the banking regulations. He said that the new amendment in the Banking Regulation Act is expected to hit the cooperative banking sector very badly and thus PM has been requested to intervene to change the amendment as it will prove to regressive for the sector. Pawar also discussed the issue of vaccinations, said Malik.“Pawar’s meeting was scheduled earlier. Pawarsaheb met Goyal, BJP’s group leader in Rajya Sabha, on a courtesy call after the latter’s appointment as leader of the House. Meanwhile, yesterday [on Friday], Singh had convened a meeting at his office with two former defence ministers, one being AK Antony and the other being Pawar. People are linking these meetings for speculating about the MVA government in Maharashtra. But the speculations have no substance,” Malik said.He categorically clarified that there was nothing more to read out of it and that Pawar had already informed CM and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra Congress in-charge HK Patil about the meeting. The NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress are part of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition. “CM was informed about the meeting by Pawarsaheb when they met two days ago. Similarly, Patil was informed about the meeting early this week. The meeting was scheduled to take place much before, but got delayed due to time constraint. Pawarsaheb had already spoken with PM over phone on the issues in the banking and cooperation sector, but the latter insisted upon a personal meet. Pawarsaheb also requested PM to formulate a policy to ensure the smooth supply of the vaccines to all states,” added Malik.On his twitter handle @PawarSpeaks , the NCP chief posted a copy of a letter submitted by him to PM. “Through a letter, I have drawn the kind attention of our Hon’ble PM towards issues and conflicts in the wake of certain developments in the co-operative banking sector (sic),” said Pawar in the post. Later in the day, Pawar tweeted, “I reiterated in the letter that the aims and objectives of the amended Act are well-intentioned, and many provisions are necessary. Erring board and management must definitely be acted upon strictly and the depositors’ interests should be protected. But at the same time, it should be ensured that while doing so, the co-operative principles laid down in the Constitution are not sacrificed at the altar of over-zealous regulation.”According to NCP insiders, Pawar requested PM to avoid ‘unwarranted’ action against the cooperative sector as well as against leaders from the ruling political parties in Maharashtra. On Friday, ED had attached properties worth ₹4.2 crore of former home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh. Several leaders from MVA are facing ED probe.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “I don’t think there will be any political upheaval in Maharashtra anytime soon as the three ruling parties know that they have no option but to stay united or else they will face dire consequences. I think there was nothing unusual in PM-Pawar meeting and it was a routine meeting ahead of the Parliament session. They must have discussed farm laws, proposed changes in the cooperative sector, reservation to OBCs and Marathas.”Political analyst Hemant Desai said that though NCP is claiming other reasons, the meeting between PM and Pawar has political implications behind it. “NCP has been ambiguous on many fronts and has never taken a strong stand against BJP and Modi. NCP had not opposed the farm bills in the Parliament and has also not cleared the air on Ajit Pawar’s swearing-in with Fadnavis for their 80-hour government. BJP is also in search of new allies ahead of the 2024 elections. So it would be wrong to say that there was nothing political in the meeting,” opined Desai. Malik said that NCP stands firmly with the other Opposition parties in both the Houses of the Parliament and will join hands with them to raise voice against the rising prices of fuel, inflation, vaccination issues, tension on borders and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pm-modi-pawar-discussed-coop-banks-issues-vax-drive-maharashtra-cm-cong-kept-in-loop-ncp-101626547397081.html

ABAP president, Mahant Narendra Giri said that human life was as important as religious practices and thus the best option is that the Kanwar yatra is called off this year as well. “On behalf of the Akhara Parishad I would like to appeal to the Shiva devotees not to take out the Kanwar yatra in view of the predicted third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The devotees should make Parthiva Shivlinga (Shivalinga made from clay) in their households and offer the water of Ganga or for that matter even of the local pond, of their village to lord Shiva,” Giri said. “Although the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath wants that kanwar yatra should be taken out by following all the laid down Covid-19 protocols, at the same time it is the moral responsibility of the devotees to see that their deeds should not, in any way, enhance the possibility of triggering the third wave of the pandemic. Religious practices are important but human life is more important,” the ABAP chief said. The ABAP chief’s appeal has come at a time when the apex court has asked the center not to permit states to take out Kanwar yatra and the UP chief minister has sought opinion of the religious organisations involved in arranging the yatra. “It is advisable that the pujan (prayers) of lord Shiva should be either done through making a Parthiv shivlinga at home or if at all the devotees decide to visit the neighbouring Shiva temple, they must follow the laid down protocols,” the ABAP chief said. Chief patron of Juna Akhara and general secretary of ABAP Mahant Hari Giri said, “Akhara parishad has taken the right decision. During the Kanwar yatra, the religious sentiments are quite high, and devotees often forget to maintain social distancing and hence run the risk of getting infected. All of us need to work jointly to avoid the third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/abap-against-kanwar-yatra-says-human-life-as-important-as-religious-practices-101626547097050.html
18-07-2021||Other||Curious case of Mumbai’s Mithi River leaves BMC concerned||On multiple occasions this year, the city has witnessed a delay in the time taken for logged water to recede from the streets or nullahs, following heavy rain in some flooding spots. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also noticed that the Mithi River took longer to drain its water into the sea in the past two or three instances after a downpour. This has caused some storm water drains in the suburbs – that empty water into the Mithi River – to stock up to full capacity, leading to waterlogged streets. This has also led to an apprehension if Mumbai is staring at more floods in the coming years. On Friday morning, Mithi’s water level rose to 3.9 metres (m), prompting BMC to evacuate residents who live on the river’s banks. A senior civic official said, “The area received 200mm of rainfall between 4am and 8am on Friday morning, which led to the swelling of the river. Previously, a combination of factors – over-flowing of the Powai lake, that discharges its water into the Mithi River; and high tide, due to which water from this river cannot empty into the sea – had contributed to similar situations.” The official said, “On Friday, Powai lake did not overflow, and there was no high tide during the four hours of heavy rainfall. Despite this, Mithi took longer to drain water into the sea.”Civic officials ruled out lack of desilting of the city’s storm water drains. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s storm water drains department, said, “We noticed that Mithi was taking longer to drain its water into the sea on Friday. Because of this, some nullahs that empty water into Mithi, such as the nullah at Kalpana Cinema in Kurla, also filled up and the areas that these nullahs cater to were inundated. I inspected Mithi and other waterlogged areas on Friday. However, I have noticed that water has receded fast enough from other streets throughout the monsoon. So this is not due to improper desilting. Mithi is a natural rain water draining system, and has been doing its job properly. There is no problem as such with it.”Civic officials are not sure why Mithi’s water level rose to 3.9 metres with only one factor in play, that is 200mm rainfall in just four hours. The senior civic official said, “Over the past few years, Mumbai has seen erratic rainfall patterns. As per the natural topography, Mithi should drain all its water into the sea. However, if the sea is not accepting the water, an in-depth study will be needed to know if this is attributed to climate change or rising sea levels.” Experts believe that it is time that BMC starts integrating climate change in its policy making. “For example, the Brimstowad project (aimed at overhauling drains) has no mention of rising sea levels. The CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) notification of 1998 says plains that are likely to get inundated with sea water, especially during monsoon, should have no construction, but we have ignored them. Also, we have destroyed to a large extent Mithi’s floodplains, which is bound to affect the water flow,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee of non-profit organisation Conservation Action Trust (CAT).City-based naturalist writer-photographer Sunjoy Monga said, “The delay in the time taken for water to recede from the city is attributed to a lot of reasons, including nullahs being over clogged with garbage and muck. We need to inculcate civic sense among the citizens of Mumbai. Rampant construction and concretisation without understanding the dynamics of water over the years are an invitation to situations where we will face such problems repeatedly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/curious-case-of-mumbai-s-mithi-river-leaves-bmc-concerned-101626547037062.html

The Modi government is being run by big corporate. That’s why they have failed to hold a dialogue with farmers protesting against Centre’s three farm laws. If any other party had been in power, they could hold a meeting with farmers to end the deadlock,” Tikait added.Tikait said BJP stalwarts like LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi are confined in a “jail” and are not allowed to speak.“Leaders who had been raising voices of people when they were in Opposition are not allowed to speak when their party is in power. The government wants to shift the farm agitation from Delhi borders to Haryana-Punjab borders. That’s why the BJP leaders are provoking farmers in these areas,” Tikait said.Reacting sharply to more than 100 farmers being booked on sedition charges, Tikait said the Supreme Court has questioned the relevance of sedition law, terming it ‘colonial’. “But the Haryana government has imposed the colonial law on farmers to stop the dissent voice,” he added.“We will hold a mahapanchayat in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut on September 5 to launch a mission against BJP in UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab, where assembly polls are due,” he added.In the afternoon, a 20-member committee of farmers met officials of the Sirsa administration to discuss the release of arrested farmers. The meeting ended without any result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/union-govt-being-run-by-corporates-tikait-at-sirsa-mahapanchayat-101626546620722.html
18-07-2021||Lucknow||‘Kanwar sanghs have cancelled yatra’: Uttar Pradesh govt||The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced that the Kanwar sanghs (associations of pilgrims) have cancelled this year’s Kanwar Yatra on the appeal of the state government. The state government’s additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said this in a short statement issued on Saturday evening. The yatra was scheduled to start on July 25. “The Kanwar Yatra has been cancelled by the Kanwar sanghs on the appeal of the Uttar Pradesh government,” Sehgal said.The Uttar Pradesh government spoke to Kanwar sanghs in various districts since the Supreme Court on Friday nudged it to reconsider the state’s decision to hold the yatra despite Covid-19 concerns. The top court asked the state government to inform it by July 19 whether it would reconsider its decision to hold a “symbolic” Kanwar Yatra. The annual pilgrimage held in the Hindu holy month of Shravan involves Lord Shiva devotees generally walking barefoot with pitchers of holy water from the Ganga or other rivers hung on Kanwars (bamboo or wooden slings) and then offering the water to the deity at Shiva temples. Sehgal said that last year, too, the Kanwar sanghs had cancelled the yatra. On Tuesday, the Uttarakhand government cancelled this year’s Yatra but the UP government said the Yatra was allowed in Uttar Pradesh with Covid safety protocols. Following this, the Supreme Court took cognizance of the issue and, on Friday, asked the UP government to reconsider its decision to allow the Kanwar Yatra in the state with a limited number of pilgrims. The apex court asked the government to consider a complete ban on the physical movement of kanwariyas in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kanwar-sanghs-cancel-yatra-uttar-pradesh-govt-101626546559270.html

Parliament will convene for the monsoon session on July 19. “A nine-member delegation will meet Delhi police officials at around 12 noon tomorrow to discuss the proposed protest and how it can be conducted peacefully,” an SKM member said, asking not to be named.Demonstrations near Parliament are not allowed.According to SKM, from July 22 onwards, batches of 200 farmer volunteers and leaders will march towards the Parliament in a peaceful manner. The daily batches of protesters will comprise farmer leaders and volunteers drawn from various organisation across the protest camps at Delhi borders.A special protest march has also been scheduled on July 26 and August 9 by women farmer leaders and volunteers.This will be the second interaction between the farmers and the Delhi police after the two sides held a series of meetings ahead of the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 on the occasion of Republic Day this year. The rally descended into chaos with the several groups of farmers straying from the pre-decided route and clashing with the police at several points in the Capital, including the Red Fort.Thousands of farmers are protesting on Delhi borders since November last year against the three farm laws that seek to deregulate farm trade. The farmers want the three agricultural laws repealed, and say that the legislation will leave them at the mercy of large corporations. The government has said the laws will bring competition and widen farmers’ access to markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-may-meet-delhi-police-today-to-discuss-july-22-march-to-parliament-101626545177000.html

However, the 10% discount offer is going to go live for the public from Friday even as its final round of testing will start from Monday, and will last for 2-3 days, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.In the same meeting, the Cabinet also approved the bid for procurement of 160 low-floor air conditioned buses that will be on the roads by November.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the government has revamped the One Delhi app which, in addition to e-ticketing, will also show real time information and ETA of buses and the nearest available EV (electric vehicles) charging stations. Passengers can also book pink tickets, meant for female passengers as their journeys are free of cost. Besides, monthly or yearly bus passes can also be issued using the app by just scanning the QR code inside the bus, and selecting ticket fare or source and the destination stop. The app is available both in English and Hindi.“The Delhi government, in the past few years, has been striving to revolutionise how public transport is perceived in the country. The Cabinet’s decision is a welcome step especially in the middle of the ongoing pandemic, to reduce the spread of the virus through surface contact. When we launched the common mobility card in 2018, we saw a large number of private car users shift to public transport. I am hoping that state of the art buses, with increased surveillance and safety features, and right incentives like the ones we’re offering through e-ticketing apps and the common mobility card, will be a much-needed push for the people of Delhi to adopt public vehicles as their default mode of transport,” said Gahlot.The Delhi government’s contactless ticketing app has been undergoing extensive trials under a special task force since July 2020, and initial trials have shown that tickets booked through the app account for 6% of total ticketing being done, a government spokesperson said.Delhi has a combined (DTC and cluster) fleet size of 6,750 and witnesses an average daily ridership of 4.9 million passengers, which is more than Metro’s average daily ridership of about 2.5 million.A senior transport official said the move is also expected to save the government’s revenue on printing, manpower and data storage. The department also envisages the app-based ticketing system to help in generation of better passenger on-boarding data that can be analysed to rationalise routes and provide better services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/book-tickets-on-app-get-10-discount-on-bus-fares-in-delhi-101626545116983.html

The new chairperson will review it once. The tariff order is, otherwise, ready and there is unlikely to be any hike in electricity charges this time again,” said the official on condition of anonymity.The annual revision of electricity tariffs in Delhi has been delayed by nearly three months.

Separate FIRs are registered against these vehicle owners. Of the 17, 12 were using fake number plates, two were using unregistered vehicles and three were found allegedly plying stolen vehicles.The exercise to go door-to-door was initiated after traffic police officials found that several e-challans, in the past six years, had not been reached the violator and was being delivered to someone else.“We verify the addresses and issue a notice to pay the fine amount. There are several addresses where the vehicle owners have moved out or have meddled with the number plates to mislead the traffic officers and cameras,” said Kishore Shinde, senior police inspector of Mankhurd traffic station.Traffic police officers now realise that this could be one of the reasons why the e-challan system was not operating efficiently and had a backlog of 2.9 million unpaid e-challans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-traffic-cops-to-go-door-to-door-to-collect-2-9-million-unpaid-echallans-101626543616896.html

18-07-2021||Pune||Your space: Reopen schools in Covid-safe areas||The Maharashtra government has barred private schools from hiking fees for the academic year 2021-22. A recent survey shows majority of parents prefer offline classes if Covid norms are followed. What steps should the government take to ensure parents are not financially strained; students get quality education and private schools stay afloat. No clarity from school administration There is no clarity from school administration. They are still charging miscellaneous fees like meal and transport charges. It is unclear what has been waived and what is still there. When we reach out to schools, they say it’s only a relaxation in time and not the fee amount. The state government should intervene and instruct schools to charge only tuition fee. We are ready to send children to schools provided Covid norms are in place. Priorities for education-focused efforts after the coronavirus pandemic should include ensuring that school infrastructure and facilities are safe, and measures are in place to prevent the spread of disease in the event of a future outbreak. Jyoti Shinde Fee issue should be addressed on priority We have to accept the new normal life and protect our children from the deadly virus. The elders have to venture out for a living. Parents, government and school administration should have to find a way to restart schools and free children from the lockdown. We need to find an amicable solution instead of blaming each other. The fee issue should be addressed on priority and other aspects in a phase-wise manner. Mayur Patil Reopen schools after proper planning Many kids are bored of online classes and want to rejoin schools. In the new normal, we have to find some solution. All are mentally prepared to face the situation. The government should frame SOPs (standard operating procedure) for school education. As lockdowns ease and schools start to reopen in some places across our region, it’s as good a time as any to take stock and look at the likely future of education. School reopening plans should account for underlying risk factors, including student attendance rates, percentage of economically disadvantaged students, student-teacher ratio, average years of teacher experience, and the presence of vulnerable groups, including girls. Poonam Gaikwad Paradigm shift in school education To succeed in life and at work, they will need all the social, emotional and academic support via rich and flexible learning experiences that will differ vastly from schooldays of their parents. Before Covid-19, the focus has been heavily weighted on classroom experience. I think we will see a shift where schools will create a foundation of inclusive, flexible, data-driven buildings and spaces that will enable students to learn beyond those walls. Omer Shah Evolve new ways of teaching There are teachers who teach in the traditional way. And there are great teachers who are also model learners. They learn with the kids. They don’t feel like they have to know everything, but they have to show what great learning looks like. Overall, it means inspiring students onto a path of lifelong self-learning. And that can include learning about new technology, which they can learn with the kids. If they can explore new ways of doing things, they can all grow together. Sandy Patole Education has gone beyond classroom In many ways, the classroom has become a physical barrier and just a way of holding onto the past. We are no longer bound by limitations that used to require us to have 30 kids in a classroom with one teacher. Now we can rethink that model. It can be multiple teachers with multiple kids. They can be places where kids can move around more flexibly. They don’t have to do the same thing at the same time in the same way. Schools have been exploring this for some time – technology changes the success rate. Sahir Sayyad Plan dynamic mode of education Water and hygiene facilities will be a crucial part of schools reopening safely. Administrators should look at opportunities to improve hygiene measures, including handwashing, respiratory etiquette (coughing and sneezing into the elbow), physical distancing measures, cleaning procedures for facilities and safe food preparation practices. Administrative staff and teachers should also be trained on physical distancing and school hygiene practices. The ability of teachers to keep adapting and innovating will be crucial. What we want educators to do is not be bound by the structure of a 40-minute lecture, classroom dynamic, or assessment that’s connected to a curriculum, but recognize their goal and mission to expand upon every student’s potential. Shrikant Hingane Reopen schools under strict safety norms Considering that many countries are starting to slowly lift restrictions on activities, the long-term effects of keeping schools open on community transmission are yet to be evaluated. Some modelling studies suggest that school reopening might have a minor effect on wider transmission in the community, but this is not well understood. Further studies are underway on the role of children in transmission in and outside of educational settings. Government should promote and put in place respiratory and hand hygiene, physical distancing measures and use of masks in transportation such as school buses, in accordance with local policy. Government or local authority should have to provide tips for how to safely commute to and from school, including for public transportation. Organise only one child per seat and ensure physical distancing of at least 1 metre between passengers in school buses, if possible. This may require more school buses per school and if possible and safe, keep the windows of the buses, vans, and other vehicles open. Reshma Gore Restart schools on trial basis In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of Covid-19 and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, school administration should have to report, monitor, rapid testing and tracing of suspected cases. Most of the parents and students don’t want remote teaching. Children are desperate to go to school. Even parents are ready to send their children to schools. Therefore, the government should have to make a firm decision and restart school at least a few days a week on a trial basis. School administration should have to fix timetables and call each class on alternate days. Sanjay Sharma Prepare flexible mode of school education It’s crucial that schools plan ahead and look at what additional measures they can put in place to help ensure students, teachers and other staff are safe when they return and communities are confident in sending their students back to school. Going back to school will likely look a little different from what you and your child were used to before. It’s possible that schools may reopen for a period of time and then a decision may be made to close them again temporarily, depending on the local context. Because of the evolving situation, authorities will need to be flexible and ready to adapt to help keep every child safe. Shrikant Dalwale Strengthen future learning trends Schools at the centre of a community ecosystem of learning and support is an idea whose time has come, and some of the emerging practices amid Covid-19, such as empowering parents to support their children’s education, should be sustained when the pandemic subsides. School administration should have to engage students in accelerated learning interventions to reverse crisis-related learning loss and strengthen future learning trends. They should have to engage teachers in training and coaching so they can help students catch up, and ensure that school environments are safe and protected and engage parents by capitalising on their current involvement in remote learning to improve future outcomes.

18-07-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Marathi theatre and political insensitivity||I was actually writing about something else, something more “light-hearted” when I read the news that a political programme took place at Kalidas Natyagruh in Nashik which was attended by the former chief minister and a current minister in the state cabinet. By attended, I mean that they were on stage and gave speeches. Shortly thereafter pictures of the event started circulating. And I just could not get myself to write the piece that I was writing. It is common knowledge that one of the worst hit sectors in this pandemic is the entertainment sector. The worst hit amongst the entertainment sector is theatre. There are a large number of people who depend on theatre for their daily meal. During the first wave, the official association of backstage workers in Mumbai reported that they had nearly seven hundred plus members. This includes make-up artists, light, sound and music operators, set labour and the likes who earn (or “earned”) on a daily basis. A large number of theatre artists came forward and started various funds for them. It ranged from providing a monthly stipend to workers, groceries. Some even helped out onstage artists who had no other means of supporting themselves. After a long hiatus, theatres restarted briefly at fifty per cent capacity. Even the audience was supportive and co-operated in every way possible. But the second wave seems to have crushed not only the activity but also the resolve of many theatre artists. During the first wave, artists had adapted to the online form of performance. Though it was in no way a substitute for the real experience, it still showed that we were not ready to give up. I believe one of the reasons this has not happened during the second wave is because of the constant uncertainty. Not to forget the fact that most of us were affected directly by the second wave. Towards the end of the previous year, theatres had become operational again and we were slowly but surely inching back towards normalcy. But after the second lockdown, even though things have started opening up again, the unlock procedure seems random. For theatre to survive it requires dedicated theatre practitioners and a loyal audience. But it also requires the state support. The only reasons that it has thrived in so many countries in the West is because it is an organised sector. There are laws, rules, unions, concessions, insurance policies for theatre artists. There is nothing of that sort here. But these are just normal everyday problems associated with theatre. I know that there is nothing new in the paragraph I wrote earlier. But despite all this, there are people who practice it regularly and sincerely. I am also aware of the counter-argument, that nobody has forced anyone to be a theatre-practitioner. They can do something else and provide for themselves and their families. True. And many of us have! So many have done all sorts of odd jobs too. But then we would be losing out on an art form, a part of our culture and a means of expression too. That is unacceptable. And if we are to talk in terms of money then theatre has the potential to be a major revenue earner for the state, but unfortunately that is completely overlooked. But let us keep all this aside for a moment. When it is public knowledge that theatre artists are grappling everywhere in the state, how can our leaders be so insensitive and organise a programme in a venue that is made for theatre performances? And how come that is not a safety hazard? And that includes leaders from the current government as well as the opposition! Then we know what to expect even if there is a change in power. It is high time that theatre practitioners unite under a single banner and leave aside their disputes that seem petty now. Many of the influential artists are affiliated to different political parties. But this event at Nashik has showed that the insensitivity is beyond political parties and ideologies. If this incident does not spark a movement, a permanent change, then I am afraid that the time and resolve for any kind of change is past us. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-marathi-theatre-and-political-insensitivity-101626523756160.html
18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Narrow escape for Chandigarh BJP leaders as farmers damage vehicles||In the first such incident in Chandigarh, farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws attacked the vehicles of BJP leader Sanjay Tandon and mayor Ravi Kant Sharma on Saturday. Police said Tandon and Sharma escaped unhurt but their vehicles were damaged in the incident at the Motor Market in Sector 48. At least 250 members of the Naujawan Kisan Ekta were rounded up for the attack and taken to the Sector 31 police station. While police are working to identify those who attacked the leaders, they have registered a case against 25 people by names. “We have booked 25 persons and those involved in the attack are being identified. No one will be allowed to disrupt the law and order,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. The FIR has been lodged under Sections 147, 148, 149, 341, 427, 307, 506, 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 49 police station. A tractor of the protesters has been impounded. Also read: Tipped to be Punjab Congress chief, Sidhu meets Jakhar for ‘guidance’Were attending a thanksgiving function by tradersSince Friday, a video had been doing the rounds, appealing farmers to gather at the Motor Market where a function will be organised to honour BJP leaders. The party had apprised the police of the video and after assurance from senior police officials, its leaders had gone for the function. As soon as their vehicles drove in, the protesters, carrying black flags under the banner of Naujawan Kisan Ekta, raised slogans against them. “The market association of Sector 48 had organised a thanksgiving programme to honour BJP leaders. When we reached the venue, protesters were gathered there but they were stopped by police. Through the one hour of the function, the protesters continued to raise slogans and even played loud music to disturb the event,” said Ravi Kant Sharma, Chandigarh mayor. As soon as he and Tandon left the venue in separate cars, the protesters armed with bricks, stones and lathis attacked their vehicles, damaging both front and rear windshields. Sharma said a protester lied down before his official vehicle and others managed to open a door. “A youth armed with an iron rod even tried to enter but was restrained. These were goons carrying out the attack under the garb of farmers’ agitation,” he alleged. Police caught unprepared?Raising concerns over the police arrangements, Tandon said, “Someone has to be answerable for this. The police were told well in advance about the video, but still there were lapses, which led to the attack. I have apprised home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda about the incident.” On the police’s part, SSP Chahal said adequate force was deployed and action was underway against the attackers.SKM demands immediate release of farmers Sanyukat Kisan Morcha leader and president of All India Kisan Federation (AIKF) Prem Singh Bhangu and Vipin Kumar, a member of the Lawyers’ Defence Committee for Farmers, in joint statement strongly condemned the use of police force against farmers who were protesting peacefully. Stating that one farmer was injured and 25 were arrested, they demanded the immediate release of the arrested farmers, withdrawal of the case registered against them and peaceful resolution of the incident through negotiation with farmers. Saturday’s incident is the latest in the backlash that BJP leaders have been facing from farmers in the agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana against the Centre’s farm laws.On June 26, police had to use water cannons to disperse protesting farmers when they broke barricades on the Chandigarh-Mohali border in a bid to march towards the Punjab Raj Bhawan to hand over a memorandum to governor VP Singh Badnore, demanding the repeal of the farm laws. The protesters, led by Balbir Singh Rajewal, were stopped near Sector 17 in the heart of Chandigarh and prevented from heading to Raj Bhawan. Finally, Rajewal handed over the memorandum to the Chandigarh deputy commissioner for giving it to the governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/narrow-escape-for-chandigarh-bjp-leaders-farmers-damage-vehicles-101626518656540.html
18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Cong chief decision binding, Sidhu must apologise: Capt||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has refused to meet former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, seen as a favourite to become the new Punjab Congress president, till he tenders a public apology for his offensive tweets and statements against him. Capt Amarinder, who is upset over the central leadership’s handling of factionalism in the Punjab Congress ahead of the elections, told this to Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs, during a meeting on the impending revamp of the state unit, said Congress sources. Rawat, one of the three members of the panel set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to resolve the crisis, discussed with the chief minister the names of probables and urged him to have a meeting with Sidhu, but Amarinder refused to meet him. “Capt told the state in-charge that he will not meet Sidhu till he tenders a public apology for putting out hundreds of derogatory tweets and statements in the media against him,” said a person aware of discussions between the two leaders. Capt’s annoyance with Sidhu pertains to the latter’s tweets and a spate of media interviews accusing the CM of colluding with Badals, promoting mafia raj and allowing corruption in the government. Though several ministers had demanded action against Sidhu for repeatedly targeting the chief minister in public, the high command was not seen to have acted on this. Also read: Hoardings greeting Navjot Sidhu as PPCC chief spring up in Amritsar‘New state chief will be accepted by all’The two-time CM, who is opposed to having his trenchant critic in the top party position in the state, also told Rawat that the appointment of the new state chief was the prerogative of the Congress president. “Had a fruitful meeting with @harishrawatcmuk. Reiterating that any decision of @INCIndia President will be acceptable to all. Raised certain issues which he said he’ll take up with @INCIndia president: @capt_amarinder,” the CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted. Amarinder had, in a letter to Sonia on Friday, cautioned the central leadership that if Sidhu, a Jat Sikh like him, is appointed the state unit chief, it could lead to a split in the party, besides making a mention of resentment over the neglect of senior and traditional Congressmen. He has repeatedly advocated for a Hindu face for the position. The party high command is said to be working on a truce formula of four “working presidents” with the state chief to balance the caste and religious equations. In his meeting with Rawat, Amarinder again conveyed his displeasure over the way the central leadership handled the infighting, particularly insufficient consultation, premature announcements and deliberate leaks, said the people quoted above. Also read: Party will suffer if Sidhu is made state unit chief: Captain to SoniaSidhu’s meeting spreeSidhu, who seems confident of his appointment and prepping to hit the ground running, set out from Patiala in the morning to meet party leaders and his first of port of call was the incumbent state chief Sunil Jakhar’s residence in Panchkula. The meeting lasted nearly 45 minutes during which he sought Jakhar’s support and margdarshan (guidance). “He (Jakhar) is an elder brother and a guiding force,” Sidhu told reporters after they came out together. Jakhar also said that Sidhu is “very capable and does not need any guidance”. Jakhar, appointed president of the state Congress in May 2017, was considered close to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. The two drew apart in the past four months following the state chief’s criticism of some of the CM’s decisions. Thereafter, Sidhu reached cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s residence in Chandigarh where party MLAs Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Barindermeet Singh Pahra, Devender Singh Ghubaya, Kulbir Singh Zira, Darshan Singh Brar were already represent. “Sidhu said that he has been told by the high command to start working,” one of them said. The Amritsar East MLA later also visited cabinet ministers Balbir Singh Sidhu, Gurpreet Singh Kangar and and Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh before heading back to Patiala with Warring, Brar, Zira and Ghubaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tipped-to-be-punjab-congress-chief-sidhu-meets-jakhar-for-guidance-101626507676296.html

It added that foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood had met the Afghan envoy on Sunday to brief him on all the steps taken by Pakistan and to reassure him of full cooperation. “We hope that the government of Afghanistan would reconsider its decision,” the Foreign Office said.Saleh said in a tweet: “President @ashrafghani instructed @mfa_afghanistan to call back our ambassador from Islamabad along with all senior diplomats. The abduction of Afgh ambassador’s daughter & her subsequent torture has wounded the psyche of our nation. Our national psyche has been tortured.”He added in another tweet, “This isn’t the first case but the first spectacular case involving a lady. Harassment of diplmts/local staff with integrity who reject collaboration is in the menu of Islamabad agencies.”On Saturday, Afghanistan had demanded full security for its diplomats in Pakistan after Selsela Alikhil, 26, the daughter of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil, was abducted, held for almost five hours and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad on Friday.The Afghan foreign ministry had summoned Pakistani ambassador Mansoor Ahmad Khan in Kabul to lodge a strong protest over what it described as a “grave incident”. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had described the incident as an act of “man-handling” and said police have launched an investigation.A statement made by Selsela Alikhil said she was kidnapped when she boarded a taxi at Blue Area, a commercial district in Islamabad located a short distance from the Parliament. She said an unidentified man who was let into the taxi by the driver had beaten her and called her the daughter of a communist.A medical report stated she had injuries to her wrists, ankles and head.The latest downturn in bilateral ties came days after President Ghani accused Pakistan of not taking action to prevent the “influx of over 10,000 jihadi fighters” in the past month and not delivering on repeated assurances to use its power to influence the Taliban to join negotiations. Ghani made the allegations at a regional conference in Uzbekistan while Prime Minister Imran Khan was in the audience....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-recalls-envoy-diplomats-from-pakistan-after-kidnapping-of-ambassador-s-daughter-101626630382231.html

This is almost double the last record of the fastest internet speed in the world held by researchers from the University College of London. The speed was 178 Tbps.What 319 terabytes per second mean:1. The full form of Tbps is terabytes per second. One terabyte means 1,000 gigabytes. One gigabyte is 1024 megabytes.2. According to a report of 2020, the highest mobile broadband speed was experienced in South Korea, which was around 100 Mbps (megabytes per second).3. The same report said Singapore had the highest fixed-line broadband speed, which was 2015 Mbps.4. Hong Kong, according to the report, had an internet speed of 210.73 Mbps and Romania had 194.47 Mbps speed.5. India's download speed was shown as 38.19 Mbps in case of fixed broadband and 12.16 Mbps in case of mobile broadband, the 2020 report said.6. With 178 Tbps, the last-held record of the fastest internet speed, one can download entire Netflix in just one second, reports said. With almost double that speed, entire Netflix will be insufficient for 319 Tbps.6. Many reports said that 319 Tbps means one can download 57,000 full-length movies in 1 second or the entire library of Spotify in less than three seconds.7. Nasa's system runs at 400 gigabytes per second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/downloading-over-50-000-movies-in-a-second-what-japan-s-319-tbps-internet-speed-means-101626627500055.html

The unidentified suspect entered the store, filled a bag with candles and then started spraying people with mace.“This is an only in Miami story,” Doral Police spokesman Rey Valdes told the Miami Herald. “You can’t make this up.”About 35 people were affected. Some were taken to hospitals for treatment, including the store manager, but officials were not sure how many or whether any had to be admitted. Bear mace is a strong irritant to a person's eyes and respiratory system.A portion of the mall was evacuated after the macing Saturday.

18-07-2021||World||Japan sets internet speed record by transferring 319 Tb/s over 3,001 km||Researchers in Japan have demonstrated an internet speed of 319 terabits per second, setting a world record. A team of researchers at Japan’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) used advanced fiber optic technology with a 4-core optical fibre of standard outer diameter of 0.125 mm to perform the speed test, breaking the previous record of 178 Tb/s set by engineers in Japan and Britain a year ago.To achieve the record speed, the researchers constructed a recirculating transmission loop experimental set-up by combining two kinds of rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers. The combination of erbium and thulium doped-fiber amplifiers and distributed Raman amplification enabled a long-distance transmission over 3,001 km.“The 4-core MCF with standard cladding diameter is attractive for early adoption of SDM fibers in high-throughput, long-distance links, since it is compatible with conventional cable infrastructure and expected to have mechanical reliability comparable to single-mode fibers,” the Japanese research institute said in a paper published earlier this month.NICT stressed that it was crucial to demonstrate how new fibers can meet the demand of apparent “explosive increase” from new data services. The research institute further noted that the result from the latest internet speed test will help the realisation of new communication systems that can support the new “bandwidth hungry services,” adding that they will continue to explore ways to further increase the transmission capacity of “low-core-count multi-core fibers and other novel SDM fibers.”“Further, we will work to extend the transmission range to trans-oceanic distances,” NICT said.The research paper was published at the International Conference on Optical Fiber Communication which was held virtually from June 6-11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-sets-internet-speed-record-by-transferring-319-tb-s-over-3-001-km-101626625183592.html
18-07-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson's U-turn on plan to skip quarantine after Covid exposure||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak will both self-isolate in line with national guidance, abandoning heavily criticised plans to take part in a pilot scheme that would have allowed them to continue working.The U-turn comes a day after health minister Sajid Javid said he had tested positive for COVID-19 and at a time when the government's coronavirus response is under intense scrutiny.Almost all remaining restrictions in England will be lifted on Monday despite a surge in infections as ministers put their faith in the advanced vaccine programme.Cases are rising by more than 50,000 a day and hundreds of thousands of Britons are being asked to self isolate for 10 days, causing havoc for employers and parents, prompting train cancellations and forcing some businesses to close their doors.The government announced at 0700 GMT that Johnson and Sunak had been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and would take part in a trial scheme that allowed them to keep working instead of self-isolating.But less than three hours later that decision had been reversed after a flurry of criticism from voters, political opponents and business owners."We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme... but I think it's far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules," Johnson said in a video message from his country residence, where he will isolate until July 26.Opposition politicians had said it was hypocritical for Johnson and Sunak to have tried to exempt themselves from some of the rules."Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have been busted yet again for thinking the rules that we are all following don’t apply to them," said Labour Party leader Keir Starmer.Sunak also acknowledged the backlash over their initial decision."I recognise that even the sense that the rules aren’t the same for everyone is wrong," he said on Twitter.The government's handling of the pandemic has been dogged with episodes that have damaged public trust - most recently when then-health minister Matt Hancock was pictured kissing an adviser, in breach of social distancing regulations. He later resigned.Housing minister Robert Jenrick confirmed that the government would go ahead with its "freedom day" plan on Monday, removing the requirement to wear face masks, lifting limits on social gatherings and allowing high-risk businesses to reopen.Johnson used his video message to plead with the public to take a cautious approach to the change of rules."Please, please, please, be cautious," he said."Go forward tomorrow into the next step with all the right prudence and respect for other people, for the risks that the disease continues to present and, above all, please, please, please when you're asked to get that second jab ... please come forward and do it."Ministers argue that the vaccination programme, under which 87.8% of the adult population has had one vaccine and 67.8% have been double vaccinated, has largely broken the link between cases and mortality."The last time we had cases at the level we do today, the number of people dying from the virus was 30 times the number it is today," Jenrick told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-s-u-turn-on-plan-to-skip-quarantine-after-covid-exposure-101626620830280.html

A Beijing-based veterinary surgeon was infected with the virus after he dissected two dead monkeys in early March, according to China CDC Weekly.The 53-year-old veterinarian started experiencing nausea and vomiting and a month later, fever and neurological symptoms followed. He visited several hospitals but eventually died on May 27, China CDC Weekly revealed Saturday.Around mid-April, researchers collected cerebrospinal fluid from the patient for next-generation sequencing and the readings suggested possible alphaherpesvirus infection. They also collected several specimens including blister fluid, blood, nasal swab, throat swab, and plasma to further identify the etiological agent.The samples were sent to the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (IVDC) of China CDC. The IVDC conducted four sets of RT-PCR to detect BV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), monkeypox virus and orthopoxvirus, however, the sample tested positive only for BV.Also Read | Rare but not alarming: All you need to know about monkeypox found in TexasAll close contacts of the patient are reported to have tested negative for the virus and are safe from it, for now, reported Global Times.

Many airfields under Americans including the Bagram air base which have been vacated due to the ongoing power tussle with the Taliban.The Indian workers involved in civil works have also been asked to move out. Indian public sector company WAPCOS had some officials there for dam projects. India had recently also announced works worth around $350 million including the Shahtoot dam for providing drinking water to the city of Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-fighters-taliban-told-to-target-india-built-assets-in-afghanistan-report-101626609876295.html
18-07-2021||World||Bitcoin a climate calamity? UN experts see sustainable development in cryptocurrencies||Despite issues of greenhouse gases produced in Bitcoin mining, the United Nations believes that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could play an important role in sustainable development.In recent months, many people around the world have raised concerns about Bitcoin mining, an energy-intensive process that involves using powerful computers round the clock to solve complex mathematical problems. Citing environmental concerns, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his company would no longer accept Bitcoin. This led to a collapse in Bitcoin’s market value, which was earlier skyrocketing on the back of confidence shown by the same tech billionaire.Tim Berners-Lee, who wrote the source code of the World Wide Web, described Bitcoin mining as “one of the most fundamentally pointless ways of using energy.”Why does the Bitcoin network require a staggering amount of energy?Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that has no physical existence. New Bitcoins are brought into circulation as a reward for a process known as 'mining'. The proof of transaction in cryptocurrencies is not stored in a central database, rather stored in a block and recorded by a distributed network of miners.The miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins for each block they mine successfully. Recording a block involves solving mathematical problems which get more complex with each mining. Over the years, the algorithms kept getting longer and more complex, requiring special computers with colossal processing powers to record the block.Naturally, such processes are energy-extensive and often rely on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. As per an estimate by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining consumes more than 178 (TWh) annually.Also Read | Tesla suspends Bitcoin use. Here's how mining cryptocurrency affects the climateWhat does the UN say?The UN experts believe that cryptocurrencies could actually improve their stewardship of the environment. In a report last month, the United Nations said that transparency is one of the most useful aspects of cryptocurrencies and can provide a trusted record of transactions, especially in countries with weak institutions and high levels of corruption. The World Food Programme (WFP) has found that blockchain technology can help ensure that cash gets to those who need it most.It could be also helpful in protecting the environment since it has been used as a tool to eliminate illegal fishing in the tuna industry. The UN experts believe that the technology could provide a transparent way to show how countries around the world are taking action to reduce their impact on the climate.On the issue of power consumption, the UN noted that many players in the industry are working to address it by switching to a different method to verify transactions. According to the report, the Ethereum Foundation has said that the energy cost of each transaction could be cut by 99.95% by switching to a different method called Proof of Stake, or PoS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-a-climate-calamity-un-experts-see-sustainable-development-in-cryptocurrencies-101626605165317.html

The 15 new research studies will allow researchers across the United Kingdom to draw together their expertise from analysis long Covid among those suffering long-term effects,” the department stated in a press release.The release further said that the programs will focus on several aspects, including efforts to understand the condition better and identify it, the evaluation of different treatments, as well as measures to ensure better integration of specialist, hospital and community services for people with long Covid.The announcement by the Department of Health comes in the wake of a latest study which stated that while many people can fully recover from Covid-19, a significant portion of people continue to experience its symptoms for “several months.” The aim of launching these studies is to help those affected return to normal lives, the release further stated.In recent days, the UK has seen a fresh uptick in daily coronavirus infections, driven primarily by the Delta variant which was first found in India last year. Despite this, virtually all Covid-19 restrictions will come to an end on July 19, as confirmed by the government earlier this week. However, experts, alarmed at the rise in daily cases, have urged prime minister Boris Johnson’s administration to continue with certain safety measures, with former health secretary Jeremy Hunt warning that a lockdown “may have to be re-imposed.”(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-announces-15-new-research-programs-to-study-long-covid-101626604632728.html
18-07-2021||World||Europe: Death toll due to flooding climbs to over 180||BERLIN (AP) — The death toll from flooding in Western Europe climbed above 180 on Sunday after rescue workers dug deeper into debris left by receding waters.Police put the toll from the hard-hit Ahrweiler area of western Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate state at more than 110 and said they feared the number may still rise. In neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany's most populous, 45 people were confirmed dead, including four firefighters. And Belgium has confirmed 27 casualties.Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to visit Schuld, a village near Ahrweiler that was devastated by the flooding, later Sunday. Her visit comes after Germany's president went to the area on Saturday and made clear that it will need long-term support.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he will propose a package of immediate aid at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, telling the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that more than 300 million euros ($354 million) will be needed. And he said that officials must start setting up a rebuilding program which, from experience with previous flooding, will be in the billions of euros.Although rain has stopped in the worst-affected areas of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, storms and downpours have persisted in other parts of western and central Europe. There was flooding Saturday night in the German-Czech border area, across the country from where last week's floods hit, and in Germany's southeastern corner and over the border in Austria.Some 65 people were evacuated in Germany's Berchtesgaden area after the Ache River swelled. At least one person was killed.A flash flood swept through the nearby Austrian town of Hallein late Saturday, but there were no reports of casualties.Heavy rain and storms caused serious damage in several parts of Austria.Climate scientists say the link between extreme weather and global warming is unmistakable and the urgency to do something about climate change undeniable.Scientists can’t yet say for sure whether climate change caused the flooding, but they insist that it certainly exacerbates the extreme weather that has been on show around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-death-toll-due-to-flooding-climbs-to-over-180-101626598212130.html

The researchers comprising those from Royal Holloway, University of London, analysed the encryption protocols used by Telegram and highlighted the vulnerabilities in its cloud chats.Telegram said it acknowledged the vulerabilities highlighted by the researchers and fixed them in latest update. The platform uses MTProto protocol to secure its cloud chats, something like the Transport Layer Security (TLS), a popular cryptographic standard meant to ensure security of data in transit.Explaining what they set out the achieve, the researchers said in their study that they launched four attacks on the security protocols used by the popular messaging app and the last one "broke the authentication properties of Telegram’s key exchange, allowing a MitM attack"."Telegram uses its MTProto “record layer” - offering protection based on symmetric cryptographic techniques - for two different types of chats. By default, messages are encrypted and authenticated between a client and a server, but not end-to-end encrypted: such chats are referred to as cloud chats," said the study.They said though the platform offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) through a feature called "secret chats", the cloud chats aren't encrypted. They then described the methods used to attack Telegram's security protocol and how they succeeded.The vulnerabilities gave an adversary the chance to "reorder" messages, said researchers, adding that it can allow the hackers to manipulate Telegram bots. The messaging app uses cloud chats to control several automated bots.“The latest versions of official Telegram apps already contain the changes that make the four observations made by the researchers no longer relevant," Telegram wrote in a blog post on Friday.Apps like Telegram and Signal have seen massive surge in downloads and usage after WhatsApp updated its privacy policy that included a controversial change of linking data of WhatsApp users to Facebook's other products and services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/telegram-vulnerabilities-highlighted-by-researchers-platform-says-issue-fixed-101626596188613.html
18-07-2021||World||Explained: How to become a space tourist and the cost||Space will soon become a place, not just for astronauts but also tourists who can book a flight to go to the edge of unknown and take experience of a lifetime. Two billionaires - Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are taking early strides to open up the frontier for space tourism.While Branson successfully spent some time at the edge of the space, Bezos - through his other company Blue Origin - will undertake the journey on July 23.The nearly 11-minute flight will see Blue Origin crossing the Karman Line, 100 kilometres above, from where the limit of the space starts and descend through a parachute to a desert in Texas.What will it take to become a space tourist?Nothing much actually. The person interested to go to space should be in reasonable shape. Virgin Galactic has said that its training will last for five days during which the astronauts will learn how to make the most of time spent in microgravity, as well as how to be safe and comfortable during periods of high acceleration. The company will also keep aerospace medical experts on hand to offer advice and help and check pre-flight fitness.Blue Origin, meanwhile, will teach the potential astronauts everything they need to know for the space visit. Though it has not listed the day-wise training schedule, Blue Origin expects the participants to be able to climb seven flights of stairs (the height of the launch tower) in under 90 seconds. It has also prescribed a height requirement between 5'0" and 110 pounds (152 centimetres and 50 kilograms) and 6'4" and 223 pounds (193 cm and 100 kg).What will be the cost?This is the part which takes space tourism to selct few. Virgin Galactic sold the initial tickets at $200,000 to $250,000 each. And it has warned that the price will increase in the future. The company has so far sold 600 tickets.Blue Origin has so far not announced the price of its tickets.For those looking for a cheaper option, Florida-based company Space Perspective is taking space tourists on its Spaceship Neptune - a balloon-shaped pressurised capsule - for $125,000 a seat. However, the capsule will ascend only 19 miles - far from the boundary of space, and weightlessness. Still, 300 seats for 2024 have all been sold.How soon can space tourism begin?Virgin Galactic has said it will launch regular commercial flights from 2022, after two more test flights. Once the full-fledged operations are launched, the goal is ambitious: 400 flights per year.As for Blue Origin, no detailed calendar has been announced. The company's spokesperson, however, said earlier that they plan to launch their operations in 2022.What about Elon Musk?Musk and his company SpaceX is also getting into the space tourism game, but its plans involve journeys that are far longer. The costs are also predicted to be astronomical - tens of millions of dollars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-to-become-a-space-tourist-and-the-cost-101626594084634.html
18-07-2021||World||Covid-19 virus piggybacks only black carbon emission, says study||A new study has suggested that Covid-19 virus piggybacks only black carbon emitted during biomass burning and not all PM2.5 particles. The study, conducted by Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and published in the journal ELSEVIER, is based on data collected from Delhi from September to December last year and the 24-hour average of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and black carbon (BC).PM2.5 are fine particles which penetrate deep into the body and ignite inflammation in the lungs and respiratory tract that leads to the risk of having cardiovascular and respiratory problems including a weak immune system. PM2.5 consists of black carbon, often called soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among others.Several studies have linked air pollution to higher Covid-19 cases. A study carried out in Italy correlated the incidence of coronavirus cases with PM2.5 levels, authors Aditi Rathod and Gufran Beig said, reports news agency PTI."However, in this paper, we argue that not all PM2.5 particles carry the virus. It is only black carbon which is emitted during biomass burning which carries the virus," Beig, senior scientist and founder-project director, System of Air Quality Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), said."Delhi was worst affected by the novel coronavirus infection. However, when the situation was returning to normal after about six months with minimum fatalities, it suddenly encountered a reversal with a 10-fold increase in infection counts, coinciding with the onset of the stubble burning period in neighbouring states," the study noted.The study says that the aged biomass black carbon particles tend to aggregate and react with other compounds to grow in size, providing temporary habitat to viruses leading to the rapid increase in Covid-19 cases, which declined after the crop burning stopped.The researchers found that the concentration of black carbon "directly corresponds to the speed at which infections spread after the onset of winter and stubble burning period and then reduced with a declining trend in BC with reduction in stubble fire counts".The surge in black carbon emission is directly related to the additional contribution of stubble burning-induced PM2.5 concentration transported externally from stubble burning regions, the study stated.In another study conducted earlier, Beig and his co-authors had said that people living in Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are more likely to contract Covid-19 due to prolonged exposure to high concentration of PM 2.5. "Higher number of Covid-19 cases have been found in places like Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh with prolonged exposure to high concentration of PM2.5," the report had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-virus-piggybacks-only-black-carbon-emission-says-study-101626587916926.html
18-07-2021||World||India to Canada: Speed up study permits before new semester starts in September||India has conveyed its concerns to the Canadian government regarding hurdles that more than 33,000 Indian students are facing in their bid to reach Canada in time as the new semester at various universities start in September.The concerns were raised by India’s external affairs ministry with the Canadian high commission in New Delhi, while its Indian counterpart in Ottawa has taken it up with Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry.The final decision on the issue rests entirely with Canadian authorities.While Canadian missions in India have given Indian students priority and booked appointments for them, it appears the process could drag until September or later. It includes submitting biometric details and mandatory medical examination.Earlier, due to Covid-19 lockdowns in Canada, universities allowed international students to attend classes online based on approval-in-principle of their study permits. However, as the situation normalises in Canada due to a fall in coronavirus cases, the educational institutions are no longer accepting delays and advising students to seek deferrals.India has asked Canada to provide additional appointments in July and August to clear the study permit backlog and to request universities to extend their deadlines or take into consideration the delay in getting those documents for reasons beyond the control of the students.India has also linked this to the problem that students are facing in travelling to Canada, due to the absence of direct flights as Ottawa barred them since April 22 over fears of the Delta variant of the virus. Without direct connectivity, students have been forced to travel via other countries and require a negative Covid test result from the last point of departure for Canada before being allowed to board the flight.India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, confirmed that the concerns have been officially conveyed, as he told HT, “We have strongly taken up issues relating to students with the Canadian government as well as universities to facilitate their mobility from India to Canada.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-canada-speed-up-study-permits-before-new-semester-starts-in-september-101626587719695.html

18-07-2021||World||Earth's richest man Bezos to blast off into space on Tuesday||Jeff Bezos, the richest person in the world, is set to join the astronaut club Tuesday on the first crewed launch by Blue Origin, another key moment in a big month for the fledgling space tourism industry.The mission comes days after Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson crossed the final frontier, narrowly besting the Amazon magnate in their battle of the billionaires.Blue Origin's sights are, however, set higher: both literally in terms of the altitude to which its reusable New Shepard craft will ascend compared to Virgin's spaceplane, but also in its future ambitions.Bezos founded Blue Origin back in 2000, with the goal of one day building floating space colonies with artificial gravity where millions of people will work and live.Today, the company is developing a heavy-lift orbital rocket called New Glenn and also a Moon lander it is hoping to contract to NASA under the Artemis program."They've had 15 successful New Shepard uncrewed flights and we've been waiting years to see when they're going to start flying people," Laura Forczyk, founder of space consulting firm Astralytical, told AFP, calling it an "exciting time" for enthusiasts.New Shepard will blast off at 8:00 am Central Time (1300 GMT) on July 20 from a remote facility in the west Texas desert called Launch Site One, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of the nearest town, Van Horn.The event will be live streamed on BlueOrigin.com beginning an hour and a half before.- Richest, oldest and youngest -Joining Bezos on the fully autonomous flight will be barrier-breaking female aviator Wally Funk, who at 82 is set to be the oldest ever astronaut, Dutch teenager Oliver Daemen, the company's first paying customer, who will become the youngest astronaut.Rounding out the four-member crew is Jeff Bezos' brother Mark, a financier who directs the Bezos Family Foundation and works as a volunteer firefighter.The pair are best friends, and Jeff shared the moment he asked his younger sibling to join him in a viral video on Instagram last month.Notably absent is the mysterious winner of a $28 million auction for a seat, who had "scheduling conflicts" and will take part in a future flight, and has asked to remain anonymous, the company said.After lift-off, New Shepard will accelerate towards space at speeds exceeding Mach 3 using a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen engine with no carbon emissions.The capsule soon separates from its booster, and the astronauts unbuckle and begin to experience weightlessness.The crew will spend a few minutes beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, at 62 miles altitude (100 kilometers), as the spacecraft peaks at 65 miles high (106 kilometers).They will be able to admire the curvature of the planet -- and the inky black of the rest of the universe -- from large windows that comprise a third of the cabin's surface area.The booster returns autonomously to a landing pad just north of its launch site, while the capsule freefalls back to Earth before deploying three giant parachutes, and finally a thruster, to land gently in the west Texas desert.- Bigger prizes -Beyond the first flight, relatively little is known about Blue Origin's future tourism plans.The company has a history of secrecy, its existence only becoming public knowledge three years after its creation. It then pursued a policy of "self-imposed silence" until 2015.Unlike Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin hasn't officially started selling tickets -- Daemen won his spot through the auction process. The company wants two more flights this year, then "many more" in 2022, it told AFP.Forczyk, the analyst, said it will all depend on the level of demand that is generated by these early flights, and how well the industry recovers from accidents "which there inevitably will be, because spaceflight is inherently risky."Elon Musk's SpaceX will enter the fray in September with an all-civilian orbital expedition on its Crew Dragon, and is tying up with another company, Axiom, for visits to the International Space Station.Beyond tourism, Blue Origin would like to supplant SpaceX as NASA's leading private sector partner, and sees New Shepard as "sort of the stepping stone and also the way to make money along the way for the greater ambition," said Forczyk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earths-richest-man-bezos-to-blast-off-into-space-on-tuesday-101626570837768.html

A bag of 20 kg wheat flour will cost PKR 950 from its existing rate of PKR 800, which is a 19 per cent hike. Sugar's rate has also been revised from PKR 68 to PKR 85 per kg, registering an increase of 25 per cent.The hike in the essential food items came a day after the Imran Khan government okayed the increase of petrol and high-speed diesel price. The new price for petrol will be PKR 118.09 per litre, while one litre diesel in the country now costs PKR 116.5. On petrol price, information and broadcasting ministry Fawad Chaudhry said the government has no other choice as fuel has become dearer in the international market. However, Pakistan has kept it the lowest in the region, the minister tweeted, as reported by Dawn.In 2020, poverty has increased from 4.4 per cent to 5.4 per cent in Pakistan, according to an estimate of the World Bank. According to the estimation, the poverty ratio in Pakistan is projected to remain at 39.2 per cent in 2021-2022, news agency ANI reported quoting The News International.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghee-wheat-flour-sugar-become-costlier-in-pakistan-petrol-at-rs-118-09-per-litre-101626513371800.html

The software is made by Israel-based NSO Group, which said it only supplies to government clients.In its response published by The Guardian, The Indian government termed the reports a “fishing expedition” and said there is no concrete basis or truth associated with the claim that there was government surveillance on specific people. “The commitment to free speech as a fundamental right is the cornerstone of India’s democratic system. We have always strived to attain an informed citizenry with an emphasis on a culture of open dialogue,” it said.HT reached out the ministry of electronics and information technology but did not receive a confirmation on the response. Screenshots of an email sent by the ministry to one of the journalists were shared by news agency ANI.The statement added that the “questionnaire sent to the Government of India indicates that the story being crafted is one that is not only bereft of facts but also founded in pre-conceived conclusions. It seems you are trying to play the role of an investigator, prosecutor as well as jury”.“It also indicates poorly conducted research and lack of due diligence by the esteemed media organizations involved,” the government said.It added that the minister of electronics and IT has spoken in detail, including in the Parliament, that there has been no unauthorised interception by Government agencies. “It is important to note that government agencies have a well-established protocol for interception, which includes sanction and supervision from highly ranked officials in central & state governments, for clear stated reasons only in national interest,” the government said.It added that each case of interception, monitoring, and decryption is approved by a competent authority “i.e. the Union Home Secretary”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-committed-to-right-to-privacy-india-s-response-over-pegasus-hack-101626631762226.html
18-07-2021||India||Speculations over leadership continue despite Yediyurappa’s denial||Despite Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa denying the rumours of his resignation, speculations over his replacement continue within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Yediyurappa calling for a legislative party meeting on July 26 has further intensified a section of party leaders claiming that a change of guard is imminent, while others claiming only a cabinet reshuffle would take place during the legislative party meeting, HT has learnt. Two senior BJP leaders from Karnataka, on the condition of anonymity, said that apart from news reports suggesting that a decision has been made to replace Yediyurappa during his meeting with Prime Minister Modi on Friday, no information is available to legislators. “As far as we are concerned, the legislative party meeting is about a possible cabinet shuffle and not a change of guard,” said a legislator from Bengaluru. Yediyurappa, following his two-day visit to New Delhi, had said, “No, not at all... There is no truth in the rumours.” He went on to say that he had no reason to hide if he had resigned and “not a single word” was discussed on the issue by him or Central party leaders. After the meeting with party BJP chief JP Nadda, Yediyurappa said he had been asked to give his all to strengthen the party ahead of the elections in 2023. He added that he would be returning to Delhi to discuss various developmental issues early next month. The Karnataka chief minister arrived in the capital late last evening and has since met Prime Minister Modi and Nadda. Talking to reporters on his arrival, he said, “The central leaders have asked me to continue as chief minister and strengthen the party. It is our duty to follow their instructions from time to time. There is no question of leadership change.” However, a legislator, associated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) faction of the BJP, said that there are clear indications that Yediyurappa will be handing over the charge. “You can’t expect the party or Yediyurappaji to reveal the details of the meetings with the Prime Minister to the media. But the fact is that there is a consensus between the party leadership and Yediyurappa to do what is required for the long-term success of the party. You will know the details soon,” he added. Meanwhile, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President DK Shivakumar said several MLAs and the workers belonging to the Lingayat community are ready to join the Congress. Speaking to reporters at Kalaburagi Airport on Saturday, Shivakumar said that former ministers MB Patil and Eshwar Khandre and others are holding discussions in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speculations-over-leadership-continue-despite-yediyurappa-s-denial-101626629061179.html
18-07-2021||India||At the end of bitter battle, elevation for Navjot Singh Sidhu in Punjab Congress||Drawing curtains to the ongoing feud between Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu, the Congress on Sunday appointed Sidhu as the president of the Punjab Congress. The appointment will come into effect immediately, the press release, signed by Congress leader KC Venugopal said. Sangat Singh Gizian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Pawan Goel and Kuljit Singh Nagra have been appointed as working presidents of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. The rift between Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and Sidhu has been going on for long with Sidhu openly rebelling against Captain. The Congress High Command was trying to reach out to both the factions of the Congress leaders to stop the fort from crumbling ahead of elections in 2020.Punjab formula will be accepted by all, says CMAhead of the revamp in the state unit, 10 MLAs issued a joint statement in support of Captain and said Sidhu was a celebrity and undoubtedly an asset to the party, but criticism of his own party in public has created the rift.That Sidhu will be elevated as the chief of the party's state unit and Amarinder Singh will remain the CM face for the upcoming election was a formula that many insiders were aware of. On Saturday, Sidhu met Sunil Jakhar who was in charge of the party's state unit so far.Amarinder Singh had met Sonia Gandhi last week, while Congress general secretary in charge of Punjab Harish Rawat met Sonia Gandhi on Friday. After the meeting in which Sidhu was also present, Rawat reiterated that there is no question of replacing Captain as the CM face in the poll-bound state as his governance was well received by the people of Punjab who are not very experimental with their political leadership.Meetings, statements add fuel to Punjab Congress row amid Captain-Sidhu tussleAmarinder Singh was not in favour of Sidhu's elevation as he wrote to Sonia Gandhi that elevating a Jat Sikh to the post would upset senior leaders representing the Hindu community.However, he maintained his official stance that he will welcome any decision that the High Command takes. Reports said Captain made it clear to Harish Rawat that he would not meet Sidhu till he publicly apologises for the tweets against the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-appointed-as-punjab-congress-president-101626624448002.html
18-07-2021||India||Monsoon session of Parliament starts from Monday; fuel price rise, farm laws on agenda||The stage is set for a confrontation between the government and the Opposition over raging issues of fuel price rise, vaccination strategy and the farm laws in the monsoon session of Parliament that starts from Monday.The government announced it is ready to face any debate. The Opposition has planned an offensive on the first day over the fuel price hike.According to two leaders, government managers proposed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will brief floor leaders on India’s covid management in an exclusive meeting. All Opposition parties rejected the offer, insisting on a proper, parliamentary debate on the subject.The session comes against the backdrop of the second wave of the pandemic that saw an acute oxygen crisis in large parts of the country. While both the treasury and the Opposition bench would look for opportunities to corner each other, the recent assembly polls and the long-term goals of the 2024 election may also add to the underlining politics in the session.Participating in an all-party meeting on Sunday, PM Modi urged 31 political parties that “there should be meaningful discussion in both the Houses” and reminded them it’s “the responsibility of all to create such a conducive environment”.Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi told journalists, “The Prime Minister said that as per our traditions of a healthy democracy, issues concerning the people should be raised in an amicable manner, and the government should be given the opportunity to respond to these discussions.”“The Prime Minister said the people’s representatives truly know the ground level situations, and hence their participation in the discussions enriches the decision-making process,” said Joshi. Modi also pointed out that most of the MPs have been vaccinated and it will help them in actively working in Parliament.In the all-party meeting, Rajya Sabha Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge demanded more bills to be scrutinized and every week, one short-duration discussion and a Calling Attention motion must be allowed. The Congress leader also asked for an election for the post of deputy speaker, which has been lying vacant for more than two years now.Kharge even took jibes at the PM, before he joined the meeting at its fag end, to demand that the PM should not come when key parties have already spoken as it amounts to disrespect for those parties, according to two leaders present in the meeting.Trinamool Congress leaders Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O Brien raised seven issues including sidelining of the states, discrepancy in vaccine distribution, and “motivated functioning of central agencies”.But petrol price hike remained the top issue for most opposition parties followed by a fresh demand to repeal the controversial farm laws. The TMC also asked for the enactment of the Women Reservation Bill.The DMK demanded a discussion on the devolution of GST after many states claimed the Centre has not paid their dues. TRS mentioned that PSUs should be turned profitable and should not be disinvested.5 political parties including, TRS, YSRCP, and BSP wanted a debate on Scheduled Ten of the Indian Constitution as anti-defection cases regularly comes up before the legislative houses or the courts. The BJD demanded that the bill for the legislative council of Odisha should be expedited.Samajwadi Party leader Ramgopal Varma expressed concerns over the quick passage of bills without scrutiny. His outburst against some governors surprised many as he accused gubernatorial offices of trying to become more powerful than elected chief ministers.NCP leader Sharad Pawar asked for a debate on inflation and CPIM demanded a review of labour laws.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi listed 29 bills and two financial legislation. He sought cooperation for all and reiterated that all issues can be discussed in Parliament.In another all-party meeting, chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, several Opposition leaders asked for the reintroduction of the MPLAD funds after it was canceled last year for two fiscals due to the pandemic.

18-07-2021||India||Covid 3rd wave: Has it arrived? What government, latest projection reports say||The World Health Organization this week has set the alarm bells ringing as it said that the world is at the very advanced stages of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. This wave is mostly being driven by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, first reported in India. WHO's warning is a red flag for India as well, the Union health ministry has said this week as the fall in the Covid-19 cases in India has slowed down. In India, the Covid-19 situation remains worrisome in some pockets, including some districts in Maharashtra, Kerala and the northeast.Govt says next 2-3 months crucialHas the third wave in India set in? Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said this week that the present situation in India is under control. But India is far from achieving herd immunity either through vaccination or through natural infection. Hence, the risk remains. The next few months will be very crucial, the government has said.'Third wave arrived on July 4'University of Hyderabad pro-vice-chancellor physicist Dr Vipin Srivastava has recently said that the third wave in India has already arrived on July 4. He said July 4 recorded a similar trend like what the first week of February (the beginning of the 2nd wave) saw.ICMR on third waveThe third wave may hit the nation by August-end, but it will be of less intensity than the second wave. Head of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, Dr Samiran Panda has said that the third wave is not inevitable.Economists' reports on the third waveUBS Securities India has said the risks of a third wave look real because of the increased presence of the Delta variant and the pace of vaccination.SBI Research in its report prepared early this month said India may witness the third wave of the pandemic by the second fortnight of August.Difficult to predict timing: Devi ShettyDr Devi Shetty, chairman of the Karnataka Covid expert committee, said it is difficult to predict the timing and the severity of a third wave. "People have to respect COVID appropriate behaviour like social distancing, wearing a mask. These are the things that will protect us. If people behave in an irresponsible manner no government, no anti-biotic no vaccine can protect them. So people have to take the responsibility," he said to ANI.May be more severe than 2nd wave: Randeep GuleriaAIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria has said that there are many possibilities in which the third wave if it comes, may shape up. If an immuno-escape variant of the virus emerges and all restrictions are eased, then the third wave can be more severe than the second wave. Waning immunity, the emergence of a more transmissible variant, and lockdown relaxations will decide the third wave, Dr Guleria said.IIT scientists' 3 scenariosAt the beginning of this month, a group of IIT scientists project three scenarios in which the situation could go back to normal by August, could continue as it is or could worsen.Last month, Reuters conducted a poll and predicted that the third wave in India will come by October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-3rd-wave-has-it-arrived-what-government-latest-projection-reports-say-101626620955675.html

Tharoor asks Centre||Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has sharpened his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government over its domestic as well as foreign policy ahead of the Monsoon session of Parliament. Speaking to news agency ANI, Shashi Tharoor accused the government of “terribly mismanaging” the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation, claiming there aren’t enough vaccines as people across the country are lining up at vaccination centres.“This is a major issue for which the government should be held accountable,” ANI quoted Tharoor as saying.The Lok Sabha member from Thiruvananthapuram also asked about India’s perspective vis-à-vis Afghanistan at a time when the Taliban fighters are rapidly making advances in the war-torn country. India has invested more than $3 billion in Afghanistan for various projects, including reconstruction efforts, the 218-km road between Delaram and Zaranj Salma dam, and the Afghan Parliament building which was inaugurated in 2015.“Where's that (Afghanistan) country going at the moment and what's India's perspective (on that). Our taxpayers' $3 billion is invested in Afghanistan. Is that all going to go down the drain as the Taliban coming back to power? These are important questions,” he added.Also Read | Pakistani fighters, Taliban told to target India-built assets in Afghanistan: ReportTharoor’s statement suggests that Congress is likely to focus on the government's pandemic response and the Afghan issue during the Monsoon session.Earlier today, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held a meeting with floor leaders where PM Modi was also present.

An overall assessment was carried out in the UT focusing on areas such as total weekly new cases, positivity rate, bed occupancy, fatality rate, vaccination coverage and extent of compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour.J&K | Higher education and skill development institutes can consider phased opening based on the vaccination status of staff and students after 31 July. Public & private education institutes can seek the attendance of vaccinated staff for administrative purposes: State govt pic.twitter.com/HFuYfGoZYdSignificant improvement was seen in some districts compared to the previous week, the administration said. However, it was noted that daily Covid-19 cases were showing an uneven trend for the past few days.As the previous Covid-19 containment orders remain imposed in Jammu and Kashmir until further orders, the deputy commissioners can allow shops to open at 6am instead of 7am to avoid rush on July 19 and 20 ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, it was told.All deputy commissioners have been further instructed by the government to focus on the positivity rates of the medical blocks under their jurisdictions, according to Sunday’s order.“All Deputy Commissioners shall keep active track of the positivity rates in these blocks and consider implementing stricter control measures in closed clustered spaces like Public-Private Offices, Community halls. Malls, Bazaars etc, in case the weekly positivity rate goes beyond 4 percent in these Blocks,” the order said. The three-“T” protocol of testing, tracking and treating and vaccination would also have to be strengthened in these blocks, the government said.Jammu and Kashmir reported 179 new Covid-19 disease cases on Saturday, which took the total caseload to 3,19,755. One more person succumbed to the viral disease and the total deaths have climbed to 4,363.

But this should not be introduced because of the impending election, Sanjay Raut said. As Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has opposed the bill, Raut said the BJP should withdraw its support of the Nitish Kumar government if Nitish Kumar opposes the legislation.Amid strong rumours of the BJP and Sena coming back together in Maharashtra following reports of a rift in the three party-led Maha Vikas Aghadi, Sanjay Raut wrote both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have suffered owing to over-population because of which people have to migrate to other states in search of livelihood.Observing that the population of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is nearly 15 crore and a majority of the people migrate to other states in search of livelihood, Raut said legal steps must be taken in these states to control the population.Shashi Tharoor says population move 'communal', Jairam Ramesh posts Twitter threadReferring to the religion-based Partition of India after 1947, Raut wrote that Hindus were forced to become secularists while Muslims and members of other religions enjoyed their religious freedom. "These people don't believe in population control and family planning. Their sense of freedom is having more than one wife and giving birth to children...Obviously, the population of the country increased but most of them are illiterate and remain unemployed," he said, claiming that Hindus have become a minority in eight states and two Union Territories. "Due to illegal migration (from neighbouring Bangladesh), the population demography has changed in Assam, West Bengal and Bihar," Raut wrote."Hindutvawadis who wanted Hindus to give birth to four or five children to counter the growing population of Muslims are bringing the population control bill. The UP draft bill should be seen as an experiment and all good things should not be measured in terms of religion, caste and politics," Raut wrote in reference to Vishwa Hindu Parishad's objection to the draft bill.In an addendum, Sanjay Raut poked fun at Lok Sabha MP Ravi Kishan who will introduce a private bill on population control for discussion in the monsoon session. "Call it insult or irony, if Yogi Adityanath implements the population policy, 160 BJP MLAs will come under its purview. MP Ravi Kishan who will introduce a private bill in the Lok Sabha for discussion has four children. Ata kay karaych (what to do!)," he wrote.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindus-forced-to-live-as-secularists-sanjay-raut-s-take-on-population-control-101626611960236.html

Addressing a virtual training program on the foreign policy for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, Jaishankar said India has made efforts to have cordial relations with its neighbours while ensuring that terrorism is treated as a global issue, reported news agency ANI.“Due to us, Pakistan is under the lens of FATF and it was kept in the grey list. We have been successful in pressurizing Pakistan and the fact that Pakistan's behaviour has changed is because of pressure put by India by various measures,” ANI quoted Jaishankar as saying.During the training program, the minister also credited the Union government’s efforts through the United Nations for sanctions on terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, reported ANI. The session was reportedly aimed at informing BJP’s members of Parliament about foreign policy initiatives taken by the Union government so that they can counter opposition charges during the Monsoon session starting Monday.Last month, FATF retained Pakistan on the list of countries under “increased monitoring”, observing that the country failed to prosecute top leadership of the UN Security Council-designated terror groups. Pakistan had completed 26 out of the 27 tasks assigned to get delisted but failing to complete one task worked against its efforts. Moreover, the terror-financing watchdog handed down Pakistan another list of six tasks, mainly related to money laundering actions.Jaishankar said that PM Modi’s personal efforts on global forums like G7 and G20 made nations realise that terrorism was everyone’s problem, reported ANI quoting people familiar with the development. He told the BJP leaders that India made China back down on the Doklam issue and gave an appropriate reply when the People’s Liberation Army tried infringing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh."Now the world knows, India will not bow down to pressure from China," the minister reportedly said, according to ANI.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-ensured-pakistan-remained-on-fatf-grey-list-says-jaishankar-101626608739423.html

Know government's new rules for vintage cars||All two- and four-wheelers that are 50+ years old and have been maintained in their original form will be defined as vintage motor vehicles, which will not be driven for regular and commercial purposes and will have to get a special registration, the ministry of road transport and highways has recently mandated in its amendment of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989.As of now, there were no existing rules for regulating the process of registration across different states. "The new rules shall provide a hassle-free process along with salient features such as retention of old numbers for already registered vehicles and a VA series (unique registration mark) for fresh registrations," minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari tweeted a few days ago.…such as retention of old number for already registered vehicles and a “VA” series (Unique Registration Mark) for fresh registrations.What do the amendments say?1. A vintage motor vehicle shall not be driven on roads for regular or commercial purposes, it said.2. Which cars will be defined as vintage cars? The rules say all 2/4 wheelers over 50 years shall be defined as vintage motor vehicles. But they should not have undergone any substantial overhaul. The original form must be retained.3. Application for registration or re-registration shall be made as per Form 20 and shall be accompanied by an insurance policy, fee, bill of entry in case of imported vehicles, and an old RC in case of an already registered vehicle in India.4. The state registering authority shall issue a certificate of registration as per Form 23A, within 60 days.5. The new registration rules say vehicles that are already registered can retain their original Registration Mark. For a new registration, the registration mark will be assigned as XX VA YY. Here, the VA stands for vintage, XX stands for state code and YY will be a two-letter series and “8” is a number from 0001 to 9999 allotted by the state registering authority.6. Fees for new registration will be ₹20,000 and the subsequent re-registration fee will be ₹5,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-you-have-a-50-year-old-vehicle-know-government-s-new-rules-for-vintage-cars-101626607057066.html

It seems the curfew is very strict,” said a resident of Churachandpur district headquarters, around 70 km south of Imphal. Local body and civil society organisations in the state were also supporting the total curfew, calling it the only way to tackle the present situation. Jeetendra Ningomba of Joint Committee on Covid-19 appealed to the masses to strictly follow the rules to aid in the fight against the pandemic and to get vaccinated at the earliest.The curfew till July 27 was clamped after detection of Delta Variant of the Coronavirus in the state and the need for stringent measures to break the chain of its transmission.Daily Covid cases in the north eastern border state breached the 1000-mark for the 4th consecutive day and the death toll rose to 1,365.

It affects youths, destroys their families and gives rise to various other social ills,” Sarma said at one of these events in Barhampur on Sunday. “When we assumed office, we decided to provide succour to those addicted by illegal drugs and also their families. Our first effort was to stop the supply of drugs to our state, second was to end its circulation and third was to rehabilitate those affected by its abuse,” he added. Sarma said that between May 10 and July 15, the state police registered 874 cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and arrested 1,493 drug dealers across the state and seized nearly ₹163 crore of the contraband. On July 14, the CM informed the state assembly that over 27 kg of heroin, 12,823 kg marijuana, 41 kg opium, 78,000 bottles of cough syrup, over 1.3 million psychotropic tablets, 3 kg morphine, 3 kg crystal methamphetamine, 3,300 kg poppy straw and ₹1.80 crore in cash were seized since May 10. On Saturday, Sarma burnt 802 gm of heroin, 1,205 kg of cannabis, 3 kg opium and over 200,000 psychotropic tables at Golaghat followed by burning of 3.47 kg of heroin, 11.88 kg of morphine, 103 kg of cannabis, 2.89 kg of crystal methamphetamine and over 200,000 psychotropic tablets at Diphu. On Sunday, the CM burnt 10 kg of heroin, 253 kg of cannabis, 977 gm opium, over 271,000 psychotropic substances at Barhampur followed by burning of 3.2 kg heroin, 1,015 kg cannabis, over 35,000 psychotropic substances at another event at Hojai later. “If we assume that the seized drug was just 10% of the entire quantity smuggled into Assam, we can say that the trade in illegal drugs in Assam is worth nearly ₹5,000 crore annually,” the CM said on Sunday. Reacting to allegations by opposition parties that police were trigger happy in their operations against the drug dealers, Sarma said that the cops have been instructed to deal with the drug dealers strictly.“Some people say that the police should shoot these criminals dead instead of arresting them, but we can’t do that and we have to perform our duties within the ambit of law. I have asked the police department to be as strict as possible against drug dealers while following [the] laid down laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-burns-illegal-drugs-worth-rs-163-cr-to-send-message-of-zerotolerance-101626606260313.html
18-07-2021||India||‘Unfortunate’: IMA slams Kerala’s decision to ease Covid curbs due to Bakrid||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Sunday expressed its displeasure over the Kerala government’s decision to ease ongoing lockdown restrictions for three days due to Bakrid amid the worsening crisis of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the state.The medical body further said it would knock the doors of the Supreme Court “if the state is not enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour and become a model state to curtail the rising menace of Covid, by withdrawing this decision”.Stating that the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government’s decision to loosen curbs is ‘unwarranted and inappropriate at this time of medical emergency’, the IMA, in its press release, called for immediate withdrawal of the order and enforcement of a zero-tolerance policy towards Covid-appropriate behaviour. It further urged the administration not to deviate from its statutory duty and vision to ensure the safety of the state as well as the country.Kerala, which is one of the worst-hit states in India that has, so far, recorded over 3.14 million Covid-19 cases and 15,269 deaths due to the viral disease. On Saturday, the state recorded 16, 148 new infections, the highest single-day spike in one month.The state government has allowed a relaxation in lockdown restrictions on July 18, 19 and 20 due to Bakrid, which will be celebrated either on July 20 or 21.The IMA said in its press release that many states in north India such as Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand have stopped traditional and popular pilgrimage and yatras, adding it is unfortunate that Kerala decided to ease curbs that would pave the way for mass gatherings. Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have called off the Kanwar Yatra in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The IMA’s statement came just a day after Union minister V Muraleedharan urged the Kerala government to better manage the pandemic and impose a lockdown on a scientific basis instead of taking knee-jerk reactions.“Now that Bakrid has come, the government has announced a three-day exception for the lockdown. My suggestion is to follow the scientific approach and follow the guidelines of Government of India, ICMR guidelines and WHO. Do not utilise the pandemic as means of having political benefit out of it,” Muraleedharan told news agency ANI on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imaurges-kerala-govt-to-withdraw-order-easing-covid-19-curbs-for-bakrid-101626604897707.html

"It will be a peaceful protest. We will sit outside the Parliament while proceedings will continue in the House," Tikait said on Wednesday.The statement came in the wake of apprehensions of violence, like the one witnessed on the Republic Day when the farmers reached Red Fort as a part of their 'tractor rally' protest.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Farmer leaders and the Centre have held several rounds of talks but the impasse remains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-near-parliament-delhi-police-asks-dmrc-to-keep-extra-vigil-101626599730788.html

Assembly election is slated to be held in Punjab next year.Meanwhile, state party chief Sunil Jakhar called a meeting of MLAs and disctrict Congress heads on Monday to bring an end to the ongoing crisis and “pass a resolution expressing faith in the Congress high command and that its decision will be acceptable to all".The 10 MLAs, who issued a joint statement urging the central leadership not to let down the chief minister, included Harminder Gill, Fatehjang Bajwa, Khaira, Kuldip Vaid, Laddi and Pirmal Khalsa. They said Singh, a retired Captain of the Indian Army, is still the tallest leader of the masses in Punjab, ANI reported.Around the same time, Sidhu, a cricketer-turned-politician, reached the residence of MLA Madan Lal with six party legislators, including state minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, in Patiala. Sidhu, who is said to be in contention for the state Congress chief’s post, has been holding several rounds of talks with party leaders over the past few days. He met about 30 sitting MLAs and ministers on Saturday.The chief minister has reportedly written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, expressing his reservation over Sidhu’s appointment as the state unit president and is believed to have warned against the move having an "adverse" impact on the party's prospects in the upcoming assembly elections. The possible elevation of Sidhu would amount to ignoring the old guard, Singh said.Meanwhile, Bajwa said he had invited the Punjab Congress MPs from the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at his Delhi residence to devise a strategy on the farmers' issue and discuss some important matters related to the party.Senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge, former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat and ex-parliamentarian JP Aggarwal have been tasked by Gandhi to resolve the months-long crisis in the state ahead of the crucial election. The committee has been holding talks with the warring groups, but no solution seemed to be in sight as the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meetings-statements-add-fuel-to-punjab-congress-row-amid-captain-sidhu-tussle-101626595949318.html

The houses have been cordoned off by the CRPF.Two days ago on Friday, one residential flat owned by Deshmukh in Mumbai’s Worli, valued at ₹1.54 crore, and 25 land parcels in Dhutum villages in Raigarh district of Maharashtra, book value ₹2.67 crore, were attached by the ED. The agency then also issued summons to his wife Aarati Deshmukh for questioning.Former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh had alleged that as a minister in the Maharashtra government, Deshmukh had asked suspended police officer Sachin Vaze and few others to extort ₹100 crore every month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Following the allegations, the Bombay high court ordered a preliminary enquiry by the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation). The agency later registered an FIR against Deshmukh in April this year. The ED, which was also invited to join the probe, last month arrested Anil Deshmukh’s PA Kundan Shinde and PS Sanjeev Palande, and also summoned Deshmukh and his family members.People aware of the developments said that Deshmukh or his close relatives were not present in the houses at Katol and Wadvihira, which were being raided on Sunday. The ED had also raided his Civil Lines residence here last month and interrogated his wife Aarati and son Rishi.The fresh raids come close on the heels of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-deshmukh-s-ancestral-houses-in-nagpur-raided-in-rs-100-cr-extortion-case-101626593359695.html

The state government said that the associations of pilgrims which organise the pilgrimage, decided to call it off in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic on government's appeal.The development came a day after a nudge from the Supreme Court, which asked the UP government to reconsider the decision to hold the yatra despite Covid-19 concerns.With this, Uttar Pradesh joined the list of states which have cancelled the annual event due to Covid-19. Here is a list of such states:Uttarakhand: The Uttarakhand government had already announced the suspension of the yatra for second consecutive year due to the coronavirus disease pandemic. The concerns flagged by experts about a possible third wave of the disease triggered the state government's decision. Haridwar, the holy city where Kanwariyas visit to collect the water of holy river Ganga, has sealed the borders of the city.Jharkhand: The state government too has shown reluctance to hold the Kanwar Yatra to check Covid-19 from spreading. There has been no preparations from the Deoghar district administration where Kanwariyas gather at the famous Baba Baidyanath temple, considered one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the Ganga water collected from the river. The Jharkhand government had earlier withheld permission for the Ratha Yatra festival at the Jagannath temple in Ranchi.Bihar: The Nitish Kumar government has closed all the religious places till August 6 this year, so there won't be any Kanwar Yatra to Deoghar. The Kanwarariyas carry Ganga water from Sultanganj in Bihar to offer it to Lord Shiva in Deoghar.The Kanwar Yatra goes on till the first week of August and sees thousands of Shiva devotees called Kanwariyas travelling mostly on foot from states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi to collect water from the Ganges in Haridwar, Gangotri and other places.The yatra is held in the Shravan month of the Hindu calendar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-latest-to-cancel-kanwar-yatra-list-of-other-states-101626586254162.html

The decision has been taken to prevent overcrowding in the area."We will try to avoid overcrowding. Sitting will not be allowed except for the senior citizens. We have been experimenting to reduce crowd and also to implement Covid-appropriate behaviour," Negi said.He also said that if the number of people or tourists increases more than the capacity of Ridge and Mall Road, their entry can be banned.The police in Himachal Pradesh, like other states with popular hill stations, have been imposing fine on people found without violating the Covid-19 protocol and roaming around without masks. They have also launched awareness campaign campaigns to tell people how important it is to follow Covid appropriate behaviour."If they (the tourists) don't understand to abide by the law in place, then challaning is being done. To reduce the crowd from the Ridge area, we shall first remove sitting benches and overcrowding will not be seen likely in near future," said the deputy commissioner.Chief minister Jairam Thakur too had last week appealed to the visitors coming to the state to follow Covid-19 norms.Shimla, along with Mussoorie and Nainital, has seen a huge influx of tourists in recent weeks who are heading to hills to escape heat in the plains. The state government and respective district administrations stepped up vigil along the border to restrict the number of tourists.Covid tests like RT-PCR have been made mandatory and people urged to keep wearing masks while outside.The photographs of people thronging the hill stations were also displayed by the officials of the Union health ministry during a meeting, who cautioned people against letting their guards down and warned of reimposing the curbs if violations continue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also expressed concern about the violations at a meeting with chief ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shimla-administration-restricts-people-on-ridge-mall-road-amid-covid19-101626584846347.html

The Indian Express has reported that Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has reviewed the project and directed that the rollout plan be advanced to connect at least 40 cities with the Vande Bharat trains by August 2022. Vande Bharat is the name given to India’s own semi-high speed train set, a collection of 16 coaches, self-propelled and do not require an engine to drag them.Medha Servo Drives Ltd secured the contract to supply the electrical systems for 44 Vande Bharat trains in January this year. The Hyderabad-based engineering firm has now been told to advance its production plan so that at least two prototypes can be rolled out by March next year following all trials.There is a contract condition that along with all the trials and testing that are needed to give nod to a Vande Bharat, the prototype train set that comes out of its anchor should also complete 1 lakh kilometre of commercial run with passengers before the following lot can be placed for production. Under this, the Vande Bharat trains could take months to hit the tracks commercially. Officials estimate that if all three production units are put to use, Indian Railways can manufacture around six to seven Vande Bharat train sets every month.The idea of the new plan is to get maximum train sets rolled out by 2024 by utilising Integral Coach Factory in Chennai, Modern Coach Factory in Raebareli and Rail Coach Factory in Kapurthala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-gears-up-to-roll-out-10-trains-to-link-40-cities-in-vande-bharat-boost-report-101626582550550.html

The direction comes after parents complained about private schools pressuring them to pay the entire school fee for the academic year , according to the Tamil language newspaper Dinakaran. The department also instructed the schools to collect 40 per cent of the fees in the first instalment and the rest 35 per cent in the second one.  All the educational institutions were closed in Tamil Nadu on April 24 following the second wave of Covid-19. The Tamil Nadu government is yet to announce the reopening of the schools.  Considering the Covid-19 pandemic situation , private schools should collect only 75 per cent of the fees for this academic year. The first instalment of 40 per cent could be collected by August 31. The remaining 35 per cent could be collected two months after the schools reopen. The government will decide on the remaining 25 per cent of school fees based on the Covid-19 situation in the state , the circular noted.  Unlike the first wave , the second wave ravaged the state resulting in more infections and deaths. The second wave and the lockdown drained the sources of people's livelihood and many are finding it difficult to afford the education cost of their wards. Under these circumstances , there were complaints that some private schools are forcing the people to pay the entire school fees for the academic year 2021-22.  Following the complaints , commissioner of school education K Nandakumar has sent a circular to all chief education officers of the districts with directions about the school fees. The circular has stated that the schools closed because of the Covid-19 second wave since April 24 are not open for offline classes to date. But there are complaints about private schools forcing parents to pay the school fees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-private-schools-told-to-collect-75-fees-this-academic-year-101626583160376.html
18-07-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi reconstitutes Congress’ Parliamentary hierarchy||In a major reshuffle in the Congress party’s parliamentary hierarchy, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has reconstituted the parliamentary groups in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, bringing in senior faces such as former Union ministers P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari, Ambika Soni and former chief minister Digvijaya Singh. Gandhi, in a letter said, “As the chairperson of the CPP (Congress Parliamentary Party), I have decided to reconstitute the following groups to facilitate and ensure the effective functioning of our party in both Houses of Parliament. These groups will meet daily during the session and can meet during the inter-session periods as well where Parliament issues are concerned.” The letter makes it official that Bengal MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury will continue as the Leader of the Party (LoP) in the Lok Sabha. But inclusion of Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor in the group underlines that Gandhi wants more heads in the party’s parliamentary decision-making process. Interestingly, both Tewari and Tharoor were perceived as a possible replacements for Chowdhury. The two leaders have joined Chowdhury, Gaurav Gogoi (deputy leader), K Suresh (chief whip), Ravneet Singh Bittu and Manickam Tagore (both whips). The Rajya Sabha hierarchy, which earlier had Mallikarjun Kharge as the Leader of the Opposition, Anand Sharma (deputy leader) and Jairam Ramesh (chief whip), will now include Chidambaram, Soni and Singh—the three senior leaders with years of experience in parliament as well as the party. The latest reshuffle in the parliamentary teams come just a day before the monsoon session of Parliament starts on Monday. After two curtailed session, this one holds promise to be a full session. It is also likely to be stormy as the Opposition wants to corner the government on economy, vaccination strategy, job loss and farm issues. The groups will have various roles. Mustering numbers, coordinating with various political parties and deciding on key floor issues such as support for a bill or the extent of cooperation with the government. It will also decide which issue needs to be raised and how the Congress will manoeuvre on issues raised by other parties. Only last week, the Congress had entrusted LoP Mallikarjun Kharge with coordination with other parties in Parliament. Kharge, a former Union minister, is expected to play the key role in Parliament as the lack of Opposition unity has proved to be an advantage for the ruling dispensation in passing key bills such as on Triple Talaq, bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir as union territories and the scrapping of Article 370. The groups with senior, more accessible leaders also come when the Opposition camp has seen signs of fissures with a few regional parties trying to carve out their independent spaces keeping in mind the upcoming state elections and the larger goal of 2024 national poll. The Congress already has two panels—the parliamentary strategy group headed by Gandhi to look into the larger issues relating to parliamentary functioning and a smaller group headed by P Chidambaram to carefully scrutinize all government bills....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-reconstitutes-congress-parliamentary-hierarchy-101626582139442.html

These students have lost 150 days of regular teaching days. As both the Board of Secondary Education and Council of Higher Secondary Education have reduced syllabus, resumption of physical teaching in classrooms has become a necessity,” said Sahu.He said the department will issue a comprehensive standard operating procedure (SOP) to schools for the reopening.Prior to reopening, all school teachers will be vaccinated on priority and the district education officers (DEOs) have been instructed to ensure that all the Covid-19 protocols are strictly followed.“We have given an option to students to come to school with consent from their parents. Keeping in mind the safety of the students, the decision on reopening of schools will be taken by the respective district collectors. The offline classes for standard 10 and 12 students will be held between 10 am and 1: 30 pm with no lunch break. The schools will remain closed on Sundays and on all state government holidays,” said Sahu.Last month, the Odisha government kicked off YouTube live streaming of classes for students in standard 1-8 in 8 districts and standard 9-10 in all the 30 districts. While Odia, English, history, geography, Hindi and Sanskrit classes were held three times a week, science and mathematics classes were telecast twice a week for class 10 students.Sahu said nearly one million students of class 10 and 12 from the state were preparing for various competitive exams and losing out on learning due to lack of mobile connectivity.Odisha shut down all the schools on April 19 after Covid-19 cases started rising and cancelled class 10 and 12 board exams while promoting the students of class 9 and 11 without examinations.Lockdowns of varying degrees are in place in Odisha’s 30 districts till August 1 with weekend shutdown in 10 districts that have more than 5% Test Positivity Rate (TPR)-- percentage of positive samples among those tested in a specific period. On Saturday, the state reported 2,182 cases with TPR of 2.94%.So far states such as Gujarat, Bihar, Chandigarh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand and union territory of Chandigarh have either reopened the state-run schools or are in the process.Meanwhile, the Odisha government has asked all its employees to start coming to office immediately. The general administrative (GA) department said since most of the employees are now fully vaccinated they were required mandatorily to attend office regularly.“Employees who are neither vaccinated nor exempted will not be permitted to attend office and their absence will be treated as wilful,” the department said in an order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-resume-offline-classes-for-class-10-and-12-from-july-26-101626578299112.html

When malnourished children are afflicted, they either take longer to recover or have poorer chances of survival,” said Lokesh Nath, a former in-charge overseeing the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly, one of the hotspots.Encephalitis syndrome is a serious public-health problem in India, said KN Bhilegaonkar of the ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Pune, the author of a study of the disease’s prevalence in Bareilly district.According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, between 2007 and 2016, over 70,000 cases were reported from the endemic districts.More than 30,000 children have died of encephalitis in the past three decades.A 2010 report by the erstwhile Planning Commission had stated five broad measures to tackle encephalitis: vaccination, vector control, sanitation facilities, safe drinking water and adequate nutrition, Nath said.The five states most vulnerable to the syndrome include Assam, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.Official data shows that when the Jal Jeevan Mission began in 2019, nearly 800,000 or 2.67% households in the 61 districts had access to tap water supply.At the end of last month, an additional 9.7 million families were provided access to tap water, taking the total number to slightly over 10 million, or 35% of total households.However, progress has not been equal in all five states, data shows. With 15 encephalitis-endemic districts, Bihar comes out on the top.The state, on average, has provided tap water connection to 85.53% of households.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10mn-households-in-je-hot-spots-get-tap-water-access-101626549523442.html

A fan of the club, she had attended two matches in the season despite the inconveniences caused by the pregnancy. In both matches, she was not allowed to take water bottles inside the stadium due to security regulations.“I was eight months pregnant. I needed hot water, and I needed to take my medicine as well. At the same time, I didn’t want to miss the match because of this. So, I wrote to Bengaluru FC, asking permission to carry hot water. I got a call from them, and they explained that taking water bottles inside the stadium was not possible. But then they blew mind saying I can watch the match from the owner box,” said Nair, who recently clicked a picture with her child, warped in Bengaluru FC’s colours, outside the stadium.For fans like Nair, Bengaluru FC is not just a club, but it is their extended family.Formed on May 28, 2013, Bengaluru FC was the new kid in the block, which took pride in its football culture. Bengaluru’s rich history in the sport dates back to the pre-Independence era. After all, it was a team from Bengaluru that beat the British in their own tournament for the first time.The feat occurred during the Rover’s Cup, the second oldest of the three big tournaments in the country started by the British in 1891. During its early years, the tournament only included the football teams of the British army regiments but in 1923, Indian civilian football clubs were allowed to participate in the tournament. Even though Kolkata-based Mohun Bagan reached the final that year, the dream of an Indian team winning the tournament remained unfulfilled for 45 years until the barefoot men of Bangalore Muslims created history at Bombay’s Cooperage football stadium.Even though the Bangalore Muslims put Bengaluru on India’s football map, they were forgotten over the years. Several legendary teams like ITI, HAL came along and produced national players, but the love for the game died down over the years.So, when a new football club came to town, there was scepticism. “In 2013, after the club was formed, we called for an open practice session with the Bengaluru FC players to promote the team. The fact was that they were always available but made it premium by making it a formal event. Seven people turned up,” recollected Kunaal Majgaonkar, the media manager for Bengaluru FC.“There were more players than fans that day. But the most important thing was those fans were happy. They had three players talking to one fan. Then, the word spread. People heard stories about Sunil Chhetri (national team captain) playing football with fans. In the next session, we had 60. Now, every season starts with a practice session and the numbers are beyond belief,” Majgaonkar.What started at that small group of people at a practice session is now known as the West Block Blues, a name worn proudly by the fans of Bengaluru FC. “West block A was one of the stands at the Bangalore Football Stadium (near Garuda mall). It was from there we got the name west block blues. From season 2, when the games were shifted to Kanteerava stadium, we occupied the West Block A there and the number stuck” said Rakesh Haridas, a Bengaluru FC fan.Even in terms of the fan base, Bengaluru FC has stood out. While Bengaluru had several football fans who thronged the stadiums, it never had a football culture like the English clubs. “Before Bengaluru FC came into the picture, many of us were followers of many English football clubs. Those of us who argued in pubs over English clubs finally had a team of our own to rally behind. So, we wanted to introduce those elements to our team too. We created an anthem and created chants for each player,” said Haridas.According to Akanksha Singh, meeting the players or the coach after the match and even running into them at a pub is not common with Bengaluru FC. “The Bengaluru FC team itself lives as a family in one single apartment in the city. They are always accessible, and even when the team management organises events with fans, players don’t come because they are asked to, but because they love it. Also, they don’t behave like the politicians, they become one of us,” said Singh, a fan since the team’s inception.From chats inspired by English football culture to loudly singing ‘Santoshakke’ the famous Kannada song by S P Balasubrahmanyam, the atmosphere is always an experience for the fans.When Bengaluru FC calls itself a family or part of the community, it doesn’t end with slogans. During the two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, the team and their fans were part of the city’s fight against the virus. “We knew that we can’t be sitting on the sidelines when the city was going through one of the biggest challenges. So, during the first wave started using our network to support small businesses in Bengaluru. We worked with them to put their message out in the public and help them get their businesses back on their feet. The team and fans took the campaign personally,” said Majgaonkar.When the city was hit by the pandemic again, in 2021, blues decided to roll up their sleeves. “Since the season was happening under strict lockdown, we were confined to our hotel. We asked what we could do, so it was decided that we would use our reach. The skipper (Chhetri) had more than 1 million followers, so we found volunteers, who were helping with SOS messages seeking beds and medicines. So, the skipper gave them access to his account to promote the message. He didn’t just give the access, we are constantly in touch with them asking what more can be done,” he added.According to Majgaonkar, when a team becomes a community and even family, a team becomes much more than just a game. “We know that even though not big football fans, the owners of the small businesses and those who were helped during the pandemic will cheer us when the team steps on the field next time,” Majgaonkar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-block-blues-a-fan-base-no-less-than-family-for-bengaluru-fc-101626550757264.html
18-07-2021||India||52% rise in frequency of cyclones in Arabian Sea over two decades: Study||The frequency and intensity of cyclones developing over the Arabian Sea has increased in the last two decades, while fewer such storms have been seen over the Bay of Bengal, researchers have found in a paper that underlines the increasing risk of disasters hitting the west coast of India if the trend continues to hold over the years.A 52% increase was noticed in the frequency of cyclones over the Arabian Sea between 2001 and 2019 , and an 8% decrease over the Bay of Bengal, compared to the 19-year period between 1982 and 2002, according to a new study by scientists of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) under the Union ministry of earth sciences.Normally four to five cyclones form over the north Indian Ocean region (includes both Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) in a year, with the majority -- about three-four of them -- developing over the Bay of Bengal.But this is fast changing. For instance, 2019 witnessed eight cyclones in the north Indian Ocean, out of which five formed in the Arabian Sea. The total figure was seven for 2018, including three over the Arabian Sea.Not just the frequency, the intensity and duration of the cyclones over the Arabian Sea too are changing, according to the paper published in Springer’s Climate Dynamics journal on Saturday. Apart from a higher than usual number of cyclones over Arabian Sea in recent years, back-to-back “extremely severe cyclonic storms” (with wind speeds between 167-221kmph) occurred within a single month over the Arabian Sea in 2015, according to the paper.This trend means India’s west coast may have to prepare for more frequent and stronger storms, researchers said.“Until now the west coast was least prepared for very severe cyclones. Our study shows that the number of very severe cyclones in the Arabian Sea has gone up by 150% during the last two decades. This means that we need to be prepared, not only in terms of forecasts but also have a risk assessment. This risk assessment should be based on the overlapping impacts of storm surges, heavy rains and a rising sea level that can act together, resulting in prolonged floods in the west coast. More cyclones in the Arabian Sea means the chances of (storms) some getting closer to the west coast are more, like we saw in the last four years,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist and co-author from IITM.The study, titled Changing status of tropical cyclones over the north Indian Ocean, said cyclones over the Arabian Sea have become extremely intense in recent decades.The research also noted that the duration for which a cyclonic storm lasts over the Arabian Sea is on a rise. The total time span of cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea rose 80% between 2001 and 2019 when compared to the 1982 to 2002 period. Similarly, there was a three-fold increase in the duration of “very severe cyclonic storms” (which see wind speeds in the range of 118-166 kmph) for the same period.The findings consolidate what has been theorised for a few years: abnormal warming of the Arabian Sea is creating a recipe for deadlier cyclones compared to the Bay of Bengal, which was earlier considered to host ocean-atmospheric conditions that are more conducive to the development of cyclones.When asked what could be causing this switch in cyclone patterns, Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD agreed that there may be connections to the climate crisis, but said more studies are needed. “This is happening because of an increase in the ocean thermal energy, enhanced mid tropospheric moisture content as well as a reduced vertical wind shear compared to the past over the Arabian Sea,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/52-rise-in-frequency-of-cyclones-in-arabian-sea-over-two-decades-study-101626550577184.html
18-07-2021||India||Jal Jeevan Mission: 10 million homes in encephalitis hot spots get tap water access||New Delhi: The country’s flagship programme to provide rural households with piped drinking water, Jal Jeevan Mission, has expanded rapidly to cover more than 10 million homes in 61 districts notorious for Japanese Encephalitis-Acute Encephalitis Syndrome, a brain fever in children that needs a multi-pronged approach for treatment, according to health experts. The 61 districts spread over five states are endemic to various forms encephalitis. Years of repeated outbreaks have contributed to poor health of outcomes for children, particularly in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The figure of households provided tap water in these districts is a milestone, an official of the Jal Shakti ministry said, requesting anonymity. “This represents a 32% increase in household tap water connections in the 61 priority districts, about 12% higher than the national average increase of 23.43% in providing tap water connections in the country during the past 22 months,” the official added. This is the fastest pace yet in covering a priority segment within the overall target of providing every rural household with a functional water tap by 2024 under the Jal Jeevan Mission. Experts say better sanitation and clean drinking water are essential to lessen the disease burden, although the encephalitis syndrome is caused by a clutch of vectors. Acute encephalitis syndrome, which includes Japanese encephalitis (JE), is caused by different types of viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi and spirochetes. Vaccines are the mainstay of preventing JE, part of a federal intervention in these districts, but there is little check on other strains. “The absence of clean drinking water aggravates encephalitis syndrome because unsafe water is a cause of malnutrition. When malnourished children are afflicted, they either take longer to recover or have poorer chances of survival,” said Lokesh Nath, a former in-charge overseeing the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly, one of the hotspots. Encephalitis syndrome is a serious public-health problem in India, said KN Bhilegaonkar of the ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Pune, the author of a study of the disease’s prevalence in Bareilly district. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, between 2007 and 2016, over 70,000 cases were reported from the endemic districts. More than 30,000 children have died of encephalitis in the past three decades. A 2010 report by the erstwhile Planning Commission had stated five broad measures to tackle encephalitis: vaccination, vector control, sanitation facilities, safe drinking water and adequate nutrition, Nath said. The five states most vulnerable to the syndrome include Assam, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Official data shows that when the Jal Jeevan Mission began in 2019, nearly 800,000 or 2.67% households in the 61 districts had access to tap water supply. At the end of last month, an additional 9.7 million families were provided access to tap water, taking the total number to slightly over 10 million, or 35% of total households. However, progress has not been equal in all five states, data shows. With 15 encephalitis-endemic districts, Bihar comes out on the top. The state, on average, has provided tap water connection to 85.53% of households. Assam has been able to provide tap water to only 30% schools and 8% anganwadi centres, while West Bengal fares no better with 14% schools and 7% anganwadi centres, compared to the national average of 65% schools and 60% anganwadi centres, official data shows. Anganwadis are state-run child-care centres. Uttar Pradesh, which has managed to cover just 11.8% of total households, too, needs to ramp up. The Union government has allocated a ₹10,870 crore to Uttar Pradesh under the Jal Jeevan Mission for 2021-22, the highest allocation for any state. The allocation has been increased four times over last year. The state will go to polls in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jal-jeevan-mission-10-million-homes-in-encephalitis-hot-spots-get-tap-water-access-101626550517172.html

She also demanded that all those behind the alleged nomination day violence on July 8 be brought to book. The elections were held on July 10.The Congress leader, who is on a three-day visit to the state, visited Semra Ghat village of Pasgawan block area in Lakhimpur Kheri, about 130 km from the state capital, and met the Samajwadi Party worker (who was party’s block pramukh candidate) and her proposer who were victims of the alleged violence during the elections. She said there was no point in providing reservation to women in the panchayats when they were not being allowed to file their nomination.Both the women had allegedly been misbehaved with on the nomination day. The SP worker had alleged that she was not allowed to file her nomination.An FIR in the incident has been lodged and police have arrested three people. Six police officials, including Mohammadi deputy police superintendent, have been suspended after the government took strong note of the incident. “Filing of nomination (for panchayat election) is her right. This right was taken away from her… She was targeted and attempt were made to pull away her saree and tear her clothes. One can imagine what she went through. She had a small child with her. A 19-year-old boy was also with her. She had her family with her…The circle officer, who tried to save her, has been placed under suspension and the administration is maintaining silence,” Priyanka told reporters after meeting the two women.“I have come here as a fellow woman to extend my support to her, to assure her that every woman of the state and that of the country is with her in her fight for justice,” she said.She added, “The violence took place in all the districts (during block pramukh polls). Bomb explosions were there at some places, violence was witnessed at some other and atrocities were committed against the women… I have come here to meet her because she is a woman. She is my sister as well… I demand that the election should be countermanded. Whosoever is occupying such a high position can see this is not the way any election is held and so it should be countermanded.”“Not alone in Pasgawan, fresh elections should be held in all other blocks of the state where such violence took place,” she told reporters.“The purpose of reservation to women in a democracy was their empowerment. However, situations have come to such a level that women are being misbehaved with,” Priyanka said.The Congress leader targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi again for his congratulatory message after the panchayat elections and said, “Re-election is ordered whenever such things happen. Why should re-election not be held? Can anybody be allowed to win election by indulging in violence? We have a video. Everything is clear whatever happened there. The police is seen not helping her. Only one or two persons came for her help. Do you want all democratic norms should be thrown to the winds? Prime Minister Narendra Modi is praising and congratulating the government.”In a social media post, she said she would write to the state election commission to get justice to the victims of panchayat poll violence.“I will write a letter to state election commission to demand justice for all the sisters and citizens who became victim of BJP-sponsored violence,” she said in a tweet earlier on Saturday.A large number of party workers welcomed Priyanka at Bakshi Ka Talab on way to Lakhimpur Kheri. Later, she held meetings with the party’s office bearers from different districts at the UPCC headquarters here on Saturday evening.(With inputs from Deokant Pandey in Lakhimpur Kheri)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-meets-up-panchayat-poll-violence-victims-demands-repoll-101626550338990.html

She alleged that Kumar, 43, called her to his bungalow on October 14, 2017, where he raped her. Kumar allegedly recorded the act and threatened to make the video public if she approached the police, the woman said, adding that she did not file a complaint earlier as she was frightened. Kumar, son of music baron, the late Gulshan Kumar, however, denied the allegations and accused the woman of extortion.In his complaint, Kumar’s uncle, producer and director Krishan Kumar Dua, said the accused Mallikarjun Pujari called Kumar several times between July 3 and July 10, demanding and threatening that if he did not comply, the woman will file a rape complaint against him. Kumar was also given a death threat if he did not pay the money, Dua said in the complaint.A case was registered against Pujari under sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 500 (Punishment for defamation), and criminal intimidation under sections 506 and 506(2) of the IPC, an official said on condition of anonymity.“We have registered a complaint and will question the named accused to find how he is related to the victim and who directed him to demand money,” said a police official from the Amboli police station, requesting anonymityHT tried reaching Pujari but he was not available for a reaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-rape-complaint-bhushan-kumar-s-family-alleges-extortion-bid-1-booked-101626550338385.html
18-07-2021||India||Farmers begin a sit-in at Sirsa after talks fail||Rohtak: Scores of farmers attended the ‘mahapanchayat’ in Sirsa on Saturday, demanding the release of five members of their community, who were arrested under sedition charges for allegedly attacking Haryana assembly’s deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa on July 11.According to the police, the entire Sirsa was converted into a cantonment with heavy deployment of Haryana Police personnel and paramilitary forces to stop farmers from breaking law and order while the local administration had imposed Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area.Police had barricaded loads leading to Shahid Bhagat Stadium, but farmers managed to reach the mahapanchayat venue by removing barricades.Addressing the mahapanchayat and reacting on sedition charges slapped against more than 100 farmers, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said the Supreme court has questioned the relevance of sedition law, describing it as ‘colonial’, but the Haryana government has imposed the ‘colonial law’ on farmers to stop the dissent.Attacking the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government over the three farm laws, Tikait alleged that the Centre was being run by “corporate companies”.“Some BJP workers have the misconception that their party is in power at the Centre. The Modi government is being run by big corporate companies and that’s why the government has failed to hold dialogue with farmers protesting against three farm laws. If any other party had been in power, they would have held a meeting with farmers to end the deadlock,” Tikait added.“We will hold a mahapanchayat in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut on September 5 to launch a mission against the BJP in UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab, where assembly polls are due,” he said.Earlier in the day, a 20-member committee of farmers met Sirsa administration officials to discuss the release of arrested farmers. However, the talks could not reach a logical conclusion, Tikait told reporters.The farmers have decided to stage an indefinite sit-in in front of the mini-secretariat to protest the arrests and slapping of the sedition cases, Tikait said, adding that a 20-member delegation of farmers met officials for over two hours over the issue. While the district administration maintained that action against arrested will be taken by the court, the delegation sought the withdrawal of the sedition charge.Meanwhile, Haryana home minister Anil Vij said, “The country’s law is supreme, and that law does not function on anyone’s advice, be it a politician like me.” He said the law functions at its own pace and in its own ways, and such activities have no effect on the legal procedures.Meanwhile, former Leader of the Opposition and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala objected to the use of the sedition law by the state’s BJP-JJP government. “It is a law of British times. The British had made this law so that any Satyagrahi could be imprisoned by accusing him of rebellion or terror,” he said.Protesting farmers have been opposing public functions of the BJP and the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) in the state.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for over seven months in protest against the Centre’s three agriculture laws.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-begin-sit-in-at-sirsa-after-talks-with-officials-over-sedition-cases-fail-101626550217779.html
18-07-2021||India||People know that judiciary will stand by them, says CJI||The judiciary stands by the people when things go wrong, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Saturday while addressing multiple events, where he also supported opening up court proceedings to people through efforts like live streaming.The chief justice first addressed an international audience at the India-Singapore Mediation Summit 2021 before inaugurating the Gujarat high court’s live streaming service later in the day. Through the day, he touched on the issue of pendency of cases – which he said was not an indicator of a system’s effectiveness or failing – and called for a greater role of mediation in settling disputes.“People are confident that they will get relief and justice from the judiciary. It gives them the strength to pursue a dispute. They know that when things go wrong, the judiciary will stand by them,” the CJI said at the Mediation Summit, adding that this trust explained why cases flood Indian courts.At the launch of the Gujarat High Court live-streaming, the CJI said: “It is high time for de-mystifying the justice delivery system in the country and furthering access through open courts.”Justice Ramana said that while courts in the country are open to litigants and lawyers, access to justice will “become a true reality when litigants and interested parties get to witness, understand and comprehend” justice dispensation first hand through live-streaming.He hinted that at the Supreme Court, efforts were underway to open some courts for live-streaming. “People may want to follow the arguments of the lawyers and observations of the bench only in certain cases, such as those that involve Constitutional interpretation or attract public attention.” Currently, this information is available through the media, he added, and there can be some transmission loss leading to misinterpretation of questions asked and observations made the bench, which often gets amplified by vested interests.“The formalisation of the live streaming of court proceedings is the best cure for the aforesaid malady.”But, Justice Ramana warned, live streaming could also become a double-edged sword as judges might feel the pressure of public scrutiny, which can result in a stressful environment.The privacy of parties involved and the safety and security of the victims and witnesses should also be ensured during live streaming, the CJI told Gujarat High Court Chief Justice Vikram Nath and other judges of the HC at the virtual event.At the earlier event, the CJI spoke about pending cases in Indian courts. “The often-quoted statistic that “pendency” in Indian courts has reached 45 million cases -- which is perceived as the inability of the Indian judiciary to cope with the case load -- is an overstatement and an uncharitable analysis.”Pendency cannot be a useful indicator of how well or poorly a system is doing, he said.The problem ailing the Indian judiciary is of delay, he added, and said he was of the strong view that the development of alternate dispute resolution (ADR) techniques such as arbitration, conciliation and mediation can reduce delays by settling disputes outside courts.The current state of mediation in the country shows that between 2005 and March 2021, nearly 3.22 million cases have been referred and nearly 1 million cases have been settled by nearly 43,000 mediation centres.To ensure mediation is successful, CJI suggested it should be prescribed as a “mandatory first step” for resolution of every allowable dispute. “Perhaps, an omnibus law in this regard is needed to fill the vacuum,” as mediation is not governed by any law unlike the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.Some recent laws, such as Commercial Courts Act 2015 and Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016, provide a clause for compulsory pre-litigation mediation.Since mediation is cheap and simple, it can benefit a vast majority of litigants in India who belong to middle and poorer sections of society, Justice Ramana added, giving the example of Lok Adalats that have helped reduced cases coming to courts.Over 7.84 million cases were settled by the Lok Adalats in 2019 and 2020 of which nearly 3.94 million cases were settled at the pre-litigation stage.The CJI cited the Indian epic Mahabharata to say that mediation, as a concept, is deeply embedded into the Indian ethos. In the epic, he said, Krishna’s futile attempt to mediate the dispute between the Pandavas and Kauravas was pivotal. “Failure of mediation led to disastrous consequences,” CJI said.He also cited the example the example of aeroplane pilots to suggest ways in which mediation can be improved. Commercial pilots have a simulator component in their training where they are equipped to respond to multiple scenarios – similarly, training programmes of mediators should contain such a component, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-know-that-judiciary-will-stand-by-them-says-cji-101626549918304.html
18-07-2021||India||Kanwariyas accept yatra cancellation, albeit reluctantly||For four consecutive years until Covid stopped him in 2020 and now in 2021, Ajay Kumar and a small group of friends travelled every July to Haridwar and came back with a small pot of holy water. Working odd jobs, Kumar, 21, saved a little over ₹8,000 as his contribution for the trip for hiring a truck, a DJ, new clothes, and other items such as food, water, generator and even videographers needed for the pilgrimage.His friends would begin planning for the 200-km trip months earlier – all for the joy and pride of getting to call themselves kanwariyas. This year though, they dropped the idea months ago. “I don’t have the money to spare,” said Kumar, who works as a food delivery agent.Late on Saturday, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to cancel the yatra amid Covid-19.Kumar said while he was worried that cancellations for two consecutive years could change the way the festival is celebrated, the decision has reduced his guilt of not being able to go for the pilgrimage due to financial constraints.“Now, I’ll just think that even if I could go for the yatra, I couldn’t have gone,” he said.The yatra, which attracted 36 million people in 2019, stoked a controversy this year after UP initially allowed the pilgrimage to go ahead despite experts warning that overcrowding and violating of Covid protocol could spark the third wave of infections across the country. Uttarakhand cancelled the yatra this week.The popular yatra attracts tens of millions of pilgrims across north India. For them, carrying holy water from the Ganga back to their local Shiva shrines is an article of faith. But for Kumar and his friends, religious devotion was mixed with something far more worldly – public recognition in their otherwise mundane lives.“There is always ‘astha’ (faith), but the yatra also offers freedom from the daily tensions of life,” said Kumar, wearing a shirt with Shiva’s image on it.“Local residents recognised me as an important part of the ‘Shiv Bhola Kanwar Samiti’. We were a popular group of local youngsters united by our joint participation in the yatra. Now, we are all just trying to find work and support our families,” Kumar said.Kumar and other kanwariyas were not particularly worried about the pandemic – they believe Shiva will take care of their health and immunity. “There is no fear of corona, this is a work of the Lord himself,” said Amar Singh Shekhawat, vice-president of Shiv Kanwar Sewa Sangh, a Ghaziabad-based group that organises camps for the kanwariyas. “A kanwar yatra will actually improve our immunity,” said Harish Singh, a 35-year-old businessman.Doctors and health experts rubbished these claims and warned that allowing the devotees to travel to Haridwar would not only endanger their lives but also cause a potential superspreader event that could trigger a devastating surge of infections.“Social distancing in the yatra is practically impossible. Devotees from far corners of north India will be travelling hundreds of kilometres and exposing themselves to risk,” said Dr Arun Gupta, senior consultant at Fortis Hospital and the president of Delhi Medical Council. Preparations for the yatra were elaborate. Noida resident Balaji Sinha and his friends created a WhatsApp group in March, followed by meetings, budget sessions, and donation collection drives.In recent years, however, kanwariyas have increasingly been associated with lawlessness and boorish behaviour in cities they pass through, such as Delhi.Mamata Sharma, who lived in east Delhi’s Dilshad Garden -- next to the road which the yatra takes -- said that she avoided letting her two daughters out on the streets during the kanwar season. “I feel there would be no accountability if something wrong happened.”The more serious devotees – who see the kanwar yatra as part of their vows to Shiva – dismiss these charges. Keshav Kumar is one of them.The 32-year-old Noida resident wakes up at 5.30am every day and exercises an hour in the local park, trying to rebuild his stamina for his role as dak bam (the courier who runs with the pot of water).Despite the announcement of cancellation, Keshav remains hopeful. “There is still time. The government may still find a way to make it happen. If not, I’ll see how I can carry out my vow differently,” he said. Ashok Bhati, president of the Shiv Kanwar Sewa Sangh, said he will ensure people abide by the UP government’s order to cancel the pilgrimage. “The disease must still be severe enough for the government to cancel the yatra. Those who must carry out the yatra will do it with the Ganga Jal saved from the previous year,” said Bhati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanwariyas-accept-yatra-cancellation-albeit-reluctantly-101626549017223.html
18-07-2021||India||Oppn to target govt over Covid, inflation, farm stir in House||The Centre’s management of the Covid-19 pandemic, price rise, the ongoing farmers’ agitation and implications of US troops pulling out of Afghanistan will be the focus of the Opposition strategy during the monsoon session of Parliament starting from Monday, representatives of various parties told Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu during a meeting on Saturday.During the meeting, the Opposition members also underlined the need for more scrutiny of bills by parliamentary committees.Responding to their suggestions, Naidu said though it is for the central government to take a view on referring bills to parliamentary committees, it may be “done to the extent possible”.He also urged the ministers, particularly the parliamentary affairs minister, to reach out to leaders of various parties and apprise them of key bills pending for passage, said a person aware of the details, who did not wish to be named. “The chairperson said all issues can be discussed in the House, but none should seek to force their own position on the others,” the person added.Naidu also called for upholding the spirit of cooperation in the House and said: “A dysfunctional Parliament adds to the prevailing gloom and hence all sections of the House should ensure a smooth and productive session as it offers an opportunity to address the concerns of the people affected by Covid-19.”According to people aware of the details, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP, Derek O’Brien had underscored the need for more scrutiny of bills by the Parliamentary committees.“He pointed out that while 60% of the bills were sent for Parliamentary scrutiny during the UPA1, the number was 71% during UPA2. During the current dispensation, the percentages of bills referred to the committees was 25% (NDA1) and 11% (NDA2),” said a person privy to the meeting.The TMC MP also tweeted that scrutiny of bills has “dropped drastically” and that the government should ensure discussions and calling attention motions are listed weekly and ensure rules and precedents are implemented.Opposition MPs have been raising the issue of lack of scrutiny of bills by Parliamentary committees. The Opposition leaders also asked for taking up issues of “broader concerns” for discussion in the House.“Leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge proposed discussion on the situation caused by Covid-19, including its impact on economy and employment, poverty, the possibility of a third wave and the government’s preparations for it, the ongoing farmers protest, China’s actions along the border, situation in Jammu and Kashmir and issues related to cooperative federalism,” said the person quoted above.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar suggested a discussion on the situation in Afghanistan and the implications of the withdrawal of US troops from the region.Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Binoy Viswam said the Chairperson assured the Opposition members that issues raised by the smaller parties in particular will be allocated time.The government on Friday said it is ready with facts and data to answer the questions that the Opposition will put forth during the upcoming monsoon session. “The government will respond to all the questions and issues that the Opposition raises...,” said a minister on condition of anonymity. Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi informed the meeting that the government has identified 29 bills, including six ordinances replacing bills and two items of financial business, for the session.Among those present at the meeting were the newly appointed Leader of the House Piyush Goyal, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-to-target-govt-over-covid-inflation-farm-stir-in-house-101626548597090.html
18-07-2021||India||Meeting with Modi touched upon issues of national interest: Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar appeared to downplay the speculation around his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, stating that they held discussions “on various issues of national interest”, including the Banking Amendments Act and the cooperative sector.The meeting, held against the backdrop of talks of fissures among Maharashtra’s ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies and the Enforcement Directorate’s action against NCP leaders Anil Deshmukh and Eknath Khadse created buzz in the political circles. Pawar had earlier in the week also met senior BJP leaders and Union ministers Piyush Goyal and Rajnath Singh.“Met the Hon’ble Prime Minister of our country Narendra Modi. Had a discussion on various issues of national interest,” Pawar said in a tweet.The 80-year-old former Maharashtra chief minister also tweeted a letter he wrote to the PM about the amendment to the Banking Act.“I reiterated in the letter that the aims and objectives of the amended Act are well-intentioned and many provisions are necessary… but at the same time it should be ensured that while doing so, the cooperative principles laid down in the Constitution are not sacrificed at the altar of over-zealous regulation,” Pawar said.The letter comes days after the Centre formed a new ministry of cooperation under home minister Amit Shah.NCP national spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik said there were no political implications of Pawar’s meetings with BJP leaders. He said the MVA partners knew about the meeting and “even CM Uddhav Thackeray was apprised of this meeting [with PM]”. “Pawar’s meeting [with Modi] took place as per the pre-determined appointment. Piyush Goyal had called on Pawar saheb as a courtesy call after his appointment as leader of the house. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had convened a meeting at his office with two former defence ministers Sharad Pawar and AK Antony yesterday…The speculation has no substance,” Malik said.Political analyst Hemant Desai, however, said that it would be wrong to assume that the meeting had no political implications. “NCP has been ambiguous on many fronts and has never taken a strong stand against the BJP and Modi. BJP is any way in the search of new allies ahead of the 2024 elections, so it would be wrong to say there was nothing political in this meeting,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meeting-with-modi-touched-uponissues-of-national-interest-pawar-101626548417132.html
18-07-2021||India||16k cases in Kerala as Covid spike continues||Kerala reported 16,148 new cases of the coronavirus disease on Saturday – the highest single-day increase in infections in over a month – as outbreak continued to expand again in the state which is currently India’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the high volume of cases coming out of the state is a matter of concern and emphasised the need for more vigil and surveillance.The test positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive for Covid-19 – remains the highest among India’s populous states. On Saturday, the positivity rate in the state was 10.8%. On average, 10.3% of all samples tested in the past week in the state have returned positive – nearly five times the national average of 2.1%. Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with increasing new cases, it indicates that the virus is spreading fast within the community.While the second wave of Covid has been receding in most regions in the country over the past two months, Kerala has been witnessing rising infections over the past four weeks, data shows.The seven-day average of daily infections in the state, which had dropped to 11,357 for the week ended June 27, has now again climbed to 13,409 cases a day in the past week. While this number has dropped more than 90% from peak of second wave across India, it has only fallen 65% in Kerala, data shows. This has resulted in the state becoming the biggest outbreak centre in the country. More than one-third of all infections reported across India in the past week have been in the state.The CM, however, put up a brave front and reiterated that there is no need of panic as the state’s healthcare system is equipped to deal with the rising cases. “High caseload is due to increased tests. We have set a high testing target and have been moving towards this. Even at the peak of second wave, the state did not utilise 70% of its hospital infrastructure. No oxygen shortage is reported here,” Vijayan said.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed concern over high volume of cases in Kerala and Maharashtra during a meeting with the CMs of six states.“It is true the state is reporting a lion’s share these days. We hope situation will stabilise by month-end,” said public health expert Dr N M Arun. To be sure, Kerala has performed the best in terms of deaths being reported among those infected with the virus. On average, while 1.5% of all reported cases across India have resulted in deaths, only 0.5% of confirmed Covid patients have died in Kerala.Central government ministers, however, said that the state wasn’t following a scientific approach, “ Instead of reaping political benefits out of pandemic control measures, it has to go by the guidelines of the Union Government and Indian Council of Medical Research,” said minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, who is from Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16k-cases-in-kerala-as-covid-spike-continues-101626548237173.html
18-07-2021||India||India administers 400mn coronavirus vaccine shots||India on Saturday crossed 400-million mark in the number of coronavirus vaccine doses administered across the country so far – a key milestone in the country’s inoculation drive, making it the highest number of shots given among any nation in the world with the exception of China.Until Saturday night, 404.5 million shots had been administered across the country to 318.4 million people, according to data released by the Union health ministry. This translates into a little over one-third of India’s eligible population (currently only people above the age of 18 years qualify for shots) having received at least one dose of the vaccine – 25.2% of India’s adults are partially vaccinated, and 8.7% have received both doses.But despite this milestone, India has the unique and monumental task of inoculating the world’s second largest population with nearly two-thirds of the eligible population yet to receive a single jab. The country’s vaccination drive, meanwhile, faces challenges such as constraints regarding supplies and production, and a heavily fluctuating pace of shot administration.“India takes another leap in the fight against #COVID19 by administering more than 40 crore vaccine doses so far under the world’s #LargestVaccineDrive!” said the ministry of health in a tweet on Saturday.Also on Saturday, two panchayats in Jammu and Kashmir completed 100% vaccination for everyone above the age of 18 years, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said. They join Ladakh, which achieved the feat earlier this month, as regions that have given single shots to their entire eligible populations. “I want to congratulate the ASHA [workers] and the people of the two panchayats in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajauri district for 100% vaccination. The way they have taken the vaccination drive to the most inaccessible places is admirable,” the minister said.India’s vaccination drive, which kicked off on January 16, has seen huge fluctuations so far. The drive picked up pace in April after it was opened up for everyone over the age of 45 years, but numbers remained low through May despite vaccinations being thrown open to everyone over the age of 18. This forced the central government to announce a change in procurement strategy, where the Centre purchased 75% of all vaccine doses and gave it to states for free starting June 21. As the latest vaccine policy kicked off, the vaccination rate briefly soared to its highest ever, but has again slowed down over the past few weeks. In the past week, India has averaged administration of around 4.1 million shots a day – a drop of over 36% of the peak levels seen in the third week of June. State governments too have said lately that they are facing severe scarcity of doses, and that some of them have had to close down some vaccination centres due to patchy supply. On Wednesday, Mandaviya said that vaccine availability in July was increased from 120 million doses to 135 million. Till the evening of July 17, nearly 64 million doses had been administered in the month.On Friday, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with the chief ministers of six states regarding the Covid-19 outbreak, the CMs of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu stressed on the need for increased vaccine supply. The PM assured them of all possible help in taking forward the Covid-19 vaccination drive.These states were in addition to several regions such as Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Odisha, who have over the past week raised concerns over their diminishing vaccine supplies.Earlier this week, Mandaviya had said that “misinformed” statements were being put out to “create panic” among people regarding vaccine supply. He added that states knew “well in advance” the time and volume of doses they were scheduled to get, so any supply shortage was the result of “mismanagement” at the state level.Till Saturday morning, 416 million doses of vaccines have been sent to states, with another 1.8 million doses in the pipeline, according to the government data.Experts, however, stressed that with less than 10% of the country’s adults fully vaccinated, it still leaves a massive task at hand for the government.“Having fully vaccinated less than 10% of the eligible population is too small a fraction if our aim is to inoculate a big enough proportion of the country to reduce the transmission of the infection... We need to vaccinate at least 40-50% of the eligible population (to achieve that),” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore. He said that in order to solve the issue of patchy vaccine supply and production, the government should have started stockpiling vaccines when they entered Phase 3 of trials. “Once vaccine candidates pass Phase 1 and 2 of trials, we know there’s a good chance they will get approved. The government should have started ordering doses then. Instead they waited till the drug regulator approved the vaccines and bought stockpiles that were created by the companies. The manufacturing capacity has been increased only in the last couple of months, the effect of which will only be seen August onwards,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-administers-400mn-coronavirus-vaccine-shots-101626548177180.html
18-07-2021||India||Punjab formula will be accepted by all, says CM||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh said on Saturday that he will accept any decision of the Congress high command on changes in the state unit but, people aware of the situation said, he refused to meet Navjot Singh Sidhu unless the latter made a public apology for tweets and statements critical of the state government.The developments suggest the apology may lead to a possible way for the two Punjab leaders to reach a compromise. Sidhu is tipped to take over as the head of the party’s state unit, but the elevation has been stuck over objections from Singh, who on Friday wrote a letter to the Congress central leadership warning of a split if Sidhu were to be elevated.The state is due for elections early next year and both leaders enjoy wide support. The Congress has rushed Harish Rawat, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge to deal with the situation.“Had a fruitful meeting with @harishrawatcmuk. Reiterating that any decision of @INCIndia President will be acceptable to all. Raised certain issues which he said he’ll take up with @INCIndia president: @capt_amarinder,” the chief minister’s media adviser Raveen Thukral said in tweet after Singh and Rawat met.According to a person aware of the developments, Singh made his precondition for the apology known to Rawat when the latter suggested the CM and Sidhu meet.“Capt told the state in-charge that he will not meet Sidhu till he tenders a public apology for putting out hundreds of derogatory tweets and statements in the media against him,” said one of the people aware of the matter, asking not to be named.“One thing is very clear... Captain Amarinder Singh ji who had earlier made a ‘mahan’ (great) statement that that whatever decision will be taken by the Congress president will be honoured by him reiterated that statement today,” Rawat told reporters.The truce formula also involves the appointment of four working presidents to balance caste and religious equations, a second person aware of the discussions said, asking not to be named. Amarinder cautioned the central leadership that if Sidhu, a Jat Sikh, is appointed the state unit chief, it could lead to a split in the party, and advocated for a Hindu face for the position.In his meeting with Rawat, Singh conveyed his displeasure over the way the central leadership handled the infighting in Punjab, particularly what he said was insufficient consultation, premature announcements and deliberate leaks, the first person quoted above said.Sidhu has in recent months made several tweets and appeared on media interviews accusing the chief minister of colluding with the rival Shiromani Akal Dal’s Badals, promoting mafia raj, and allowing corruption in the government.Several cabinet ministers sought action against Sidhu for repeatedly targeting the chief minister in public for several weeks, but the high command was not seen to have acted on these. Sidhu has held meetings recently with the Gandhis.On Saturday, Sidhu was in Chandigarh and called on several senior party leaders, starting with the incumbent state chief Sunil Jakhar. Their meeting lasted nearly 45 minutes during which he sought Jakhar’s support and margdarshan (guidance). “He (Jakhar) is an elder brother and a guiding force,” Sidhu told reporters after they came out together.Jakhar said Sidhu is “very capable and does not need any guidance”.Sidhu also met cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa at his residence in Chandigarh where party MLAs Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Barindermeet Singh Pahra, Devender Singh Ghubaya, Kulbir Singh Zira, Darshan Singh Brar were also present.A day earlier, on Friday, Sidhu called on Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo, both former presidents of Punjab Congress and known rivals of the chief minister.On Saturday, after the CM met Rawat, he was visited by Bajwa and assembly speaker Rana KP Singh and cabinet minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi.Bajwa has been a strident critic of the CM for most part of his current tenure and their meeting signalled a possible realignment of forces in the state Congress. “Good to see @Partap_Sbajwa & @capt_amarinder together along with our Hon’ble Speaker @RanakpINC & @iranaosodhi. Partap who I know since 1983 and Captain Sahib would make a good team for the times ahead. He is an old dyed in the wool Congress man,” said senior Congress leader and MP Manish Tewari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-formula-will-be-accepted-by-all-says-cm-101626547098180.html
18-07-2021||India||Indigenous anti-drone technology to be made available soon: Shah||The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and other agencies are working on indigenous counter-drone technology, and it will be available soon, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday and added that all gaps in India’s border fencing will be covered by 2022.The comments came over two weeks after a drone was used to target the Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Jammu with explosives on June 27. The explosives left two personnel injured. Drones have since been repeatedly spotted hovering over military installations in the region.“Smuggling of drugs, arms, and explosives through tunnels and drones is a major challenge. Today, it is very important for us to deal with these challenges at the earliest. I am confident that we will soon increase our presence at the borders with Swadeshi (made-in-India) anti-drone technology,” Shah said at an investiture ceremony of the Border Security Force (BSF).The June 27 attack on the IAF station was the first such instance of Pakistan-based terrorists deploying unmanned aerial vehicles to strike at vital installations in India. The National Investigation Agency is investigating the case. There have been several incidents of terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs, and money to fuel terrorism in the region. At least 300 drones have been sighted along the border there with Pakistan since 2019.HT last week reported several rounds of meetings have been held between various agencies and private players on a technology to detect, identify and mitigate the threat of rogue drones. A procurement plan for it is at an advanced stage.Shah told top security officers at the investiture ceremony that it is their responsibility to find new technology with help of experts to help India deal with the threat of the use of Artificial Intelligence and robotics technology by enemies and terrorists.Intelligence Bureau chief Aravind Kumar, Research and Analysis Wing head Samant Goel, BSF director general Rakesh Asthana and heads of other central police forces attended the ceremony.Shah said all gaps in India’s border fencing will be filled by 2022 to completely end the infiltration and other anti-national activities.India shares over 15,000 km land border with Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan.Fencing has been sanctioned over 2,069 km of the 3,323-km-long India-Pakistan border. It has been completed over 2,021 km. India shares a 4,096-km-long border with Bangladesh. About 3063.24 km of it has been fenced.The government last year approved a plan to replace the old with a new design fencing with “anti-cut, anti-rust, and anti-climb features”. Shah cited the hurdles in the fencing at certain stretches--habitations within 150 yards of the border, pending land acquisition and protests by the border populations, and bureaucratic hurdles. He added these hurdles often delay the fencing progress. He added the issues were being sorted out through discussions.“If 97% border is fenced, then that 3% is part of the problem as it leaves an opportunity for the infiltrators. The government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked towards resolving the border security issues. There is no benefit if there are gaps. So, I can assure you that there will be no gaps in fencing on the border by 2022,” said Shah. “A country cannot be secure if its borders are not secure.”Shah praised the BSF for its work in guarding borders and especially in detecting tunnels used by terrorists and smugglers. He urged the paramilitary forces deployed at different borders to make sure the local populations do not migrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigenous-counter-drone-technology-very-soon-shah-101626511996661.html
