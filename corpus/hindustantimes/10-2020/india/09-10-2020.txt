The police, however, have denied the charge, saying that the pagri fell off during the scuffle and that the man was asked to put it on before he was arrested. The outrage over the incident had cricketer Harbhajan Singh tweeting to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday, saying: ‚ÄúPlease look into this matter @MamataOfficial this isn‚Äôt done.‚ÄùHe posted tweets and news video clippings tweeted by BJP‚Äôs Delhi unit secretary Impreet Singh Bakshi. The same tweets and videos were also shared by BJP national secretary Arvind Menon and other leaders.‚ÄúIn Bengal, is there no respect for people from other religious faiths except a specific one?‚Äù tweeted Menon. A few members of the Sikh community staged a silent protest in central Kolkata. They carried small posters that sought ‚Äújustice‚Äù for Singh. News footage of Thursday‚Äôs incident showed that Singh grappled with three policemen and there was jostling during which his turban came off. Police charged Singh under the Indian Arms Act as the licence he carried was issued in Rajourie, Kashmir. It was not valid in West Bengal. Singh was produced in Howrah court on Friday and remanded in custody. ‚ÄúThe concerned person was carrying firearms in yesterday‚Äôs protest. The Pagri had fallen off automatically in the scuffle that ensued, without any attempt to do so by our officer (visible in the video attached). It is never our intention to hurt the sentiments of any community,‚Äù The West Bengal Police tweeted around 10 pm on Friday, attaching a video of the incident. ¬†The concerned person was carrying firearms in yesterday's protest.

BJYM national president and Lok Sabha MP from Bangalore South, Tejasvi Surya has also accused the police of insulting the party‚Äôs MPs.Surya and two BJP MPs from Bengal went to Jorasanko police station to lodge complaint against the police for the injuries suffered by party workers during the baton charge on Thursday. The BJP MP alleged that he and the others were shoved by the officers.

09-10-2020||India||First time since lockdown, commercial vehicles in Assam begin carrying 100% passengers||Commercial passenger vehicles in Assam started carrying 100 percent passengers from Friday - the first such instance since March when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to control the spread of Covid-19. The move follows concessions made by the state government after the All Assam Motor Transport Association (AAMTA) launched an indefinite strike since Monday, seeking an increase in fares to offset losses suffered due to Covid-19 restrictions. ‚ÄúThe bus operators have been asked not to carry passengers beyond the total seating capacity, provide hand sanitisers, ensure everyone wears a face mask and sanitise the buses after each trip,‚Äù Ashok Bhattarai, chairman of Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) said. The list of demands by the AAMTA included waiving of road tax for one year, waiver of quarterly tax on vehicles, increase in bus fares and financial relief to transporters due to Covid-19 restrictions. Also read: Flipkart tells Nagaland customer no service outside India. Then apologisesAs per the government guidelines, buses and other commercial passenger vehicles in Assam were operating with 50 percent occupancy to maintain social distancing among passengers. To press for their demands, buses and other passenger vehicles stayed off the roads since Monday while the government tried to ease problems faced by passengers by plying around 650 buses belonging to the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) on the roads. After a round of deliberations on Tuesday between the AAMTA and the government failed to end the strike, another meeting was held on Thursday where it was agreed that operating vehicles with 50 percent occupancy with the existing rates was not commercially viable. ‚ÄúWe received a notification from the government on Thursday evening allowing us to operate with 100 percent occupancy. We have called off our strike and most vehicles are back on the roads from Friday,‚Äù Pradip Das, general secretary AAMTA told media. The government, however, refused to allow transporters to increase bus fares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-time-since-lockdown-commercial-vehicles-in-assam-begin-carrying-100-passengers/story-gcRQKent5at82PWZCzwLFO.html

09-10-2020||India||India gets second set of data on Swiss bank account holders: Official||The Switzerland authorities have shared details of bank accounts of Indians nationals and entities allegedly holding black money as part of a confidential agreement between the two countries, people familiar with the development said. The data will be examined by agencies dealing with black money investigations to see if there are any irregularities in these bank accounts belonging to Indians, people cited above added. The latest exchange of financial data by Switzerland‚Äôs Federal Tax Administration (FTA) ‚Äì second time in last one year - is part of the framework of the global standard on the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) to combat the problem of offshore tax evasion and avoidance and stashing of unaccounted money abroad requiring cooperation amongst tax authorities, a senior finance ministry official said.The information exchange this year with 86 countries including India involves nearly 3.1 million (31 lakh) financial accounts, FTA said in a statement on Friday. It is not immediately known exactly how many of these are accounts linked to Indians.India has activated AEOI relationship for receiving information from over 96 jurisdictions such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands and Mauritius. Switzerland and India had signed a joint declaration on the introduction of AEOI on tax matters on November 22, 2016 on reciprocal basis. The first set of documents on accounts held by Indian residents in Swiss banks was shared in September last year for the year 2018, said this finance ministry official. ‚ÄúThe data, thus, received are processed by tax authorities and agencies and the processing of information takes time. If some suspicious activities are found involving certain individual accounts, agencies probe their details further and on the basis of material evidence, notices are served and taxes along with penalties are recovered,‚Äù the official said. This official declined to divulge any detail because of the confidential agreement.Amit Maheshwari, Partner AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm told HT, ‚ÄúAEOI is an important tool under the aegis of Gobal Forum to help countries get important information on an automatic basis instead of on request. This will help countries and in this case India to use this information to investigate whether account holders have correctly paid taxes on these overseas assets. Overseas assets by Indians are a focus area of the government and this exchange of information would form the backbone of the quest to bring to task tax evaders who have stashed money abroad.‚Äù Sherbir Panag, Partner at Panag and Babu and international legal expert on white collar crimes, said: ‚ÄúThe Global Forum is a step in the right direction towards a more cohesive exchange of financial accounts between countries. Safe havens and lack of transparency, touted by some countries for foreign investment attraction - remain a big impediment to the global fight against money laundering and financial crimes. Nothing frustrates the efforts of national law enforcement authorities and victims of fraud, as much as lack of international cooperation. That said, there‚Äôs a long way to go for meaningful reform.‚Äù||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gets-second-set-of-data-on-swiss-bank-account-holders-official/story-kSR7acJlyEthdb3iipO5WP.html
09-10-2020||India||Odisha CM‚Äôs Twitter handle falls victim to fake news on Oxford University||A spate of news articles on a study by a team of researchers at the Oxford University, UK, and the Northeastern University, US, on the Odisha model of Covid-19 may turn out to be fake. The news was also shared by the official Twitter handle of Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik but the post was deleted. On Thursday, a few websites reported that a study by UK‚Äôs Oxford University and the Northeastern University of the United States praised the Ganjam district of Odisha and Dharavi slums of Mumbai for their strategy to deal with the pandemic. First reported by a little-known website called pledgetimes.com on October 8, the report described how a study by the Oxford University found Ganjam in Odisha and Dharavi slums in Mumbai managed to ‚Äúimprison Corona‚Äù.The news item did not mention the title of the study but spoke of how Ganjam and Dharavi managed to control the surge in Covid-19 cases trying to pass off the success as the findings of the study. Several news portals and websites of local newspapers picked up the story with each of them repeating that ‚ÄúOxford University study praised the Ganjam and Dharavi model of fighting the pandemic‚Äù.Also read: ‚ÄòModi made crises‚Äô India could‚Äôve avoided: Cong‚Äôs 10 point attack at CentreWhen asked on Twitter to post the link of the study, the CMO Twitter handle did not reply. However, a senior official of Odisha government later pointed out to a study titled ‚ÄòCrowding and the shape of Covid-19 epidemics‚Äô by the Oxford University and the Northeastern University that was published in the highly-respected ‚ÄúNature Medicine‚Äù journal on October 5. The study said small, close-knit communities are at high risk for rapid, intense Covid outbreaks especially if they haven‚Äôt yet experienced outbreaks of Covid-19. The study showed that whether Covid outbreaks come to a fast, dramatic peak or whether they are long and drawn-out is more closely related to city layout and social structures than city size and density.The paper, ‚ÄòCrowding and the shape of Covid-19 epidemics‚Äô used epidemiological data from Chinese cities and Italian provinces, climate and population data, and the response to local interventions as measured by human mobility and Covid-19. Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset was used to identify drivers of transmission and create a model to predict the risk of high-peak outbreaks based on similar data from 310 cities around the world.While several websites claimed that the study praised the Ganjam and Dharavi model of dealing with the pandemic, none of these claims was found in the report whose central hypothesis was how unaffected area can see a rapid peak in cases when individuals had high rates of contact within social units, such as households, care homes and prisons.The study also did not include Ganjam as it selected only 310 urban centres from the European Commission Global Human Settlement Urban Centre Database. To ensure global coverage, up to five most populous cities in each country were selected including Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.An e-mail sent to the study‚Äôs lead authors Samuel V Scarpino, Oliver G Pybus and Moritz UG Kraemer, seeking reply whether the paper praised any particular model of controlling the pandemic, did not elicit any response.Ganjam, which saw an influx of over 5 lakh migrant workers from Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other parts of India after lockdown, had become a Covid-19 hotspot by late July when it reported around 10,000 cases. Apart from the returning migrants, the compartment-like dwelling housing of the people in the district contributed to the surge. Later, intensive door-to-door screening of people with Covid-19 symptoms and quick treatment brought the numbers down. Though it recorded the highest Covid-19 casualty of 221, the active caseload has come down too.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrita Kulange, whose Twitter handle too posted a tweet talking of the praise from Oxford University over its handling of the epidemic, said he has not seen the study. ‚ÄúThe Oxford University people may have done the study independently. But no one has contacted me for the study,‚Äù said Kulange. After several people started questioning the authenticity of the claim of the government, the CMO‚Äôs Twitter handle deleted one post which referred to the praise by Oxford University.This is not the first time when well-known, verified Twitter handles have fallen victims to fake news. In August this year, Odisha Governor Ganeshi Lal and Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Pratap Sarangi congratulated IAF wing commander Nikhil Rath for a feat he never accomplished.While all of them took to Twitter to congratulate Wing Commander Rath for being ‚Äúselected for the country‚Äôs first manned space mission Gaganayan‚Äù scheduled for 2022, none of them had checked the authenticity of the information. Though Rath had been included among the 25 pilots shortlisted in 2019 for Gaganayan, he never made it to the four candidates who were finally selected for the mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cm-s-twitter-handle-falls-victim-to-fake-news-on-oxford-university/story-Wbp9TQZksoNJBFf8rYcmVK.html

09-10-2020||India||‚ÄòModi made crises‚Äô that India could have avoided: Congress launches 10-point attack at Centre||The Congress on Friday focussed on 10 moves taken by the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government during the coronavirus pandemic, including the lockdown and the three farm laws, which the opposition party said could have been avoided.‚Äú10 Modi made crises that could have been avoided but have instead devastated our nation. #BJPseNaHoPayega,‚Äù the grand old party posted on Twitter along with a video. In a one-minute clipping, the Congress slammed the government for India being on the spot in terms of Covid-19 tally, ‚Äòill-planned‚Äù lockdown decision, farms laws and ‚Äúlying‚Äù on Chinese intrusion in Ladakh. ¬†10 Modi made crises that could have been avoided but have instead devastated our nation. #BJPseNaHoPayega pic.twitter.com/VAYVwjYnlMAmong others issues, the Congress targeted the government over the migrant workers‚Äô crisis, scams amid the pandemic, Covid-19 relief package, passing of bills without discussion in the Rajya Sabha, allowing gross violations of human rights in Uttar Pradesh and lying about data related to migrants, Covid-19 and jobs. The party added that the list goes on and on.Here‚Äôs a look at some of Congress‚Äô key allegations against the Modi government1. Ill-planned 8pm lockdownThe Sonia Gandhi-led party slammed the government for suddenly announcing the 21-day nationwide lockdown on March 24 when the coronavirus disease had claimed 12 lives and there were more than 500 confirmed cases in the country. Prime Minister Modi had stated that a shutdown was the only way to break the chain of infections.The Congress has time and again slammed the move as ‚Äúill-planned‚Äù saying that the government did not take into consideration the plight of migrants and daily-wage workers. It had also called the lockdown a ‚Äúpause‚Äù and not a solution for the crisis at hand.2. Migrant workers‚Äô crisisThe grand-old party also took note of the migrant workers‚Äô crisis as scores of them across states had to walk back on foot to their home states as no transport was available during the initial days of the lockdown. Former party president Rahul Gandhi also met some migrants in Delhi in May. In a video, the migrants were seen saying that more than the coronavirus, hunger is hurting them and that is why they were not afraid of getting killed on the roads.3. Scams amid pandemicIn the video on Friday, the party accused the government of leading scams amid the pandemic but did not reveal any details about the claim it made in this regard. It was an apparent reference to senior Congress leader and former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah‚Äôs allegation that the BJP government in the state was involved in a Rs 2,200 crore scam related to the purchase of Covid-19 related equipment.4. Lied on Chinese intrusionThe Congress had earlier too attacked the Centre over the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) intrusion amid an ongoing border standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. A row had erupted over a defence ministry statement on August 4 that acknowledged that the Chinese army had transgressed into multiple areas in the sensitive sector but was taken down two days later.5. Jumla relief package for the economyThe Congress renewed its attack on the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package that the government launched in view of the coronavirus crisis. Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram had earlier said, ‚ÄúThere is nothing in what the finance minister said for the lakhs of poor, hungry and devastated migrant workers who have walked ‚Äî and many thousands are still walking ‚Äî back to their home states. This is a cruel blow dealt to those who toil every day,‚Äù6. Black farm bills that will destroy farmers, benefit crony capitalistsDays after concluding several tractor rallies in Punjab and Haryana, the Congress again accused the Modi government of passing ‚Äúblack farm bills‚Äù during the monsoon session of Parliament. The party was referring to The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which were cleared in the Rajya Sabha amid a ruckus by the Opposition parties that the bills were passed without voting.7. Gross violations of human rights in UPIn an apparent reference to the gang-rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman by four ‚Äúupper caste‚Äù men in UP‚Äôs Hathras district, the Congress has alleged the government has allowed gross violations of human rights in the state. This comes after the victim died last week in a Delhi hospital and her body was cremated by the UP police at 2:30am the following day against the wishes of her family members, who were allegedly locked inside their home and were being threatened. A Congress delegation, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, met the victim‚Äôs family members and assured them of support in seeking justice for their daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-made-crises-that-india-could-have-avoided-congress-lists-a-10-point-jibe/story-iU7rKe8ioMWkBn9ByfBYVO.html

In addition to repeated advisories, warnings and booking of at least three cases against MP for violation of Covid guidelines, there is no improvement in behaviour,‚Äù Mishra wrote in the letter.‚ÄúSuch irresponsible behaviour on the part of a people‚Äôs representative will demotivate the Covid Warriors and is an insult to all those who have lost their lives. And it also sends a completely contradictory message to the people at large especially in the light of the Honourable Prime Minister‚Äôs repeated messages and his appeal yesterday,‚Äù he said.Sarangi, who in July was penalised by police for violating social distancing guidelines, however denied that she had violated any Covid guidelines.‚ÄúAfter arriving at Bhubaneswar two days ago, I have always been masked up. PM Modi ji has asked us to do our work with proper masking and I have not forgotten it. But did the minister raise any questions about one of his ministers and party MLA attending the funeral of party MLA Pradip Maharathy last week despite testing positive for Covid-19. Did he write to CM questioning their conduct,‚Äù asked Sarangi.The minister further wrote that as Sarangi is a people‚Äôs representative and national spokesperson of the BJP, it is important that she inspires people to follow the Covid guidelines at this very critical juncture.‚ÄúThese are tough times when people have obeyed the lockdown and sacrificed their livelihood. But the video clearly shows Sarangi surrounded by hundreds of women who are neither wearing masks nor maintaining social distance and indulging in song and dance with utter disregard to Covid guidelines issued under the National Disaster Management Act despite repeated appeals made by the Prime Minister regarding the same,‚Äù he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-gets-complaint-against-bjp-lawmaker-for-violating-covid-guidelines/story-kePPUfZc8CEvpi2RhKT2RI.html

The court said Naik had filed an application under section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for investigation. ‚ÄúThe office is hereby directed to issue intimation to the circle police inspector of Kyathasandra police station along with (a) photostat copy of the complaint for the report,‚Äù the court said, according to PTI.Watch | ‚ÄòFile FIR against Kangana Ranaut‚Äô: Karnataka court over ‚Äòanti-farmer‚Äô tweet¬†Naik, who hails from Kyathasandra, said the court had directed the jurisdictional police station to register an FIR and inquire in connection with his criminal case against the actor.‚ÄúPeople who spread misinformation and rumours about CAA that caused riots are the same people who are now spreading misinformation about Farmers bill and causing terror in the nation, they are terrorists.

Since he arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday, the chairman of Afghanistan‚Äôs High Council for National Reconciliation has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and army chief Gen MM Naravane and briefed them on the peace process and the talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha.

He made the remarks shortly after US President Donald Trump tweeted that he planned to pull out all American troops from Afghanistan by Christmas, months ahead of the earlier deadline of May 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/full-support-for-peace-in-afghanistan-jaishankar-to-abdullah-abdullah/story-GVuBoC3UO6vrBrGG4bAUYM.html

The government has stationed Rs 20 crore, and the tower will come up in 10 months, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, claiming that it will be the first of its kind in the world.Following high pollution levels in the national capital, the Supreme Court had in November 2019 asked the Centre and the Delhi government to come up with a road map on installing smog towers in the national capital region (NCR) to combat air pollution. Delhi‚Äôs first smog tower came up at Lajpat Nagar central market on January 3. Gautam Gambhir, former cricketer and BJP MP from East Delhi inaugurated a prototype air purifier at Lajpat Nagar. The 20-feet-tall tower is fitted with exhaust fans to suck in polluted air and can remove up to 80% of the particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM10) -- the primary pollutant in Delhi‚Äôs air.Know everything about smog tower and how it works:1. Smog towers are structures designed to work as large-scale air purifiers. They are usually fitted with multiple layers of air filters, which clean the air of pollutants as it passes through them.2. The smog tower sucks the polluted air, which is purified by the multiple layers before re-circulated into the atmosphere. To purify the air; the highly effective H14 grade Highly Effective Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) filter would be used. This filter can clean up to 99.99% Particulate Matter (PM) present in the air with the help of pre-filter and activated carbon.3. The smog tower installed in Lajpat Nagar is cylindrical in design and built like a pole with a big inlet and four outlet units. The giant air purifier is fitted with exhaust fans to suck in polluted air with the help of a big inlet unit. It is painted in four colours ‚Äì orange on the top, white in the middle, green colour just above the bottom and blue at the bottom. The tower will run on electricity.4. The cost of each smog tower is to be around Rs 10 to 12 crore which includes filtering equipment, monitoring system and construction of the tower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-connaught-place-to-get-a-smog-tower-what-you-need-to-know/story-UQ4l6aJvlMVjYUfDqWlqpN.html

The device developed could largely help in monitoring the quality of food being offered to children in schools under the mid-day meal programme in the country. It could also potentially help the farmers in selling their produce directly to the buyers by enabling the buyers to assess the quality of the produce from any corner of the state.

In addition to Karnataka, seven other states received similar letters from NCPCR.Taking serious view of the letter, amicus curiae Gaurav Agarwal, who is assisting the court in the suo moto proceeding, said, ‚ÄúThe pandemic has rendered children even more vulnerable, as it appears that cases of domestic abuse, child labour, child marriages are increasing, and increasing poverty has led to a substantial increase in the number of children in need of care and protection.‚ÄùAnnexing the letter with a short note, Agarwal said that such a direction could not be given by NCPCR unless they were satisfied about the suitability of the parents, guardian, or fit person with whom the child is to be repatriated. This duty is cast upon NCPCR under Section 40(3) of Juvenile Justice Act, Agarwal said.The three-judge bench of justices LN Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi agreed with Agarwal and issued a notice to the Centre and NCPCR to file a response. The bench said, ‚ÄúSuch repatriation may be done on a case to case basis but not as a general order‚Ä¶This may be problematic for children who have been sent back.‚Äù The court has posted the matter for hearing on November 24.The Centre, too, shared the concern expressed by the Court. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhatti said, ‚ÄúOur officers are trying to find out the circumstances under which such a direction was issued by NCPCR. It is true that cases of domestic violence and abuse of children are on the rise during the pandemic.‚ÄùThe apex court had issued an order on April 3 this year asking CCIs and shelter homes to ensure there is no crowding of inmates in their institutions. Two instances were brought to the attention of the court wherein children contracted Covid-19 as necessary precautions were not taken.‚ÄúThe NCPCR seems to have made the April 3 order of the Court as the basis for its letter,‚Äù Agarwal said, pointing out that the April 3 order was a temporary measure to help contain the spread of pandemic. ‚ÄúMany children are in CCIs due to poverty or their parents‚Äô incapacity to look after them. There are children who are orphaned, abandoned, victims of child abuse, trafficking, child labour, child marriage, and homeless. For them, institutional care is the only resort,‚Äù Agarwal stated in his note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncpcr-decision-to-send-children-in-care-centres-back-to-their-families-draws-supreme-court-ire/story-gu4hfUlcuOPir8TovL6h5I.html
09-10-2020||India||‚ÄòKerala hasn‚Äôt learnt‚Äô: Ecologists react to tunnel project in Western Ghats||Green activists in Kerala are opposing the proposed 6.8 km tunnel along Kozhikode-Wayanad road, to be the third longest tunnel in the country once completed, calling it a recipe for ecological and other natural disasters. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had launched the project on Monday with much fanfare and vowed it will be completed in three years time. The state government had given administrative sanction for the first phase of the project, worth Rs 658 crore, and roped in the Konkan Railway Corporation Limited for its construction. The government also took the Catholic Church into confidence before announcing the project. Thamarassery Bishop Remigiose Inchananiyil was one of the guests at the launch ceremony. During protests against Madhav Gadgil and Kasturirangan committee reports on the Western Ghats, the church was at the forefront as most of the fringe forest areas were allegedly occupied by associated believers. The church had said the two reports were a ploy to push believers out of their land. The project is yet to get mandatory environmental clearance from various agencies and no environmental impact study has been done, claimed a prominent group of environmentalists. ‚ÄúIt is a big joke that the CM announced the project one fine morning and gave it much publicity like the recent Atal tunnel in Leh. No environmental impact or feasibility study was done. We feel it is only a poll gimmick and we suspect mining barons want to plunder granite and stones in the name of tunnel construction,‚Äù said Wayanad Prakruthi Samraskshna Samiti, a prominent group of environmentalists and nature- lovers. However, the Left parties said the ‚Äúdream project‚Äù will go ahead and there will be no surrendering to ‚Äúhyper green activism.‚Äù Also Read: IIT Mandi researchers develop cost-effective, environment friendly catalystThe CM said many projects were stalled due to controversies in the past and the tunnel project will not be allowed to meet the same fate. They have asked grassroots units of the party to muster support for the project. ‚ÄúMany development projects are mired in controversies. Now controversies can wait, developmental projects will go ahead,‚Äù the CM said, and added that the government will clear all the hurdles in its path. According to the government the tunnel will reduce the distance between Kozhikode and Mysuru by 30 kms. It is alleged that the state forest department was kept in the dark over the tunnel project, which will pass through mountain ranges of the ecologically sensitive Camel Hub Complex. State forest minister K Raju is reported to have registered his protest on the issue. Also Read: Kanjur draws black kites, may threaten aircraft safety while landing: BNHS tells Bombay HCIt is the same area where a massive landslide took place last year claiming many lives in Puthumala. Geological Survey of India had suggested minimum human interference in the area. ‚ÄúKaladi, where the tunnel will end is a high intensity rainfall area which receives at least five times the normal rainfall. In both expert panel reports on Western Ghats (Gadgil and Kasturirangan), it was earmarked as the most sensitive area. It is also a favourite habitat of the Asian elephants,‚Äù said N Badusha, a conservationist. He said it was difficult to buy the government‚Äôs theory that a subterranean tunnel won‚Äôt affect dense forests and pristine hills. Environmental activists are planning a convention in Wayanad against the tunnel once Covid-19 situation improves. They say they are shocked by the way the CM announced the project and set a deadline. ‚ÄúIt seems Kerala is yet to learn a lesson from two consecutive floods that claimed many lives; its greed is not on the wane either. It has kept its eyes on some of the remaining green cover. Votaries of the tunnel should think about the next generation also,‚Äù said Dr V S Vijayan, environmental scientist who was in the team of Madhav Gadgil committee that prepared a report on the fragile ecology of depleting Western Ghats. Vijayan said it is one of the most vulnerable areas of the 1,600 km long Western Ghats mountain ranges that play a key role in breaking clouds during the monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hasn-t-learnt-ecologists-react-to-tunnel-project-in-western-ghats/story-C17vG9Zr9Jsm7G2yNaiG5M.html

A Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft was used to test-fire the indigenously developed new generation anti-radiation missile (NGARM) off the country‚Äôs east coast.Rudram 1 can be integrated to IAF‚Äôs Sukhoi-30 jets and used as its launch platform. Rudram 1 can be used to detect and hone in on a radio source, according to defence website defenceupdate.in. This gives Rudram 1 the ability to detect enemy radars on the ground. Once these missiles disarm enemy radars on the ground, it can help inflict more damage in the attacks that follow the first wave.NGARM‚Äôs primary guidance system is an on-board passive homing head (PHH) armed with broadband capability. These features allow it to choose and select a target among the range of emitters that it sees at that point of time. The new NGARMs with PHH operates in the D-J band and can detect radio frequency emission from 100km away. Rudram 1 is a target seeking missile and contains a radar dome which is critical for missiles which can be used to target and destroy enemy based radars on the ground. Rudram can strike any range between 100-250 km.Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated IAF and DRDO for its successful test. ‚ÄúThe New Generation Anti-Radiation Missile (Rudram-1) which is India‚Äôs first indigenous anti-radiation missile developed by DRDO for Indian Air Force was tested successfully today at ITR, Balasore. Congratulations to DRDO & other stakeholders for this remarkable achievement,‚Äù the defence minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rudram-missile-how-do-ngarms-work/story-C2mUYlqGY9hvU34D7lty2H.html

Union minister for panchayati raj Narendra Singh Tomar will also join the programme. The property cards being rolled out under the SVAMITVA scheme launched by the Prime Minister in April are physical copies of property titles of the villagers‚Äô homes and the surrounding areas they own (as opposed to the cultivated land), which will be handed over to around 132,000 landowners during the event.Post the launch, the state governments will physically distribute the cards to people from more than 750 villages across six states. ‚ÄúThe historic move set to transform rural India‚Äù will enable around 100,000 property holders to download their property cards through an SMS link delivered on their mobile phones.According to the PMO, the beneficiaries are from 763 villages including 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and 2 from Karnataka.Beneficiaries from all the states, except Maharashtra, will receive the physical copies of the property cards within one day and since the western state has a system of recovering the nominal cost these cards, it will take a month‚Äôs time, it added.The SVAMITVA scheme will cover 662,000 villages in a phased manner over a period of four years and the move will pave the way for using property as a financial asset by villagers for taking loans and other financial benefits, the statement said. The PMO also hailed the exercise as the first such large-scale exercise, involving the most modern means of technology, that will benefit millions of rural property owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-property-cards-under-svamitva-scheme-on-oct-11/story-6ortWNs79HseKp26cTMmRP.html

In a tweet, PM Modi later said he appreciated Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúimmense personal contribution‚Äù to strengthening the special and privileged strategic partnership between the two counries. Among others who congratulated President Putin on his birthday were leaders of Israel, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Moldova, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.It is interesting to note that while Russia and China have an economic and security relationship, the personal touch between President Putin and President Xi Jinping has been missing from both sides.According to diplomats based in Moscow and New Delhi, while Russia has offered India winter clothing and Sprut light weight tanks with a T-90 barrel for Ladakh stand-off, there are reports that Moscow has delayed the supply of the second S-400 surface to air missile system ostensibly on account of the coronavirus pandemic. China has contracted to buy four S-400 systems from Russia, the first one has already been deployed near Nyingchi across Arunachal Pradesh.India has a deal to buy 5 S-400 systems from Russia, deliveries of which are likely to begin at the end of next year.

The party had used the same formula in 2007 assembly polls in which it won a majority.With about 18-months left for UP polls, BSP‚Äôs Brahmin face, Satish Chandra Mishra has started holding meetings of Brahmins district committees to mobilise them in favour of BSP.In the last two months, Mishra, also party‚Äôs national general secretary, has chaired meetings of 73 such committees in which an impressive number of Brahmins participated.‚ÄúExcept for a few districts of west UP, the Brahmin committee meetings of east UP, central UP and Bundelkhand regions have been concluded. The party is getting an immense response, similar to what we got in 2007 assembly elections,‚Äù said Mishra.He added that the meetings were a success despite the restrictions in place due to Covid-19 guidelines. ‚ÄúDue to Covid-19, the meetings have been organized according to the government guidelines. Batches of hundred influential Brahmin community members participated in each meeting to ensure social distancing and were told to hold meetings of the community in their areas,‚Äù Mishra said.‚ÄúI will hold meetings of the Brahmin community in all 403 assembly segments after October 15 when the central government is expected to announce fresh guidelines for political and social meetings and after which I will plan the next round of the meetings across UP,‚Äù he said, giving a glimpse of his planned outreach to the influential community.

He joined the company his father started in 1966, after graduating from the University of Westminster in 2001.SII has been in the spotlight for the past few months as it is to manufacture the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University‚Äôs Jenner Institute and AstraZeneca in India. It began trials in the country in August-end and in last week of September, the third phase of human clinical trial began at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital in Pune.On September 26, Poonawalla tweeted whether the Indian government would have Rs 80,000 crore available over the next one year because that is the amount which is required to buy and distribute vaccine everyone in the country. A day later, he applauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs vision. ‚ÄúWe share and applaud your vision @narendramodi ji, on providing vaccines to the global community. It is a proud moment for India, thank you for your leadership and support. It is clear that all your arrangements for India will take care of all needs for the Indian people,‚Äù he said.After overcoming a hurdle on September 10, when the trials had to be paused in India a day after the United Kingdom-based developers announced a global halt of the human experiments because a patient developed a potentially serious condition, SII has got back to planning around manufacturing and distributing the vaccine once it is ready. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave approval to the institute a week later to resume the trials.‚ÄúThe permission has been given to restart the trials with certain conditions,‚Äù said a senior official aware of the developments in the DCGI office. ‚ÄúExtra care during screening, additional information [for] informed consent and close monitoring for similar events during the study follow-up would need to be followed,‚Äù DGCI said.

Screwvala had tweeted about a special quota of Covid-19 vaccine for Parsis. ‚ÄúMore than enough‚Äù doses of the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca will be kept for the Parsi community, Poonawalla replied.He, however, did not specify the quantity of the doses that will be kept for the community which is grappling with shrinking population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-look-at-serum-institute-and-its-ceo-adar-poonawalla-s-2020-journey-as-world-awaits-covid-19-vaccine/story-A7L1IJZCkivgQ2fTJnpR5H.html

Three accused have been arrested so far.While speaking to news agency ANI, Chhattisgarh BJP President Vishnu Dev Sai condemned the incident and said that the Congress-led government has no right to protest against the Hathras case when rsimilar incidents are taking place in Congress-ruled Chattisgarh.‚ÄúThere are constant attacks happening on tribals in the state, the Chhattisgarh government‚Äôs police are not ready to register FIRs.

He had also served in important capacity in the SPG (Special Protection Group).‚Äù Kumar was found hanging at his home in Shimla on Wednesday.

Times are very difficult,‚Äù it said.‚ÄúWe recovered a suicide note in which he (Kumar) had written he is embarking on a new journey. His family members were present when he went inside the room, locked it and committed suicide by hanging himself with a nylon rope.‚ÄúThe family does not suspect any foul play. We have seized the items in the room, Himachal Pradesh DGP Sanjay Kundu had said.

Swamy alleged that fake evidence had been planted in his computer before he was arrested by the NIA. Swamy had been questioned as a suspect in the case by the investigating agencies, including by the Pune police in 2018 and also by the NIA on several occasions since 2018.He is likely to be produced before the special NIA court on Friday, where the agency may seek his custody. Swamy is known for fighting for tribals rights in the state of Jharkhand and was part of the Jharkhand Organisation against Uranium Radiation (JOAR), a campaign run against Uranium Corporation India Limited in 1996.

Gretchen Whitmer argued in a speech Thursday that President Donald Trump‚Äôs words had been a ‚Äúrallying cry‚Äù for extremists.Whitmer, a Democrat, said the Republican president has spent the last seven months of the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äúdenying science, ignoring his own health experts, stoking distrust, fomenting anger and giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division.‚ÄùShe singled out Trump‚Äôs debate comments, when he didn‚Äôt condemn white supremacist groups and told one far-right extremist group to ‚Äústand back and stand by.‚Äù‚ÄúHate groups heard the president‚Äôs words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry,‚Äù Whitmer said. ‚ÄúWhen our leaders speak, their words matter. They carry weight. When our leaders meet, encourage or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions and they are complicit. When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs no indication in the criminal complaint that the men arrested were inspired by Trump. Authorities also have not publicly said whether the men were angry about Whitmer‚Äôs coronavirus orders, which sharply curtailed businesses and individuals in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.Democrat Joe Biden sought to tie Trump to the plot as well, pointing to the president‚Äôs tweet earlier this year to ‚ÄúLIBERATE MICHIGAN!‚Äù Whitmer‚Äôs coronavirus response has faced criticism from conservatives, and the GOP-led Michigan Legislature sued her in May to try to invalidate her stay-at-home order and other measures.The arrests and Whitmer‚Äôs comments come less than a month before the presidential election in a key battleground state, where recent polls show Biden has a lead.Six men were charged in federal court with conspiring to kidnap the governor in reaction to what they viewed as her ‚Äúuncontrolled power,‚Äù according to a federal complaint. Separately, seven others were charged in state court under Michigan‚Äôs anti-terrorism laws for allegedly targeting police and seeking a ‚Äúcivil war.‚ÄùTrump criticized Whitmer‚Äôs remarks, saying she has done a ‚Äúterrible job‚Äù and should open the state. Her stay-at-home order was lifted months ago, but mask requirements and gathering restrictions remain.The president tweeted that ‚Äúmy‚Äù Justice Department and federal law enforcement had thwarted a dangerous plot against her.‚ÄúRather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist,‚Äù he tweeted before accusing Biden and Democrats of not condemning ‚Äúlooters and mobs that burn down‚Äù Democratic-run cities.‚ÄúI do not tolerate ANY extreme violence,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúDefending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President!‚ÄùWhitmer also called for kindness and empathy during the pandemic and issued a warning to those who threaten violence.‚ÄúHatred, bigotry and violence have no place in the great state of Michigan,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you break the law or conspire to commit heinous acts of violence against anyone, we will find you, we will hold you accountable and we will bring you to justice.‚Äù___This story has been corrected to reflect that Trump said ‚Äústand back and stand by,‚Äù not ‚Äústand up and stand by.‚Äù___Associated Press writer David Eggert in Lansing, Mich. contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-s-words-inspire-extremists-says-michigan-governor-gretchen-whitmer/story-mu1sRpHoKmYXIrJirN80qJ.html

Instead of using hydrogen gas, which can be inconvenient and expensive, industries use hydrogen donor chemicals that release hydrogen for the reaction. Also Read: Shut down thermal power plants around Delhi, demands AAPHowever, a catalyst is needed for the completion of the reaction. A catalyst is a compound that increases the rate of a reaction without getting consumed in the process. For hydrogenation, industries currently use precious metals such as rhodium, iridium, platinum and ruthenium that are expensive and lead to environmental pollution. The recovery of these metal catalysts is also difficult. The team from the School of Basic Sciences at IIT Mandi, in collaboration with researchers from IIT Ropar, have developed a carbon-based graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheet that can be used instead of a metal catalyst. ‚ÄúWe synthesised a catalyst by the chemical oxidation of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheets, which results in the generation of water-loving (hydrophilic) carboxyl, hydroxyl and ketonic groups over the GCN surface,‚Äù said Dr Venkata Krishnan, associate professor at School of Basic Sciences, in a release. These hydrophilic groups are the active reaction sites for the hydrogenation process. Nanosheets are tiny sheets of the material, 100,000 times thinner than a single human hair, but present a large surface area for the reaction to occur. The team tried various hydrogenation reactions using the carbon-based catalyst and found it produced high yields for these reactions, proving it to be versatile. In addition, these nanosheets can be recovered and reused for several runs without any loss in catalytic activity. ‚ÄúWe cannot overestimate the practical importance of catalysis. Almost all the synthetic products we use now relies on industrial preparations, which in turn make use of catalysts,‚Äù said Krishnan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-mandi-researchers-develop-cost-effective-environment-friendly-catalyst/story-OLFGhzOUUpTUxOpf9VWGnO.html

The association on Thursday pointedly asked whether the proponents of this claim and his ministry were prepared to subject themselves as volunteers to an independent prospective double-blind control study in prevention and treatment of Covid-19.On Tuesday, the health and science minister had released the National Clinical Management Protocol for prevention and treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 cases based on alternative therapies.Also Read: Delhi may witness surge of 15k Covid-19 cases per day in winters: CentreThe largest body of private practitioners in the field of allopathy also asked the minister if there was satisfactory evidence regarding the claims made based on studies done on Covid-19 patients; and if so, whether the evidence was weak or moderate or strong. The evidence should be in public domain and available for scientific scrutiny, they said.‚ÄúHow many of his ministerial colleagues have so far made the informed choice of getting treated under these protocols? What is stopping him from handing over Covid-19 care and control to the Ayush ministry?‚Äù were the other questions IMA asked the minister.IMA said that science demanded reproducibility of a claim elsewhere in non-conflict situations, and double blind control studies.‚Äú‚Ä¶He admits that these are based on empirical evidence which means that the evidence is anecdotal and based on individual subjective experiences. He himself refers to Ayush as historical forms of treatment rather than current ones, by saying Ayurveda has contributed to foundation of modern medicine. IMA demands that the Union health minister come clean... If not, he is inflicting fraud on the nation and gullible patients by calling placebos drugs,‚Äù the members said in a statement.Also Read: Horse plasma can be used to treat Covid-19 patients, says ICMR studyIMA currently has 1,746 branches functional in different states across the country.‚ÄúWe have written an open letter to the health minister, and he has to answer to the people of India. He is the health minister, not the Ayush minister. What is the credibility of the document he has given? They have used words like ‚Äòinformed choice‚Äô and ‚Äòempirical evidence‚Äô but these are quite vague. There is a risk of mixing systems during treatment‚Äîwho will be answerable? We are in the middle of a pandemic, and trying to save lives. This is a serious issue,‚Äù said Dr RV Asokan, honorary secretary general, IMA.The officials in the health ministry said that the protocol was meant for treatment in Ayush hospitals.‚ÄúThis is a reference point for doctors in Ayush hospitals and Ayush practitioners treating Covid-19 patients,‚Äù said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-questions-union-health-minister-releasing-ayush-based-covid-19-management-protocol/story-YhMHKOU32tG2CXfq3pvbuL.html

Thereafter, this needs to be done on a regular basis, as per the guidelines.Also read: MHA relaxes Covid curbs in poll statesEven though most swimming pools are to remain shut, administration of water themed amusement parks and water rides will have to ensure adequate and regular water filtration and chlorination as per laid down standards.The ministry guidelines advise the use of CCTV in large numbers to monitor crowding at any rides or food court etc. as entry of visitors inside the park will have to be limited to ensure proper physical distancing.Only asymptomatic persons (managerial staff, employees, visitors) will be allowed in the premises; and management staff, employees and visitors living in containment zones shall not be allowed entry in amusement park and other similar places. Employees who are at higher risk, such as, older employees, pregnant employees and employees who have underlying medical conditions must take extra precautions. They should preferably not be exposed to any front-line work requiring direct contact with the public, according to the guidelines. Persons above 65 years of age, those with comorbidities, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years are advised to stay at home. Also, amusement parks and similar places in containment zones have been prohibited to operate.

09-10-2020||India||Train tickets to be available 5 minutes before departure from tomorrow. All you need to know||From October 10 onwards, railway seats will be available even five minutes before the train leaves the station, as the Indian Railways has decided to restore the pre-covid system of preparing the second reservation chart half an hour before the departure time. Regular passenger train services remain suspended in wake of the pandemic. But the Indian Railways in a staggered manner is restoring the pre-Covid practices and is also running special trains.Here is all you need to know about the new changes:1. The second reservation charts will be prepared 30 minutes before the schedule departure of trains from stations. This was normal before Covid. But when the Indian Railways started special passenger trains amid the pandemic, the second reservation chart was being prepared two hours before the schedule departure.2. Train tickets can be booked until second reservation chart is prepared. As from tomorrow, these charts will be prepared between 30 minutes to 5 minutes before the scheduled departure, tickets can be booked during this time. 3. The first chart is prepared at least four hours before the scheduled departure of the train. If seats become vacant owing to cancellation, they can be booked through PRS counters and online till the preparation of the second chart.4. Tickets can also be cancelled during this time, as per the provisions of the refund rules.5. The timings were changed during the pandemic as initially tickets were only available online. The Railways was avoiding crowding at the stations and the aim was to discourage people from travelling unless absolutely necessary.6. In the last few months, the situation has changed. The Centre has been focussing more on reopening instead of locking down. The Railways has started several new trains as well. With the festive season coming, the Railways has already announced 39 pairs of new special trains. It has not yet announced a date for these special trains but they will be operational between October 15 and November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-tickets-to-be-available-5-minutes-before-departure-from-tomorrow-all-you-need-to-know/story-CaEaQHnUaan1FG4pcn5yTP.html

It has been learnt that Sinha travelled for six hours and walked for about 4 km to reach village Tarkassi in the far flung area of Rajouri in the Jammu division to meet the families on Thursday.He expressed grief and sorrow over the incident and assured them of justice. He said that the government will take care of all the three families and all assistance would be provided to them, said the official. Sinha also conveyed sympathies to the families on behalf of the PM. Close on the heels of the army‚Äôs findings of irregularities in the Amshipora operation, the family of the three young Gujjar men have demanded severe punishment to the guilty under the law. All the three men hailed from Tarkassi village of Rajouri district and were related.The family has also demanded that the alleged informant, who told the army officials that the three were terrorists, in the hope of receiving ‚Äúrewards and awards‚Äù, should also be exposed. The three men- Imtiyaz Ahmad, Abrar Ahmad and Ibrar Mohammad- were missing since July 17 and the army confirmed that they were killed by the security forces in Shopian on that day. An army inquiry has found that the security forces involved in the Amshipora operation had breached the rules. Lal Hussain, uncle of the three youths, said ‚ÄúWe have lost three young men. They were my nephews, who had gone to Shopian to earn money for the families back home. I demand that those involved in the fake encounter and the contact, who branded my nephews as terrorists and passed on the information to the security forces, must be punished under the law of the land.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe pictures of the alleged terrorists killed in the encounter that went viral on social media sites were of my nephew Imtiyaz Ahmad and two other relatives Abrar Ahmad and Ibrar Mohammad Khan,‚Äù he added. The three young men aged 21, 26 and 18 years had left Rajouri and reached Shopian via Mughal Road on July 2 and July 17 to work as labourers. Thereafter, they remained missing. On July 18, the army claimed it had killed three unidentified terrorists in Amshipora of Shopian. Also Read: Three terrorists gunned down in encounter in J-K‚Äôs ShopianOn August 14, a police team from Shopian collected DNA samples of three families in Rajouri to match them with those of the three young men. Lal Hussain had been all along claiming that his nephews were innocent Gujjar boys, who had gone to Shopian to work as labourers and that they had nothing to do with terrorism. The Army had said that ‚ÄúThe inquiry has brought out certain prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court have been contravened. Consequently, the competent disciplinary authority has directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable‚Äù.

09-10-2020||India||Allahabad HC rejects plea in Hathras case||The Allahabad high court dismissed on Thursday a petition that alleged the government illegally confined the 19-year-old Dalit gang rape victim‚Äôs family to their house, with the judges observing that the matter was being heard by the Supreme Court.This came on a day the victim‚Äôs brother rejected allegations by the prime accused in the case ‚Äì Sandeep Singh -- that the Dalit‚Äôs woman family killed her because they disapproved of her relationship with Singh.‚ÄúThey are trying to pressure a Dalit family and leveling allegations against a family which has lost its daughter. These are afterthoughts aimed at twisting the case and will not sustain,‚Äù the victim‚Äôs brother said. ‚ÄúHow can one think of killing his own sister? These are tactics being adopted to mislead the probe agencies,‚Äù he added. In high court, a two-judge bench of Justice Pritinker Diwaker and Justice Prakash Padia dismissed the petition filed by an organisation working for the Valmiki community, to which the victim‚Äôs family belonged.‚ÄúIn the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, judicial propriety demands that it will not be proper for this court to entertain the present petition on merits, especially when security has been provided to petitioners 1 to 6 and other family members of the deceased victim-girl on the observation made by the Hon‚Äôble apex court and also on the basis of the directions issued by the Lucknow bench of this court,‚Äù the judges observed.On September 14, the victim was raped by four members of Thakur caste in Hathras district when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder. She was partially paralysed in the attack.As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi‚Äôs Safdarjung hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29. At 2.30am the next day, the police forcibly cremated the body without the family‚Äôs consent in a field near the village. Since then, Opposition leaders have made a beeline to the village even as the government has denied she was raped, citing the forensic report. Five police officials have been suspended even as the government has ordered a probe into an alleged ‚Äúinternational conspiracy‚Äù to defame the administration. The four accused have also garnered significant support in the locality ‚Äì especially after a mega meeting or mahapanchayat was organised by Brahmin and Thakur communities.On Friday, Singh wrote a letter to the superintendent of police (SP), Hathras, and claimed he was innocent. He said he was friends with the woman, and blamed her mother and brother for beating her to death because they never accepted his friendship with her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-hc-rejects-plea-in-hathras-case/story-obBHzuY7BINo7zzBnMoouJ.html

In his address on the 88th IAF Day celebrations at the Hindon airbase, during which Balakot heroes were presented gallantry awards, the IAF chief said, ‚ÄúI would like to commend all warriors for the quick response, in the recent stand-off on our northern frontiers, when we deployed our combat assets at short notice to handle any eventuality, and provided proactive support to all the requirements of deployment and sustenance for the Indian Army.‚Äù Three days ago, the IAF chief said at his annual press conference that China couldn‚Äôt get the better of India in any conflict and the air force was ready to handle any contingency, with its capability and intent serving as a deterrent for the adversary. The IAF celebrated its 88th anniversary with a ceremonial parade and fly-past involving 59 aircraft including the Rafale jets. It was the second public appearance of the Rafales after the planes were formally inducted at the Ambala airbase on September 10. The fly-past this year was marked by elaborate air displays by front-line fighter jets, transport aircraft and helicopters that flew in synergy in line with the theme of ‚ÄòInnovate, Integrate and Intimidate.‚Äô Bhadauria presented gallantry awards to several IAF personnel including fighter pilots who were associated with the air force‚Äôs 2019 airstrikes against terror camps in Pakistan‚Äôs Balakot. These awards were announced on the eve of Independence Day last year but given away on Thursday. Several Yudh Seva Medals and Vayu Sena Medals for gallantry were announced last year for officers who were a part of the Balakot operation on February 26, 2019 and dogfight with the Pakistan air force the next day. Those awarded the YSM by the IAF chief on Thursday included Air Vice Marshal Sunil Kashinath Vidhate, Group Captains Yeshpal Singh Negi, Hemant Kumar, Hansel Joseph Sequeira and Squadron Leader Minty Aggarwal. Aggarwal, a woman fighter controller, played a key role in intercepting the Pakistan air force‚Äôs attempt to launch retaliatory air attacks after the IAF‚Äôs Balakot airstrikes, which were in retaliation for the February 14, 2019 Pulwama suicide car bomb attack that killed 40 troopers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Those who were given Vayu Sena Medals for gallantry included Group Captain Pranav Raj, Wing Commander Amit Ranjan and Squadron Leaders Pankaj Bhujade, Shashank Singh and BKN Reddy. ‚ÄúWith Atmanirbharta {self-reliance} as the bedrock, IAF has been rapidly shifting to indigenous equipment.

09-10-2020||India||Ram Vilas Paswan: Socialist icon, consummate politician||In 1969, a tall and lanky Dalit political activist, in his early 20s, entered the Bihar legislative assembly as a legislator of the Samyukta Socialist Party.It was a time of political ferment. The hegemony of the Congress had been eroded, for the first time, in state elections in 1967, and alternative ruling coalitions ‚Äî usually led by socialists ‚Äî had taken over many state capitals in north India. But this political ferment itself was a result of social churn. The first cracks in upper caste dominance were visible. Backward communities were making their presence felt in democratic politics. Social justice for the marginalised was becoming a central political plank. It was in this milieu that the young Dalit man from north Bihar threw in his lot with socialists. On Thursday, 51 years after his entry into public life as an elected representative, the young activist, who went on to become one of India‚Äôs most senior politicians and, arguably, the most senior Dalit leader in the country, passed on.In life and death, Ram Vilas Paswan represented the possibilities and limitations of the politics of social justice in India. He symbolised the pathway that democratic electoral politics offered to marginalised communities to demand their space and challenge the hierarchies present in the social order. But he also symbolised the pragmatism ‚Äî and what critics would call the opportunism ‚Äî that often marks high politics in India. It was in how Paswan navigated the twin streams of the politics of justice and the politics of power, while remaining eternally relevant, that made him a true survivor of Indian politics.To understand what Ram Vilas Paswan meant for Dalit politics ‚Äî much before Mayawati became its face and far surpassed Paswan‚Äôs political stature in the community ‚Äî it is important to understand the social context in which he came from.¬†In Bihar‚Äôs deeply stratified society, he entered the political realm not as a beneficiary of patronage or largesse but by unapologetically asserting his identity. As he said in an interview to HT two years ago, while his father‚Äôs generation would get slapped and abused and could do nothing about it, his generation would resist ‚Äî this resistance did not bring outright change, but it created an opening.Resistance for Paswan was simple ‚Äî a space in the mainstream political structure. Power, he believed, was key to justice. And it helped that he had an instinctive smell for power, earning him the label of ‚Äúmausam vaigyanik‚Äù, or weather scientist, in recent decades for his ability to read the political winds and shift strategies accordingly.To achieve this, Paswan was committed to the constitutional and electoral route. After opposing the Emergency, in 1977, he entered the Lok Sabha for the first time ‚Äî with a record margin from Hajipur. He was to return to the Lower House seven more times, and shifted just recently to the upper house. And in this period, he would ally with every political stream in India. He was a minister in the VP Singh government, and emerged as a key champion of the implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendations. He was a minister in United Front governments in the mid-1990s, arguing for the need for a Third Front, only to be disdainful of it in later years. He was a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government on the grounds that India needed stability before he resigned, in 2002, citing the Gujarat riots. He was a minister in the Manmohan Singh government till 2009, on the grounds of wanting to defeat communal forces. And he was a minister for the past six years in the Narendra Modi government, on the plank of ‚Äúsabka saath, sabka vikas‚Äù, in what can be termed as a supremely ironical twist given why he had resigned from the Vajpayee government. But he was able to pull off all these shifts, almost seamlessly and without controversy, because he was clear-headed about what he wanted. He was ambitious and wanted to expand his power and resource base; this was possible through political authority; and this also helped his political constituency get benefits. Paswan was careful to keep this constituency intact ‚Äî be it the broader Hajipur belt in north Bihar geographically or Paswans socially. And so he focused on getting projects to his region, or employment for members of his community, or opposing atrocities when it became an emotive issue for Dalits. This base was not enough to win him Bihar‚Äôs chief ministership or become a pan-India Dalit leader. But it was enough to make him a key swing force in Bihar, with a loyal vote base, useful for other larger parties, which in turn allowed him to then bargain for a slice of power. In his final years, Paswan had only ambition ‚Äî to establish his son, Chirag, as not just his political successor but as a leader meant to achieve even greater things than he did. He relentlessly promoted his son, be it through political introductions across the spectrum (he had friends in every party), encouraging media coverage (he was an accessible minister, giving interviews as well as off the record insights), and most recently, handing over the responsibility of the Bihar election. But he also understood that Dalit politics itself was changing. In the same interview quoted above, where he spoke about the difference between his father‚Äôs generation and his,Paswan said: ‚ÄúThe Chirag Paswan generation is not ready to accept it (slaps and abuses). People ask, why is there a protest on smaller issues? It‚Äôs because young Dalits want a life of respect.‚Äù At a time when the Hathras protests have shaken the BJP, his word of advice to his bigger ally on how to handle Dalit protests may seem apt too: ‚ÄúWork without antagonising anyone. There is lava inside ‚Äî when it comes out slowly, the volcano doesn‚Äôt erupt; but if you suppress it, then it becomes an active volcano.‚Äù It was because of this recognition that Paswan persuaded the Modi government in its first term to push back against the Supreme Court verdict which was seen as diluting the atrocities act or asking it to publicise the benefits Dalits received with welfare schemes. Paswan died just as his party, the Lok Janashakti Party, has decided to contest the Bihar elections separately ‚Äî in opposition to Nitish Kumar, who is the face of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the state, while remaining a part of the same alliance at the centre. While his death is sure to have an impact on Bihar elections, what many would see as the dualism of the LJP at the moment ‚Äî of enjoying power while being the Opposition ‚Äî is perhaps symbolic of the dualism of Paswan himself, of espousing the politics of justice while being enmeshed in the politics of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-vilas-paswan-socialist-icon-consummate-politician/story-gpocgpVLzqUImxT2o0cwfN.html
09-10-2020||India||IMA asks health minister to give proof on AYUSH, yoga-based treatment of Covid||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Thursday asked the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan to produce substantiating evidence on the protocol of prevention of Covid-19 infection based on AYUSH and yoga.IMA posed several questions to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan for issuing protocol of Covid-19 prevention and treatment of asymptomatic as well as mild cases based on AYUSH and yoga.On October 6, the Central government announced the National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for Management of Covid-19. Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan released the protocol in the virtual presence of AYUSH Minister Shripad Yesso Naik.‚ÄúIs there satisfactory evidence regarding the claims made from studies done on Covid-19 patients based on the above criteria? If so, whether the evidence is weak or moderate or strong? The evidence should be in the public domain and available for scientific scrutiny,‚Äù it said in a statement.The IMA asked, ‚Äúwhether the severe form of Covid-19 a hyperimmune status or an immune deficiency status?‚Äù‚ÄúWhether the proponents of this claim and his Ministry are prepared to subject themselves as volunteers to an independent prospective double-blind control study in the prevention and treatment of Covid? How many of his ministerial colleagues have so far made the informed choice of getting treated under these protocols?‚Äù the IMA asked.‚ÄúWhat is stopping him from handing over Covid care and control to AYUSH ministry?IMA has demanded that the Union health minister should come clean on the above posers. ‚ÄúIf not, he is inflicting a fraud on the nation and gullible patients by calling placebos as drugs,‚Äù it added.Questioning the scientific basis of these protocols, the IMA has asked the health minister ‚Äúto give reproducibility of a claim elsewhere in non-conflict situations and double-blind control studies‚Äù.The National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for Management of Covid-19 guidelines has recommended doing gargles with warm water added with a pinch of turmeric and salt. Water boiled with triphala also can be used for gargling. They also recommend nasal installation/application of medicated oil (anu taila or shadbindu taila) or plain oil (sesame or coconut) or nasal application of cow‚Äôs ghee (goghrita) once or twice in a day, especially before going out and after coming back to home.The protocol also recommends steam inhalation with ajwain or pudina or eucalyptus oil once a day and adequate sleep of 6 to 8 hours.The guidelines point out specific measures and symptom management for prophylactic care in the high-risk populations, primary contacts, for asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 patients.The AYUSH Ministry is also studying four studies covering a huge sample size for prophylactic care. It has also undertaken about seven studies on `Guduchi‚Äô as prophylactic care on about 1.33 lakh population.AYUSH ministry is also studying the combination in about 200 participants through two studies in moderate Covid 19 with very positive trends. It has also undertaken six clinical studies across India which are showing very positive trends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-asks-health-minister-to-produce-proof-on-ayush-yoga-based-treatment-of-covid/story-MJbHmt3vyKb9YSldTzO6KM.html
09-10-2020||India||MHA relaxes Covid curbs in poll states||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday partially modified its latest Covid-19 guidelines to allow political rallies with immediate effect in 12 states where elections are scheduled to be held. According to the original guidelines issued on September 30, political, social, religious and other gatherings were to be allowed, in open spaces, from October 15, with no ceiling on the number of attendees. In closed spaces, the upper bound on the audience for such gatherings was raised to 200 from 100. Both of these changes will now be applicable with immediate effect in the poll-bound states. The changes will mean political parties can hold election rallies and meetings, usually conducted outdoors, ahead of the Bihar assembly elections and by-polls in 11 other states -- Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Nagaland and Odisha. The home ministry has asked all political parties to ensure that people follow all other safeguards listed in it September 30 guidelines, such as ensuring the wearing of masks, social distancing and checking the temperatures of the attendees. Bihar will vote in three phases , on October 28, November 3, and November 7. The results of the election will be declared on November 10. The voting for 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh will be held on November 3 and the results will be announced on November 10. In his order sent to the 12 poll-bound states, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said that ‚Äúit is decided that the state governments concerned may permit political gatherings outside containment zones beyond the existing limit of 100 persons on any date before October 15, 2020 in those assembly / parliamentary constituencies only where elections are to be held subject to the following conditions‚Äù. As per the conditions, for holding political gatherings in closed spaces, a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity will be allowed with a ceiling of 200 persons and the wearing of face masks, social distancing, provision for thermal scanning, and use of hand wash or sanitizers will be mandatory. In open spaces, the political gatherings will have to keep in mind the size of the ground or space with strict observance of social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and use of hand wash or sanitizers. ‚ÄúState or Union Territory governments will issue detailed SOPs (standard operating procedures) to regulate such political gatherings and strict enforce the same,‚Äù the home secretary‚Äôs order said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-relaxes-covid-curbs-in-poll-states/story-GSzuf07pfV0zXNHegw0QPN.html

Though extradition proceedings against the liquor baron concluded in May after the UK high court rejected Mallya‚Äôs plea to approach Britain‚Äôs Supreme Court against the move to send him back to India, the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù proceedings have delayed his departure. ‚ÄúWe have been informed that there is a secret legal matter that is yet to be resolved, and that without its resolution, he cannot be extradited,‚Äù external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. ‚ÄúWe are not a party to this matter and we continue to be in touch with the UK government,‚Äù he said, without giving details. On Monday, the union government told the Supreme Court that Mallya‚Äôs extradition had been stalled by the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù proceedings in the UK. ‚ÄúHe has exhausted all avenues for appeal and after that, we are in constant touch with the UK government so that he is extradited to India as soon as possible,‚Äù Srivastava said. Mallya flew to the UK in March 2016 as a consortium of Indian banks, which claims he owes ‚Çπ9,000 crore, closed in on him to recover the money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-cannot-be-extradited-till-secret-legal-matter-in-uk-gets-resolved-says-mea/story-Az73YnxMpyJ3gDsfYkt4NN.html
09-10-2020||India||Govt may allow 75% flight ops, says Hardeep Puri||As demand for air travel increases steadily, the government is considering allowing airlines to operate at up to 75% of their pre-pandemic capacity, raising it from the current 60%, but the removal of restrictions on international flights depends on a raft of factors including the discovery of a Covid-19 vaccine, civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said on Thursday.A decision on raising flight capacity will be made over the next seven to 10 days, Puri said at a press conference, as the festive season that‚Äôs usually the peak period for air travel approaches.The civil aviation ministry has allowed limited domestic flight operations up to 60% of pre-Covid-19 capacity. After domestic passenger flights resumed on May 25 following a two-month gap because of the lockdown to curb the contagion, the Centre allowed Indian airlines to operate only 33% of their pre-Covid domestic flights. On June 26, the ministry increased the capacity to 45% and to 60% on September 2.Pre-pandemic, Indian airlines used to operate around 3,100 flights a day, according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) data. Airlines are currently operating around 1,500 flights per day, according to data until October 8. ‚ÄúOur internal thinking is that we will watch it for another week or 10 days....If the figures (of passengers travelling) continue to be healthy, we would open domestic civil aviation to 75% of pre-Covid levels. There is no deadline,‚Äù Puri said. ‚ÄúBut this can happen soon as the domestic numbers are going up...I am confident that by the first quarter next year, we will be able to surpass the pre-Covid numbers.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith regard to the number of daily domestic air passengers, the figure on October 2 was 176,000 passengers...by the end of this month, we‚Äôll be at 200,000. Between Diwali and the year‚Äôs end, we will reach 300,000,‚Äù Puri said.According to the ministry, around 300,000 to 350,000 passenger travelled on domestic routes before the pandemic. Puri said a complete resumption of international flights depends on the availability of a vaccine for Covid-19, and hinted that so-called travel bubble arrangements may continue until March-April.‚ÄúIt is difficult to say (when regular international flights will resume) as there is no country which has completely opened its borders for all. It depends on the availability of a vaccine as countries will feel more confident once a vaccine is there,‚Äù the aviation minister said.‚ÄúThere are basically three issues to consider before resuming regular international flights. One, resuming domestic connectivity... Second, the nature of the virus on which I can‚Äôt comment, and the third is international restrictions,‚Äù Puri said.Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended since March 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-allow-75-flight-ops-says-hardeep-puri/story-An5Db00e47mQST6Nm22JWO.html
09-10-2020||India||Horse plasma can be used to treat Covid-19 patients, says ICMR study||Antibody-rich plasma obtained from horses can be used to treat patients infected with Covid-19, according to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) pre-print study, following which the apex medical research body has received regulatory approval to conduct clinical trials using the equine plasma on humans. The study was published on Research Square.In the study, 10 healthy horses between the ages of four and 10 years were injected with inactivated Sars-CoV-2 antigen subcutaneously (under the skin) at the Hyderabad-based Biologicals E Ltd, and after 21 days of immunisation, their plasma samples were tested. Sars-Cov-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19. The plasma had Covid-19-specific high-quality antibodies with virus neutralising capacity, which is ideal for preventing infection. The results are in line with other studies on equine antisera that reported the generation of a high level of antibodies in horses against the receptor binding area of the virus‚Äôs spike protein. A receptor-binding domain is a key part of a virus located on its spike domain that allows it to dock to body receptors to gain entry into cells and lead to infection. It is safe, and can be prepared in bulk at a low cost, the ICMR study shows. ‚ÄúWith Biologicals E we have developed horse sera which may be considered. We have completed some animal studies where we have a predictive dose‚Ä¶ we have got clearance for a clinical trial,‚Äù said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR. The virus strain was isolated from the throat and nasal swab specimens of a Covid-19 positive patient at the maximum containment facility of ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune. Diseases for which equine sera has previously been tried include many viral and bacterial infections such as rabies, hepatitis B, vaccinia virus, tetanus, botulism and diphtheria. ‚Äú‚Ä¶This study suggests promising efficacy and therapeutic potential of equine hyper immune sera against Sars-CoV-2. The quality control assessments of the different batches proved to have consistent nAb (antibody) titres (volume of antibodies produced)‚Ä¶ that can demonstrate consistent and high neutralization activity,‚Äù says the paper. ‚ÄúFurther, in-vivo testing for efficacy of this indigenously developed, cost effective product will pave the way to clinical evaluation. Additionally, being a donor independent method, this may prove as an efficient alternative to convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19 patients,‚Äù the researchers say. Virologists agree that animal antisera are a good option. ‚ÄúIt does have advantages over convalescent plasma as the quality of convalescent plasma is entirely donor dependent. The quality will be different from one donor to the other. Use of antibodies that have been raised in large animals is common, and has worked successfully in the past. If an animal study has shown promise against Sars-Cov-2, then it is good news,‚Äù said T Jacob John, former head of the virology department at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Animal-derived plasma can help overcome the challenge of limited availability of convalescent plasma from recovered patients, and find a cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies (man-made proteins that act like human antibodies in the immune system) that are laborious and expensive to generate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/horse-plasma-can-be-used-to-treat-covid-19-patients-says-icmr-study/story-wTDhCQSUjBWqx4orMhr6DO.html

Police said all four suspects sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to a hospital for treatment.The men were identified as Sunil Gahlot, 23, Amit Raj, 26, Rohit, 23, and Ravinder Yadav, 31. Six pistols, three bulletproof jackets and three bulletproof helmets were recovered from them, police said.In the past 10 days, this is the third such encounter wherein the police and suspects have exchanged fire but ended with the arrests of the suspects. Four days ago, the special cell had arrested two alleged gangsters after a shoot-out. Both men were shot in their legs. On October 28, police had arrested another alleged criminal in Delhi after an exchange of fire.Giving details of Thursday‚Äôs arrests, deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said they had received information that members of the infamous Lawerance Bishnoi-Kala Jatheri -Sube Gujjar gang -- whose members are wanted in several cases of murder, attempts to murder, extortion and robbery in Delhi-NCR -- would be arriving in Rohini from Haryana early Thursday, allegedly to eliminate their rivals. ‚ÄúActing on this information, a trap was laid in Khera village in Rohini on Thursday morning. Around 3.30am, a white car was spotted coming from Khera village. When our team signalled the driver to stop, the occupants of the car tried to speed away. As the road was blocked with a police SUV, their car hit the divider. They were asked to surrender but they instead opened fire at the police team,‚Äù Yadav said.Three bullets hits the police‚Äôs Innova that had been used to block the road. ‚ÄúOne bullet grazed inspector Man Singh‚Äôs arm. Another hit sub-inspector Ravi Rana, but he was wearing a bulletproof jacket, which saved him. The police team returned the fire and two bullets hit Sunil in his leg, while one hit his hand. Amit was shot in his legs and so was Rohit, who carried a cash reward of ‚Çπ50,000 on his arrest. Ravinder was also injured in his leg,‚Äù Yadav said.A total of 22 rounds were fired by the suspects, while the police fired 28 rounds in retaliation. ‚ÄúThe local area police were informed and ambulances called in to shift the injured to BSA hospital, Rohini. These men are wanted in more than a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, robbery, firing, etc. Four automatic pistols with 50 live cartridges and two countrymade pistols with 10 live cartridges, three each of bulletproof jackets and helmets were recovered from them.

09-10-2020||India||India weighs plan to keep ‚Äòinimical‚Äô nations out of core industries||Indian national security planners are considering a security architecture that weeds out inimical countries from participating in core economic sectors such as power, telecommunications and roads by verifying the origin and testing the reliability of imported equipment related to such sectors, officials aware of the development said.India will also forge collaborations in the development of critical technologies such as 5G and 5G-plus telecommunication standards through government-to-government or industry-to-industry partnerships rather than opt for off-the-shelf purchases of equipment in the future.The government will participate through the entire development process ‚Äúso that it has the option to go for a different partner in case of any technology denial‚Äù, said a senior government official involved in the move who spoke on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúForeign companies participating in Indian core sector will not be allowed to mask their origins and will have to go for full disclosure in case of any suspicion,‚Äù the official added.While the Narendra Modi government is tight-lipped over the matter, the ‚Äúverify the origin‚Äù debate started in July after China threw all past bilateral agreements out of the window and transgressed into eastern Ladakh, resulting in a tense military standoff that is yet to be resolved. The transgression and a June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian troops dead, besides an unspecified number of Chinese casualties, triggered calls for a boycott of Chinese products. Since then, the power ministry has decided to put in place specific testing guidelines that require the country of origin of imported equipment to be disclosed and to ensure that there is no malware embedded in critical sector equipment.‚ÄúThe new testing guidelines for power equipment are to ensure that the country of origin does not install a malware which can be activated to engineer a power crisis in India,‚Äù said a senior power ministry official, requesting anonymity.Although national security planners and technology advisers to the Modi government are on the same page, there is a push-back from the telecommunication department and industry whose representatives believe alternative equipment will cost more, and want the government to define a threshold for disclosure of the country of origin.Even in developing the 5G and 5G-plus technologies, India is keen to find out the provenance of imported technology, with test-bed collaboration being the first step in confirming that imported telecommunication equipment is clean. While India is keen to collaborate in 5G with Japan, it has kept the option of choosing European and US telcos open in case of any opaqueness in joint ventures. In the past two decades, it has come to the notice of the government that foreign companies bidding for core sector contracts would often mask their country of origin through a third country and use state subsidies to emerge as the lowest price bidder and win the contract.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-weighs-plan-to-keep-inimical-nations-out-of-core-industries/story-YNWpwbU1k4TTrsxfuK2iGI.html
09-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||October 7 saw a new record for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19): the highest number of daily cases around the world. According to worldometers.info, the world saw 343,386 new cases on Wednesday; according to the New York Times database, the number was marginally higher, 351,107. Countries may be seeing waves ‚Äì the first wave seems to be over in India, and the number of daily cases has dipped ‚Äì but the number of daily cases around the world continues to rise, powered, in many cases, by second waves that are, especially in some countries, steeper than the first. The world has seen around 36 million cases of Covid-19, and the numbers do not appear to be going down. Indeed, according to Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs Coronavirus Resource Centre, seven of the 10 countries with the highest number of daily cases currently are continuing to see a rise in their seven-day averages, an indication that case numbers are headed up in these.The 10 countries currently with the highest number of daily cases are: India, the US, Brazil, the UK, France, Argentina, Russia, Mexico, Spain, and Colombia. Among these, only India, Brazil, and Argentina are witnessing a fall in their seven-day averages (of daily cases). The rest are seeing a rise (including a sharp rise in some). Together, according to worldometer, these 10 countries accounted for 238,746 new cases of Covid-19 on October 7, or 70% of the world‚Äôs cases that day.RELENTLESS SPREADCountries may be seeing waves ‚Äì the first wave seems to be over in India, and the number of daily cases has dipped ‚Äì but the number of daily cases around the world continues to rise, powered, in many cases, by second waves that are, especially in some countries, steeper than the first. The world has seen around 36 million cases of Covid-19, and the numbers do not appear to be going down. As an aside, that level of concentration shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone: most Covid-19 cases have come from a few countries. The three countries worst affected by the pandemic, the US, India, and Brazil, account for 54% of all global cases so far (they also account for 44% of all deaths). And the top 10 countries by cases (marginally different from the top 10 countries based on current daily cases) account for 71% of all cases seen thus far. The countries in this list are: the US, India, Brazil, Russia, Colombia, Spain, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, and South Africa. To return to the list of countries that are currently seeing the most cases, the seven whose seven-day average (of daily cases) is on the rise again account for 47% of daily cases in the top-10, and a third of all daily cases in the world on October 7. This is perhaps an indication that there will be no letting up in the increase in new cases around the world, even as countries in the northern hemisphere prepare for an onslaught of cases expected in the coming winter months.THREAT REMAINSThe continuing global march of the coronavirus disease reminds us of the severity of the threat. Election season has kicked off in India. The Union home ministry has allowed, with immediate effect, open-air political rallies in 12 poll-bound states. It‚Äôs also the festive season in India. Restaurants are open and cinemas will open soon. But India continues to see an average of 75,000 cases a day.According to worldometer, the seven-day average of daily cases on October 7 was 304,879, the highest it has ever been. There have been some dips in the trajectory of this metric over the months, but none very sharp; a fall in cases in one region has usually been more than offset by a rise in another.These numbers establish a simple truth: it isn‚Äôt over yet. As cities and states and countries open up, it‚Äôs sometimes easy to forget or ignore the looming threat in the background. The continuing global march of the coronavirus disease reminds us of the severity of this threat. Election season has kicked off in India ‚Äìthe assembly elections in Bihar and bypolls in several states will be held shortly. The Union home ministry on Thursday allowed, with immediate effect, open-air political rallies in 12 poll-bound states (they were previously allowed from October 15). It‚Äôs also the festive season in India with what is arguably the country‚Äôs biggest festival, Deepavali, in mid-November. Restaurants are open. Cinemas will open soon. But India continues to see an average of 75,000 cases a day (the seven-day average on October 7 was 74,623).The Jan Andolan (public campaign) launched by the government on Thursday needs to be seen in this context.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter: ‚ÄúLet us always remember: wear a mask; wash hands; follow social distancing; practice ‚ÄúDo Gaj Ki Doori‚Äù [a distance of six feet]; together, we will succeed.‚ÄùI couldn‚Äôt agree more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-qsn4SNfrJGYdq2amOaeZLM.html
09-10-2020||India||Socialist icon, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan dies aged 74||Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, a socialist and anti-Emergency crusader who broke through Bihar‚Äôs deeply caste-stratified society to establish himself at the highest level of Indian politics in a career spanning five decades, died of heart failure in New Delhi on Thursday. He was 74.Paswan, one of India‚Äôs tallest Dalit leaders who nurtured relationships across political parties, held the portfolios of food, public distribution, and consumer affairs. He was an eight-time Lok Sabha member from Bihar‚Äôs Hajipur and, since 2019, was a member of the Rajya Sabha from Bihar.Paswan was admitted to Delhi‚Äôs Fortis Escorts Heart Institute with heart failure and kidney problems on September 11. He was subsequently put on ventilator and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but his condition deteriorated in the past 24 hours. He passed away at 6.05pm, read a statement from the hospital. ‚ÄúPapa... Now you are not in this world but I know you are always with me wherever you are. Miss you Papa,‚Äù tweeted Paswan‚Äôs son Chirag Paswan. The national flag will be flown at half mast on Friday in Delhi and capitals of all states and Union territories, and Paswan will be accorded a state funeral, the government announced.Often called a ‚Äúkingmaker‚Äù in Bihar, Paswan was known to be affable and approachable. His death capped an eventful and consummate political career that saw him become a national leader, serve as a minister under six different prime ministers and earn for himself the sobriquet of ‚Äúweathervane of Indian politics‚Äù for his ability to gauge the mood of the electorate.¬†‚ÄúSaddened beyond words. There‚Äôs a void in our nation that will perhaps never be filled. Ram Vilas Paswan‚Äôs demise is a personal loss,‚Äù tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. President Ram Nath Kovind also paid tribute. ‚ÄúIn the demise of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the nation has lost a visionary leader. He was among the most active and longest-serving members of Parliament. He was the voice of the oppressed, and championed the cause of the marginalized,‚Äù he said. Born in pre-Independence India in Khagaria district of Bihar, Paswan was selected as a state police officer but chose a life in politics, winning his first assembly election in 1969 as a member of the Samyukta Socialist Party. In 1974, he joined the Lok Dal, of which he became general secretary. When the Emergency was imposed next year, Paswan hit the streets and was arrested. In 1977, he stormed into the Lok Sabha on a Janata Party ticket from Hajipur, setting a record at that time for the highest victory margin of 424,000 votes. He would go on to win seven more Lok Sabha elections. He first became a minister in 1989 under prime minister VP Singh. In 1998, Paswan, who was then minister of railways, quit the United Front government and was back as minister in the ministry headed by Atal Bihari Vajyapee who came to power the next year. In 2002, he quit the Vajpayee Cabinet ‚Äî only to be back two years later as minister of chemicals and fertiliser when the United Progressive Alliance won the elections.Paswan‚Äôs death came at a time when his Lok Janshakti Party, now led by his son 37-year-old son Chirag, is at a crucial juncture: it ditched the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance to fight the upcoming Bihar assembly elections on its own. Since 1990, Bihar‚Äôs politics was said to revolve around the big three socialist leaders ‚Äî Lalu Prasad, Nitish Kumar and Paswan. Along the way, Paswan fell out with the others politically but continued to enjoy warm personal relations. In 2000, walked out of the Janata Party to form his own outfit, Lok Janshakti Party. ‚ÄúI am devastated by the untimely death of Ram Vilas. The unbroken ties of the past 45 years and the social and political fights we waged together is flashing before my eyes. You left too soon,‚Äù Lalu Prasad‚Äôs office tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/socialist-icon-union-minister-dies-aged-74/story-24mcF7QKs5jFtNriRXVM1N.html
09-10-2020||India||Fight against pollution: Graded Response Action Plan to kick in with Covid crisis in air||The winter phase of the mechanism to tackle air pollution comes into force in Delhi-NCR from October 15 with a ban on diesel-run electricity generators, instructions for washing of roads and increased patrolling of known hot spots, authorities announced on Thursday amid fears that this year‚Äôs pre-winter pollution could be even harder to control than usual due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), is a set of curbs triggered in phases as the air quality deteriorates, which is typical of the October-November period. Farm fires in neighbouring states and cooling weather typically combine at this time of the year to blanket the region in smoke. It includes strict measures such as a ban on the entry of heavy vehicles, the odd-even road rationing restrictions, and a halt of construction work ‚Äì each of which are likely to be impractical at a time when the pandemic has exacted heavy economic costs and public transport has been seen as an infection risk.‚ÄúThis winter, all agencies and state governments of Delhi-NCR must come together to try and not allow the need to bring in any additional emergency measures such as banning vehicles and construction. We recognise the economy is already under stress post-lockdown and therefore our combined effort must be to ensure there is no further disruption,‚Äù said Bhure Lal, the chairperson of Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), the agency set up by the Supreme Court to tackle the perennial problem. ¬†According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the air quality in Delhi was in the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù zone for the second consecutive day on Thursday ‚Äì typical for this time of the year. In the last four years, the air quality index (AQI) entered poor for the first time after the monsoons between September-end and first week of October.Thursday‚Äôs AQI was 208, slightly lower than Wednesday‚Äôs 215. But these are the worst numbers seen since mid-June, and the trend of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana suggest the levels may deteriorate further soon. According to observations from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) satellites, the number of farm fires in these two states in the last two months ‚Äì at 2,636 -- has been the highest since 2014.The situation becomes such that cities have been likened to a ‚Äúgas chamber‚Äù and experts warn that such conditions are likely to exacerbate Covid-19 infections. Lal said the agency recognises the Covid-19 risk factor link. ‚ÄúHence, efforts are required on the ground to prevent pollution levels from rising,‚Äù he said. The Epca head added that a ban on entry of trucks may be unlikely this year since most such vehicles appear to have affixed radio tags that can help identify whether they have paid the Environment Concession Charge or are indeed meant to enter Delhi, instead of merely passing through. ‚ÄúThe RFID (radio frequency identification) system is working well at 13 entry points. We plan to direct the Delhi government to deploy officials with hand-held devices at the remaining border points to check that trucks not destined for Delhi do not enter the city. Also, with both the eastern and western peripheral expressways, the truck traffic load has decreased significantly.‚Äù Stricter measures, however, have not been ruled out entirely and will depend on how bad the problem becomes, the authority decided at its Thursday meeting, according to a letter it sent to state authorities. Some measures that come into force from October 15 are meant for a more serious stage of air pollution, particularly the ban on diesel generators. Essential services such as hospitals will be exempted. Medical experts reiterated the need to curb pollution in order to mitigate Covid-19 risks. ‚ÄúThere are several studies from across the world that show pollution certainly has an impact on Covid-19 related mortality. In Italy, there was 12% mortality in northern Italy as compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country. The study attributed it to high air pollution levels in the region. A study from Europe shows that 78% mortality was in regions with high Nitrogen Oxide levels. Another study from the US shows that every 1Œºg increase in PM 2.5 leads to an 8% increase in Covid-19 death rate,‚Äù said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Environment experts said the number of farm fires seen in Punjab and Haryana seen till now suggests the pollution peak may come sooner than usual. ‚ÄúWith burning starting early, it may turn out that when the pollution peaks between October-end and November 15, the activity has receded and may not contribute to the peak as much. However, this is to be watched. Secondly, this year since many people are still working from home, vehicular emission will be somewhat lower than last year and pollution levels may not turn so severe as it has in the past,‚Äù said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi. He added that for a long-term measure, the four states -- Delhi, Haryana, UP and Punjab -- have to come together to draw up a plan to fight pollution. ‚ÄúUnless there is better coordination among these states, it will be difficult to bring down overall levels of pollution, as activities in all four states contribute to the pollution observed in Delhi every year,‚Äù he said. On Thursday, Epca decided that large-scale construction projects such as on highways and for the Delhi Metro in Delhi-NCR will need to give an undertaking to the respective state pollution control boards that they will comply with dust-control norms. Similarly, industries in the red and orange categories (classified as those with higher emissions) will be required to give an undertaking to the pollution boards that they will only use approved fuels. The Grap‚Äôs winter rules, which first were drawn up in 2017, will stay in force till March 31.

In our considered view, ends of justice would be met if condition no. 4 as laid down by the high court is relaxed and the appellants are permitted to go back to the college to pursue their studies,‚Äù the Supreme Court bench, which also comprised justices Vineet Saran and Ajay Rastogi, held.After Dr. Tadvi‚Äôs suicide, her mother lodged a complaint that she had been harassed by the three senior postgraduate students on grounds of caste -- Dr.Tadvi belonged to the Tadvi Bhil Muslim community, which is a scheduled tribe and that they were directly responsible for the suicide of her daughter. The accused were then charged with abetment to suicide under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code and also for offences under provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 and the Maharashtra Prohibition of Ragging Act of 1999. They were arrested on May 29, 2019.Their bail plea was rejected by the sessions court on June 24, 2019, but was allowed by the Bombay high court on August 7, 2019. The high court , however, ordered that the three shall not enter the college and the licences issued to them by the Medical Council of India as well as Maharashtra Medical Council would remained suspended until the conclusion of the trial in the case.The top court, while relaxing the stipulation, said the stay of the three accused on campus should be minimized as much as possible.‚ÄúThe appellants shall avail study leave so that their actual period of stay inside the college and the hospital gets reduced...If there be any holiday or vacation and it is permissible for the residents to be outside the college and hospital, the appellants shall avail that and keep themselves away from the hospital and the college,‚Äù the court said.If any untoward incident takes place, the authorities should immediately report to the police station of the area and ensure that the life and liberty of everyone, including the accused, are protected, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/payal-tadvi-suicide-case-sc-allows-accused-to-resume-studies/story-OfreQ8YKQlg6MoLt88ohdL.html

09-10-2020||India||Two same-sex couples move Delhi HC for recognition of marriages||Two same-sex couples have moved the Delhi high court seeking legal recognition for their marriages, arguing that the lack of formal acceptance of their union under Indian laws was a violation of their constitutional rights.The petitions were heard on Thursday by justice Navin Chawla, who directed that they be listed before the chief justice of the high court, who is already hearing a petition seeking recognition of same sex unions under the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act. The next hearing is scheduled on October 14. A petition seeking the recognition of gay marriage under the Special Marriage Act pending before the high court. The two petitioners were represented by senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and advocates Arundhati Katju, Govind Manoharan and Surabhi Dhar. Guruswamy and Katju were among the lawyers who successfully convinced the Supreme Court to read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexuality, in 2018. The first petition was filed by two mental health professionals -- Kavita Arora, 47 and Ankita Khanna, 36 -- who said they had been living together as a couple for eight years, were in love with each other and sharing the highs and lows of life, but unable to marry as both were women.‚ÄúThey share the highs, the lows, the joys and sorrows of life; they go through the wear and tear of living together; they have the deep, unbreakable bond of two people who have come together in love. The petitioners are like any other couple you might meet, except they are both women,‚Äù their petition read.The second petition was filed by two men ‚Äì Vaibhav Jain, an Indian citizen, and Parag Vijay Mehta, an overseas citizen of India, who got married in the United States in 2017. An Indian consulate refused to register their union this year under the 1969 Foreign Marriage Act. The couple, who were in a relationship since 2012 and were supported by their families and friends, also claimed during the Covid-19 pandemic, non-recognition of their marriage prevented them from travelling as a married couple to India. ‚ÄúThe petitioners submit that non-recognition of same-sex marriages is a wanton act of discrimination that strikes at the root of dignity and self-fulfillment of LGBTQ {lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) couples,‚Äù the petition read. The two women said that things like opening a joint bank account, buying family health insurance, or securing address proof ‚Äì things that a married couple takes for granted ‚Äì were a struggle for them. On September 30, they approached the marriage officer (the sub-divisional magistrate, South East Delhi, Kalkaji) seeking solemnization of their marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. ‚ÄúThe marriage officer would have solemnized the marriage of any similarly placed opposite-sex couple. Sexual orientation discrimination is constitutionally prohibited under Article 15, but the petitioners were refused the right to marry a person of their choice on grounds of their sexual orientation alone,‚Äù they said.The petitions argued that the non-recognition of marriage between LGBTQ persons violated the fundamental rights of liberty, equality, life and freedom of expression guaranteed to them by the Supreme Court judgment, Navtej Johar vs Union of India, which decriminalised adult, consensual same-sex relations in 2018.The Delhi high court is already hearing a petition filed by defence analyst Abhijit Iyer Mitra and three others. In response to that petition, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said last month that Indian values didn‚Äôt recognise same-sex unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-same-sex-couples-move-delhi-hc-for-recognition-of-marriages/story-gzVejfNsnhCDFRyU7F8huK.html
09-10-2020||India||Oppn states seek GST dues redress system||States ruled by parties that are not part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) are demanding that a dispute resolution system be set up to tackle differences over the Goods and Services Tax (GST), saying they don‚Äôt expect an October 12 meeting of the GST Council to settle an imbroglio over compensating states for an expected Rs. 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in revenue this fiscal year, three people aware of the matter said.The 10 states have refused to accept either of two options suggested by the Centre to make up the shortfall -- borrow Rs.1.1 lakh crore (the portion of the deficit resulting from GST implementation issues) without paying either the principal or interest, or borrow the entire Rs.2.35 lakh crore (including the shortfall caused by the Covid-19 pandemic) at a significant cost. These states want the Centre to borrow the money, reimburse the states in full and retire the debt from the amount raised as cess on luxury and sin goods luxury and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco products. The imbroglio has underscored an urgent need to put a GST dispute resolution system in place because the GST Council, which is headed by the Union finance minister and comprises her state counterparts, is unable to forge a consensus, the three people cited above said. It has happened once, on October 5, and the October 12 meeting is headed the same way, said two finance ministers of states opposed to the options, requesting anonymity.On October 5, the GST Council put off until October 12 a decision on compensating states for the shortfall in their share of GST revenue as the 10 states balked at the suggestion that they borrow from the market to make up a part of the shortfall.‚ÄúA vote was almost certain on Monday [October 5] on this matter when the chairman deferred the matter to October 12 for more discussion. However, there is no material change in the respective positions as of now. Hence, the 10 states will demand a vote on this matter on Monday [October 12],‚Äù one of the ministers cited above said.When the new indirect tax regime came into force on July 1, 2017, subsuming a raft of central and state levies, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and said their revenue shortfall should be made good using the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products. The GST Council has extended the cess beyond 2022.‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that the Central government is departing from the convention of consensus-based decisions in the GST Council. The new tax regime, a unique example of cooperative federalism, was launched on the premise that its decisions will be unanimous. Its first chairman, former finance minister Arun Jaitley, did live up to that. But now, the spirit of cooperative federalism is fast waning,‚Äù the first minister cited above said. The GST Council, for the first time since its inception on July 1, 2017 resorted to a division of votes on the issue of a tax on lotteries at its 38th meeting on December 18, 2019. Twenty-one members voted in favour of imposing a uniform 28% rate on both state-run and state-authorised lotteries, seven ministers opposed the proposal and three abstained.Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said the states were, in effect, being threatened by the Centre that choosing neither of the options proposed by it would mean no compensation.‚ÄúIn the circumstances, if the avowed principle of consensus is not being upheld, the legal provisions for a dispute resolution mechanism within the Council should be activated without delay,‚Äù Isaac said. He also demanded the appointment of a vice-chairperson for the Council.An email query sent to the Union finance ministry did to elicit any response on the formation of a dispute resolution mechanism and the appointment of a vice-chairman.A Union government official said a proposal to form a dispute resolution mechanism had already been rejected. ‚ÄúA proposal to create a dispute settlement authority consisting of retired judges was mooted in 2011, even before the implementation of the GST regime, but it was rejected by the then Parliamentary standing committee,‚Äù he said, requesting anonymity.‚ÄúLater, the then GST Empowered Committee headed by Sushil Modi also rejected the proposal, arguing that any such authority would undermine the sovereignty of the GST Council, which essentially consists of the Centre and states and whose recommendations are binding on state legislatures and Parliament,‚Äù he added. According to officials, the GST Council has committees such as the fitment committee, which determines the procedures to determine rates levied on various supplies, and the law committee to resolve disputes among members. The Council can also form groups of ministers (GoMs) and committees of officers to resolve any issue.‚ÄúThe present situation demands urgent action and cannot be expected through a dispute resolution mechanism even if it‚Äôs established at the earliest. However, given the rise in dissent from state governments, initiating constitution of a dispute resolution body should be done for speedy resolution in future and to avoid adding to litigation before the Supreme Court,‚Äù said Ayush Mehrotra, a partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The law does empower the GST Council to establish a system to resolve disputes between the Centre and one or more states, said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm EY India.‚ÄúWhile one of the mechanisms could be setting up of an independent judicial body, various other avenues could as well be explored. Nonetheless, a formalised dispute resolution mechanism reflects lack of unanimity,‚Äù he added, noting that the ability to reach a consensus ‚Äúhas been quite an applaudable feature of the GST Council‚Äù so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-states-seek-gst-dues-redress-system/story-6Le4h7aQUpFla2oq9HScTM.html

Searches were being conducted in 11 locations, including at Hyderabad, Mumbai and West Godavari in Andhra Pradesh and the office and residential premises of the borrower in Secunderabad, in Ranga Reddy district and other areas, the CBI said in a statement. Raju, a parliamentarian from Narasapuram in West Godavari district, is the chairman of Ind-Barath Thermal Power Limited, and is facing allegations of causing an alleged loss of Rs 826.17 crore to a consortium of banks led by Punjab National Bank.‚ÄúIt was alleged in the complaint that the accused had cheated the Punjab National Bank led consortium banks by way of diversion/siphoning off bank funds etc. We have booked a case and investigation is continuing,‚Äù the CBI statement said. The CBI searches on the offices and residential premises of Raju came in the wake of his revolt against the YSRC led by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last few months. In July, the YSRC petitioned Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla seeking Raju‚Äôs disqualification from his membership for defying the party discipline, after he challenged the show-cause notice served on him. Since then, he has been attacking the YSRC leadership almost every day. In April 2019, too, the CBI conducted searches in the residences and offices of Raju for alleged loan default of over Rs 947 crore. The CBI charged Raju‚Äôs company with taking loans worth over Rs 2,655 crore from three non-banking financial companies -- Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited and India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd. The loans were taken for establishment of a 666 MW coal-based thermal power project in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. It was alleged that the company defaulted in payments of Rs 947 crore which turned into non-performing assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-searches-rebel-ysrc-mp-raghurama-raju-s-offices-residences-in-alleged-rs-826-cr-bank-fraud/story-Yem1uzUmDNFqQr0HCp8KwJ.html

But when I told them I want to try acting they were surprised and reluctant. But, after much persuasion I was allowed to complete my graduation in Mumbai with specialization in advertising,‚Äù she said. Talking about her acting debut UP girl Nidhi, who is also a trained dancer, said, ‚ÄúI tried my hand at ads and sketches before getting my first digital series, ‚ÄòPermanent Roommates.‚Äô It was an instant hit and then I got plenty of projects including ‚ÄòEvery Delhi Girl in the World,‚Äô ‚ÄòMan‚Äôs World,‚Äô ‚ÄòApharan‚Äô along with films like ‚ÄòLong Live Brig Mohan,‚Äô ‚ÄòDil Junglee‚Äô and more. And when bigger OTT platforms started to come in, the content got upgraded and work doubled up for all digital actors.‚Äù Currently, Nidhi is seen essaying a role of a cop in her recently released digital film ‚ÄòBahut Hua Samman‚Äô. ‚ÄúBHS...that is being streamed on Hotstar, was a fun project and playing a no-nonsense cop made it super fun for me to portray. Then shooting in Varanasi was a double fun as I was working near my hometown and was all glad being there. I‚Äôm also thrilled with the response my new web series is garnering.‚ÄùFor the road ahead, Nidhi wants to continue doing good projects with strong female characters she is known to play. ‚ÄúOffers are there but due to ongoing Covid-19 crisis things have slowed down thankfully my projects were all streamed on time and script reading for fresh ones is underway,‚Äù she shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/nidhi-wants-to-do-projects-with-strong-female-characters/story-4vwT8skvo3pNkWzANnf03O.html
