08-10-2020||Mumbai||You may be able to travel between Mumbai and Nagpur in eight hours by May 2022||The state government’s ambitious project, Mumbai-Nagpur expressway, is expected to be ready for vehicular movement by May 2022, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is executing the project, announced on Thursday. Once fully operational, motorists can travel between the capital and the second capital of Maharashtra in eight hours, said Radheshyam Mopalwar, vice-chairman and managing director, MSRDC. Currently, the journey between both the cities takes 16 hours. Until now, 152.17km-stretch of work has been completed for the 701-km corridor, Mopalwar said. According to him, the expressway will be made operational in three stages. Around 520km between Nagpur and Shirdi will be operational by May 1, 2021, as part of Phase-1, while another 100km-work will be completed in the following six months by December 2021, making the stretch between Shirdi and Igatpuri operational. By May 1, 2022, the remaining 78km-work will be completed, making the entire expressway open to traffic. “There might be a gap of around 50km in the two districts of Washim and Buldhana, but our target is to make Phase-1 operational by next year. We are racing against time to complete it,” said Mopalwar. Like several infrastructure projects in Mumbai, the Rs 55,000 crore was also affected owing to the pandemic-ensued lockdown. “We had almost 18,000 workers before the lockdown which went down to 10,000 in the months during the lockdown. But most of the workers started coming in by July-August. Now there are more than 20,000 people working on the project,” Mopalwar said adding that the initial target to get the corridor fully operational was January 2022. The project is called Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg or the prosperity corridor. It was initiated by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)- led government and was seen as a pet project of the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The ambitious expressway will connect 10 districts, 26 talukas and 392 villages between Mumbai and Nagpur. With 24 interchanges, it will also connect many tourism locations such as the Lonar lake, Ajanta-Ellora caves, Pench National Park, Shegaon, Sevagram, Shirdi, Bibi Ka Maqbara and Daulatabad. In 2017, farmers across 10 districts opposed land acquisition for the project. However, Mopalwar said that the entire acquisition process has been completed smoothly. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government that took over the project after coming into power in November 2019 and named it after Shiv Sena’s founder, the late Bal Thackeray. The government is also developing Krishi Samruddhi Kendras or new townships along the corridor. Of the 20 proposed townships, MSRDC is currently working on the development plan for eight townships along the expressway. Each of the townships is expected to be developed in an area of 1,000-1,500 hectares with adequate infrastructure facilities. MSRDC is also looking to lease out its land parcels at Nepean Sea Road and Bandra in Mumbai, as well as some parcels along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and in Pune and Kolhapur to raise Rs15,000-crore revenue for the project. “We are ready with the proposals but were advised by our consultants to not enter the market now. We will take a concrete decision in the next 15 days,” Mopalwar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/you-may-be-able-to-travel-between-mumbai-and-nagpur-in-eight-hours-by-may-2022/story-I9oiRgLuQ9vSPcP5ywTw8K.html

A case was registered and all the suspects, who are neighbours of the girl, were arrested. Primary investigation shows the victim and the suspects were known to each other. Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women safety, Gautam Budh Nagar, said the victim’s family informed police about the incident on Thursday. “The family alleged that the three suspects live in the neighbourhood. They had asked a 12-year-old boy, who was playing in nearby field, to call the victim to their house. When the victim reached there, they allegedly gang-raped the victim,” Shukla said. The victim returned home and narrated the incident to the family members. A police team from Dadri reached the spot and sent the victim for medical examination. The police arrested the three suspects, who appear to be adults, as per primary investigation. All the three suspects are neighbours and they had gathered at one’s house and committed the crime. Shukla said Dadri police registered a case against the suspects under Section 376-D (gangrape) and relevant sections of The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. “The suspects’ medical examination will establish their exact age.

08-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai monsoon misses withdrawal date; could take another 8-10 days, says IMD||The southwest monsoon has extended beyond the normal withdrawal date for the city — October 8 — with another eight to 10 days for the season to end, the weather bureau said.In April this year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had announced the new onset date for Mumbai as June 11 as opposed to June 10 originally, and the new withdrawal date as October 8 against September 29. This meant that the normal duration of the entire season over Mumbai would span 120 days as opposed to 112 days.This year monsoon onset was declared on June 14 and the season has already spanned 116 days. It was the second wettest monsoon in history in the city.“Mumbai has missed its normal withdrawal date, but it cannot be said that it is a delayed withdrawal yet because the withdrawal date (October 8) has a standard deviation of plus-minus seven days. So it will not be a delayed withdrawal if declared till October 15,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD. IMD had earlier this month said that withdrawal was expected between October 9 and 15.KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD, said, “With the prevailing situation, it may take another eight to 10 days for monsoon withdrawal to be declared from Maharashtra and Mumbai.”The weather bureau said rainfall activity is expected to enhance over Maharashtra from October 10 onwards with a yellow alert for isolated areas in Marathwada, Vidarbha and parts of central Maharashtra and south Konkan. However, it is not likely to lead to heavy rain for north Konkan including Mumbai. “We are expecting the formation of a low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal which will increase rainfall over Maharashtra, thus delaying withdrawal,” said Mohapatra.Last year, monsoon withdrawal from Mumbai was declared on October 14 while it was October 6 in 2018, and as late as October 24 in 2017. The trend was observed in previous years as the southwest monsoon withdrew from the city on October 14 in 2016, October 15 in 2015, October 20 in 2014. Prior to that, the range had been between October 14 and 18.Independent meteorologists said withdrawal for Mumbai and Maharashtra was not likely before October 20. “The low pressure systems from the Bay of Bengal will keep the monsoon circulation active for some more days. La Niña (when the western Pacific Ocean warms up creating a low pressure near Australia pulling winds from the Indian Ocean, strengthening equatorial dynamics keeping southwest monsoon circulation active) is allowing the equatorial dynamics to be vigorous, which is, in turn, showing up in the form of low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal. The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is not moving down, hence keeping the monsoon circulation active. This translates into delayed withdrawal,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay.Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, said, “Consecutive low-pressure systems from the Bay of Bengal will prevent the official announcement of the monsoon’s withdrawal, which is largely dependent on the requirement of dry weather conditions. However, from October 15, main features of the southwest monsoon circulation (such as wind direction) will no longer prevail; so whatever rainfall will occur, will be purely due to the non-southwest monsoon weather pattern.”Meanwhile, the city and suburbs recorded no rain on Thursday with day and night temperatures a degree above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-monsoon-misses-withdrawal-date-could-take-another-8-10-days-says-imd/story-OV28305bP8yEJI3dq8HcZK.html
08-10-2020||Chandigarh||Don’t use steroids in initial stages of Covid infection, warns PGIMER||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research has cautioned against the “indiscriminate” use of steroids for the management of Covid-19 patients.The premier institute in Chandigarh, which also receives patients from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, in a release stated that it has been seen recently that the “seriousness” of Covid patients coming to the hospitals has increased majorly due to the use of steroids, which needs to be regulated.“We are facing this issue from a number of patients who are being admitted to our facility. It has become a trend that the patients are taking or given steroids, which can be harmful as the recent scientific evidence is showing,” said Dr GD Puri, dean (academics) and head of the anaesthesia and intensive care department, PGIMER.The institute, in the release, said that steroids are not recommended for patients who do not require oxygen therapy. These include initial, mild or asymptomatic patients. Citing the Recovery clinical trial published from England as well as observations made by experts at the institute, the release said it has been seen that steroids given in early stages of Covid-19, when a patient is not requiring oxygen, can increase severity of the disease along with mortality and morbidity. “Steroids should be started in Covid patients only when they are requiring oxygen therapy and that also preferably after admission to the hospital under the supervision of an experienced physician,” the institute said.‘Inhibits body defences’Throwing more light on the issue, Dr Puri said steroids (such as dexamethasone) if given in the early phase of the infection, when virus replication is occurring and there is no secondary effect on the lungs, inhibit body defences against the virus and this increases the severity of the infection. “Only when body defence mechanisms are failing and have started becoming self-destructive, it is the proper time for inhibiting inflammatory response (through steroids), which helps to limit the damage,” he said.Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid drug used in a wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. The drug has been tested in hospitalised patients with Covid-19 in the Recovery clinical trial and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients and has been shown to reduce mortality by about one-third for patients on ventilators, and by about one-fifth for patients being maintained on oxygen therapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/don-t-use-steroids-in-initial-stages-of-covid-infection-warns-pgimer/story-a4p2JAVgMzDkfTLC67ydnN.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||ED moves Mumbai sessions court against closure of cheating case against Jet Airways, Naresh Goyal||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has approached Mumbai sessions court challenging a magisterial order that denied permission to the agency to intervene in the Jet Airways case, and opposing a report filed by MRA Marg police for closing a cheating case against Jet Airways and its directors Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita.The magistrate court had, on September 19, rejected ED’s plea for intervention in the case. ED had challenged the order claiming that it was probing money laundering allegations against the airline and the Goyals based on the MRA Marg case. The agency claimed if the case was closed, they would not be able to continue their probe.The probing agency further sought a stay on the proceedings before the magistrate court, which is yet to accept the closure report, till the sessions court decided on its plea for intervention. The sessions court, however, on Thursday refused to grant a stay and scheduled the hearing on ED’s appeal for next week.Opposing the report by MRA Marg police, the agency has pointed out several lacunas in the investigation into the complaint by the chief financial officer (CFO) of Akbar Travels of India Pvt Ltd (ATIPL) against Jet Airways and its directors Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal for cheating.The complainant alleged that during 2018-19, ATIPL had done business of ₹900 crore with Jet Airways, of which ₹21.31 crore was yet to be paid. The complainant also claimed that the airline made advance air ticket bookings worth ₹23.87 crore which is due. According to ATIPLS, the airline is yet to pay a total of ₹46.05 crore to the company.The CFO further claimed that when Goyals assured the firm of payment and proceeded with business despite having knowledge about the financial crisis. The complainant also shared details of bank accounts held by Goyals in other countries for further investigation.The police, after the probe, had filed a closure report claiming that they found no evidence that the complainant was cheated. The police, in its report, claimed the case is of civil nature and sought closure of the case.ATIPL, through its lawyer Dharmesh Joshi, has also filed a petition against the closure report. ED, in their application for intervention in the hearing, claimed the police left out crucial facts and that it did not properly investigate facts about the three meetings between the complainant’s representative and Goyals.The agency also claimed that the police did not record statement of Naresh Goyal about the allegations in the complaint along with the details of accounts with foreign banks. ED said, “Police made undue haste in submitting the closure report dated March 9 to the court.” It is to be noted that ED has already initiated investigation into money-laundering allegations against Goyals. The probing agency claimed that during their probe, they unearthed numerous foreign bank accounts of Naresh and Anita Goyal and related entities in the UAE, UK, Switzerland, Singapore and USA etc. ED also mentioned that Anita holds eight properties outside India while the couple has around ₹180 crore in one of their several accounts outside India.In the plea, the agency asked the court to not accept the closure report of the police and asked the court to direct the police to reinvestigate the complaint with regards to undisclosed accounts and assets of Goyals and their family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-moves-mumbai-sessions-court-against-closure-of-cheating-case-against-jet-airways-naresh-goyal/story-UUQ8sA55NNiCwUbpzf9jBJ.html
08-10-2020||Noida||Air warriors raise bar amid challenges of Covid and border standoff||Ghaziabad: The preparations for the 88th raising day of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were held under the cloud of the Covid-19 pandemic, even as the air warriors knew they may be called to the border with China at short notice. The IAF on Thursday showcased its might with a scintillating display of frontline fighter aircraft in the air, while the air warriors showcased their discipline with a synchronous, albeit socially distanced, parade. Many who took part in the parade said it seemed like they were marching alone.“We had to maintain more distance and one cannot see the person near them. I could not see the parade behind me. But it was the confidence in each other’s capability that carried us through,” said Group captain Sagar Madhukar Paranjpe, the parade commander. He said training, precision, discipline and teamwork will help the force stronger and a force to reckon with. “We are building capability and this (the parade) was a demonstration of a similar capability. The IAF chief said that the year was challenging with tension at the borders and also due to the pandemic. During these times we have been increasing our capability and not letting it come in our way. The josh is high among the boys and they always come up and rise to the occasion,” said Paranjpe. Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria, in his address at the Hindon airbase, said the IAF had instituted various measures to counter the spread and minimise the disruption in functioning due to the pandemic. “The tenacity and resolve of our air warriors ensured, that the IAF continued to retain its capability and capacity to undertake full scale operations, throughout this period,” he said. The chief said the force had deployed transport and helicopter aircraft promptly during the lockdown to support Covid-19 related tasks pan-India and also flew almost 750 hours including many missions to bring back stranded Indians from across the globe. “I would like to commend all warriors for the quick response, in the recent stand-off on our northern frontiers, when we deployed our combat assets at short notice to handle any eventuality, and provided proactive support to all the requirements of deployment and sustenance for the Indian Army,” he said. Putting up the display of fighters and men and women of the Air Force in the time of the pandemic was challenging.“It sure must have been a difficult to take a call on whether this event should happen or not. But once our chief took the call, we all stood up. Unlike previous years when we practiced for two months, this time it was just about 28 days,” said Squadron Leader Shivangi Rajawat, the officer who led the ‘Nishan Toli’ at the parade on Thursday. There were 50 officers and 157 air warriors who were part of the parade on the 88th IAF Day. On the other hand, the frontline fighter jets including the Rafale dazzled the spectators with splendid air display. Apart from the Rafale, there were fighter jets like Sukhoi-30s, Jaguars, Mirage 2000s, MiG-29s and Tejas LCA who took part in the flypast over the Hindon airbase. The Rafales, Su-30s and MiG-29s are among the aircraft deployed in the Ladakh theatre to deal with any provocation by the Chinese military. The theme this year on the IAF Day was to ‘Innovate, Integrate and Intimidate.’ “We were flying Rafale, Tejas and Sukhoi-30 in a formation. This required a lot of practice and coordination and our manoeuvrers were aggressive. This happened for the first time. We hope to fly together not only in times of peace but also in any other situation. Rafale and Tejas flying together will definitely form a deadly combination,” said an officer who flew the Tejas LCA during the air show on Thursday. “Tejas is indigenously built and it has amalgamation of some of the best technologies available among the different platforms. We were flying together to show the ability that we can operate in a composite manner. So, this was the message that was sent across to anyone who was watching it,” the officer, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-warriors-raise-bar-amid-challenges-of-covid-and-border-standoff/story-iwFleRR706cSwo1kLqzjnJ.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Cops identify 1 lakh fake social media accounts used to malign Mumbai Police, Maharashtra govt||Another 20,000 social media accounts have been identified for having attempted to malign the image of Mumbai Police and the state government by discrediting the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Commissioner of Mumbai Police Param Bir Singh had instructed the cyber cell to investigate the matter and register cases under provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act. HT had previously reported that Mumbai Police had identified over 80,000 social media accounts, which had attempted to discredit the police and Maharashtra government after Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14. With more than 20,000 accounts being identified since, the total number of accounts engaged in the misinformation campaign is now over 1 lakh. According to Mumbai Police, many of these accounts were created on June 14 and are operated by bots. “Bots are used to increase followers or to [make] something trend on social media. In this case, we have identified over 50 bots and each bot is capable of operating at least 5,000 accounts, so it can be imagined as to how many accounts would have been used to make something trend,” Singh said on Thursday. “We have also identified IP addresses, which were used to operate and access such accounts. The IP addresses used by bots were operated from India and abroad, and the process of identifying accused is underway,” he said. A senior crime branch officer said certain accounts posted tweets in just 0.3 seconds and most posted messages that were copied and pasted. Some of the accounts were created over 10 years ago and had been inactive for a long time before posting messages with hashtags like #SushantSinghRajput. “We have also found in our investigation that the accused were using IP addresses from other countries like Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovenia, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Romania, France, Iceland, Russia and Surinam,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-cops-identify-1-lakh-fake-social-media-accounts-used-to-malign-mumbai-police-maharashtra-govt/story-UKJx1dkiMyup6ENtzFhBQM.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||No reclamation beyond 90 ha for Mumbai coastal road until further clearances are obtained: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court (SC) has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) not to undertake reclamation beyond the 90-hectare (ha) area for the coastal road project, as mandated by the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearances in 2016. BMC intends to reclaim a total of 111ha for the project and has applied for fresh clearances for the 21ha before the state’s coastal authority, which is slated to hear the application on October 31. As per the 2016 CRZ clearance, 90ha includes 20ha for constructing the coastal road and 70ha to be developed as green spaces for parks, cycle tracks, promenade, butterfly park and bus depots etc. The SC bench of chief justice SA Bobde, justice AS Bopanna and justice V Ramasubramanian was hearing multiple applications by environment groups, challenging the ongoing reclamation for the project, alleging BMC had reclaimed far beyond what was required for the road. “Till such clearance is obtained, no activity whether by reclamation or development will be carried out in respect of the said area (remaining 21 ha),” the SC said in the order published on Thursday. Hussain Indorewala, professor at Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture and Environmental Studies, presented maps showing the extent of reclamation proposed versus undertaken by BMC, alleging excess reclamation at Haji Ali and Worli. “The petitioners had originally submitted these maps about a month ago in the Supreme Court. BMC had argued in court that the additional area is needed for the sea wall, which will be partially below water. Why was this not part of the proposal submitted for CRZ clearance in 2016? BMC now wants clearance for these additional areas. Furthermore, excess reclamation has already been carried out in front of Worli promenade without clearance,” said Indorewala. BMC had told the SC that they had reclaimed 52.35ha of the sea, including 4.5ha for the sea wall, along south Mumbai for the 9.9-km ₹14,000-crore coastal road, which is to be an eight-lane highway connecting Princess Street Flyover to the southern tip of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, from March to September. “This has now increased to approximately 60ha presently,” said Vijay Nighot, chief engineer (coastal road), BMC, adding, “The SC has clarified in its latest order that reclamation for the road pertained to all necessary reclamation, which includes the sea wall construction. However, reclamation for remaining 21ha will only begin post clearance from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) during October last week.” The SC, in its latest order, clarified its December 17, 2019 order, wherein the bench stayed previous orders by the Bombay High Court (from July 2019) that quashed CRZ clearances to the civic body, and allowed reclamation of the land, 0but restricted BMC from carrying out any other development work. “We have clearly referred to ‘the land’ which meant the land over which the coastal road project is to be executed and that is 90 ha. By the December 17, 2019 order, this court specifically permitted the concerned authorities to construct a road and secure the same thereon. We see no ambiguity which warrants modification or correction of that order,” the order read. Responding to contentions that BMC did not have environment clearance under the Environment Protection Act (EPA), 1986, the SC also said that, as per submissions by BMC and its contractors, the CRZ clearance was issued after more intensive scrutiny than it is under EPA. Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust and applicant before the SC, said BMC had admittedly carried out reclamation which was not included in the CRZ Clearance. “Thus, BMC and its contractors need to be prosecuted under EPA. They have also violated the SC order of December 2019, which did not allow them to reclaim land for the seawall,” he said. “It is a sad day for the environment as till now, the SC has always held that, in matters of environment, the precautionary principle will apply, and such environmentally damaging projects will be subject to greater scrutiny by the courts. It is indeed sad to see that our top court has modified their views on environmental preservation,” said activist Zoru Bhathena. Meanwhile, the SC’s order directed that a representative of the original writ petitioners (before the Bombay high court) were allowed to remain present and be heard in the matter when MCZMA would decide on issuing CRZ clearance for the additional 21 ha proposed by BMC. “We make it clear that any activity undertaken by the petitioners and the concerned contractors shall be at their own risk and shall be subject to the final outcome of the present proceedings,” the SC order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-reclamation-beyond-90-ha-for-mumbai-coastal-road-until-further-clearances-are-obtained-supreme-court/story-CI1DwWrzJrXIzWby194YJJ.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP plans outreach across Maharashtra over three new farm laws||Amid criticism from the Opposition, the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) plans to go to farmers and workers in industries and factories to create awareness about the newly enacted farm and labour laws. Moreover, in a bid to corner chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, the party has chalked out a programme to stage statewide protests on the rise in crimes against women and support Maratha community over quota in jobs and education. The newly elected executive committee and the state working committee of the BJP held a daylong session at its Dadar office on Thursday. BJP’s national president JP Nadda addressed the executive and working committee members through video-conferencing, after its national general secretary BL Santosh inaugurated the session in the morning. Leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis addressed the valedictory session. The party passed five resolutions, three of which were to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the newly enacted laws and completion of 20 years in public office. Other two resolutions were to galvanise the party cadre against MVA rule over the rise in atrocities against women and support Maratha community’s fight for reservation. In his speech, Nadda said, “The Modi government has stood by the farmers over the past six years, be it implementation of the recommendation of the Swaminathan committee report or giving farmers liberty from middlemen. BJP workers should convince the farmers about the reforms the new laws will bring in. The people of Maharashtra are waiting for an opportunity to elect the BJP back to power.” State unit chief of the party Chandrakant Patil said the party will on October 12 hold demonstrations on crimes against women at 700 places across the state. “Covid centres erected by the government are not safe as a number of cases of rapes and molestations have been reported there. A long march from Shivaji statue at Shivaji Park to Chaityabhoomi in Dadar will be part of the protest,” he said. “The opposition to the farm and labour laws is for political reasons. The Congress’s 2019 election manifesto and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar too had supported removing farm produce from the clutches of APMCs. The same parties are now opposing the law related to the APMCs. Our party workers would go to farms and gates of factories to spread awareness about how these laws will empower them,” he said. Fadnavis said the MVA government has failed on all fronts, be it handling of Covid-19, legal battle in reservation to Marathas or atrocities against women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-plans-outreach-across-maharashtra-over-three-new-farm-laws/story-IlsQ40EUqQT3wWpe2oEraK.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Student groups demand new exam software provider for re-exam of University of Mumbai’s distance learning wing||A day after the distance education wing of the University of Mumbai (MU), Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), deferred all examinations by 10 days, several student groups have sought immediate termination of contract with the exam software provider hired by the varsity. “We had filed a petition in September asking the university to take time and conduct mock tests before starting exams. The university has not paid attention to any concerns raised by students,” said Dilip Ranadive from Ambedkar Students Association (ASA). He added that the association also wrote to the MU vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar, who then assured of smooth conduct of examinations.While the university is still unclear on what is causing the “technical glitches”, members of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena (MNVS) demanded that the university terminate services of the software company, LittleMORE Innovation Labs. “All exams should be cancelled till the software company is cleared to be able to conduct exams for students in large numbers. Students don’t need more anxiety than they are already facing,” said Santosh Gangurde, state vice-president of MNVS.This announcement for postponement of all exams until October 19 came a day after close to 9,000 third-year BCom and third-year BA students could not attempt their paper on Tuesday due to “technical glitches”. Many students complained of not being able to log on to the link on the examination application. In a statement on Tuesday, the university blamed the errors on a cyberattack on the examination software.While the new timetable is yet to be released, students are also worried about the status of re-examination, especially those who already appeared for one paper on October 3. “Nearly 50% of third-year BCom and BA students had managed to appear for the first exam on October 3, and the university has planned re-exam for those who missed the paper. But now we are not sure if we too have to appear for the paper again,” said Ankush Kumar, a student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/student-groups-demand-new-exam-software-provider-for-re-exam-of-university-of-mumbai-s-distance-learning-wing/story-6PccqGc7sCKhezOPjZOpOJ.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Sohna flyover suffered damage two months prior to the collapse on August 22||Nearly two months prior to the collapse of a span at the under-construction Sohna elevated road on August 22, the project had suffered another damage when cracks appeared in a span between two pillars of the elevated road near Sohna ki Dhani, found a recent spot visit by Hindustan Times. However, unlike the latest incident on Sohna Road, this span did not collapse and was supported with the help of steel shuttering. The officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) familiar with the matter said, at that time, a probe committee was set up, which concluded that engineering issues had led to the damage.The damage which happened at the beginning of July was concentrated in a stretch of two to three metres across the span between two pillars. However, since the damage happened gradually, it allowed the contractor to take precautionary measures, such as setting up a large steel ramp and barricading the affected area to prevent any collapse of the structure, said officials.The damage to the span has however put a question mark on the construction processes and the quality of construction material being employed by NHAI contractors.Gurgaon Sohna Highway Private Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of HG Infra Engineering, is building the ₹600-crore Sohna Road widening project from Badshahpur to Sohna town. The first half of the project is being developed by Oriental Infrastructure Private Limited.The 21.66 km-long Sohna road project has two parts — an underpass and an elevated road from Subash Chowk to a point beyond Badshahpur. The second part comprises the expansion of the 12.72-km road from Badshahpur to Sohna and will involve the construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the entire stretch.A visit to the spot under question on Sohna Road around 15 kilometres from Rajiv Chowk in Gurugram on Wednesday reveals that the span is damaged towards the eastern side and there is an obtrusion, which is visible at the crack. The contractor in order to ensure that the span does not collapse has installed heavy-duty shuttering and other measures to support the concrete beam. Workers were also deployed at the spot, who were engaged in cutting the stressing cables that are supposed to keep these spans in place.On August 22, a span between piers 10 and 11 collapsed, after which a high-level technical committee was formed by NHAI to probe the reasons for this lapse. The committee after detailed deliberations put the onus on the quality of concrete used, the presence of cavity, and the displacement of stressing cables as possible reasons for this incident.When asked about the earlier damage to the span near Sohna Ki Dhani, NHAI project director Shashi Bhushan, who recently joined the project implementation unit, Gurugram, said that the extant incident happened in the beginning of July and has been under investigation of NHAI. “A technical committee probed the matter and it was found that the damage happened due to engineering issues that are common at under-construction projects. A committee has made recommendations to prevent such incidents like testing the concrete, installing spans in proper sequence, etc — measures which were implemented,” said Bhushan. The NHAI project director added that the entire damaged span will be removed and replaced with a fresh span.HT also contacted the contractor regarding the earlier damage. The contractor said the damage to the span happened due to routine engineering issues and the snag was identified and immediate corrective measures were taken to prevent any mishap. “The corrective measures were all recommended by the NHAI. We have also installed a ramp under the damaged span and barricaded the area. Strength test of other spans is being done to prevent any repeat of the August 22 incident,” said Kuldeeo Rajbanshi, project director, Gurgaon Sohna Highway Private Limited, which is developing the project.It may be recalled here that the NHAI had transferred its senior officials and the contractor also had discharged two senior executives after the collapse of span on August 22. The authority has also stopped work on the elevated stretch and is presently waiting for the report from the technical committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sohna-flyover-suffered-damage-two-months-prior-to-the-collapse-on-august-22/story-gWSYRWCegOKIg0P4zogniN.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Haryana government does away with the practice of marking houses of Covid-19 patients||The Haryana government has decided to put an end to the practice of affixing stickers or labels outside the houses of Covid-19 patients, while directing the district administration to remove those which are already pasted. Officials cited it as a move to bring behavioural change for ending stigmatisation of positive patients. In an order issued by the newly appointed chief secretary of the state, Vijay Vardhan, the administration and health department have been directed to implement the directive at the earliest. The order issued on Wednesday stated that the practice of pasting stickers of home isolation or quarantine in front of the houses of Covid-19 positive patients has to be stopped. Authorities have also been asked to remove those stickers that have already been pasted. “The decision has been taken as the central government’s focus is on bringing behavioural change rather than enforcing anything. It has come to our notice that the pandemic has led to stigmatisation and shaming of Covid-19 patients. In the past, several brawls have taken place between the patient’s family and the government workers who visited homes to paste labels. The new directive would prevent such situations,” said Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, director, general health services, Haryana. According to him, the move will motivate people to go for testing at early stages of infection.As reported by HT earlier this week, a petition was filed with the Delhi high court regarding the pasting of posters outside the homes of Covid-19 patients, citing it as a serious infringement of the fundamental right to privacy. The plea also contended freely circulating name of the persons who tested Covid-19 positive to the residents’ welfare association and on WhatsApp groups, that allegedly led to stigmatisation of Covid-positive patients. In Gurugram, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has been assigned with the task of pasting labels. Several issues have been reported where posters/stickers of home isolation were being pasted at wrong addresses with city residents complaining about it. In Large Outbreak Regions (LOR), many families complained that home isolation posters were posted outside their homes despite testing Covid-negative. Also, many positive patients expressed the plight of being harassed by the RWAs or society members once their test status came in the public domain. A Covid-19 patient, who preferred anonymity, said, “The disease can be tackled. However, the way you are being treated by the society when you test positive is reflective of the society’s attitude towards such patients. They should not be harassed. This new order will help in getting rid of the unwanted issues created after the person is tested positive.” Ashish Singla, medical officer, MCG said, “Posters were pasted to create awareness regarding prevention from infection but we will now follow the new directives issued by the government. RWAs have been conveyed to remove the posters at the earliest.” Condemning the state’s move, Dhruv Bansal, media spokesperson for the DLF RWA, said that pasting of posters should not be completely done away with. Instead RWAs should be given the authority to carry out the activity. “The reason for the stigmatisation is that posters remain pasted for a long time even after the patient recovers in 14 days. The MCG has to be informed to take out the posters, which takes time. Till the time poster is pasted outside the home, no one picks up the garbage or delivers food items, creating difficulty for the already recovered patient. Therefore, the process should be decentralised and RWAs should be given the authority to paste labels so that they can remove it in a timebound manner. This practice of putting up poster does help others from contractiing Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-government-does-away-with-the-practice-of-marking-houses-of-covid-19-patients/story-oUFzH3J9mUGr9TeP8f2FiL.html

The accused befriended the survivor on a social media site, posing as a wealthy man looking to marry her.Nikhil Kapse senior inspector attached to Bandra police said, “We have arrested the accused from Kolhapur after a month-long chase. The girl has been rescued and handed over to her parents.”According to police, on August 30 they received a complaint from a woman claiming her daughter had gone missing, after which a case of kidnapping was registered against an unknown person.Sandip Jadhav, sub-inspector, Bandra police station, said that during the investigation they came to know that the kidnapper was in Pune. However, by the time the police team reached there, he had fled with the survivor.“We started questioning his friends, and one of them revealed that he might be in Kolhapur, his hometown. We took the help of our technical team and managed to reach his exact location at Kolhapur. On October 7, we nabbed him and rescued the survivor safely,” Jadhav added.After she was rescued, the survivor revealed that a year and a half ago, she met the accused on a social media app, and the two became friends. Last year she informed the accused that she was visiting Pune to attend a wedding. The two met and became romantically involved.The accused told her that he belonged to a rich family and wanted to marry her. On August 30, he kidnapped her from Bandra.“When she reached Pune, she was shocked to find out that the accused’s father was a vegetable vendor and his mother worked as a domestic help,” said the officer.“During the investigation, police came to know that the accused has a history of conning girls and women. In 2019 he refused to marry a woman he had befriended and the woman later committed suicide. He was arrested by Chinchwad police for abetment to suicide and spent four months in jail in that case,” Jadhav added.Bandra police arrested the accused under section 363 (kidnapping) and 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault), 8 (punishment for sexual assault) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kidnapped-mumbai-teen-rescued-from-kolhapur-23-year-old-arrested/story-MWBHGczYgcknHecAIB2JHN.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Private labs put on hold home collection of samples after government slashes testing cost||After the Haryana government brought down the cost of the Reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) — the frontline test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing Covid-19 disease — testing numbers in the city’s private labs have sharply declined to less than 1,000 per day. According to private diagnostic centres in the city, the reason for this decline is attributed to the fact that they have either limited home collection of samples or put it on hold because the new testing cost of ₹1,200 does not cover the entire cost incurred by them in administering the test. From October 1-7, private labs conducted only 45.2% of the 15,139 RT-PCR tests in the district.From September 16 onwards, when walk-in tests were allowed, private labs had seen a sudden surge in the number of tests and were conducting more than 53% of the total tests. This amounted to almost 1,200-1,400 RT-PCR tests per day.However, on October 2, the state health department issued an order, further slashing the charges of RT-PCR tests from ₹1,600 to ₹1,200. Private labs and hospitals based in Gurugram raised the issue with the district health department, stating that the revised cost did not cover the entire cost of sample collection.Data available with the health department shows that from October 3 onwards — a day after the notification — testing in the private lab came down to 865, as compared to 1,075 tests on October 2 and 1,028 on October 1. At least 879 tests were administered on October 4, 996 on October 5 and 1,047 on October 6. Numbers further dropped to 953 tests on October 7. The health department did not share the figures for Thursday.Dr Rishabh Rajput, director of Covid-19 and microbiology division, Modern Diagnostics, said, “With the revised rate, home collection is slightly difficult due to which labs are now asking people to directly come to the lab for giving samples.”Dr Santosh Kumar, microbiologist, MolQ laboratory, another lab that conducts Covid-19 tests, added, “Many labs are disappointed with the new testing cost, due to which they have stopped sample collection from homes. A technician can take only 15-20 samples when visiting homes but the same technician can collect over 60 tests if stationed at the lab,” saidAccording to him, since they are a research and a diagnostic lab they have developed their own RNA extraction kits and Viral Transport Medium (VTM) kits. “Because, we use our own products, we are not facing huge losses and are doing the home collection. But for the smaller labs, the revised rate is difficult to sustain; therefore, they have either stopped home collection or have limited it,” said Kumar.As per the data, the testing rate in the government lab based in Civil Hospital, Sector 10 has increased compared to private labs. During the time period when private labs were conducting over 1,400 tests a day, testing in government set-up decreased below a 1,000 a day as they imposed charges on testing for non-medical reasons. However, for the last one week, on an average 1,185 RT-PCR tests are being administered in the public set up. On October 1, they did a maximum of 1,300 tests. Their numbers are fluctuating between 1,100-1,300 tests. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “On-demand tests of symptomatic patients are being carried out at the sample collection centres. Also, a large number of samples are being collected through survey and contact tracing.”Till now, 2,83,927 tests have been administered in the city, of which 22,761 were tested positive for Covid-19. 20,180 have recovered and 181 have died due to illness. On Thursday, 264 new cases were confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/private-labs-put-on-hold-home-collection-of-samples-after-government-slashes-testing-cost/story-8e53uAlASn5GABLL2HcI8I.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Haryana government fixes cost for TrueNat, CBNAAT tests for Covid-19||The state government has fixed the cost for TrueNat and Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) — both of which are diagnostic tools approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for administering Covid-19 tests. Though not widely used, health officials said that the tests are generally used in hospitals during medical emergencies. The district health department following the directives issued by the state on Thursday directed all private hospitals and laboratories conducting Covid-19 tests not to charge more than ₹2,400 for CBNAAT test and ₹2,000 for TrueNat. The cost of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has already been fixed at ₹1,200, along with ₹650 for rapid antigen and ₹250 for antibody test. RT-PCR and antigen tests are the widely used for Covid-19 with the former being the frontline test. TrueNat and CBNAAT — diagnostic machines used for testing drug-resistant tuberculosis— has been validated by the ICMR for confirmatory detection of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (which causes the coronavirus disease) to boost testing capacities. On April 10, ICMR had approved the use of TrueNat/CBNAAT for screening purposes only. The turnaround time for a single test is around 40-60 minutes. Like RT-PCR tests, throat and nasal swabs are collected. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The government has now fixed the cost of the two tests which are used in private hospitals as well as government hospitals in a pregnancy case or a case that requires immediate surgery. These tests are highly specific and sensitive in detecting the Covid-19. Now, with the new orders, hospitals cannot charge more than ₹2,400 for CBNAAT and ₹2,000 for TrueNat. In Civil Hospital, Sector 10 if the test is being conducted no money is being charged.”Private labs, on the other hand, said they are not doing these tests as they have to bear additional cost in procuring equipment and other essentials to run the machine. A representative of a private lab, who preferred anonymity, said, “Many hospitals are charging more than ₹2,800 for the tests. The price was not fixed as it is not a widely used test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-government-fixes-cost-for-truenat-cbnaat-tests-for-covid-19/story-wEDZy6sfpPDNCSp7gbOMTL.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Woman tries to immolate self at police commissioner’s office||A 28-year-old woman allegedly tried to immolate herself at the police commissioner’s office on Thursday afternoon, after alleging that the police were not arresting her partner against whom she had filed a rape complaint earlier this week. The police said the woman was rescued and did not suffer any injuries. She was taken into custody and booked under sections 309 (attempt to commit suicide) and 190 (threat of injury to induce person to refrain from applying for protection to public servant) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at the Civil Lines police station. According to the police, the incident took place around 2pm when the woman, who worked as a patient care attendant, had gone to the police commissioner’s office to discuss her concerns. The police said she sat down in the waiting area on the second floor, where the office of police commissioner is located, before suddenly rushing towards the entrance/exit gate. She was carrying petrol in a soft drink bottle, wrapped around a newspaper. She took out the petrol and after pouring it on herself, she ran towards the ground floor, the police saidSubhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Several women police officials noticed the commotion and ran after her. She was rescued before she could take out the matchstick from a packet and took her into custody.” An eyewitness, who was standing near the woman a few seconds before the incident, told media persons, “She entered the gate on the second floor and was wailing. She said police did not conduct a fair investigation in her case and that the SHO concerned had rebuked her. She complained she was running from one police station to another. A woman police official asked her to sit but she resisted and suddenly ran towards the gate. She took petrol out of a bottle and poured it on her. I tried running after her but could not since I am old.” The eyewitness said the police officials took the woman to a washroom and got her changed. After over 20 minutes, she was whisked away from the premises. The police said they had conducted a fair investigation. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime against women, said, “She had filed a divorce case against her husband in 2017, which is sub-judice. This was her third suicide attempt this year. In February, a man was arrested for allegedly raping her in DLF Phase-3 area and that case is also sub-judice. A few months later, she moved in with a man in Sector 7 after they got married at a temple in September. Since then, she and her partner had filed four complaints against each other at several police stations in the city and one complaint in Delhi. But they had reached a compromise with mutual understanding in all the cases and refused further probe.” The police said earlier this week, her partner filed an FIR against her, alleging she had extorted money from him and harassed him by marrying without getting a divorce. “She also later lodged a complaint, alleging he had raped her. On her complaint, we registered an FIR under Section 376 (rape) of IPC at women police station, Sector 51, on October 3. In both these FIRs, investigation is on. The woman has been booked under sections 309 and 190 IPC today and in such cases, we take the assistance of a counsellor. That process and further investigation have started,” said ACP Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-tries-to-immolate-self-at-police-commissioner-s-office/story-AQ7sM7aN1qTxmnDtQixf8M.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar-led NCP to contest Bihar Assembly elections, will announce candidates on Monday||After the Shiv Sena, the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday announced that it will contest the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections. The party will be contesting the polls independently. Insiders said that NCP was trying to be part of the Grand Alliance led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress, but did not get a positive response.On Thursday, the NCP declared its list of 40 star campaigners for the elections on 243 Assembly seats to be held in three phases, starting October 28.Tejashwi Yadav-led RJD, Congress and left parties formed an alliance against the ruling alliance of the Janata Dal (United) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“NCP was looking to be part of the RJD-Congress alliance but we have yet to get any response. They have also declared a seat-sharing formula so we don’t have any option but to contest the polls on our own,” said a party insider, requesting anonymity.“We will be contesting the Bihar Assembly elections alone. The party is considering contesting 40-50 seats. By Monday, we will be declaring the list of party candidates as well,” said SR Kohli, permanent secretary and member of the working committee, NCP.In the previous Assembly elections, the Janata Dal (United), RJD and Congress had formed the Grand Alliance, and NCP was also part of it. The party, however, moved out of the alliance after it was allocated just three of the total 243 seats.NCP then formed a third front along with Samajwadi Party and four other regional parties. However, it soon parted ways, protesting against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s pro-BJP statements. In the last Bihar Assembly elections, the NCP contested 40 seats but could not win a single one. Two years ago, Tariq Anwar, former member of Parliament (MP) and party’s face in Bihar left NCP over Pawar’s “clean chit” to the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi in the controversial Rafale deal. In his interview to a news channel, Pawar had said that people “do not have doubts” over PM Modi’s intentions. Anwar later rejoined the Congress and has been appointed general secretary recently.Another ally of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government – Shiv Sena – has also declared plans to contest the Bihar Assembly elections on 50 seats. In the last elections, the party had contested 150 seats but failed to register victory even on one seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-led-ncp-to-contest-bihar-assembly-elections-will-announce-candidates-on-monday/story-GRyUcYBn1KnysGzPuVMdzO.html

The main bookies are still at large, police said. “We have arrested 11 bookies so far. Various teams have been formed and are dispatched to Gujarat and Karnataka to trace the remaining accused,” said Jamil Shaikh, inspector, crime branch.Following their interrogation, police zeroed down on nine other bookies and identified five more persons. An officer said while the racket is operating from Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra in India, internationally it originates from Dubai, where the current IPL season is being held.A crime branch officer said, “We raided a hotel room in Khandpe, Karjat on October 1 and arrested two persons. The duo Kanti Varsungia, 43, a Thane resident and Prakash Pujari, 42, a Mulund resident were arrested with five phones and were accepting bets on a Kings XI Punjab vs Mumbai Indians match.”The investigation revealed that the entire operation was managed on a mobile application using a login-ID system. The main bookie would create various IDs using a super mastercard and send it to at least ten bookies working under him. The mid-level bookies would further create up to ten IDs each, using a mastercard. These 100 IDs are given to gamblers across locations to place bets on the cricket matches.Each bet is placed on the betting application using a point system and the entire transaction along with the coordination takes place on the application. The bets are placed on each over or each ball bowled. After the gamblers place their bets, the mid-level bookies forward it to the main bookie.Each Monday, the bookies distribute the funds based on who won the most points.Officials said the mastercard used by the bookies has a limit of anything between ₹5 lakh to ₹15 lakh and the mid-level bookies pay the main bookie who then distributes the winnings. Each match witnesses a betting of at least ₹10 lakh, police said.The police have found five IDs, the transaction details of which are likely with the main bookie, they suspect.The accused are remanded in police custody till Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ipl-betting-racket-busted-in-maharshtra-11-bookies-arrested/story-GBe60TadvglMVJBlC4Y11H.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||2,786 fresh cases in Delhi, but infection spread slowing, say experts||Delhi on Thursday reported 2,786 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) taking the city’s total infected count past the 300,000 mark. As per the daily health bulletin shared by the Delhi government, 300,833 people in the city have had the infection and 5,653 have succumbed to it in last seven months. The first case of the infection in the city was reported on March 2, when a 45-year-old man, who had returned from Italy, tested positive. The first death was reported eleven days later, when the 68-year-old mother of the fifth Covid-19 patient from the city succumbed to the virus. Since then, the city has seen two surge in number of cases in June-July and then again in mid-September. The government now has 2,734 containment zones in the city and tests over 50,000 people a day to control the spread of the infection. The positivity rate – fraction of samples that return positive among those tested – has come down to 5.34% over the last seven days, indication a slowing of the spread of the infection. This number had reached 9.55% at the beginning of September, prompting the government to tighten control measures. The daily testing was scaled up from 20,000 a day to over 50,000 over the month. On Thursday, the number of more accurate RT-PCR tests conducted also crossed 10,000 after five days. The daily health bulletin reported 10,125 RT-PCR tests, accounting for almost 19% of the total 53,322 tests that were conducted during the day. The number of RT-PCR, as well as, the number of total tests has seen a decline this week even as the number of cases continued to fall. Delhi conducted 48,629 tests over the last seven days as compared to 54,124 tests the week before that. “There is no intention of reducing the number of tests being conducted, we will keep up these numbers to ensure the infection remains in control,” said an official from Delhi’s health department, on condition of anonymity.Dr GC Khilnani, chairman at PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care said that there could be a waxing and waning in the number of Covid-19 cases till there is susceptible population in Delhi. Herd immunity is likely to be achieved when at least 60 to 70% of the population has had the infection or has been immunised,” said .“The people who have had the infection once are likely to have some immunity against a second hit, with very few cases of reinfection reported. A large study from Iceland shows that 90% of people retain the antibodies after four months of infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-786-fresh-cases-in-delhi-but-infection-spread-slowing-say-experts/story-yCsCCqTlV0qCpAdA1C4rkJ.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray meets Maratha leaders to discuss MPSC exams, supernumerary reservation||Following the aggressive stand taken by Maratha organisations to boycott the upcoming Maharashtra Public Service Commission exams and other demands related to recruitment and college admissions, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray held meetings with organisation leaders on Thursday. He will also interact with other community members on Friday. The decision about the MPSC exams and other demands is expected to be announced later today. Maratha organisations have demanded to postpone the MPSC exams being held on Sunday at various centres across the state. The community has contended that in the absence of Maratha reservation, youth from the community may lose the opportunity of getting government jobs if the exams are not postponed till the quota matter is resolved. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court (SC), on September 9, stayed the reservation to Marathas in jobs and education for 2020-21. Marathas were given reservations of 12% and 13% in employment and admissions, respectively, in 2018, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act.Nearly 2.61 lakh applicants are vying for 200 government jobs in various categories. Besides this, the community has demanded an immediate decision regarding community members whose recruitment procedure has been completed, but their official letter has not been issued. Organisations have also been demanding supernumerary reservation until the Apex court decides on the matter.Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and other key ministers from the state cabinet attended Thursday’s meeting with three delegations led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje, BJP legislator Vinayak Mete and Suresh Patil of Maratha Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti.Speaking to media persons after the meeting, Mete said that the government was positive about cancelling the MPSC exams. “We have been assured by the government that the scheduled exams would be cancelled. We have also been assured that the state will positively consider our other demands. We have opposed our inclusion in the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota and have also demanded supernumerary quota to safeguard the interests of our youth until the final decision is made,” he said.Sambhajiraje said that they would continue their protest if the exams are not cancelled and warned the government of dire consequences if their demands are not met.The government’s decision is, however, expected to be made only after meeting other delegations. “Few other organisations have demanded to be heard. A virtual meeting with various organisations has been organised for Friday afternoon, after which the final decision will be announced,” said an official from the CM’s office.The split between organisations representing the Maratha community came to the fore during the meeting with the government, as the three leaders chose to meet separately. Mete later said that there were no differences among the leaders or organisations, and the government should have coordinated the meeting with better communication. “Solving the crisis is more important, and if several delegations are meeting the government, there should not be any objection to it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-meets-maratha-leaders-to-discuss-mpsc-exams-supernumerary-reservation/story-wYfGEeGVwPksWD66CwlToJ.html
08-10-2020||Chandigarh||Armed for attack: This is what Chandigarh’s Covid combat zone looks like||Unfailingly, unhesitatingly, they face innumerable dangers every day. For the doctors, nurses, ward boys and other staff in city hospitals, every second spent caring for their patients exposes them to the risk of contracting coronavirus – one they are very well aware of. The fear that they could be carrying the virus back home to their loved ones: Parents, spouses or children, does not stop them from turning up day after day, ready to take on the battle to save lives and win the war against the deadly pandemic. The 410-bed Covid Care unit at Chandigarh’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research is one of the largest facilities in the region with over 1,000 admissions since March.A majority of the patients, doctors say, have recovered. The centre caters to patients with serious co-morbid conditions so over a 100 doctors coming in daily have to handle cases of dialysis, heart ailments and other interventions, apart from coronavirus. Most of the staff members have to complete six-hour shifts a day in personal protective equipment (PPE) that cannot be removed during duty hours – no, not even for toilet breaks – and can get more than uncomfortable in stuffy wards with no air-conditioning. Donning and doffing of PPEs at the centre’s crowded changing stations is difficult, requiring at least 45 minutes. Those of us complaining about remaining confined indoors, unable to attend weddings or parties have it easy as we have to stay safe only to protect ourselves. Think about these brave men and women doing everything possible to save others. Let’s behave responsibly then and don’t add to their burden||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/armed-for-attack-this-is-what-chandigarh-s-covid-combat-zone-looks-like/story-kNffOccscox0mhpRICad6K.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Hybrid learning model is the way to go for Maharashtra schools, say experts||A day after the Maharashtra government announced that schools in the state would physically open post-Diwali break, experts are now suggesting a mixed-model of online and offline learning for the days to come. As the number of Covid-19 cases is still high, the state government has decided to reopen schools only after Diwali break in November. Teachers said that even when the government decides to reopen schools, the specifics of it will have to be worked out depending on place to place.“In cities like Mumbai, even if schools reopen post-Diwali, there will still be a lot of risk for students and teachers as the number of Covid-19 cases is still quite high. However, some solutions would also have to be arrived at for students in rural areas and those in cities who are not able to access online learning,” said Uday Nare, a teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public School in Andheri.Subash Joshi, trustee, Science Parivar, a group of coaching institutes said in the days to come, hybrid learning where students can choose between online and offline is the way forward.“Students whose parents wish to send them to school or who cannot attend online classes can go to schools in small groups on a rotational basis. Those who cannot attend school can opt to continue with online learning for the rest of the year,” said Joshi. Francis Joseph, co-founder, SLN Global Network said that while an online-only mode will not work post the pandemic, at least for now, schools would have to make both online and offline options available. “Students and parents would have to be given an option to choose from the two options. This would involve a lot of planning at the school level too. Schools and teachers should ensure that students in whatever way they can, quality learning continues,” he added. Anandita Singh, a parent from Malad said that most parents are anxious about sending their children to school even post Diwali. “Till the pandemic ends, a lot of parents might not take the risk. But schools should offer an option where if need be, for higher classes some offline options like guidance sessions are held in some intervals,” she added.Meanwhile, several teachers and unions from the city have demanded clarity on the conduct of exams as schools continue to operate online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hybrid-learning-model-is-the-way-to-go-for-maharashtra-schools-say-experts/story-oALJ2xysljiDwwKfDMNtvJ.html

Around 3.30am, a white car was spotted coming from Khera village. When our team signalled the driver to stop, the occupants of the car tried to speed away. As the road was blocked with a police SUV, their car hit the divider. They were asked to surrender but they instead opened fire at the police team,” Yadav said.Three bullets hits the police’s Innova that had been used to block the road. “One bullet grazed inspector Man Singh’s arm. Another hit sub-inspector Ravi Rana, but he was wearing a bulletproof jacket, which saved him. The police team returned the fire and two bullets hit Sunil in his leg, while one hit his hand. Amit was shot in his legs and so was Rohit, who carried a cash reward of ₹50,000 on his arrest. Ravinder was also injured in his leg,” Yadav said.A total of 22 rounds were fired by the suspects, while the police fired 28 rounds in retaliation. “The local area police were informed and ambulances called in to shift the injured to BSA hospital, Rohini. These men are wanted in more than a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, robbery, firing, etc. Four automatic pistols with 50 live cartridges and two countrymade pistols with 10 live cartridges, three each of bulletproof jackets and helmets were recovered from them.

The court considered that the man had eight other cases pending against him. It is alleged that the accused Kuldeep also known as Krushna Amrutlal Joshi came in contact with the survivor in 2017 through a social media site wherein he posed as a woman. Through the social media account, he started chatting with her and befriended her.Later Joshi allegedly met her the survivor at her tuition classes and gave her a chocolate. After having the chocolate she became unconscious. When she woke up she found herself in a room, without clothes. Thereafter he blackmailed and exploited the minor for two years.The man lastly took her to Ahmedabad after which her father lodged a complaint with Ghatkopar police for kidnapping and sexually abusing his minor daughter. The accused was traced and arrested on August 29. A month later on September 25, he filed a bail plea claiming he was falsely implicated in the case.Joshi claimed that the girl had accompanied him on her own. He claimed that the girl never complained during her travel to Ahmedabad with him.The plea was opposed by the victim’s family claiming there are many cases of theft registered against him. The prosecution had said that he is booked in at least eight more cases of several kinds.The court after hearing the application observed, “The accused has started contact with the victim by concealing his identity and posing himself to be a girl. Here, the investigation is at the initial stage. There are allegations that the girl has been ravished since last two years and yet the statements are to be recorded as well as there is every possibility of the victim getting scared seeing the accused immediately after the commission of the offence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pocso-court-refuses-bail-to-man-who-posed-as-woman-on-social-media-befriended-a-minor-in-mumbai-and-sexually-assaulted-her/story-CNndTOIraxcYYCC0UhsrRN.html

We had set up temporary structures, a little away from our homes, and were sleeping there for the past two weeks. But they razed everything this morning and took away the broken furniture as well,” she said.On September 24, DDA officials had carried out a demolition drive and freed up around 2.5 acres of land. Officials had said there were around 200 temporary structures in the area. According to DDA, the drive was necessary to remove encroachments from the Yamuna floodplains and was done on the directions of the National Green Tribunal.Following the demolition, residents had managed to repair some of the broken cots and had erected makeshift structures near their razed homes to make do till they found a proper place. These structures were also removed on Thursday.“I could not go to work after the first demolition as there was nobody to take care of my children,” said Saira Parveen, 24, a domestic worker with three children. “For the past two days, authorities have been digging up the land where our homes were located. As a result, the whole area is full of water. We can’t live there anymore. We were sleeping in the open nearby and even that option was eliminated today. Where do we go now?”Women residents have a far pressing problem -- they do not have any access to clean toilets since the past two weeks. “The toilets were the first thing they razed last time. This has forced us to go out in the open,” said Parveen. “There is no money to even buy food. We were relying on meals distributed by NGOs once a day,” she said.Residents said around 60 families, comprising roughly 350 people, had lost their homes after this second round of demolition. They also alleged that authorities had dug up pits in the remaining area to ensure that the slum-dwellers do not return.“The water stinks. There is a risk of dengue and other diseases. Our children have been falling sick with fever and cold. There is no means to protect ourselves from the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mohammad Jahangir, who did painting work before the Covid-19 lockdown.“We were not running away with their land. Even if they can’t let us live there, shouldn’t the authorities have made some alternative arrangements for us before rendering us homeless during a pandemic?” said Jahangir, adding that he had no money to rent a room for his family of seven.The DDA did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking its comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/makeshift-shanties-at-dhobi-ghat-razed-two-weeks-major-demolition-drive-by-dda/story-mpc9HKaLnsrXKahXnElevI.html

08-10-2020||Chandigarh||Will move court against Ludhiana MC for serving CLU notices to shopkeepers:Beopar Mandal||The Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal has decided to move court against the municipal corporation over the change of land use (CLU) notices being served to shopkeepers in the city by the civic body.Members of the Beopar Mandal held a meeting with their legal adviser, advocate Harish Rai Dhanda, on Thursday. They said that they will move on roads and file a petition in court, but not allow the MC to collect CLU chargers from shopkeepers wrongfully. On Wednesday, shopkeepers of Ghumar Mandi had staged a protest against the civic body after two shops were sealed for non-payment of CLU charges. The shopkeepers said that notices are being served to shops which were established even before the CLU norms existed.President of the Ghumar Mandi Shopkeepers’ Association, Pawan Batra, said CLU charges have to be collected before the shop is constructed. “Now, when shopkeepers have got the registry done at commercial rates, and are paying property tax, the MC is also demanding CLU charges, which is not acceptable. The shopkeepers are already reeling under losses due to the ongoing pandemic and the MC is adding to their woes,” Batra said.General secretary of the Beopar Mandal, Sunil Mehra, said,”We have decided to move court against the civic body and meetings are also being held with different associations. We met advocate Dhanda on Thursday to look into the legalities. A petition will be filed soon. The shopkeepers in the entire city are against the decision of MC to collect CLU charges and if required, we would also move on roads.” Factionalism has again come to the fore among Congress leaders in the city. Congress councillor of Ward Number 76, Gurpreet Gogi, slammed mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC for adopting pick and choose policy while taking action against shopkeepers for non-payment of CLU charges. Gogi alleged that he had raised voice against the “illegal” action being taken by MC, and the officials, working on the directions of the mayor, had commenced the drive from his ward because of this. Gogi and shopkeepers of the Ghumar Mandi area had conducted a meeting with the mayor and MC officials in the middle of September and opposed the move by the MC. after two shops were sealed on October 5. MC has served notices against around 2,300 shops situated in different parts of the city. Despite attempts to reach mayor Balkar Sandhu, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/row-over-clu-notices-beopar-mandal-threatens-to-move-court-against-mc/story-APF92a3FAWlaLcOk45jfbJ.html

The TMC government murdered rule of law in the state. The way our cadres and leaders were attacked and beaten up mercilessly by the police is unprecedented. Don’t we have the right to conduct a peaceful rally in the state?”Kolkata and parts of Howrah witnessed clashes between BJP workers and the police near Howrah. The state police in riot gear beat up protesters, burst tear gas shells and used water cannons to disband the protests.Responding to these allegations, West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay was quoted as saying by news agency ANI, “No chemical was used in cannon water, it is wrong information. The intent globally to use coloured water is to identify a person post dispersal for further necessary action as per the law if required.”Bandopadhyay added that there is evidence of violent incidents. “Firearm has been recovered, policemen were also attacked. 89 persons were detained in Kolkata Police area & 24 detained in Howrah Police area. Some police personnel have sustained injuries.”He also said that allowing 25,000 people across several rallies would have been a travesty of the lockdown norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/tejasvi-surya-claims-chemical-induced-water-sprayed-at-bjp-workers-govt-denies-allegations/story-CdBAMKXBgm6tHGjHfRKK4I.html

Punjab BJP SC Morcha president Raj Kumar Atwal said that Dharamsot was “clearly involved in the scam and Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in the state was trying to protect him”.“The struggle to dismiss Dharamsot will continue,” Atwal said while addressing a conference at the district office of Ludhiana BJP near Clock Tower. He said a scam of ₹63.91 crore had come to light in Punjab in the central post-matric scholarship scheme. Atwal said it was shameful that Sadhu Singh Dharamsot’s name cropped up in this incident despite him holding the post of a cabinet minister. He said Dharamsot himself should have resigned on moral grounds. SC Morcha president said that Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar should break his silence on the scam that “exposed” Dharamsot and say what action is being taken against him.Atwal said that children belong to scheduled castes have suffered the most due to this scam. “They were not even given certificates from colleges. Now, colleges are saying that they will give certificates after the students pay money,” he added. “The government has betrayed the SC society by committing this scam,” Atwal said while demanding a CBI probe into the matter as well as strict action against the culprits.Ludhiana BJP district vice-president Sunil Maudgil, district general Kantendu Sharma, district president of Ludhiana BJP SC Morcha Kulwinder Singh, district vice-president Yashpal Janotra, councillors Surinder Atwal , Yashpal Chaudhary, Satish Kumar, Surinder Bali, Jatinder Goria, Nitin Jain, and Manu Arora were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sc-scholarship-scam-bjp-to-hold-chakka-jam-in-ludhiana-on-october-10/story-adfAnaiLoklPN6LNZzk6PJ.html

According to association members, they had gone to meet the DC, but as he was not available, they submitted a memorandum at his office on Thursday.The association also alleged that schools were “escaping from their responsibility of ensuring safety and security of the children and asking parents to submit self-declaration forms mentioning that the schools will not be held responsible if any of students tested positive for Covid-19”.Bhagwant Singh sought the formation of a seven-member committee comprising parents, which would examine if the classrooms were being sanitised properly and check the Covid-19 test reports of the staffers.The parents’ body also demanded that the government officials whose children were going to schools should make public their self-declaration forms so that the other parents could follow them and would not hesitate in sending their wards to schools during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/test-staff-for-covid-before-reopening-schools-in-ludhiana-parents-body/story-KdVPCgXYwXMoD5RCq7OpRL.html
08-10-2020||Chandigarh||GMADA approves 14 vending sites in Mohali||The Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has approved 14 sites in accordance with the Street Vendors’ (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, after a five-year delay. The sites have been identified in a joint survey conducted by the Mohali municipal corporation (MC) and GMADA recently. MC has over the years failed to remove illegal vendors from the main markets of the city, the worst-hit areas being phases 7, 3B1, 3B2, 9, 10, and 11.The Act is aimed at registering and rehabilitating street vendors and preventing their exploitation by enforcement officers. It also calls for controlling use of urban streets and spaces.MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said after GMADA identified the sites the civic body had appointed officers to check if these could be used and submit a report after before allocation could begin The town vending committee has yet to approve the sites even though the process of vendor identification began three years back. It was only in the last five months that MC issued identity cards to 200 vendors out of 993 under the Act, before GMADA identified the sites A senior GMADA official said the MC had proposed several sites earlier, but these were either meant for parking space or did not have the requisite legal authorisations.“We then carried out a joint survey and identified them... It is MCs project and now they have to check the feasibility of the new sites,” he added.In January this year, MC decided to first implement the Act in Phase 7, where 139 vendors are registered, as a pilot. The MC commissioner had even asked the agency that conducted the survey to mark the space in the parking areas, but it did not work out as the Market Welfare Association and area councillor of Phase-7 rejected the proposal to allot the sites at the rear parking area of Phase-7.However, out of 973 vendors only 200 were issued identity cards by the MC, but they are yet to be allocated sites.The spots selected by GMADA are in sectors 54: Close to Bassi Theatre and near Madanpur Chowk; 55: at Phase 1 barrier; 56: UT-Mohali border; 59: Near Sanatan Dharam Mandir; 65: Close to the petrol pump; 66: Near the sewage treatment plant; 67: National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research; 68: Near Temple of Knowledge; 77: Near Akal Ashram Colony; 78: Near Fire Station; 79: Near Housefed Flats; and 80: Near Convenient Shopping.Identification process started in 2015At least 993 vendors were identified in a survey started in 2015 by MC carried out by a private company it had hired. Initially, the firm had identified at least 2,295 vendors, but the MC House found anomalies in the survey and ordered a fresh one. In 2017, the civic body had identified 993 moving and stationary vendors.Expressing the hope that the vending problem would be sorted out soon, Jatinder Pal Singh, Phase 3B2 Market Welfare Association President, said, “We have requested the authorities concerned on multiple instances to take action against illegal vendors, but nothing has been done so far. The parking lots are left with no space as vendors have encroached upon the area.”The issue of encroachments is debated in every House meeting, but nothing comes out of it, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmada-approves-14-vending-sites-in-mohali/story-ugwipkqgf3ceE56QqBmApM.html

08-10-2020||Chandigarh||Special relief awaited: 3 years on, families of 9 fallen Ludhiana firemen run from pillar to post||Three years after nine firefighters were killed in the line of duty, their families are still forced to make rounds of MC offices for disbursal of a special monthly allowance of Rs 6,000 that has been promised to them. The allowance was announced in January last year when the President’s Fire Service Medal for Gallantry was awarded to the fallen firefighters who lost their lives while dousing the flames at a plastic factory near Suffiyan Chowk in November 2017. The deceased include sub-fire officers Rajinder Sharma, Sumohan Gill and Raj Kumar, leading firemen Pooran Singh and Manohar Lal, and firemen Rajan, Vishal, Manpreet Singh and Sukhdev Singh. Other benefits promised to their families include discount on air travel, concession in school admission fee for children and widow quota in jobs.Also, four firefighters who suffered burn injuries while dousing flames at a factory in Vijay Nagar in May 2017 are also suffering due to the apathy of the department.Of these, one leading fireman, Hajura Singh, has started receiving compensation after his transfer to Amritsar. The others injured include firemen Lovlesh Sood, Naresh Kumar and Saudagar Singh.Deceased sub-fire officer Raj Kumar’s wife, Manjeet Kaur, said, “We are continuously making rounds of MC offices and have also met Mayor Balkar Sandhu recently. But, the authorities have still failed to provide the allowance. The families of the firefighters who gave their lives in the line of duty are forced to run pillar to post to get what they deserve. The government has provided the government jobs to the family members but few families are still struggling to make ends meet. Also, no other benefits including concession in school admission fee, discount on air travel etc are not being provided.” Deceased sub-fire officer Rajinder Sharma’s son, Tushar Sharma, said the gallantry award was announced for the firefighters in January 2019 and the amount, which was earlier Rs 3,000 per month, was increased to Rs 6,000 in March this year.Municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “I am aware of the matter and as per procedure, the file has to be approved by the Finance and Contracts Committee (F and CC) of MC. I have forwarded the case to the committee and the allowance will be released soon after getting approval.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/disbursal-of-special-allowance-families-of-fallen-firefighters-run-from-pillar-to-post/story-IfTFUk1fD3tFLAUpR1hHJO.html

The competent authorities have been instructed to look into the matter and, in accordance with the law, will take the necessary steps,” said district magistrate, Suhas LY.The meeting was held on September 15 and the order was issued on September 19, but was made public only on Wednesday. “Human-animal conflicts are becoming increasingly common and many residential areas have reported incidents of confrontation between residents and animal feeders over the time. Such a decision will go a long way in resolving these issues,” said Kaveri Bhardwaj, an animal welfare activist.She said that if the feeding points were chosen with care, cases of human-animal conflict will go down too. “If all parties involved, including residential bodies, come to a definite conclusion it will definitely help improve the situation a lot. Places can be decided based on convenience of both the animals and residents,” she said.Residential bodies also feel that such a decision will be helpful for both humans and the stray animal community.“In the current scenario, it is but obvious that animals and we have to co-exist. There are several issues that need to be addressed in this regard but having specific feeding points is a step in the right direction towards resolving a few of those conflicts,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida federation of Apartment Owners Associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gautam-budh-nagar-admin-wants-authority-to-make-animal-feeding-points-in-residential-areas/story-Wu7HAwq0LBFNEkusDt0EnL.html

The suspects, police said, were seen in CCTV footage running away on a red motorcycle after the incident. In another CCTV footage, one of the suspects is seen holding a helmet in one hand. Two suspects were carrying backpacks that were used to carry away the stolen money. Four teams, including one surveillance group, have been engaged to arrest the suspects. Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said two teams of police personnel from Sector Beta 2, one special team, and one surveillance team have been engaged to solve the case. “The suspects appear local as they spoke in local dialect during the crime, and they fled on a bike. The CCTV footage showed they had fled towards a private hospital in the neighbourhood,” he said. Singh said the suspects robbed ₹2.15 lakh cash from the drawer of a cashier, and on their way out snatched the bag of a customer that had ₹1.75 lakh in it. “It is possible that the suspects were following the businessman who entered the bank to deposit the money. The criminals snatched the businessman’s cash bag, looted₹2.15 lakh from the bank and fled,” he said. A police team reached the spot after getting information but the suspects managed to escape. The suspects had held the security guard at gunpoint and hit him for putting up resistance. The cyber team has retrieved a list of around 1,000 phone numbers that were obtaining signals from the tower closest to the bank at the time of robbery. “The police teams are investigating the matter from all angles and we hope to solve the case soon,” Sigh said. The suspects could not reach the cash vault at the back as the officials had pressed the security alarm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/police-release-sketches-of-bank-robbery-suspects/story-KQzFKyqYMEUKR4Fc877mEJ.html
08-10-2020||Noida||Man posing as Bulandshahr SHO held in Greater Noida, he was trying settle local dispute||The police on Wednesday arrested a man who was allegedly pretending to be a sub-inspector and recovered a police uniform, cap and shoes from his possession. Police said the suspect, Rajesh Tripathi, 45, a resident of Kanpur, was allegedly trying to pressurise a person in a dispute at a local shop in Badalpur by pretending to be from the police. He had shifted to Badalpur two weeks ago and has been living in a rented accommodation. He lived in Ghaziabad before that for a year, the police added. Dharmendra Sharma, in-charge Badalpur police station, said that two persons had clashed over some issues near Dharam Kanta in Badalpur on Wednesday. “One of the two persons was known to Tripathi, who reached the spot on a two-wheeler and introduced himself as the station house officer (SHO) of Gulawathi police station in Bulandshahr. He was in plain clothes and locals suspected his claims,” he said. The opposite party, meanwhile, informed the Greater Noida police and a team from the Badalpur police station reached the spot. “Tripathi claimed that he is a police sub-inspector posted in Bulandshahr. We checked with the Bulandshahr police and found his claim to be false. We asked the suspect to produce his police identification card, which also turned out to be counterfeit,” he said. The police team then scanned the suspect’s two-wheeler and found a police uniform and a cap under the seat. “The suspect later admitted that he had faked his identity. He revealed that he used to pretend to be a police officer to get undue advantage. He used to visit different places to intervene in disputes as a police officer and then extorted money from people,” Sharma said. A case was registered against him under Section 420 (cheating), Section 467 (forgery), and Section 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) of the IPC. “The suspect was produced in court and sent to jail,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-posing-as-bulandshahr-sho-held-in-greater-noida-he-was-trying-settle-local-dispute/story-uEGAzwQWs2Fn0eSMP9ydBP.html

The authority has sanctioned ₹12 crore for the horticulture work to be carried out at this Golf Course. The first 18-hole Golf Course was developed in Sector 38A in the 1990s. “We have issued a tender to invite proposals from interested developers. According to rules, after agencies apply, the authority will finalise one, which will be awarded the contract,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty of the Noida authority, who is heading the horticulture department.The authority had issued the tender in this regard last month as well. However, no developers had shown any interest in the project, said officials. “We have issued this tender a second time. If less than three agencies apply for a project then the authority cannot finalise one out of the one or two which have applied for a project. We hope now enough agencies will apply, after which we can finalise one,” said Singh.The authority, in its 198th board meeting in February, had approved a tentative budget of ₹90 crore for the golf course. The project’s detailed report has been finalised and the budget has been vetted.The proposal for the golf course was finalised in the 197th board meeting of the Noida authority, on September 27, 2019. It is proposed to have a 90 acre golf course, 20 acre adventure sports facility and a heliport spread on 10 acres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/tender-issued-again-for-noida-s-second-golf-course-project-in-sector-151a/story-CeoD2sYFrlJMlem7cfB8gO.html
08-10-2020||City||MPSC exam: CM to hold another meet on Friday||Pune: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday decided to hold another round of dialogue with Maratha outfits again regarding MPSC exam and reservation on Friday. The Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) exam is scheduled on Sunday (October 11).The meeting was attended by representatives of Maratha outfits who urged the government to defer the exam date and increase the age limit for candidates by another year. Earlier, before the meeting, Shiv Sangram president Vinayak Mete said that till the time government takes a call on Maratha reservation, MPSC exams should be postponed and upper age limit for candidates should be increased. In Pune, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) president Prakash Ambedkar said that opposition to MPSC exam by community outfits is wrong though his party will support the Maharashtra bandh called by some Maratha outfits on October 10 over the quota issue. Over 2.5 lakh students have applied for the examination. VBA chief Ambedkar said that his party has previously taken a call about backing the Maratha reservation and, therefore, it will support Saturday’s bandh. “We have conveyed to Suresh Patil of Maratha Arakshan Samiti that these two reservations, Maratha and OBC, will remain different and no demand should be made seeking reservation for Maratha community by touching the OBCs’ share,” Ambedkar said. If both sides (representing Marathas and OBCs) remain firm on the stand that both the issues will remain separate, the mutual understanding in the state will remain intact, he said. Without naming BJP MP Udyanraje Bhosale, Ambedkar said that he didn’t understand how the saffron party could send someone who doesn’t know the Constitution to Rajya Sabha and says reservations for everyone be scrapped if Marathas cannot get it. The Supreme Court had last month stayed the implementation of 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs, but made it clear that the statute of those who availed of the benefits will not be disturbed.Following this, the state government has filed an application before a larger bench of the apex court, seeking vacation of its stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mpsc-exam-cm-to-hold-another-meet-on-friday/story-w62nVHyuaHzPYz6R4eWCgJ.html

Officials said that the re-suspended dust particles, which are less than 75 microns, aid PM 10 levels as they have a tendency to unsettle. “During an interaction with IIT Kanpur, the UPPCB directed us to take samples. During discussions, it came out that dust particles less than 75 microns do not settle easily and continuously move with the movement of vehicles and wind. So, samples were taken from 18 different road patches in Ghaziabad in order to find out the quantum of such particles,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. Patches from where samples were taken include areas near Vaishali metro station, Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi, Vasundhara Sector-16A, opposite ITS College at Mohan Nagar, in front of LT Centre at Kamla Nehru Nagar and in front of Koyal Enclave at Loni-Bhopura Road, among others. In Noida, officials said 10 road patches were identified from where the samples were taken. “The samples are being tested in Ghaziabad and results are expected by next week. Once we get the results and find out the share of the particles, we will be able to ascertain where we need to intensify dust abatement measures,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida.Some of the spots from where samples were taken are near Sector 62 metro station near Fortis Hospital, Sector 62 A-B Block Road, near Mahamaya Flyover at Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, Sector 129 to Sector 155 road, and in front of Spectrum Metro Mall near Sector 50 metro station, among others.During his recent visits to Ghaziabad, Bhure Lal – the chairperson of the Environment (Pollution & Control) Authority (EPCA) – had directed district officials to focus on dust abatement measures and also get road repairs done in order to control PM10 levels during the winter season. “In compliance with the directions, we have identified about 72-78 different road patches across the city which are potholed and need immediate repairs. The list is being provided to the administration to give further directions to different agencies to get the repairs done at the earliest,” Sharma added. Environmentalists, meanwhile, said if the study brings desired results, it should be taken up for all major roads in the city. “The condition of roads is already dilapidated after the monsoon season and road repair works should be taken up before the temperature starts to drop. On the basis of sampling if desired results are obtained, then the winter action plan should also be modified. But first, the results need to be analysed and corrective measures should start immediately to find the effect of the study,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. The deterioration of air quality has already started to show effect in the three cities of the two districts of Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) on October 8, Ghaziabad recorded AQI at 236, Greater Noida at 224 and Noida at 226 - all under the ‘poor’ category.Box: Roads where testing was taken up:Ghaziabad: Outside Vishali metro station, near Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi, Vasundhara sector-16A, sector-4 at Vasundhara, opposite ITS Mohan Nagar, in front of Ajnara Integrity at Raj Nagar Extension, in front of ALT Centre at Kamla Nehru Nagar, opposite to district headquarters, Saur Urja Marg in Maharajpur, in front of Koyal Enclave at Loni-Bhopra Road, Rajendra Nagar Industrial Area, near Haj House, Delhi-Meerut Road, outside Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Park at BS Road Industrial Area, GT Road Industrial Area, NH-9 bypass near Vijay Nagar, outside CISF campus at Indirapuram and outside Kafe Republik in Indirapuram Noida: Sector-62 metro station near Fortis Hospital, sector-62 A-B block road, near Mahamaya Flyover at Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, near Advant IT Park sector-142, sector-129 to sector-155 road, sector-37 to Bhangel road, in front of NSEZ Phase-II Surajpur Road, near Parthala Chowk sector-121 Vikas Marg, in front of Spectrum Metro Mall near sector-50 metro station and sector-16 to 12/22 crossing||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pollution-control-board-collects-samples-to-ascertain-road-dust-levels-in-noida-ghaziabad/story-iAlPJRUDvfw3uQPcK5f1kJ.html
08-10-2020||Noida||Install anti-smog guns at construction sites or face action, UPPCB warns builders||The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) on Thursday warned developers in the city that action will be initiated if construction sites in the city are found running without anti-smog guns.The UPPCB is checking up on construction sites ahead of the onset of the winter season which witnesses a spike in air pollution levels, said officials.Anti-smog guns spray atomised water (tiny droplets of water) up to a height of 50 metres, creating an artificial mist, which is expected to stick to air-borne pollutants and bring them down to the ground. The use of the device helps suppress air-borne particles and dust on road surface.“We will conduct inspection at all sites where construction is ongoing across the city and if found that rules are not being complied with, legal action will be taken,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer for UPPCB, Noida.Following directions from the pollution watchdog, the confederation of real estate developers association of India (Credai) asked all developers to put anti-smog guns to contain air pollution at their respective sites in Noida.The UPPCB in September had reminded developers to put up anti-smog guns at all sites so that air pollution can be mitigated, in a follow up to the directions issued by the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary to make sure developers do not flout orders of the Supreme Court in this regard. The apex court had, in January this year, made it mandatory for developers, government bodies and other agencies to keep in check and mitigate air pollution at construction sites.“The Credai’s western UP wing has sent an advisory to install an anti-smog gun to all its members at their under-construction project sites and most of the members have installed the same. Some builders who could not install them due to issues are expected to do the same before implementation of GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan) in the region,” said Subodh Goel, secretary, Credai, western UP, and CMD, Civitech Group.According to the state government, all construction sites of 20,000 square metres or above need to have antismog gun on their premises to contain air pollution.According to the UPPCB, there are 19 housing projects which are at the stage of construction in Noida, out of which 13 have installed anti-smog guns at their respective sites. “Work at the sites of the remaining six housing projects is currently shut. If they restart construction, they will have to install an anti-smog gun or face penalty,” Kumar added.Apart from these, there are six construction sites of the Noida authority, including an underpass at Sector 71, two underpasses at Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, Bhangel elevated road, Chilla elevated road and Sector 96 administrative building works. “We conducted inspections to ascertain whether anti-smog guns are installed at the sites. All six sites of the authority had installed them,” said Kumar.Residents, however, are not happy with the UPPCB’s claim that several sites have anti-smog guns.“The UPPCB must conduct proper inspection of all big sites in the city as we have not seen anti-smog guns at many sites in Noida,” said PS Jain, president of confederation of NCR residents’ welfare associations (CONRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/install-anti-smog-guns-at-construction-sites-or-face-action-uppcb-warns-builders/story-6EfepTfR0CY8ixVxHrrHEM.html
08-10-2020||Noida||NCR residents worried about power supply as Epca bans diesel gensets from Oct 15||The Supreme Court appointed environment pollution (prevention and control) authority’s (Epca’s) move to ban diesel generator sets in the national capital region (NCR) from October 15 has thrown up concerns from Noida and Ghaziabad residents who have had to suffer frequent outages. With many working from home due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, they often had to depend on diesel generator to ensure uninterrupted supply.“The UP government claims that Noida is a ‘no power cut’ zone. But in reality, every sector witnesses at least an hour’s power cut daily. Without uninterrupted power supply, lifts, wi-fi and other utility services will stop functioning and affect normal life and work,” said Sandeep Chauhan, a resident of sector 74 housing society and who has been working from home since the Covid-19 outbreak. Diesel is a polluting fuel and its ban was recommended, among other measures, to control emissions as winter sets on north Indiam bringing with it weak winds that would be unable to disperse pollutants. The Epca has also recommended dust management at construction sites, compliance of norms on large infra projects, pollution control measures at polluting industrial units, enforcement of norms on hot spots, improvement of waste management, regular cleaning of roads and closure of coal fired power plants.There are 350,000 customers in Noida who get their supply from Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL).  Residents are of the view that the government must take all required steps to contain air pollution but also take adequate steps to supply uninterrupted power during the ban on diesel. “The government never works to strengthen its power supply network and therefore we have to suffer. Why should we depend on gen sets? Only because the power cuts troubled all the time without any prior notice. It is high time that government addressed the issue,” said PS Jain president of confederation of Delhi-NCR RWAs (CONRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs. The PVVNL, meanwhile, said that it was taking adequate steps to ensure uninterrupted supply. “We are on standby to handle any situation that comes about. There is a power cut only when we have to address sudden faults in the supply line. However, we will try our best to supply uninterrupted supply from hereon,” said VN Singh, chief engineer, PVVNL, Noida. In Ghaziabad, residents’ associations said that about 80-90% highrises have diesel generators that supply to apartments, elevators, lighting in common areas, basements, among others. “It will not be feasible for a high-rise to shut down the diesel generators. Connections to flats and common services are combined and the generators start automatically as soon as the power goes off. So, shutting down these generators will be a difficult proposition. Although the electricity situation nowadays has improved, there are still power cuts,” said Alok Kumar, founder-member of federation of association of apartment owners. RK Rana, chief engineer (distribution) from PVVNL did not respond to calls. “We will ensure that the compliance of directions for diesel generator ban is complied with. To ensure that electricity supply is uninterrupted, we will soon hold meeting with electricity department officials and ask them to take measures so that supplies remain uninterrupted. We will also figure out if there are provisions to allow the use of generators in emergency situations,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ncr-residents-worried-about-power-supply-as-epca-bans-diesel-gensets-from-oct-15/story-sHGB2dCqjH15tOZNwkvlHL.html

Fear of the virus is so tangible that I wanted to explore what it means to be incarcerated, to lose the life you are so used to, or to lose a career? How does one create their own affirmations?” Mansingh says.The play, a devised improvisation, also deals with the leitmotif of numbers. “Everyday a bulletin comes out enumerating the infections, recoveries, and deaths. Tomorrow we may become one of the numbers rather than being a person who dreamt, loved, lost, and created, which builds anxiety,” she adds.Ask Mansingh if it was difficult to put up a production amid the pandemic, she says, “This was a new experience. There is no music, which has been an intrinsic part of my works in the past. I have always done ensemble work. But this time, I worked with only one person who does the lights and everything by himself.”The play will be adapted for cinema by Mansingh’s son, Kabir Singh Chowdhry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-has-reduced-us-to-numbers-rather-than-people-who-ve-dreamt-loved-lost-neelam-mansingh-chowdhry/story-inknaQBqs71RcnDL4GeY3N.html

08-10-2020||City||Farmers’ agitation hits fuel supplies to J&K, Ladakh||The farmers’ agitation in Punjab over the controversial farm bills passed by the Centre has led to the ‘fuel crisis’ in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh due to rail service being disrupted.The Union territories could be staring at a fuel crisis as many petrol pumps may go dry in the next couple of days.President of Jammu Kashmir Petroleum Dealers’ Association, Anan Sharma said, “Not a single wagon (freight trains) has arrived at Jammu from Punjab since October 1 due to farmers’ stir as they have blocked rail tracks there and until the blockade is lifted, normal supplies cannot be restored in the UTs.”He said that the major oil depot at Jammu railway station has stopped supplying fuel to gas stations in J&K and Ladakh.Petrol pumps are now sourcing oil from Jalandhar and Bathinda via tankers to maintain the supply line. “Consequently, 250 oil tankers were dispatched to Jalandhar and Bhatinda on Thursday and over 45 tankers, which had left a day before, returned with stocks today, but not with full capacity,” said Sharma.He added that fuel stations were running short of supplies and the situation can become worse if supplies were not restored. The administration should take up the matter with the Punjab government to ensure a smooth supply.“Fuel stocks from Jammu go up to Leh and we all know that in November, roads are blocked due to snow. Secondly, the apple season is at its peak. Around 3,000 trucks are coming to Kashmir from Delhi every day to receive apple consignments. The government has to resolve the issue to restore normal supplies,” he asserted.“Every day 400 oil tankers used to lift supplies from Jammu depot, which is not the case as of today. Though 100 oil tankers from Manali also reached Leh with supplies, an equal number of oil tankers used to transport supplies from Jammu to Leh on a daily basis,” he said.Out of 400 tankers from Jammu depot, 150 tankers used to cater to the Jammu region, 100 to Ladakh, and 150 to Kashmir. However, state-level coordinator of oil companies— HP, BP and Indian Oil—Rajiv Yadav said, “We have mobilised tank lorries from Punjab for the last three days and bringing supplies from Bhatinda, Sangrur and Jalandhar. Some oil tankers reached Jammu on Thursday and some are on their way. There is no fuel crisis in Jammu and Kashmir.”He also claimed that the J&K administration has reached out to the Punjab government to resolve the issue.“Till wagons resume normal supplies, we are relying upon tank lorries. As far as the Ladakh region is concerned, we do winter stock,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-agitation-hits-fuel-supplies-to-j-k-ladakh/story-KbAxUMcmFn9CvyQth6ub1N.html

The state had started intra-state transport in a phased manner in August end. Himachal Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) had been bearing heavy losses after it suspended its bus services in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.“We are fully geared up to resume inter-state bus services and the corporation is waiting for the government’s nod. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all routes were suspended and this has resulted in heavy losses completely ruining the transport business in the region,” said transport minister Bikram Singh Thakur.HRTC will ply buses on 728 routes across the northern states and Union territories including Jammu, Ladakh, Kashmir, Chandigarh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan.The corporation earns nearly Rs 54 lakh per day and its losses have crossed Rs 1300 crores. Last year alone, it bore a loss of Rs 154 crore. HRTC, which has a fleet of 3,719 buses, has already prepared the SOPs for plying inter-state buses. Overcrowding in buses will not be allowed, drivers and conductors will be provided masks and sanitisers, while buses would be sanitised before starting the journey, said Thakur. Tourism industry stakeholders are demanding the government to start the inter-state bus services ahead of the festive season Tourism industry that has borne heavy losses is hoping for good business in the festive season. The stakeholders have urged the government to start rail services on the heritage Shimla-Kalka track. The stakeholders are apprehensive of the railways’ decision to terminate the Howra-Kalka train at Chandigarh instead of Kalka. “The termination of Howra-Kalka train at Chandigarh will hit the Shimla tourism circuit in particular and of the state in general because Shimla is a gateway for tourists coming to Himachal, said MK Seth, president of Himachal Tourism Stakeholders Association.The majority of tourists set on their journey of Himachal from Shimla. Kalka-Howra train is a popular train and contributes a large number of tourist inflow from West Bengal. He said that this is the most convenient train for tourists coming from Bengal because of its direct connectivity up to Shimla by the World Heritage Kalka-Shimla train. During the Durga Puja holidays maximum tourists from West Bengal travel by this train to Shimla.He said that Howra-Kalka mail is running since the Shimla-Kalka rail line came into existence in 1903.Stakeholders have also expressed anguish over the railways’ decision to terminate the Bandra-Kalka train service at Chandigarh from next week. The tourists from West Bengal and Maharashtra contribute a large Inflow of tourists to Himachal.

In the letter, the representatives of HCMSA alleged that Dr Bhagwan was suspended since he had conducted a raid at a CT Scan centre in Kaithal. “MLA Gurjar had pressurised him to refrain from conducting the raid. An FIR was also registered against the owner of the CT scan Centre under the PNDT Act,” the doctors’ body wrote.Gurjar said he did not have anything to do with the raid conducted at the clinic.

He closed the counter of his 32-square-feet porta cabin even though a long queue waited on the pavement facing it. Rajat Gupta, 24, one of the those in the queue, decided not to spend a minute in disappointment. He pulled out his smartphone and started shooting a Facebook live video of himself. He smacked his lips loud and began: “Ah! What a meal it was. You can see, I am outside Baba ka Dhaba…”Baba ka Dhaba – the name of the eatery owned by Prasad and his wife, Badaami Devi – shot into fame over the last 24 hours with a video of Prasad going viral on social media.

We have run out of savings and we are struggling to make ends meet,” said Devi.Thursday’s menu was Rice, chapatti, dal, rajma (kidney beans), muttar-paneer (fresh cottage cheese cooked with peas) and parathas stuffed with mashed potatoes and onions. Each food item costs anything between Rs 20 and Rs 50. Prasad said that he cooked a slightly larger quantity than usual. He cooked 2 kg paneer on Thursday against 1 kg on usual days. For most dishes, the quantity cooked was doubled, said the couple’s son, Azad Hind, who helps them.By 12 noon, a crowd of around 60-70 people gathered outside the small shop. All of them wore face masks and jostled for space. Officers from the local police station periodically did rounds just to remind people to adhere to social distancing norms.“It was unprecedented,” said Prasad, as he wiped his tears once again.The people in the crowd ranged from college students to young office goers, businessmen, workers in the nearby markets and the local legislator.“I came to know about this place through social media.

They said that they moved to the present location and started the eatery around 30 years ago.“We have a small shop. On any regular day, we hardly sell around 20 plates of each food item... between 9 am and 3 pm. The number of plates sold per item dropped to below 5 since we reopened the shop in June after two months of [Covid-19] lockdown. We often had to take back food...and eat it ourselves or occasionally distribute among neighbours... Today was a blessing,” said Hind.Around 12.30 pm on Thursday, the food was over. For the next few hours, Prasad and Devi opened a small window in their porta-cabin as they entertained photographers and journalists, who interviewed them.

Medical oxygen is important in the treatment of critically ill Covid-19 patients.“The state’s struggle for oxygen will now be a thing of the past. After the installation of HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula), the demand of oxygen had shot up in the Covid-19 hospitals in the state. The new facility will bridge the gap between demand and supply and it is heartening that such a facility is ready during the trying times of the pandemic, when it is needed the most,” said the chief minister, according to a state government press statement.The chief minister expressed happiness that the company would now set up another plant in central UP and more such plants would come up to eliminate the oxygen supply problem.Also Read: 75% new Covid-19 recoveries, 79% positive cases from 10 states each, says health ministryCommissioned by Inox Air Products, one of the largest producers of medical and industrial gases, the plant has the capacity to produce 150 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day. The plant was set up as part of an MoU (memorandum of understanding) signed between the UP government and the company during the UP Investors’ Summit 2018 in February 2018 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the plant’s foundation in July the same year, according to a state government press statement. The plant also has the capacity to store 1,000 metric tonnes of oxygen. It will supply oxygen to 200 government and private hospitals in the state.Apart from medical purposes, oxygen from the plant could also be utilised in industries such as pharma, chemical, and electronics.Uttar Pradesh’s industrial development minister Satish Mahana, health minister Jai Pratap Singh and medical education minister Suresh Khanna too were present at the inauguration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/chief-minister-yogi-adityanath-inaugurates-uttar-pradesh-s-biggest-oxygen-plant/story-y2MlqgucqMYbSRydVSFNFK.html

08-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai police probes Republic TV for TRP fraud, Arnab Goswami hits back||Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh on Thursday claimed to have busted a racket that involved private television channels manipulating their Television Rating Points, or TRP. One of the three channels is Republic TV, the police commissioner said. The other two are local Mumbai channels.Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami responded soon after, linking the police action to the channel’s coverage of certain events including the police probe into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and threatened to file a criminal defamation against the police commissioner. “He should issue an official apology and get ready to face us in court,” Goswami said.The police action was initiated on a complaint from Hansa, the firm contracted by Broadcast Audience Research Council, or BARC, to install audience measurement meters installed in selected households to track television channels that are being watched by people. Singh said about 30,000 such meters had been installed across the country; 2,000 in Mumbai. Information about the households where the meters are installed is treated as confidential so that the data isn’t manipulated.But this information was leaked, police said.Singh said the Mumbai police found that a set of households where these meters were installed were paid money to tune to a particular channel. In one case, Mumbai’s top police officer said, investigators found that a household comprising people who were not literate always had an English news channel switched on.The households were paid about Rs 400-500 every month, the police commissioner said.Singh said owners of two local channels had been arrested along with an ex-employee of Hansa suspected of leaking the information about meters installed to the television channels.Republic TV is next on the police’s radar. Officials of the news channels will be summoned either today or tomorrow, Singh said. “No one involved will be spared,” the senior police officer said, recalling that they earlier believed that some news channels carried out propaganda stories to boost their TRP. Now it appears they manipulate audience data too, he said.Singh said a small manipulation of the audience data could lead to increase in advertising revenue running into crores of rupees.“As you are aware, a small manipulation of the TRP translates into advertising revenue running into hundreds of crores... “We will examine bank accounts of the television channels. We will examine the funds received from advertisers. And if this is funds from proceeds of crime, action can be initiated to seize the money or freeze the account,” Singh said.In a statement issued soon after, Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami said it was an attempt to get back at the channel for its coverage of the Maharashtra government. Republic Media Network's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami's statement pic.twitter.com/axhbJZ47eAArnab Goswami’s statement put out on the channel’s Twitter handle said Singh had “made false allegations against Republic TV because we have questioned him in the Sushant Singh Rajput case investigation. Republic TV will file a criminal defamation case against Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. There is not a single BARC report that mentions Republic TV. The people of India know the truth”.“Mr Param Bir Singh’s investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput case is under a cloud and this is a desperate measure because of Republic tV’s reportage on Palghar, the Sushant Singh Rajput case or any other case. This kind of targeting only strengthens the resolve of everyone at Republic TV to push for the truth even harder,” Goswami said, threatening to sue the police commissioner.“Param Bir Singh stands completely exposed today since BARC has not mentioned Republic in any single complaint,” the statement said.Earlier this year, the police had investigated complaints that Republic TV’s editor-in-chief and prime time anchor Arnab Goswami allegedly instigating hatred against the Muslim community while anchoring a programme on April 29 on the protests by stranded migrants outside the Bandra railway station on April 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-busts-racket-to-manipulate-trp-rating-says-republic-tv-among-3-channels-being-investigated/story-SDaVA2MeStP5z3lJ8nJi7I.html
08-10-2020||Pune||Bhima Koregaon judicial panel requests state to put hearings on hold due to Covid||The Bhima Koregaon judicial commission has written to the chief secretary, government of Maharashtra, requesting the state government to put the extension notification on hold at least till the end of the year due to the aggravating Covid-19 situation in the state.The Maharashtra home department had granted the final extension to the commission to complete its task and submit its report before December 31. It is the seventh extension granted to the two-member commission probing the January 1, 2018, riots at Bhima Koregaon near Pune. The previous extension ended on April 8 when the Centre had announced a nationwide lockdown, bringing the commission’s work to standstill.Commission secretary V V Palnitkar in his letter dated October 6 stated, “Covid-19 pandemic is very much active even today. Thousands of new patients and hundreds of deaths are still being reported every day. Safety measures like use of mask, social distancing and sanitisation are mandatory. There are restrictions on travel in local trains. Travel by other modes of public transport is not safe. Also, most of the staff members of the commission stay out of Mumbai in places like Virar and Navi Mumbai. Staff members of the commission are not treated as government employees. They have not been given regular government IDs. Therefore, they are not allowed to travel by local trains. Some of the staff members are senior citizens and have history of comorbity. Witnesses and advocates may also find it unsafe to travel during this pandemic. The overall situation makes it very difficult to hold sittings without risking life of the concerned people.”“Although the commission is willing to resume its functioning, it is facing the challenges mentioned above. Therefore, the commission requests the government to put the notification dated October 5, 2020, on hold at least till the end of this year ,” he added.The commission also said that it was still waiting for the government to reply to its request seeking additional space for sittings in Mumbai . The communication states, “In anticipation of extension of term of the commission and in view of the safety directions issued by the government about social distancing; the commission vide its letter dated July 7, 2020, informed the government of its difficulties in holding sittings in the small-sized hearing hall situated at the premises of the State Chief Information Commission (SCIC) and requested the government to provide an auditorium and two suites from Sahyadri Guest House and one suite in the Sahyadri annex building so that office of the commission could be shifted temporarily. The commission is waiting for reply. However, the commission has received copy of notification dated October 5, stating that the commission should submit its report by December 31, 2020,” the letter added.“It has become difficult for advocates and witnesses to attend the hearing due to the fear of infection. The staff members have also expressed their fears about contracting the virus. The commission does not want them to come to office in such a situation and moreover, they are not government employees. Earlier, we had to postpone hearings during the lockdown and now the situation has aggravated further. We are finding it very difficult to conduct the hearings. We will have to think about the safety measures,” said Palnitkar.The two-member Bhima Koregaon inquiry commission, headed by retired Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, Jay Narayan Patel, also includes former chief secretary and the present chief information officer of Maharashtra, Sumit Mullick as its member. VV Palnitkar is serving as the registrar of the commission. The commission functions with the powers of a civil court in two locations: the Public Information Office at Madam Cama road, Mumbai and the Zilla Parishad building in Bund garden, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bhima-koregaon-judicial-panel-requests-state-to-put-hearings-on-hold-due-to-covid/story-9xo72RllvpQcjPabNBlC7H.html
08-10-2020||Pune||Four, including shooter, arrested for murder of Pune builder||The Bund garden police have arrested four persons in connection with the daylight assassination of builder Rajesh Kanbar (64), near the district collector’s office on Monday. According to the police, the murder was a fallout of a property dispute and four persons, which includes a history-sheeter from Junagadh, Gujarat, have been nabbed in connection with the incident. The accused have been identified as Rahul Ananda Kamble, Rupesh Ananda Kamble, Ganesh Dnyaneshwar Karhe and Hasmukh Jaswantbhai Patel, who is accused of firing the pistol shots. Patel has four cases of murder, kidnapping, dacoity preparations and hurt offences lodged against him in the city. The murder case was lodged against him at Bund garden police station in 2011 while a dacoity related case was lodged against him at Bibvewadi police station in 2015. An extortion related case was lodged against him at Sinhagad police station in 2015. Kanbar who had come to attend a hearing at the district collectorate was leaving for his home when two motorcycle-riding men arrived at the spot and pumped bullets into Kanbar and escaped. He was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared dead. A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 3(25) of the Arms Act was later registered at Bund garden police station. The complaint in the murder case was lodged by the driver Vishwas Gangawane (32), a resident of Yerawada who saw the live shooting while he was waiting for Kanbar to return to the car. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said “We have arrested the accused quickly based on our information and technical strength. We will show more such results and not speak before we do something. Our main focus will be to go all out against crime and currently we are on a mission mode to act against criminals in the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/four-including-shooter-arrested-for-murder-of-pune-builder/story-Imhr6YCqGQaL4jthymEJLO.html
08-10-2020||Kolkata||In a first, scientists discover 2.5 million-year-old dragonfly fossil in India||A team of scientists from West Bengal has discovered the first dragonfly fossil in India from Jharkhand’s Latehar district. The fossil is at least 2.5 million years old. A paper on the finding was published in the October 10 edition of Current Science journal.“This is the first dragonfly fossil from India. It is a well-preserved one. The fossil belongs to the late Neogene period, which dates between 2.5 million and five million years ago,” said Subir Bera, a professor with the Centre for Advanced Study of the Botany department, University of Calcutta. The dragonfly is around 3cm long and has a wingspan of around 2.5cm. This is, however, much smaller than the fossils of giant dragonflies, which have been found elsewhere in the world. Experts said that the wingspan of one of the giant dragonflies Meganeuropsis permiana measured around 2.5 feet. It dates back to the Permian era, around 300 million years ago. In 2013, a giant, well-preserved dragonfly fossil, dating back 200 million years, was discovered in China. Also Read: Urban air pollution may make Covid-19 more deadly, says studyResearchers from four universities in West Bengal have been looking for fossils in the sediments of Chotanagpur plateau for almost a year. In January 2020, they dug the dragonfly fossil from a depth of around 5m below the soil surface. The team has also found fossils of various insects, fishes and leaves of some flowering plants. The research was headed by Mahasin Ali Khan, assistant professor of Botany at Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University. “The nearest living member of the fossil is Libellula depressa, a species of dragonfly that is found in any tropical country, including India,” said Manoshi Hazra, one of the team members and the first author of the research paper, which has been published in Current Science. As dragonflies spend most of their lives near fresh water bodies, the scientists said that millions of years ago a freshwater body might have existed there, which has now dried up. The other fossils of plants and fishes, which the scientists have found, also support the theory. “The very fact that the team has found the fossil of an adult dragonfly from the sedimentary bed is very interesting. Usually the prospect of finding an immature dragonfly from the sedimentary bed is huge because dragonfly-larvae live underwater. The prospect of finding insect fossils from sedimentary beds and coal beds is huge, but unfortunately little work has been done in India in this regard,” said TK Pal, a former scientist of the Zoological Survey of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/in-a-first-scientists-discover-2-5-million-year-old-dragonfly-fossil-in-india/story-C8zFc4iW2ikqJsuXkhmrcJ.html

The QDA, which is based on satellite communication, helps authorities to reach out to people or officials in no signal areas and send and receive voice and video data apart from holding video conferencing. The QDA technology was inaugurated by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in Dehradun at SDRF control room on Thursday. The state government has already distributed 248 satellite phones to people living in the remote areas of the state so that timely communication is possible with authorities involved in dealing with disasters and emergencies even without mobile connectivity. To further strengthen the emergency communication set up, the SDRF has now acquired the QDA technology. SDRF commandant Tripti Bhatt said Uttarakhand is the first state in the country which has started using QDA, which till now, was being used primarily by paramilitary forces and the national disaster response force (NDRF). Bhatt said the SDRF has procured six QDA systems including three standing and three mobile ones.“The static (standing) QDAs will be set up at SDRF headquarters in Dehradun while mobile QDAs would be sent to the affected areas by a helicopter, so that communication regarding the disaster rescue and search and other emergencies could be established in a very fast way. This will help in effectively managing rescue and search operations in real-time and will help the authorities in reducing casualties due to various disasters”, she said. Sanjay Gunjyal, inspector general (IG) SDRF and Tripti Bhatt, SDRF commandant, first conducted a trial of QDA systems by establishing communication between SDRF control room Dehradun and Gunji area in Pithoragarh, Malari area in Chamoli and Tiuni area in Dehradun district. After the successful trial, the QDA technology was inaugurated by the chief minister, who interacted with the village heads and others in these areas using the system. After the inauguration, Rawat said the new technology will help the state government in effectively dealing with various disasters and emergencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-gets-system-to-communicate-with-remote-areas-can-save-lives-in-crises/story-yAfAuXrWudhOR3aWi7cfqN.html

I am hoping that PMC generates a Rs 1,000 crore revenue through the scheme. During Covid-19 period if the PMC would get these funds, it would help to carry out the planned development works.” According to Kanade, for any scheme, the maximum payments are received when the due date approaches. “It is our experience that maximum citizens take benefit or pay bills when the due date comes closer. The PMC launched this scheme on October 2nd, we are hoping that in the next few weeks, PMC will receive a maximum collection through this scheme.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-collects-rs-5-31-cr-in-property-tax-under-amnesty-scheme/story-WZtcX99ZHbVMeGUa0po57J.html
08-10-2020||Pune||5km stretch from Katraj to Navale bridge in Pune, a hotspot for accidents||The 5-kilometre stretch from Katraj to Navale bridge has turned out to be an accident-prone spot with eight accidents and five deaths in the past 16 months, according to data available with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station, Dhankawadi. Of the many issues that the stretch faces, the four major shortcomings include vehicles on the wrong side of the road, hawkers selling vegetables occupying a portion of the road, incomplete road widening work and potholes. On Tuesday, one person was killed and eight others were injured, after an out of control truck rammed into 13 vehicles and ran over a motorcyclist. “People drive carelessly, especially the youth. There is an urgent need for increasing signal timing below Navle bridge and more blinkers should be placed to safeguard people,” said Mohan Deshmukh who is part of the accident department at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. After a spot visit by an HT reporter, it was noticed that commuters were carelessly using the wrong side of the road which included two-wheelers, auto rickshaws and also four-wheelers. “It is a daily routine as there are many small lanes passing from both the ends so people tend to put their vehicle in between. Yesterday’s accident was dangerous, I saw how truck rammed the vehicles,” said Suhas Yadav, a paan shop owner at a nearby complex. Overspeeding vehicles and potholes also contribute to the hazards in the stretch from Katraj to Navale bridge. “Since it is a slope, commuters do not follow the speed limit. With many potholes on the stretch, people try to skip the pothole by tilting their vehicles which creates an error of judgement for vehicles coming from the rear side and causes accidents,” added Deshmukh. On the entire stretch, there are no CCTV cameras installed to keep track of speeding vehicles. “CCTV cameras are must on roads, especially on highways. The footage is helpful while conducting an investigation,” added Deshmukh. Nitin Gadkari, union minister for road transport and highways, in February 2019, had approved the road widening project to ease the traffic on Wadgaon-Katraj stretch of Dehu road-Katraj bypass. The contract was awarded to All Grace Infrastructure, Gurugram.Rs 96 crore was sanctioned for the 5-km stretch. Once ready, the six-lane lane road will have paved shoulders and 7-metre wide service road on both sides of the stretch. The Central PWD has prescribed that the entire width of the stretch has to be 60 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/5km-stretch-from-katraj-to-navale-bridge-in-pune-a-hotspot-for-accidents/story-AmViRMQH1EHSvTYeNDz3xH.html

The NGT Western Zone bench at Pune took offence to the authority repeatedly seeking more time while the appeal was being heard, thus allowing the structures to remain standing. “The (CRZ) Notification issued in 1991 has not been complied with till date and with the conspiracy aid and assistance of Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), the polluters and violators of law are still continuing their activities,” an NGT bench comprising justices Sheo Kumar Singh and Satyawan Singh Garbyal said. Also Read: Mumbai records most environmental offences among major cities for second consecutive year“When the law protector becomes the law violator, how will the law be protected? “Under the guise of this pending appeal, the GCZMA promotes only the appeal, fails to submit the reply and [is] continuously delaying in filing a reply and thus indirectly helping the illegal construction and this has become the business of GCZMA. In so many cases, we see that old cases are pending and no action is being taken by the GCZMA and replies are not being filed. This is highly objectionable and in violation of CRZ Rules,” the NGT added. The NGT also warned government servants in positions of power that they would be doing a huge disservice to society at large if they only further feelings of helplessness among the public. “Under our Constitution sovereignty vests in the people. Every limb of the constitutional machinery is obliged to be people oriented. The servants of the government are also the servants of the people and the use of their power must always be subordinate to their duty of service.“Harassment of the common man by public authorities is socially abhorring and legally impermissible. It may harm him (the common man) personally but the injury to society is far more grievous. Crime and corruption thrive and prosper in the society due to lack of public resistance. Nothing is more damaging than the feeling of helplessness. An ordinary citizen instead of complaining and fighting succumbs to the pressure of undesirable functioning in offices instead of standing against it,” the NGT bench said. The parties were given additional time to file their replies while the matter was transferred to the principal bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nothing-more-damaging-than-feeling-helpless-ngt-warns-goa-agency-against-violations/story-W8ufh0M5M3QmDAeMuy1nrL.html

In the pre-Covid-19 quarter (January to March), the number of housing units sold were 15,959.The MMR includes Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane as well as parts of Palghar and Raigad districts.Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director (research), Knight Frank India, described it as an encouraging trend. “The recent cut of stamp duty by 3 percent has been a big motivation for many of the buyers. In addition, the low interest rates on home loans plus the freebies and discounts offered by the builders have all resulted in increase in sales,” said Sinha.She said, looking at the current trend, the sales may further be boosted during the forthcoming festival season of Diwali.The Maharashtra government on August 26 decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty from 5% to 2% till December 31, 2020. After that the Stamp duty from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021, will be 3 percent. Also Read: Housing prices fall 2-7% in July-September in 6 top citiesThe last three months also saw 8,389 new launches which were a significant improvement compared to the 1,011 launches during the period of April to June, 2020.“Builders are getting the confidence as sales are taking place and are hence launching new projects. The construction work is now progressing since the migrant force is coming back to work,” said Sinha.Also Read: Asian markets rise banking on hopes for post-election stimulus in USThe Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI), the apex body of the builders, concurred with the report. “We are seeing the fence sitters taking a plunge as they realise this is the best time to buy a property as they are getting the best deal in the current market,” said Deepak Garodia, president, MCHI-CREDAI and also the managing director of Dosti Group.The real estate sector was already witnessing a slowdown when the situation worsened with the lockdown, imposed to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.

08-10-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: BJP workers clash with police during march to state secretariat; pistol seized||Hundreds of workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its youth wing, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), clashed with police on Thursday afternoon when they were stopped from proceeding towards Nabanna, the state secretariat in West Bengal’s Howrah district, as it was in violation of the prohibitory orders in place.The BJYM had organised ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (March to Nabanna) in protest against issues ranging from alleged lack of employment opportunities in Bengal to law and order problems. However, the government did not give permission for the agitation. Also, Section 144 of CrPC is imposed in and around Nabanna throughout the year. Also read: Bengal govt cites Shaheen Bagh ruling, Covid to stop BJP’s ‘Nabanna March’Around 2 pm, there was chaos on the streets in parts of central Kolkata and Howrah as BJP and BJYM workers clashed with the police. They hurled brickbats; bombs also went off at two locations in Howrah district although it was not clear who hurled them. In Kolkata, police used water cannons, using a purple dye for the first time to mark the agitators, and resorted to baton charge at Howrah bridge, Hastings, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Burrabazar and Brabourne Road. A pistol was also seized from a BJP worker in Howrah. BJYM national president and Lok Sabha MP from Bengaluru, Tejasvi Surya, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh and other senior leaders were present with the first batch of BJP workers that clashed with the police around noon. Ghosh alleged that Menon sustained injury in a stampede-like situation near the state BJP headquarters on Central Avenue. BJP state vice-president Raju Banerjee fell ill after he was hit by a cannon jet at Hastings. Vijayvargiya and BJP Lok Sabha member Locket Chatterjee started a sit-in demonstration at Hastings, alleging atrocity by the police. “Police attacked peaceful demonstrators. Stones were pelted on us by some people who were definitely not policemen,” alleged Chatterjee. Surya, who was in Howrah with state BJYM president Soumitra Khan, addressed the gathering before the march. “The youth of India are with you...The Mamata Banerjee government has failed to meet the aspirations of millions of youths. They do not have jobs. You must raise your voice against the misrule West Bengal is witnessing,” said Surya.The Trinamool Congress also took out a procession from Jadavpur University to Golpark in south Kolkata to counter the BJP, accusing the latter of creating unrest in the state. An Indian ordnance factory-made .32 pistol was seized from a BJP worker in the Howrah Maidan area. The man has been detained. While seeking permission for the march, the BJYM had informed the government on Wednesday that each of the four rallies would have around 25,000 people. In reply to the BJYM, the home department cited an order of the Centre which banned gathering of over 100 people. It said the government would allow the BJYM to hold peaceful and democratic rallies at places where prohibitory orders were not violated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-bjp-workers-clash-with-police-during-march-to-state-secretariat-pistol-seized/story-sbcbu49InkpOWXTr9IMb3I.html

08-10-2020||Delhi||World Post Day: Braving pandemic, postal workers emerge as Covid-19 warriors||In sunshine and in rain, the postal workers brace the weather and numerous other hurdles to deliver letters all year round. Amid the pandemic when life suddenly became locked down, the postal service personnels donned various hats, helping everyone fight back the disease. Right from the distribution of testing kits to delivery of medicines and money, postal employees in India have been providing these all, emerging as corona warriors who continued to work in the face of adverse conditions. On World Post Day (October 9) and National Postal Day of India (October 10), here’s bringing you action from behind the post counters. “We restarted our operations in April, with staggered timings and shifts, so that the transport of letters, urgent medicines was not hampered,” says Ashok Kumar, assistant superintendent of postal services in Chanakyapuri Post Office. Kumar, who has been a postal department employee for almost four decades, adds, “We made arrangements for safety equipment for all our employees, including gloves, masks, sanitisers. People worked in shifts; if extra work was needed to dispatch packages, we put in more time.” The postal staff has also been delivering cash to people, in need, when the latter have been unable to access banks due to the pandemic. To accomplish providing money to people at their doorsteps, some like Delhi-based postman Narendra Kumar RC have been working without any leaves, all this while. “Apart from regular deliveries, I also tried to immediately reach people when they would make a request for money at the post office. Iss time pe kisi ko zarurat hai, toh hum chhuti toh nahi le sakte na,” says Kumar, who has been a postman for 34 years. His memory goes back to the time when he joined the profession to see people happy when they receive their letters, and he adds, “In my locality, there were people who asked me to help them with money from the post office, and I did it. Humne ye job logon ki madad karne ke liye li thi, toh yeh toh humara farz hai.” Lakhs of postal workers around the country, like Kumar, have been instrumental in keeping the postal services running during these difficult times. Vijay Kumar, who works at RK Puram main post office, describes how delivery of medicines has taken priority over the time. “Usually, once we receive packages we take time to set them in order citywise, for cumulative dispatch. But, during the time of Covid-19, we have started making instant dispatches of medicines pan India,” he says. When asked if he became concerned about his personal safety at any point, Kumar says, “Of course, there was a fear! But, we took all precautions, worked over time, and sometimes even with just 50% personnel capacity, so that the work doesn’t suffer.” Isn’t that the spirit of being a warrior?Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/world-post-day-braving-pandemic-postal-workers-emerge-as-covid-19-warriors/story-L4iwgeu7M1xhvoKXPZWmFP.html

08-10-2020||Kolkata||Durga Puja celebrations set to be low-key in Kolkata amid Covid crisis||Keeping in mind the risks of Covid-19, big-budget Durga Puja committees in Kolkata have decided not to celebrate the festival in a grand manner. “This year, due to Covid-19, there is a lot of uncertainty about how many people will come out for the festival and maintaining social distancing and sanitisation on such a large scale will be very difficult. This is why members of big-budget puja committees have decided against celebrating in a grand manner. The demand for power supply will be less due to this,” West Bengal Power Minister Sovandeb Chatterjee told ANI.He further said that there was a surplus of power, and without demand from major puja committees, losses would continue. “Every year before Durga Puja, we hold a meeting to evaluate how much electricity usage will be required. Already due to the Covid-19 situation, we are running at a loss of Rs 2,500 crore. The power department is ready to provide electricity and have a surplus, but since pujas will not be taking place on a large scale, there is no foreseeable solution. Lightning arrangements and decorations will not be as elaborate as the previous years so there won’t be an increase in demand,” Chatterjee said.Earlier in September, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that organising cultural programmes at pandals won’t be allowed during the festival.“During Durga Puja, a pandal needs to be open from all four sides. Hand sanitisers should be placed at entry points of pandals, and the wearing of masks to be mandatory. Physical distancing needs to be maintained. Organising cultural programmes at pandals won’t be allowed,” Mamata said.This year, Durga Puja be celebrated from October 23 to October 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/durga-puja-celebrations-set-to-be-low-key-in-kolkata-amid-covid-crisis/story-my5htGhm0wvjisB0lPMYEL.html

In the memorandum submitted to Mishra, the BJP alleged that there has been an unprecedented increase in crime against women, Dalits, tribals and common people in the last 20 months—when chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s government has been in office.A total of 4.35 lakh cases have been registered in Rajasthan from December 2018 to August 2020, including 11,200 cases of rape, molestation, eve teasing etc. The figures of the national crime record bureau, 2019 reveals that 7% of the country’s crime cases are from Rajasthan. The state stands second in crime against women. There has been an increase in crime by 49.10% in 2019 compared to 2018. “The state stands first in crimes related to rape, as country’s 18.72% crime happens here, which is unfortunate. It is shameful that the state is on top in cases of rape against girl above 12 and below 18 years. Rajasthan is second in crimes against Dalits with 14.81% of the country’s total cases.” Also Read: Post Hathras, UP to set up data analytics centre to identify crime against women hot spotsKataria was accompanied by deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore, state BJP chief Satish Poonia and others.The delegation mentioned the recent incidents of crimes against women such as rape in Banswara, Sirohi, Bharatpur, Dholpur etc to support their point.“The chief minister is also the home minister but is silent on such incidents. The state is embarrassed with such cases and people are living in fear. Congress has no moral right to be in the government,” said Kataria.Also Read: Victim’s family alleges illegal confinement at Hathras home, approaches HCThe institutions such as the women commission and the SC commission, which have powers, are lying vacant, he said. Congress leader Archana Sharma responded to the charges by alleging that the BJP was levelling baseless allegations to hide their own failures across the country. She further stated that the state government was committed towards the welfare of the masses, especially women and Dalits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/bjp-dubs-rajasthan-as-hub-of-crime-against-women-in-offensive-against-gehlot/story-UL2rPWGPcKSiWRCPuhX7oL.html

08-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sets up Chandrapur human-tiger conflict resolution study group; report by Dec 31||Taking cognisance of the rising human-tiger conflict in Chandrapur, the Maharashtra government has set up an 11-member committee to look into options for conservation, relocation of tigers, and suggest measures to reduce conflict.Forest minister Sanjay Rathod said the committee will submit its report by December 31 and a government resolution on its formation would be published on Thursday.Also read: 1,300 wild animals killed by electrocution in India over a decade, says report“Since Chandrapur has the highest number of tigers in the state, the number of conflict cases has increased. As directed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, this committee will assess different aspects associated with this conflict such as suspected problem areas...views and suggestions from locals, previous cases and actions taken... [the panel will conduct] in-depth study on the rise in cases this year,” said Rathod.Chandrapur’s chief conservator of forest, NR Praveen, will head the panel.Milind Mhaiskar, principal secretary (forest), called the formation of the committee a very important decision. He said striking a correct balance for tiger density is crucial for the entire landscape, and especially in the context of reducing human-wildlife conflict. “Final decisions based on this study also have the potential to enrich other areas in Maharashtra with an increase in the tiger population.”The toll from the human-tiger conflict in Maharashtra mounted to 32 this year when a 70-year-old man was killed in Chandrapur on Monday. Of these, 27 deaths have been reported from Chandrapur alone, according to the forest department. Three tigers have been captured from the district this year, and operations are underway to capture a male tiger (RT1) blamed for killing the 70-year-old. RT1 has also attacked 11 people while evading efforts to tranquilise it since February this year.In May, the forest department submitted a proposal to the government suggesting the translocation of 50 tigers from Chandrapur to areas with low tiger density. It also proposed sterilisation of male tigers. On August 8, Thackeray directed the formation of the panel while turning down the idea for sterilisation.“With coordination among different state departments, awareness drives at villages and developing a protocol with villagers for reporting tiger movement, the forest department has taken a lead in addressing conflict cases in a meticulous manner in Chandrapur by ensuring the safety of both human and tiger lives,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). “The committee’s suggestions will help develop specific strategies and remedies for addressing this issue.”A National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India (Dehradun) study on the status of tigers in 2018-19 found Chandrapur to be the region with maximum human-tiger conflict.Of its 11,443 sq km area, forest areas are spread across 5,206 sq km in Chandrapur.Between 2002 and 2014, 63 deaths were reported due to tiger attacks, according to forest department data. As many as 84 deaths were reported between 2016 and 2020.The tiger population in Maharashtra has increased from 103 in 2006 to 168 in 2010, 190 in 2014 and 312 now. Chandrapur is home to 175 of the 312 tigers.“This year, we have had a difficult time with a very high number of tiger kills,” said Praveen. “Rise in conflict maybe because Chandrapur has more than 50% of total tigers in Maharashtra in one district while at the same time almost 45% of the total geographical area is under forest cover with fragmented forest patches interspersed with the agricultural landscape. There is a high tiger dispersal rate into agricultural areas while large numbers of people are dependent on farming as their mainstay. The clash leads to conflict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sets-up-chandrapur-human-tiger-conflict-resolution-study-group-report-by-dec-31/story-StlilS7jY12LqkgqhiecBJ.html

The Women Power Line 1090 is a 24x7 contact centre in Lucknow that women can call to register complaints against eve-teasing.At the centre, to be established under the ‘safe city’ project, data would be collected and analysed to identify areas more prone to crime against women, officials said. Also Read: Victim’s family alleges illegal confinement at Hathras home, approaches HCAdditional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said the data analytics centre would collect the data regarding crime against women from various sources. “The data, collected from different sources, would be analysed to identify the areas where the women were harassed. The areas from where maximum cases are reported would be marked as hot spots. The district police and anti-Romeo squads would be activated to check crime against women,” he said. Soon after coming to power in the state in 2017, the Yogi Adityanath government had instituted a policy to check stalkers and eve-teasers in Uttar Pradesh by constituting groups of volunteers called anti-Romeo squads. However, there are several reports of self-appointed vigilantes who harass couples in the name of protecting women.According to Awasthi, the cyber cell of the Women Power Line 1090 would be strengthened for quick disposal of cases, using cyber forensic tools. To check the cases of stalking, the Women Power Line had been integrated with the UP-112 line so that police could be immediately dispatched to take action against anti- social elements. “An SMS alert would be sent to the police officer posted in the area and feedback about police action would be collected from the victim,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/post-hathras-up-to-set-up-data-analytics-centre-to-identify-crime-against-women-hot-spots/story-KG8QoyvZGRSEhtwlPNAsyO.html
08-10-2020||Kolkata||Bengal govt cites Shaheen Bagh ruling, Covid to stop BJP’s ‘Nabanna March’||Hours after the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in reference to the blockade against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at south Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh that right to protest in public places is not absolute and public places cannot be occupied indefinitely, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government cited the same order to dissuade the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from holding a mega protest outside Nabanna, the state secretariat in Howrah district, on Thursday. The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the BJP, has organised the ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (march to Nabanna) programme to raise its voice on issues ranging from an alleged lack of employment opportunities in Bengal to law and order problems. Top BJP and BJYM leaders are to lead four processions from different locations in Kolkata and Howrah to Nabanna on Thursday. The BJYM informed the government that each of these rallies will have around 25,000 youths. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court highlighted the troubles faced by the general public due to the road blockade at Shaheen Bagh by protestors who were opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and ruled that dissent and democracy go hand in hand but protests must be carried out in designated areas. The Shaheen Bagh blockade started in December 2019 and continued till March 2020. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee supported the movement and she still opposes the new citizenship law and the National Population Register (NPR) in public, saying these will trigger social and religious discrimination. A Shaheen Bagh-like agitation was held in Kolkata as well earlier this year. The SC order also asked authorities to ensure that public places were free of occupation by protestors. “Occupation of public places for protests is not acceptable. Authorities must ensure removal of occupation of public places,” the bench held on Wednesday. However, the manner in which occupants should be removed to clear public places is to be decided by government authorities and they should not hide behind or wait for court orders in order to carry out their functions, the court added. Hours later, the West Bengal home department, while replying to a letter from the state BJYM, cited the same ruling, saying it was duty-bound to follow it.“You are probably aware that, only a few hours back, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has given a judgement in Civil Appeal No 3282/2020 wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court has held certain principles regarding protest and occupation of sites and public places and public ways. You will kindly appreciate that we are duty-bound to comply with the solemn order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India,” said the letter sent by the special secretary of the home department to the BJYM. HT has seen the letter. In a parallel development, the state government declared that all offices in Nabanna will remain closed for two days so that they can be sanitised. In its bid to discourage BJYM’s ‘Nabanna March’, the state home department also cited the prohibition on large political gathering as per the latest Central guidelines issued to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read: ‘Inspect tyres’: Mamata Banerjee amid concerns trucks are Covid carriers“You are also probably aware that the Government of India, on the strength of the National Disaster Management Act, has issued guidelines banning gatherings and political rallies having more than 100 people in view of the current Covid-19 pandemic. It seems that your protest march is in clear violation of this disaster guideline of the Government of India. Indeed, you have categorically mentioned that each of your rallies will have around 25,000 youths,” said the home department’s letter. “You are probably also aware that Section 144 CrPC is in force in and around Nabanna,” said the letter, adding that the government would help the BJYM hold peaceful and democratic rallies at places where prohibitory orders under Section 144 are not violated. Also Read: Third man arrested in Bengal BJP leader’s murder caseReacting to Wednesday’s order of the Supreme Court on the Shaheen Bagh blockade, Bengal’s deputy health minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said, “The order is applicable to the BJP which blocks roads and holds agitations, causing inconvenience to people.” BJYM leaders said that no matter what the government said they would go ahead with the agitation as planned. “It seems the TMC already knows that its days are numbered. That is why it is emptying Nabanna. Our programme will be held peacefully as planned,” Bengal BJP president Ghosh told the media on Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-govt-sites-shaheen-bagh-ruling-covid-to-stop-bjp-s-nabanna-march/story-U3YZlXmP2jajwysCg5hP2O.html

At the same time, the home department constituted a team of officials including two superintendents of police to assist the EOW in its probe. “A letter from the director general of EOW has stated that the high court has issued a directive to institute an inquiry into charges against trustees of Khasgi (Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Charities) Trust regarding misappropriation, illegal construction and illegal sale of government land. In this regard a preliminary enquiry has been registered,” said an official release. As per the communiqué, a committee of police officers has been formed in view of the magnitude of the inquiry and importance of the case to assist the EOW in its probe. The team members include superintendent of police of police training college in Indore, Awdhesh Goswami, superintendent of police of the anti-terrorism squad, Ramji Shrivastava, additional superintendent of police of the cyber cell in Indore, Vaibhav Shrivastava, inspectors of police, Gopal Parmar, Santosh Singh Yadav, Vinod Dixit, Narendra Raghuvanshi and Manju Yadav and sub-inspector of police JP Trivedi, as per the official information. The home department has additionally requested the director general of police to assign 10 sub-inspectors of police and 20 constables to assist the probing team, as per the communique. Denying any fraud in the transactions, the counsel for the trustees from erstwhile royal family of Holkars, Abhinav Malhotra said, “The fact remains that in the past six decades of existence of the trust only 6 of 246 properties were sold and the proposal for every sale was duly approved by each and every member of the trust. Three of the trustees include Holkar family members and their representative; two trustees are representatives of the state government and one trustee is nominated by the central government.” Malhotra added that the sale of properties was done in a transparent manner to fund the maintenance need for trust properties.“The sale was transparent and entire money was deposited in the trust’s bank accounts to create a corpus for maintenance of the trust properties. This is also a fact that while the state government gives merely Rs 2.91 lakh to the trust for maintenance of the trust properties, the royal family members, who are trustees, have given crores of rupees from their own pockets for maintenance of the properties.” Also Read: MP begins probe into alleged multi-crore rupee scam in govt scheme for farmersNotably, high court’s Indore bench on Monday quashed the judgment of a single judge bench of the same court, passed in 2013 and questioned the sale of endowment properties by the trust while declaring the sale of the land null and void and ordering an inquiry by the economic offence wing (EOW) of MP government into it, as per the judgment copy.

Police said the man, who was marginal farmer, was under emotional stress since his wife died battling cancer last month. In an eight-page suicide note in Punjabi, the man said that he was unable to bear the loss of his wife and had decided to take the extreme step. He said that all assets belonging to the family should be donated to the village gurdwara. The body of the couple’s eldest child, a seven-year-old boy, was found hanging in a room, while two daughters were aged three years and one year were found dead on the bed.

08-10-2020||Delhi||Two crushed to death as truck topples on car in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar||Two men were crushed to death inside their car after a truck, filled with rice sacks, toppled on their vehicle in south Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar in the early hours of Wednesday, the police said. The victims, Ranjan Kalra and Ankit Malhotra, were both 35-years-old and ran an event management firm for seven years, according to the police. The collapse was such that the police needed to employ the services of two private hydra cranes as well as three cranes of the traffic police to remove the truck, said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). It took nearly 90 minutes to cut through the mangled remains of the car and pull out both the occupants. “The two men were declared dead on arrival at a hospital,” Meena said. The driver, 25-year-old Vipin Yadav, fled from the scene of the accident soon after the incident, but was arrested later that afternoon, and booked for causing death due to negligence. “Yadav was on his usual trip to Tughlaqabad after picking up rice bags from Ludhiana,” an investigator involved in the matter said.Malhotra lived with his family in east Delhi’s Karkardooma, while Kalra was a resident of Lajpat Nagar. Kalra has left behind a toddler daughter. The two were on their way to the airport when the incident took place on Wednesday.“They had organised an event in Noida on Tuesday evening and were supposed to visit Kolkata for work, and were due to return on Thursday,” the officer said.In the early hours of Wednesday, Malhotra drove out in his Honda City and had picked up Kalra from his Lajpat Nagar home around 3.30am. “Like they often did, they planned to leave the car at the airport’s parking lot,” the officer said. But as they emerged from a service lane in the neighbourhood and turned on to the road under the Lajpat Nagar Flyover to head towards the airport, around 3.45am, the allegedly speeding container truck happened to come right in front of them, the officer said based on the initial probe. “Malhotra tried to save the situation by swerving towards the right, but the truck driver couldn’t stop his vehicle and it ended up toppling over the car,” said the officer. Since there was no way the occupants could be brought out without removing the truck, the police first sought the help of private cranes from nearby. “When that did not help either, we sought the traffic police’s help to use their cranes to remove the truck. The car’s roof was smashed and we had to cut the car to bring out the victims,” said the investigator. They were finally pulled out by 5.15am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-crushed-to-death-as-truck-topples-on-car-in-delhi-s-lajpat-nagar/story-6xQAriF9DRTCwJAvmQQXSL.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Just another day at work||Like many jobs, being a waste collector is hectic. One has to walk along one’s assigned streets, go through piles of garbage to pick up the viable trash, put it in a sack and transport it to the collection point, which can be the collector’s own home.“It’s hard physical labour,” says Shakir Husain. Himself a collector, Mr Husain operates in the central parts of the city. This afternoon he has collected enough stuff to fill up two medium-size bags. Both bags are hanging down from his right arm.Standing by a tea stall, he says he shall now walk back to the room where he lives, deposit the trash there, and go out again for another round. “I’ve already made four rounds,” he says. Mr Husain works daily from 10am to 5pm.Gesturing towards the empty shirt sleeve falling down on his left, he says he lost that arm many years ago. “I got electrocuted by 11,000 volts.”It had happened back home in Moradabad, UP. “Losing one hand was a setback, but one has to make a living to support one’s family.” His wife, kids and mother live in the village and depend on his earning.Not long after the accident, Mr Husain followed the footsteps of some of the folks in his village and arrived in Delhi to find a living. “One is not born a waste collector,” he explains. “Finding an employment in a big city is a matter of luck and kismat (fate)... I could have been something else, perhaps, but my destiny was to be a kabadi walla.”He admits “that the work was very tough in the early days, because I had to manage everything using only one arm.” By now, he says, he has grown used to “the nature of my job.”Suddenly, Mr Husain’s attention is claimed by a pile in the corner. He walks over, bends down over a large plastic bag and fiddles inside it. It has two tin boxes, and some banana peels. He tosses the peels aside and keeps the tins inside one of his two bags.After dropping this load at home, he will take a lunch break before going back to work. “I never cook,” he says. “I always eat outside, much easier.”He walks away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-just-another-day-at-work/story-c0iCmIJwghbq17pmyR3gVO.html

Fire tenders continued to control the fire even on Wednesday, but heaps of waste at the site kept smouldering.Those living in Dadumajra, Sector 38 (West), Sector 25 and New Chandigarh complained of low visibility, thick smoke, foul smell filling up their homes, making it difficult to breathe, and irritation in throats.Several complaints of burning sensation in the eyes due to thick smoke, which continues to engulf the surrounding areas, were also reported. Owing to poor visibility, commuters found it difficult to cross the stretch of road between Dadumajra and Mullanpur.Fire officer Surjit Singh said, “Two water boozers and four fire tenders deployed at the site are continually throwing water to douse the flames. Around 15 trucks are being used to throw mud on the heaps of garbage to prevent the flames from spreading.”Anil Kumar Garg, chief fire officer, said, “The fire is under control and the smoke will also be curtailed soon. The cause of fire is yet to be ascertained. Presence of plastic and other synthetic compounds in the waste is prolonging the smoke and fire.”Cause of fire unclear, theories abundantThough the exact cause of the fire is still unclear, the residents are blaming the municipal corporation (MC) and the authorities suspect it to be the work of scrap dealers.ALSO READ: Fire erupts at Dadumajra dumping ground in Chandigarh“The scrap dealers burn the plastic coating to extract wires that could have led to the fire. As methane gas is emitted from the waste material, the fire spread over a large area,” said a fire official on the ground.“The fire may have been caused by a stray burning bidi or cigarette,” added another official.“In violation of the norms of the NGT, the height of the garbage dump is increasing so those responsible for dumping the garbage here sometimes burn heaps,” said Dyal Krishan, president, Dadumajra Dumping Site Joint Action Committee.Solid waste management is an albatross around the neck for Chandigarh. During one of its hearings, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had observed: “We are sorry to observe that the municipal corporation, Chandigarh, and the project proponent both have left no stone unturned to ensure that the most beautiful city is converted into a junkyard.”Dr PS Bhatti, former medical officer of health (MOH), Chandigarh, who visited the site, said, “At present, only 50 metric tonne (MT) of municipal solid waste (MSW) is being processed. Rest of the 550 MT is being directly thrown in the dumping ground. Methane gas is constantly generated from the unprocessed garbage, leading to frequent fires.”Authorities have failed us: ResidentsResidents took to social media to share videos of the fire at the dumpsite, in an attempt to highlight their plight. “Authorities have completely failed us,” said Dyal Krishan.“Last night, many residents of the surrounding areas reported difficulty in breathing, choking of throat, irritation in eyes, chest congestion and sleeplessness as the smoke entered their houses. The authorities had planned to shift the dumpsite, but no concrete step was taken,” he added.Major DP Singh, patron of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), said, “Residents of all nearby sectors such as 14, 24, 25, 37, 38, 38W, 39 and surrounding colonies live at the mercy of the wind directions. The fires at the dumping ground have become a regular feature.”Vinod Vashisht, convener of City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO), said, “Ever since the MC took over the plant in June, waste processing has become worse. The plant is not operating to its optimal capacity.” He added that solid waste incineration at the thermax furnace of the plant had not been done for the last six months.Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman of Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said, “How long can we keep on suffering? If need be, our federation will knock the doors of the high court and the National Green Tribunal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fire-at-dumping-ground-in-chandigarh-s-dadumajra-residents-complain-of-burning-eyes-choking-throats-sleepless-night/story-pf49C78FyOkWWvWZheiqbO.html

08-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case drug link: All offences under NDPS Act are non-bailable, says Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday held that all offences under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 are non-bailable, while granting bail to two house staffers of the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput – Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant – in connection with the drug link that emerged through WhatsApp chats while investigating his death. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra home on June 14. Justice Sarang Kotwal rejected the argument advanced on behalf of the two Rajput staffers and another accused Abdel Basit Parihar, all arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), that all offences involving small quantity of contraband material were bailable and such accused are entitled to bail as a matter of right. The counsels for the accused, advocate Taraq Sayed and advocate Subodh Desai, had relied on a June 2010 decision of a single judge bench of the HC in Stephen Mueller’s case, in support of their contention. Justice Kotwal, however, refused to accept the argument. The judge relied on a 1999 judgment of the Constitution bench of Supreme Court, holding that all offences under the NDPS Act were cognisable and non-bailable. The judge also rejected the argument that the observation of the Constitution bench was merely a passing reference and not a binding decision. Justice Kotwal said the observation has been subsequently referred by the other Apex court benches as a binding precedent and no other court can take any other view on the issue. The HC said the NDPS Act has undergone a change in 1989, owing to which the second part of the schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code, which declares that offences punishable with imprisonment of up to three years under non-IPC Acts shall be bailable, was not applicable to the NDPS Act. Even offences involving small quantity of drugs (which attract lesser punishments) were made non-bailable, the court said. “If the accused claims bail as a matter of right in case of possession of small quantity, no investigation can be carried out to find the source and trade of the contraband,” said justice Kotwal. “This defeats the object of the Act. One cannot overlook the prevailing situation in today’s society. Offenders involving smaller quantity or lesser punishment expose themselves to immediate arrest. They cannot claim bail as of right. The Act needs to have this deterrent effect to curb the spread of drug abuse,” the judge added. The single judge bench, however, granted bail to Miranda and Sawant on furnishing personal bond of ₹50,000 each, along with one or two sureties in the same amount. The HC granted them bail primarily in view of the fact that they were employees of Rajput and purportedly accepted deliveries of contraband material on instructions of the late actor or his girlfriend, Rhea. HC said there was no material to show that they were part of any chain or had sold drugs to earn profit. They acted only at the behest of their employer, the court added. Like actor Rhea Chakraborty, the HC has also given them time to furnish sureties, paving way for their immediate release from prison. Both of them are ordered to surrender their passports and also restrained from leaving India. The HC, however, rejected the bail plea of Parihar, a student of architecture, Chakraborty’s brother Showik and other alleged peddlers and suppliers arrested in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-drug-link-all-offences-under-ndps-act-are-non-bailable-says-bombay-hc/story-3EbbGITWnlmdN0BuvQCFSK.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks NCERT to verify credentials of experts before enlisting help for special education||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the ministry of education and the National Council for Education, Research and Training (NCERT) to verify the credentials of the experts listed by the petitioner for finding a way to provide education for specially-abled children in over 900 special schools across the state. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the National Association of Blind (NAB), was informed by advocate Dr Uday Warunkjikar that as per court directions, he had prepared a list of experts who could provide a solution to the problem of education for specially-abled students. In an earlier hearing, Dr Warunjikar had informed the court that while education for normal students had commenced through virtual classrooms, the same was not viable for specially-abled students, and urged that the state and Centre come out with a solution to ensure that specially-abled students were not denied their right to education. While responding to the contentions of NAB, advocate Rui Rodrigues for NCERT had informed the court that it had started radio lessons for visually-impaired students but a programme for the deaf and dumb would be introduced only after six to eight months as work on it was still going on. As NAB had opposed the same, the court had suggested that NAB form a panel of experts who could come up with an expeditious solution. On Wednesday, Rodrigues submitted that NCERT was striving to make a fool-proof programme but if the court so directed, it was willing to enlist the help of the experts. Thereafter, the court directed Rodrigues to verify the credentials of the experts as one of them had already undertaken some programme on behalf of the ministry of education in the past, and to submit a report on the same by Monday. The court also directed that NCERT address the points raised by the experts in their covering letter and submit a response to it as well. The PIL has been posted for hearing on October 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-ncert-to-verify-credentials-of-experts-before-enlisting-help-for-special-education/story-ppVlS4QnnUAmpNHr3hI73N.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police’s EOW books property investment firm for duping 7,000 investors of ₹700 crore||The Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) registered a first information report (FIR) on Wednesday against Expat Projects and Development Private Limited, a Bengaluru-based property investment company, and its nine directors and top executive officials for duping 7,000 investors across various states to the tune of ₹700 crore. Expat Projects and Development Pvt Ltd and its directors and senior executives Sachhinandan Kanchan, Firoj Shaha, Santosh Shetty, Nenumal Bhatia, Arvind Gowda, Lancel D’souza, Parth D’souza, Rakesh Gaekwad, Raina Prasanaa and others have been charged under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 4 of Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) (In Financial Establishments) Act.Rajvardhan Sinha, joint commissioner of police, EOW, confirmed the development to HT and said that lookout circulars (LOC) have been issued against the accused and two offices of the company in Bengaluru and Mumbai have been raided.The company is registered in Bangalore and has offices in Bengaluru, Pune and Mumbai. The police said that the company would lure investors to make monthly instalment-based investments in agriculture and non-agricultural plots. “They would ask investors to invest up to 70% of the land price in instalment and then do the registration of the plot. The firm told investors that once they make the payment for the remaining 30%, they would hand over the plot. The company promised the investors that if it fails to give them the plot, then they would return the money with an additional interest of 2% to the interest rate prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India. Initially, the company delivered on their promises, but later started defaulting. They neither gave plot nor refunded money to investors. Our preliminary inquiry has revealed that since 2013 the company has duped around 7,000 investors to the tune of ₹700 crore,” said Rajendra Sangale, senior inspector, unit-7 of EOW.Over 400 investors from Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra, Bengaluru in Karnataka, Goa and other states as well as some NRIs have already approached the police with relevant documents and recorded their statements, an EOW officer said.The company has bought land parcels, most of which are in Raigad district. However, the process of buying the agricultural lands allegedly involved irregularities. “We are trying to find out where exactly investors’ money was used or diverted. The process of collection of evidence has begun,” said Sangale.EOW has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into the matter since the past few months, and after it found that a cognisable offence can be made, a case was registered at Vinobha Bhave Nagar police station. It was later transferred to EOW.The police registered the case on the complaint of Lislot Ludusswami Reddy, an investor, who lost ₹63,76,800 to the fraud.Police sources said investors from Pune have also registered a case against the company around a month ago as the company has plots in Pune district.The firm did not respond to calls and messages from HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-s-eow-books-property-investment-firm-for-duping-7-000-investors-of-700-crore/story-55RzlJC1jVXoUAbI8Q3OHN.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Congress demands SIT probe into use of fake social media accounts||Maharashtra Congress has demanded a thorough probe into 80,000 fake accounts in the Sushant Singh Rajput case by a special investigation team (SIT) and alleged that it was a conspiracy hatched by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress on Wednesday handed over documents, claiming those were proof of a large number of fake social media accounts used to create suspicion around Rajput’s death case, to Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.After meeting Singh, state Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the attempt by the BJP to defame the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra government was a conspiracy against the democracy and it was nothing less than an act of ‘neo-terrorism’. “Nearly 80,000 fake accounts were created overnight to defame Mumbai Police and Maharashtra government by spreading lies and suspicion in SSR case. This is a new trend of maligning the image of other parties by using fake accounts and spreading lies. Mumbai Police should investigate this case by constituting an SIT,” he said.BJP has, however, said that the allegations were levelled by the ruling parties to divert the attention from their failures in handling the Covid-19 pandemic and other crises in the state.Sawant said they have handed over data collated from social media platforms with names of the companies and the fake and original accounts created by them. Sawant said the commissioner assured them about investing the matter. “Some of the twitter handles had sent out 40,000 tweets in the last three months, while some of them tweeted at the rate of 25 tweets a minute. The tweets were on SSR case and were posted with related hashtags. It was a planned and strategic conspiracy against the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government by hiring professional agencies. Similar modus operandi was used by the saffron party after Palghar mob lynching case and Delhi riots. There is possibility of use of similar pattern in future too, if not restricted at appropriate time,” he said.BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said, “The allegations are nothing but an attempt by the ruling parties to divert attention from its failure on various fronts. We are not against any probe. The police should go ahead and book the culprits involved in such activities. At the same time, home minister Anil Deshmukh and the MVA government should tell us about the status in the inquiries announced by them in the past. What happened to the probe in phone tapping case? What is the status of the probe announced by Anil Dehsmukh against Kangana Ranaut in drug dealing case? Why she was allowed to go back to Himachal Pradesh without any probe? If the Congress is talking about Palghar lynching, it should first answer why charge sheet was not filed within stipulated time and why police let the accused get bail due to inept handling of the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-congress-demands-sit-probe-into-use-of-fake-social-media-accounts/story-jyxqFnF5swhet8wUQfdF7M.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police’s EOW files closure report in alleged ₹25,000-crore MSC Bank scam, says it’s civil in nature||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police filed a closure report in the alleged ₹25,000-crore Maharashtra State Co-operative (MSC) Bank fraud. The police filed a C summary in the special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court after EOW’s special investigation team (SIT) found no criminal aspect to be investigated in the case. The police complaint named 76 people accused in the case including the then deputy chief minister and many other political bigwigs from the state.An EOW source close to the development on Tuesday said the SIT had, on September 15, filed a C summary report in the MSC Bank scam at the special ACB court. C summary is filed when the complaint is neither true nor false or if the offence is of civil nature.The investigation officer of the case and assistant commissioner of police (ACP), EOW, Kiran Patil, has confirmed that a C summary report was filed in the case last month, but refused to elaborate as he is not authorised to speak to the media.An EOW officer, who is aware of the development, requesting anonymity said that the investigation has revealed that all the transactions in the alleged scam were done as per the rules prescribed by the government and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). There are certain irregularities, but they are of civil nature and no criminal investigation is required for the same, he said.EOW had filed a first information report (FIR) in the case under sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 120B and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, section 13 (a)(b)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and section 29 of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act. The case was filed in August last year on the direction of the Bombay high court, which was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Andheri-based social activist Surinder Arora, 64, who had alleged police inaction into the fraud.The complaint pertained to thousands of crores obtained in loans by sugar cooperatives, spinning mills and other processing units from district and cooperative banks.MSC Bank, the apex bank that controlled credit to the co-operative sector in the state and was handled by then ruling politicians, landed in trouble in 2011 after an inquiry report by Nabard found the bank was in red with a negative of ₹144 crore. The report indicted the board of directors of the bank for financial mismanagement that led to ballooning of non-performing assets. This was largely due to handing out of loans to sugar co-operatives and spinning mills in violation of all norms.The complainant Arora had then alleged that illegal loans were sanctioned and secured assets were sold out at throwaway prices, contrary to norms.The Nabard report had said that balance sheets had been fudged to show a profit of ₹2 crore when the bank was facing losses of ₹798 crore. The board had 76 directors, of whom 44 were elected representatives — 25 from the Nationalist Congress Party, 14 from the Congress, 2 each from the Bharatiya Janata Party and Peasants and Workers Party of India and one from the Shiv Sena.EOW was already making a preliminary inquiry in the matter but before it could conclude anything, a PIL was filed in this connection in the high court.Senior EOW officers were not available for comment on the development.Advocate Satish Talekar, Arora’s lawyer, said, “EOW filed a 67,600-page closure report in the case last month. However, the court has not accepted it yet as the complainant is yet to be heard by the court. We would soon file our say opposing the closure report. And if the court accepts police’s closure report, then we are going to challenge it in a higher court.”Talekar said, “The investigation officer did not go to any sugar factory, did not record statements of people having key importance in the case. It’s all manipulated. We would soon be filing another PIL seeking investigation by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).”After EOW filed an FIR in August 2019, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) also registered a case of suspected money laundering and initiated a parallel probe. A senior official from ED confirmed to HT that ED had, on Monday, opposed the clean chit given to the politicians named in the multicore scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-s-eow-files-closure-report-in-alleged-25-000-crore-msc-bank-scam-says-it-s-civil-in-nature/story-NTN3CVzNCwYn37Dj1FYk8M.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai’s distance education wing postpones all exams; to start from October 19||After postponing three examinations within a week for students of the distance education wing of the University of Mumbai, the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL) on Wednesday announced postponement of all IDOL exams. The rescheduled exams will now commence from October 19, but the timetable for the same will be released later. This announcement comes a day after around 9,000 third-year BCom and third-year BA students could not attempt their paper on Tuesday due to “technical glitches”. Many students complained of not being able to log in to the link on the examination application prescribed to students by the university. In a statement on Tuesday, the university blamed the errors on a cyberattack on the examination software.“In a meeting of the board of examination (BoE) on Wednesday, it was decided to clarify all queries raised by students and ensure no technical errors affect exams henceforth. Therefore, all exams will be conducted starting October 19,” said the statement released by IDOL on Wednesday. However, there’s no clarity on the status of re-examination for students who managed to attempt their paper on Saturday (October 3).Due to Covid-19 pandemic, this year all final-year exams are being conducted online. IDOL exams commenced on October 3. On the first day, several students complained about not being able to attempt the one-hour paper due to server issues, following which, the university announced a re-exam for the paper at a later date. The same problem cropped up the next day as well, following which, thousands of students gathered at the IDOL office at the university’s Kalina campus. “The examination software company is currently working on all queries raised by students, and we want to make sure that such problems don’t crop up in the future. New exam dates will be announced soon,” said a spokesperson for the university.While the university is still unclear on what is causing the “technical glitches”, members of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena (MNVS) demanded that the university terminate services of the software company, LittleMORE Innovation Labs, which was hired to conduct exams this year. “All exams should be cancelled till the software company is able to conduct exams for students in large numbers. Students don’t need more anxiety than they are already facing,” said Santosh Gangurde, state vice-president of MNVS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-s-distance-education-wing-postpones-all-exams-to-start-from-october-19/story-PARyE77vpCG4OUm2U6ubEK.html

The CMO, though having confirmed that he has received a notice from the NHM union in the matter, declined to speak.The NHM Karmachari Sangh (Haryana) had, in late September, warned of a possible strike over the introduction of two contentious termination clauses in their employment contracts, which were up for renewal. On October 1, the matter was resolved in a meeting with Dr Virender Yadav, who agreed to renew the workers’ contracts with the specific clauses rescinded. At the time, too, Dr Yadav had confirmed the development but declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-700-national-health-mission-workers-threaten-two-day-strike-from-oct-12/story-H6ODvK2xDzAI0bvEoKkn8O.html

Officials said that out of these, 10 houses had received occupation certificates but conducted building plan violations recently and action would be taken against the owners as per rules . The enforcement team conducted the inspection along with local MCG councillor RS Rathee and they interacted with area residents and heard grievances raised by them. RS Bhath, who is also the district town planner, said that the inspection started around 11am and they first visited the A block and spoke to residents, who apprised them of problems being caused due to construction activities in the area. “During the inspection it was observed that some of the plot owners had obtained occupation certificates but carried out construction later in violation of norms. We also found that at a large number of places, construction material was not covered and it was causing dust pollution. At few houses construction of stores and other rooms was being done, which has been stopped,” said Bhath. DTCP officials further said that in view of the impending winter season and directions issued by government to curb pollution, they would conduct similar inspections in colonies under their jurisdiction to ensure that dust pollution is curbed. Bhath said that action would be taken against house owners for violations of town and country planning rules within a week. Last week the department had formed four teams to conduct inspection of houses to which occupation certificates were issued to check whether violations had been carried out after obtaining the occupation certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/building-plan-violations-in-several-houses-in-dlf-phase-1-dtp-to-take-action/story-ZHcTUKNUxScYPsTqFELgKK.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Sharpshooters part of sleeper cell, target was to establish supremacy: Gurugram cops||A day after three members of Sube Gujjar’s gang were arrested after a brief exchange of gunfire in Sohna, police said probe has revealed that the main sharpshooter of Gujjar’s gang, Rajesh Kumar alias Fauji had recently formed a ‘sleeper cell’ of shooters and recruited the two arrested suspects, Kamal alias Kamli, 32, and Aman alias Sardar. Two policemen and both the arrested suspects were injured in the shootout. Police said on the directions of Sube Gujjar, Fauji had formed the cell and their target was to commit a series of crimes, starting with the murder of a property dealer in Dhunela on Tuesday, to establish supremacy. Investigators said that other gang members in Gujjar’s gang were unaware of the recruitment of these ‘silent’ sharp shooters. The trio had conducted a recce for two days and assembled a cache of weapons for the murder, but they were arrested after the crime branch sector 39 received a tip-off. Two pistols, two revolvers, a country-made gun, 110 live cartridges, a backpack, and a motorcycle were allegedly recovered from the possession of the suspects. Police said after the arrests of most of his associates, Sube Gujjar, a former sharpshooter of gangster Kaushal, has assumed leadership of the Kaushal gang in the last one year. Gujjar has a reward of Rs 5 lakh for information leading to his arrest. Fauji was Gujjar’s right hand man and most trusted aide, who kept him informed of the gang’s activities, said police. Fauji has been deemed as a bad character — a person with a history of crime — at Sadar police station and is accused in 18 criminal cases, including several murders, extortions and loots in a career that spans over two decades. A resident of Naharpur Rupa, Fauji took to crime in 1998 and was arrested for the first time in 2001 for a conspiracy to loot. Over the next five years, he rose through the ranks and along with Kaushal and Sube, was involved in several gang wars, including murder of gangster Shailu in 2006. From 2006 to 2008, a period when Gurugram witnessed several inter-gang shootings, he was accused in at least four murders and attempt to murder cases, before he was arrested by Delhi Police’s special cell from Bhiwadi. He continued to operate his activities from jail later. More recently in 2019, he was accused in the murder of a nambardar (an official who maintains and verifies land records) in Manesar and murder of a cleric in Hathin. The second suspect, Kamal alias Kamli, a resident of village Badha in Kherki Daula, was a school bus driver till three years ago. He is a cousin of Fauji and was allegedly recruited by him. Police said he had allegedly committed two murders on the direction of Gujjar and his involvement in the gang was always kept under the wraps. He only reported to Gujjar and Fauji. The third aide, Aman alias Sardar, a native of Ludhiana, used to be an auto rickshaw driver and later started smuggling liquor for Fauji. He too was recruited on Gujjar’s directions for the purpose of carrying out a spate of murders. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “The entire gang and their aides are on the radar of the police and we are hopeful of getting them all behind bars. The three arrested persons are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Sohna and shall be taken into custody after they are discharged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sharpshooters-part-of-sleeper-cell-target-was-to-establish-supremacy-gurugram-cops/story-fuu7QIDIfsxHxvrg2s5caO.html
08-10-2020||Noida||UPPCB identifies 50 air pollution hot spots in Ghaziabad for stricter checks this year||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) has identified 50 different hot spots that are prone to bad air and are likely to aggravate pollution levels in the approaching winter season.Directions have been issued to different agencies to take steps in their respective areas in order to keep a close watch on the hot spots to keep pollution levels in check, officials said.The officials said they identified 17 hot spot areas affected by vehicular pollution and 10 where construction activities are on. Nine spots are affected by road dust while six industrial areas have been identified about which the board often receives complaints of emission. Another eight spots are where there are issues of garbage dumping and burning. Last year, only seven to eight hot spots were identified but the number has been increased this year in order to have stricter checks. “The hot spot areas will be under scanner and different agencies have been asked to keep a tab on pollution-emitting sources. In this connection, UPPCB has already asked for a self-audit of construction sites and installation of cameras. The compliance is to be done by October 10. The cameras will be monitored online by UPPCB. We have also issued directions to various industrial units in the city to install cameras facing the chimneys,” Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, said. The officials have identified about 70 to 100 industrial units that use coal and wood as fuel and will be required to install such cameras and hand over the online control to the board for constant monitoring. The Supreme Court in 2017 had banned the use of pet coke and furnace oil as fuel. Industrial units in areas such as Sahibabad, Pandav Nagar, South Side GT Road, Meerut Road, Loni Road and Dasna are among the hot spots. They have also identified areas such as Siddharth Vihar, Vasundhara, Loni Road, Raj Nagar Extension, NH-9 and Delhi-Meerut Road among others, where construction activities are on. NH-9 and the Delhi-Meerut Road are the two major hot spots where construction activities for the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and the Regional Rapid Transit System, respectively, are already underway. “The unpaved road areas not only result in emission of dust but also lead to traffic issues and aide air pollution. The agencies have been asked to make use of water sprinklers and deploy anti-smog guns, etc., The administration had directed them to repair roads. Construction activities have already started to impact air quality. As a result of the ongoing activities, the Loni monitoring station is showing high AQI levels,” Sharma said. The online monitoring station at Loni already has shown a high average of 241.14 air quality index while the other three at Indirapuram, Sanjay Nagar and Vasundhara had an average AQI of 212.86, 190.29 and 195, respectively, from October 1 to October 7. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.” “The city is largely affected by road dust, construction activities, industrial and vehicular emission. The air quality is already showing signs of deterioration which is also the result of instances of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. At a local level, all enforcement measures and checks need to be put in place to ensure local pollution sources are curbed to an extent,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. According to UPPCB figures, in 2019 the city recorded 31 days with ‘severe’ category of air quality index (AQI). It had another 67 days when its AQI was recorded under the ‘very poor’ category and another 112 days when the AQI was under the ‘poor’ category.

08-10-2020||Noida||Sharda University designs e-scooter for persons with disabilities||Greater Noida: Sharda University has patented an electric scooter it has developed for persons with disabilities (PWD). The scooter, Divya Shakti, was also displayed at the Auto Expo – 2020 in February. The Greater Noida-based private university aims to collaborate with the government and manufacture it for those in need. “There is no such vehicle for PWDs the market. The project has huge social application for the disabled and elderly. It supports a rotating seat in order to make it easier for a person to board or alight,” said project coordinator Abhishek Bhattacharya, assistant professor, department of mechanical engineering, Sharda University. Three students – Piyush Joshi, Arun Joshi and Showket Latif Bandey – worked on this project and developed the viable prototype, he said. “It has a self-start system and can run 75 km on a single charge. It has maximum speed of 60 kmph and the estimated charging time is 3 to 4 hours.” Anil Chhikara, automobile engineering expert working with Delhi government, said, “These vehicles can be used locally. For their commercial use, the vehicles first need to pass safety tests. They also need to be registered by the government. The manufacture of motorcycles/e-bikes also need significant investment. This can be possible if the government or a private company gets involved,” he said.Dr Parmanand, dean school of engineering and technology, said the University will approach local administration and government for a collaboration for this project. “We will work on the model’s testing and registration as well. We are not aiming for commercial benefits, and hence the product would be low cost,” he said. PK Gupta, Sharda University Chancellor, also said that they will collaborate with the government and manufacture the product. “We have filed a patent for the product. We are not going for comm  ercial deal with any private companies but to serve the needy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/sharda-university-designs-e-scooter-for-persons-with-disabilities/story-ke2pfJXA4ew6yVEwiSUUWN.html
08-10-2020||City||Now, dump expired medicines at Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s hub in Sector 43||Gurugram: To keep a check on health complications arising from expired medicines, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has created a hub in sector 43 for collecting such products, the first such facility in Haryana, officials said on Wednesday. According to MCG officials, residents can dump expired medicines at the hub, from where a bio-medical waste collection concessionaire would collect and incinerate them at a designated centre.MCG officials said that until now, there was no mechanism for disposing of expired medicines in the city.“The city only has only basic levels of waste segregation, primarily wet and dry waste. There are many other types of waste segregation levels, each of which have their own set of importance attached. Hence, last month the MCG launched a drive in condominiums to collect expired medicines. The aim was both educating people of its hazards as well as letting them know that a separate collection centre is being opened shortly where they can dump expired medicines in the future,” said Sonia Duhan, waste management expert, MCG, adding the drive was needed in making residents across the city aware about the collection hub.Along with the Iamgurgaon NGO, MCG had launched a drive between September 15 and October 5 to collect expired medicines in more than 25 condominiums.43 kilograms of expired medicines were collected, said officials. Duhan said at MCG’s “samadhaan hub” in sector 43, a separate waste centre was created earlier this week for dumping of expired medicines. The hub also has waste centres for dumping clothes, different types of plastic, and e-waste, officials said. “One of our main aims behind the collection of expired medicines was to keep a check on the formation of superbugs. Due to improper dumping of mosquito coils, chemicals on the coil often get mixed with water bodies and over time, mosquitoes have built a resistance against them, deeming them ineffective. With expired medicines, especially antibiotics, we do not want different types of viruses to lso build resistance and become extremely dangerous for humans,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter. The samadhaan hub is open seven days a week, between 9 am and 6 pm.“The expiry data carries high importance, especially in the case of antibiotics where consumption of sub therapeutic or less than recommended doses of antibiotic drugs will increase chances of resistance apart from not treating the primary disease. In addition, adverse effects can sometimes occur on consumption of expired medication such as injury to vital organs as a result of toxic degradation of the drug. It can also lead to drug allergies and skin rashes, especially in dermatological products,” said Dr Amitabh Parti, Director, Internal Medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram.Dr Col Vijay Dutta, Internal & Respiratory Medicine, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, said discarding expired medicines by flushing down the toilet or disposing them with usual garbage is extremely harmful for the environment, human beings and animals. “The expired medicines can easily mix with water or end up in landfills and be indirectly consumed in several ways. The authorities should run awareness campaigns on segregation of waste at home not only in terms of biodegradable or non-biodegradable, but also emphasise on keeping expired medicines separately and give it to the collector. A strict policy for separating and destroying bioactive compounds at the final stage of segregation is a must,” said Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-dump-expired-medicines-at-municipal-corporation-of-gurugram-s-hub-in-sector-43/story-f05HyjD0ukbOwhHGh9YwcM.html

08-10-2020||City||Gurugram: Covid-19 hampers efforts against non-communicable diseases, say officials||Gurugram: The Covid-19 outbreak has dealt a heavy blow to the Gurugram health department’s efforts against non-communicable diseases (NCD) such as heart problems, cancer and diabetes, officials said on Wednesday. This is because population-based screening (PBS) campaigns carried out by ASHA workers and auxiliary midwife nurses (ANMs), to detect prevent, detect and control five common NCDs in the district, have been hampered with resources being diverted to battle the coronavirus disease, they said. Non-communicable diseases, according to a 2017 National Health Mission module for ANMs, are responsible for 60% deaths in India. These are led by coronary heart disease, stroke, and hypertension (45%), chronic respiratory disease (22%), cancers (12 %), and diabetes (3%). Surveillance for these diseases, implemented under the health ministry’s National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), was greatly expanded in 2017.“Earlier, we used to conduct what we called ‘opportunistic screening’, where anyone above 30 years of age who came to a health care centre would be checked for three diseases, including hypertension, diabetes and oral cancer. In women, we also checked for breast and cervical cancer,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gururgam. Sharma said opportunistic screening was replaced with the PBS method of surveillance in 2017, where 37% of the population (above the age of 30) would be screened for NCDs. In Gurugram, this is now done by about 1,000 trained ASHA workers, 230-odd ANMs, and an estimated 50 nurses and medical officers each. ASHA workers conduct door-to-door campaigns around their respective primary health centres (PHC) and urban PHCs, and refer cases to the nearest health care centre or sub-centre for treatment. They also carry out routine follow-ups with patients. “Last year, the target population for screening was about 870,000 people, men and women. Of these, across 35 UPHc and PHCs in the district, we managed to screen 16.5% of the target, which is around 1.5 lakh individuals,” a medical officer with the health department’s NCD division said. “This year, a few PHCs have not screened even a single person. Others screened only between 100 and 150 people each. By the end of the year, we may reach about 8% of last year’s target,” the doctor said, seeking anonymity. These door-to-door campaigns, the doctor said, have come to a standstill this year after the Covid-19 outbreak in March. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, confirmed this. “PBS cannot be a priority in the middle of a pandemic, as most of our staff are involved in Covid response. ASHA workers and ANMs particularly, which would usually do the PBS exercise for an incentive of Rs 50 per household, are now occupied with contact tracing, following up with Covid patients, door-to-door screening for SARI and ILI symptoms, and so on,” he said.Yadav added, “Checking for these five NCDs requires close contact between the field worker and the patient. Though ASHA workers may still choose to do NCD screening for the financial incentive, we cannot encourage it because it puts them at greater risk of contracting Covid-19 from someone in the community. It is a catch-22 situation.” Dr Sunita Rathi, nodal officer for prevention and control of NCDs, declined to provide a comment for this story, though her office did confirm the medical officer’s claims. “We are just in the process of preparing the quarterly report and can give better data once it is ready,” said an administrative staffer, who also declined to be identified. Experts believe the public health ramifications of this diminished surveillance can be assessed in earnest only after the pandemic has passed. Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, a Gurugram resident and vice-president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India, said, “In the next four to five years, we may see an increase in background morbidity due to NCDs. They are deadly in themselves but also increase chances of mortality in cases of co-infection with diseases like Covid-19.” “Recent work by WHO shows that these kind of disruptions of routine health services is a global issue. Locally speaking, the challenge isn’t so much about lack of surveillance, but lack of secondary and tertiary care that patients with these illnesses will soon require,” Dorairaj added. “Opportunistic screening is a key strategy of the NPCDCS that has been understandably affected by the ongoing Covid crisis. The recently launched Great Barrington Declaration (by infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists) recognises that the current situation can produce devastating effects on short and long-term public health effects, including worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. The Declaration recommends a ‘Focused Protection’ strategy to minimise mortality and social harm while better protecting those who are at highest risk.” said Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health, JNU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-covid-19-hampers-efforts-against-non-communicable-diseases-say-officials/story-xRRg3RcYgPkQdoH5G3EdrO.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records highest 1-day spike of 2,848 Covid infections||Keeping with the plateauing trajectory of Covid-19 cases across the state over the past two weeks, Maharashtra clocked 14,578 new infections, even as Mumbai registered its highest single-day spike of 2,848 infectionsRegions other than the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have seen a drastic drop in cases over the past few weeks. On Wednesday, the state’s case tally reached 1,480,489, which includes 219,961 infections from Mumbai. Mumbai’s toll touched 9,248 after it reported 46 fatalities on Wednesday. With 355 new fatalities reported across the state on Wednesday, the toll reached 39,072, of which, 211 were from last two days, 48 were from last one week and remaining 96 were from the period before it, according to the state health department. Pune district retained its second position in terms of new infections by reporting2,343 cases, which included 966 in city, 851 in rural areas and 526 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. The district reported 40 deaths. Following Mumbai and Pune; Ahmednagar and Nashik districts were top contributors with 902 cases (14 deaths) and 1,108 cases (7 deaths) respectively. With 57,926 patients, Pune tops the chart of active cases, followed by Thane (31,770) and Mumbai (26,544). Total active cases in the state dropped to 244,527, taking the recovery rate to 80.81%, against the national rate of 84.7%.The state has witnessed a steady drop in new infections over the last two weeks, after cases in districts like Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Sangli, Kolhapur saw a dip in the cases. While the cases in peripheral districts succeeded to bring the growth rate down, cities in MMR, which comprises nine municipal corporations including Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli and rural parts of Thane, Raigad, Palghar, reported a rise in cases over the past four weeks. Opening up of activities and lifting of restrictions on mobility are the reasons attributed to the rise. The share in the daily cases in MMR in the state caseload increased to 32.61% on October 6, from 19.20% four weeks ago on September 8 and 21.07% two weeks ago on September 22. Western Maharashtra’s share reduced to 32.61% from 38.98% a month ago. North Maharashtra reported dip in daily cases to 12.56% on October 6, from 14.29% in September 8. Vidarbha and Marathwada cases dropped to 15.58% and 0.90% from 14.59% and 11.10% during this period. While rural parts of Thane, Palghar and Raigad have witnessed a drop over the past four weeks, the cities in MMR have clocked a rise during this period. “We have aggressively opened up activities, including restaurants, industries, and have also increased the number of local services for essential/emergency sectors. Apart from it, the number of tests has been hugely increased over the past few weeks. Lack of sense of Covid-appropriate behaviour among people is another reason for the rise in cases. Mobility within MMR is higher than any other part of the state. All these reasons result in the rise in the cases, although we are hopeful to keep it stable and gradually bring it down in the near future,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).In Mumbai, the highest single-day spike recorded until Wednesday was on September 30 — 2,654 cases being reported in a day. Since the first week of September, the city has been reporting nearly 2,000 cases on a daily basis.Of the total Covid-19 cases recorded in the Mumbai so far, 26, 544 are active cases in the city at present, while 1, 83, 742 patients have been recovered and discharged so far. The recovery rate stands at 83% and case fatality rate is 4.2%. As per BMC’s data, out of 46 deaths, one death was below 40 years of age, 16 deaths were of people between 40 to 60 years and 29 deaths were above 60 years of age. The city’s doubling rate of cases in the city is 67 days. On Wednesday, Dharavi reported 12 new Covid cases with the total cases reaching 3,292 cases.Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday that although the state is reaching a plateau, people should not be negligent and follow the guidelines. Experts, however, feel that the state has reached the plateau and if the trend continued for next two weeks, there could be a drastic fall in cases by the month’s end. “The overall fall in the number of cases is owing to attainment of plateau, herd immunity witnessed in containment areas-hotspots and drop in the tests by the authorities. The natural history of any epidemic disease sees a plateau after third stage. If we continue with the downward trend for next two weeks, we can expect the number of daily tests to fall below 5,000. The hope, however, comes with a rider. The people should not let their guard down and the government should continue tracing and testing susceptible people,” said Avinash Bhondve, Maharashtra president, Indian Medical Association.82,812 tests were conducted in the state in the last 24 hours with a positivity rate of 17.60%. 2,248,741 people are under home quarantine, while 25,655 are institutionally quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-highest-1-day-spike-of-2-848-covid-infections/story-09QFPgSsli45IE5WMxatTM.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||Rise in Covid, dengue co-infections a concern||With cases of dengue and Covid-19 both on the rise, doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi say they have recorded at least 20 cases of co-infection of the two diseases — a situation that presents a problem for diagnosis and treatment.With fever and cough the predominant symptoms for both diseases, diagnosing both infections has become a challenge, doctors from the hospital said on Wednesday at the National Grand Rounds, which virtually connects physicians from across the country to discuss Covid-19 management.It also presents a challenge in treatment — Covid-19 patients are often given anti-coagulants to prevent clotting, but the medicine increases the risk of bleeding, which can lead to a shock in dengue patients with low platelet counts. Delhi has reported 266 cases of dengue till October 3, according to data shared by the city’s municipal corporations. Of these, 188 cases were reported in September alone. Meanwhile, the Capital added 2,871 cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, which took the city’s tally to 298,107.“Cases of vector-borne diseases like dengue go up after the monsoon, and we are seeing many cases of Covd-19 with dengue. Co-infection with both the viruses becomes challenging to manage — in one disease we have to give anti-coagulants, because the body is in a hypercoagulable state (tendency of clot formation); and in the other you are worried about the fall in the platelets and shock syndrome that might happen. What is important is that if there is an atypical presentation of Covid-19, the clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for other infections,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS. Of the 20 cases, nine were reported by the department of medicine from the main AIIMS campus, and the other were from their campus in Jhajjar. The analysis of the data of the first 4,200 Covid-19 patients from Jhajjar showed that the most common infection along with Covid-19 was tuberculosis, followed by HIV, and Hepatitis. Data presented by Dr Pawan Tiwari, assistant professor of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, showed that of the 4,200 patients with Covid-19, 32 had active tuberculosis (TB) and 35 had latent TB. There were 27 cases of HIV, 12 cases of Hepatitis B, and 11 cases of dengue. “From what we have seen over the years, about 25% of dengue patients come in with some upper respiratory symptoms. On the other hand, Covid-19 does not predominantly present as a respiratory infection when the patients first come in. This complicates diagnosis. Another challenge is that if a person who tests positive for Covid-19 is put in home isolation, early diagnosis of dengue might be missed,” said Dr Tiwari. Of the nine patients who came in with both the infections at the main campus, only three had moderate to severe dengue, and all but one had mild Covid-19. All of the patients recovered and were discharged, said Dr Ved Prakash Meena, assistant professor of the department of medicine. At the Grand Rounds, Meena presented the case of a 22-year-old patient from Uttar Pradesh who tested positive for Covid-19 but not dengue initially. He was later diagnosed with the infection when his platelet count started dropping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rise-in-covid-dengue-co-infections-a-concern/story-MSsQBZYcXvkRoeuDnbx3KI.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Schools will not reopen in Maharashtra till Diwali||The Maharashtra government has decided not to reopen schools at least till Diwali, which falls on November 14, against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision came after the Central government, in guidelines issued on September 30, allowed state governments to take a decision on reopening schools, colleges, educational institutions and coaching institutions after October 15, in a graded manner. It, however, also said that online and distance learning should continue to be the preferred mode of teaching and be encouraged.A senior official, who did not wish to be named, said the cabinet decided not to allow schools to open till Diwali festival. “The state has experienced a surge in cases after the Ganesh festival. There are chances that it may happen again as both Dussehra and Diwali are at a gap of 20 days only,” he said.“Though Covid-19 situation in the state has improved, we will have to take precautions as there are countries that have started facing a second wave of the pandemic. Also, we have seen the experience of Andhra Pradesh before us, where many school students have tested positive. We cannot risk the lives of students,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.Around 27 students of classes 9 and 10 in two schools have tested positive for coronavirus in Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh. While the schools were to reopen from November 2, the students were reportedly attending classes informally with parents’ consent, according to news reports.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also directed the school education department to take review on the progress of online classes allowed by the state. On June 15, as the new academic year began for schools in the state, the state government approved a set of SOPs (standard operating procedure) to ensure uniformity in the conduct of online learning across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-will-not-reopen-in-maharashtra-till-diwali/story-83ZGUqtbG6qfIhTSTmUOWM.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Crime branch cracks down on cricket betting, 9 arrested so far||Cracking down against cricket betting rackets in the city, the crime branch of Gurugram Police has arrested at least nine people in separate cases for allegedly making bets on Indian Premier League (IPL) matches in the last fortnight. Since the start of the tournament last month, separate raids have been conducted at four locations - Sushant Lok, sector 107, sector 51 and Sector 69 with all the suspects being booked under relevant sections of the Public Gambling Act. The alleged bookmakers had been on the police radar since the IPL began on September 19. Senior police officials said that typically, such operations mushroom whenever a domestic or international sports league is being telecast. This year, the start of several sports tournaments, which usually take place in the summer, was delayed due to the raging Covid-19 pandemic. With sports returning on television, the illegal betting operations, which had been dormant, too have come back to life. In most cases of betting on cricket matches, the modus operandi is the largely the same. Police officials said that during a match, the suspects are connected to a ‘live line’ where one of their ‘contacts’ is physically present at the match location, who informs them over the phone about the odds. The ‘local’ bookie takes bets from the punters — a person who places the bets. There is an entire chain of ‘bookies’ who communicate over the phone. The odds keep changing as the match progresses. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police, (ACP), crime, said, “We are cracking down on all such illegal operations and more arrests are likely. Probe so far has found that these bookies take bets on all such sporting activities. They mostly use encrypted communication and have a nexus with bookies at several locations. We are trying to bust the whole chain.” “Since it is a bailable offence, several accused return to gambling after they are released. It is yet to be established if the accused in these four cases have a common link or they were running independent operations. Four FIRs have been registered at respective police stations,” said ACP. Four days after the start of IPL, on September 23, the crime branch of sector 17 received a tip-off about two bookmakers, operating from a flat in sector 107, who had taken bets on a match between Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings. Police formed a raiding team and arrested Virendra, 27, and Rakesh Kaushik, 35, both residents of Nangloi, Delhi, while they were taking bets over the phone as the match was screened on a television set. Eight mobile phones, a notebook, a laptop and a pen were recovered from them. Two days later, acting on a tip-off, the same crime unit arrested three more people, identified as Kapil Kumar, Nitin and Avinash, all from a society in sector 69. Police said the trio was operating a book on an IPL match between Delhi Capitals and Chennai Superkings and recovered three phones, a notebook and a laptop. A crime branch official from sector 17, requesting anonymity, said, “In one of the raids, the bookmaker on the phone was communicating that the odds were 39 paise for a bet on the team batting first, which means that a person, placing Rs 100 on that team at that point of time, would receive Rs 139 if it wins. The odds keep changing.” The third raid was conducted on October 1 by a crime branch team from Manesar after police received ‘secret information’ that a similar operating was being run in Sushant Lok. The accused, Tarun Kumar, a resident of Madanpuri, and Nawab Ali, a native of West Bengal, were arrested for taking bets. Along with four phones, LED TV and a laptop, Rs 8000 in cash was seized. Earlier this week on Monday, the crime branch, sector 31, arrested two persons, Rajesh alias Soni, and Nitin Dhareja, both residents of New Colony, from the ninth floor of an EWS flat in Vatika City, sector 51. The duo was running a book on a match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals. One LED TV, three mobile phones, a diary, a set top box and pen were recovered from their possession. The accused released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-crime-branch-cracks-down-on-cricket-betting-9-arrested-so-far/story-d5ik5ehb93PkHBezDE5u2O.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Bombay high court grants bail to Rhea Chakraborty||Thirty days after actor Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) over drug-related charges in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday granted bail to the 28-year-old actor, negating all major allegations levelled by the agency, including being a “part of a drug syndicate” or “harbouring, financing” drug activities. A single bench of Justice Sarang Kotwal granted bail to Rhea, who walked out of Byculla jail at 5.30pm, on a personal bond of Rs1 lakh and one or two sureties of the same amount. She has, however, been granted time to furnish sureties, paving the way for the actor to come out of jail immediately. By way of bail conditions, HC has directed her to surrender her passport to the investigation officer and not to leave India. She has also been restrained from leaving the jurisdiction of the special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court in Mumbai without submitting itinerary to the special court, and asked to attend the NCB office on first Monday of every month. However, Justice Kotwal rejected the bail pleas of Chakraborty’s brother Showik, observing that he “appeared to be an important link in the chain of drug dealers” and alleged drug peddler Abdel Basit Parihar, while granting bail to Rajput’s domestic aides Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda.On September 8, NCB, after three days of intense questioning, had arrested Chakraborty claiming that she was part of a drug syndicate, and that she financed to procure drugs for her boyfriend and late actor Sushant Singh Rajput under sections 8(C), read with 20(b)(ii) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase, transport, ware-house, use, consume, import, export or trans-ship cannabis other than ganja), 27A (financing illicit trafficking into drugs and harbouring offenders), 28 (attempt to commit offences under the Act) and 29 (abetment) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. “I am unable to agree with the submission that giving money to another for consuming drug would mean encouraging such a habit, and would mean ‘financing’ or ‘harbouring’, as envisaged under section 27A of the NDPS Act,” noted Justice Kotwal in his 70-page order. The allegations and material against Chakraborty are that on some occasions she had used her own money in procuring drugs. She facilitated procuring of drugs through her brother. For that purpose, employees of Rajput were also used. “As discussed earlier, her acts would not fall under Section 27A of the NDPS Act,” the order further noted, while it went on detail that the main section which could be attracted in Rhea’s case is violation of Section 8(C) of the NDPS Act, which is made punishable under Section 20 or Section 22. “In that case, it is necessary for the investigating agency to show that her activities or contravention involved commercial quantity of a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance,” noted Justice Kotwal. The investigation did not reveal any recovery either from Rhea or from the house of Rajput. “It is their own case that the drugs were already consumed and hence there was no recovery. In that case, there is nothing at this stage to show that the applicant (Rhea) had committed any offence involving commercial quantity of contraband. The material at the highest shows that she has committed an offence involving contraband, but, the crucial element of incurring rigours of section 37 in respect of commercial quantity is missing,” observed justice Kotwal. “Therefore, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant is not guilty of any offence punishable under sections 19, 24 or 27A or any other offence involving commercial quantity. There are no other criminal antecedents against her. She is not part of the chain of drug dealers. She has not forwarded the drugs allegedly procured by her to somebody else to earn monetary or other benefits. Since she has no criminal antecedents, there are reasonable grounds for believing that she is not likely to commit any offence while on bail,” said Kotwal while granting Rhea bail. The bail order went on to describe the importance, relevance and reasoning behind the incorporation of section 27A, stating that the section as introduced by the legislation “India was facing a problem of transit traffic in illicit drugs. The spill-over from such traffic was causing problems of abuse and addiction. To control the traffic in illicit drugs as the spill over from such traffic was causing problems of abuse and addiction, a separate section 27A was introduced to check these activities, which were the root cause of illicit traffic. “Financing” and “harbouring” such activities were, therefore, specifically mentioned under Section 27A.” Section 27A is of significance because it is independent of the quantity involved. There is no mention of activities involving small, intermediate or commercial quantity in section 27 A, observed Justice Kotwal and noted that it has hence necessary to consider what “financing” and “harbouring” meant. The financing and harbouring parts are specifically made punishable under Section 27A. Justice Kotwal noted that neither “financing” nor “harbouring” was defined under the NDPS Act, and the court chose to derive the meaning of “financing” through Concise Oxford Dictionary and Black’s Law Dictionary and found, “The allegations against the Applicant (Rhea) of spending money in procuring drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput will not, therefore, mean that she had financed illicit traffic.” While it chose a Supreme Court order and Black’s Law Dictionary to define “harbouring”, the court found that Rhea’s act could not be termed as “financing” or “harbouring”. Section 52-A of IPC can be used for a limited purpose as mentioned by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The key words in that Section are “to evade apprehension”, noted Justice Kotwal and added, “This only means that first of all there has to be another offender who has committed the offence. The person who is charged with harbouring the main offender should have supplied him with shelter, food etc.; and then the next requirement is that that second person should have done this to prevent the main offender’s apprehension.” In the present case, no criminal case or FIR was pending against Rajput. He was residing in his own house and was spending for his own food and other necessities. At that point of time, he had no apprehension of any arrest. “Therefore, the act on the part of the applicant (Chakraborty) cannot be stretched to attract the allegation of harbouring Rajput,” observed the single bench. Kotwal also refused to agree with the additional solicitor general Anil Singh who argued that “the celebrities and role models should be treated harshly so that it sets an example for the young generation and they do not get encouraged to commit such offences.” “I do not agree. Everybody is equal before law. No celebrity or role model enjoys any special privilege before the court of law,” observed Justice Kotwal, while adding, “Similarly, such person also does not incur any special liability when he faces law in the courts. Each case will have to be decided on its own merits, irrespective of the status of the accused.” The single bench also noted that the learned Special Judge under NDPS had observed that Chakraborty may alert others and evidence can be destroyed by them. “There is no basis for such observation,” observed justice Kotwal and went to write in the order that, “It is also important to note that when the applicant was produced before the court for her first remand, the investigating agency did not seek her custody. That means, they are satisfied with her interrogation and she had cooperated in that investigation.” After the order was pronounced, additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought stay of the order for at least one week. “This matter involves number of questions of law and therefore we want to test this order (before the Supreme Court),” said Singh. Justice Kotwal flatly rejected the request. “What do you want to test,” the judge asked Singh. “I have accepted your contention and held that all offences under the NDPS Act are non-bailable,” the judge added while rejecting the request. After Singh’s request, HC ordered Chakraborty to attend the nearest police station every day for ten days, so that she will easily available for re-arrest in case NCB succeeds in its challenge to the bail order. Meanwhile, the judge said that allegations that Showik was in direct contact with drug dealers Ike Abdel Basit Parihar, a last year student of architecture, whose bail application was also rejected on Wednesday, and at lease three others. “Monetary transactions are reflected in his account. The applicant (Showik) was facilitating procurement of drugs from one party, for supplying them to Rajput” said HC. “He was clearly involved in illicit trafficking or illegal trade of drugs. The applicant’s case will have to be distinguished from that of a consumer or an end purchaser.” Showik was arrested on September 4“We are delighted by the order of the Hon’ble Bombay HC, granting bail to Rhea Chakraborty. Truth and justice have prevailed and ultimately the submissions on facts and law have been accepted by justice Sarang V Kotwal,” said advocate Satish Maneshinde, who represented Rhea. “The arrest and custody of Rhea was totally unwarranted and beyond the reach of law. The hounding and witch hunt by three central agencies .. the CBI, ED and NCB of Rhea should come to an end” said Maneshinde. “We remain committed to Truth. Satya Meva Jayate.” Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14. After a case of alleged abetment of suicide was registered against Rhea by Rajput’s parents, a parallel probe into alleged drug procurement by her also began on the basis of her WhatsApp chats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-bombay-high-court-grants-bail-to-rhea-chakraborty/story-MflaV1SIPqURY1aAqpDdNK.html
08-10-2020||City||Farmers face tough time availing gate passes at Ambala mandi||On the day when Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel staged a symbolic protest outside the Haryana Vidhan Sabha against delay in paddy procurement in his segment, farmers at the New Grain Market on Hisar Road here faced a tough time to avail their gate passes. Most of the farmers HT spoke to on Wednesday expressed satisfaction with the process, but complained about the trouble they faced while obtaining the gate pass.They claimed they had to wait for three to four hours to get their ‘parchi’ and spend the entire day at the mandi to complete the procurement process. “I entered the mandi around 10am and got my turn to unload the crop at 12.30pm. There was a huge rush as many farmers had come as early as 6am,” Raghubir Singh, a farmer from Khaspura village said, adding that the procurement process, however, had significantly improved.Kulwant Singh from Chamaru village and Vipin Batra from Matehri village also shared similar complaints about the gate passes. An employee with Batra said, “Despite two entry gates at the mandi, the process to get the passes was too slow. We waited for four hours to get the passes for our seven trolleys.”Market board secretary Asha Rani accepted that the distribution of gate passes was slow. However, she said, “There had been server issues previously, but there was no such problem today.” Will protest with Goel: Mullana MLA VarunReacting on Goel’s dharna in Chandigarh, Congress MLA from Ambala’s Mullana segment Varun Chaudhary said, “Goel is my neighbour and if he sits on a protest again, I won’t hesitate to join.”“More importantly, he has accepted that farmers are anxious, but where are the ministers? This also shows that something is not right between the ally partners and we have also witnessed recently that MLAs from both sides are not happy with each other,” Varun added.Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Ambala unit chief Malkit Singh termed Goel’s protest ‘a political stunt’ and said, “He had to sit in Chandigarh as farmers have banned the BJP-JJP leaders from entering their villages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-face-tough-time-availing-gate-passes-at-ambala-mandi/story-WA3GA62dDKAENYWbnhaSKN.html
08-10-2020||City||New DTCP policy allows setting up of drive-in theatres, sports academies in Haryana||Gurugram: To streamline the setting up of ventures such as drive-in theatres, sports academies and banquet halls, the department of town and country planning (DTCP) has come up with guidelines to grant permission for a change of land use (CLU) to establish such projects outside municipal limits. The policy comes in the wake of interest expressed by landowners and investors, who wanted to set up such projects but waited for the government to define norms first. DTCP officials said CLU permission will be granted in areas marked as open space in the master plan. The policy will ensure construction of illegal buildings and development of unauthorised colonies by land owners is curbed. Explaining why the policy was formed, a DTCP official said that last year, one of the largest dirt-track racing companies in the world had expressed interest in setting up an entertainment project in the Gurugram but the project could not materialised. “There were other proposals also but due to lack of such a policy, these could not materialise. The new norms are very clear about the requirements and this will boost such investments,” the official said on condition of anonymity. Gurugram has only one drive-in theatre on Faridabad Road. There are a number of private sports grounds but most of these have come up on agriculture land. According to government norms, the policy allows setting up banquet halls, sports academies, drive-in theatres in a minimum area of two acres of land. There is no limit on the maximum area. The road approaching such a project in urban areas should be 18 metres wide. In rural area, a road of around nine metres will be required, the policy said.The maximum floor area ratio allowed is 0.5 and the maximum ground coverage is 35%. The policy provides a commercial component of 10% of FAR and 10% is allowed for guest rooms. Parking has to made available within the premises. Anil Rao, president, Gurugram Tent Dealers Association, said this was a positive development as it would provide a boost to the entertainment industry and banqueting. “The norms are clear and this will make it easier to.set up and run such projects,” he said. Apart from boosting investment, the department said, the policy will also curb large-scale violations seen in open space areas. Often, villagers who owned land there would construct houses, warehouses and other structures due to a lack of monitoring and suitable policy to allow proper use of land, officials said. In Gurugram, the enforcement wing of DTCP recently demolished 100 warehouses that had come up in sector 94, which is marked as open space, the officials said. Makrand Pandurang, director, town and country planning department, said the objective of this policy was to allow land owners to set up these projects in open space areas after taking permission. “There was no such policy earlier and it led to violations. Now owners can set up such projects alone or jointly after taking permission. It will boost investment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-dtcp-policy-allows-setting-up-of-drive-in-theatres-sports-academies-in-haryana/story-Hu4dyXmi6s1ra7tYhpDL3M.html
08-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Health teams to go door-to-door to administer deworming tablets||With no clarity on re-opening of schools in Gurugram, the district health department has planned a reach out and will hold deworming campaign for students aged between one and 19 years by conducting house-to-house visits. More than four lakh students are likely to be covered in these visits, which will take place between October 12 and October 20. The challenge, according to officials, will be rationing its workforce of healthcare workers, most of whom are already involved at the ground level in fighting the spread of Covid-19. Currently, teams of Accredited Social Health Activists ( ASHAs), Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANMs) and Anganwadi workers are involved in visiting home-isolated Covid patient every alternate day to check on them.Officials clarified that the health workers will not be visiting any of the 96 identified Covid-19 containment zones in the district to administer the deworming tablet – Elvendazone. Elvendazone is known to prevent the harmful effects of parasitic intestinal worm infection like roundworms, hookworms among others that are transmitted through soil contaminated with fecal matter. Chronic worm infestation leads to under-nutrition and anaemia in children. Before the outbreak of Covid, the deworming campaign had been carried out for a couple of days in schools and anganwadi centres and covered pre-school children and those aged between 1-19 years.However, it is for the first time, district health officials said, that the deworming campaign will last for a whole nine days as teams go from door-to-door . “For the first two days of the campaign, we will observe the working of the ground teams as it is for the first time that they will be visiting households on a mass scale to administer deworming tablets. Also, if there is any update on reopening of schools from October 15 in the state, then we will tweak our coverage strategy accordingly,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. He said that since the department has limited health staff, they will ask the administration to provide additional manpower by involving volunteers from non-government organisations (NGOs). The nodal team for the campaign said that preparations are underway. Sandeep Singh, adolescent health councillor, said, “At the primary health care centre (PHC) level, ASHAs and ANMs, already have certain number of households under them which they have to visit for health programmes. Based on that they have prepared a list of children, who are to be administered the deworming tablets.”According to Sangeeta Rathi, deputy civil surgeon and nodal officer for the deworming campaign, at present the district has a workforce of more than 2500 health workers, who will cover 461,534 children. “While administering the tablets, ASHAs and ANMs will also enquire about the health of the other family members to check for symptoms of Covid-19. “Any child with Influenza Like Illness (ILI) will not be administered the medicine and instead will be referred to the nearby PHC for a test. Each ASHA worker will cover over 1,000 households in the 9 days,” said Rathi.Yadav, on the other hand, said, “Through house to house visits, the teams might be able to trace new Covid-19 cases as well as they will be enquiring about the health of other family members for Covid-like symptoms||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-health-teams-to-go-door-to-door-to-administer-deworming-tablets/story-rIEtkDXhK81WfL5exRe6rK.html
08-10-2020||Mumbai||In Maharashtra, only 10, not 70, licences needed for hospitality business||In a boost to the tourism sector in Maharashtra and to attract more investments, the Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday approved the ease of doing business policy, bringing down the number of licences required to start a venture in the hospitality sector to 10, instead of the earlier 70. “Similarly, nine self-certifications will be required, instead of 15 no-objection certificates from seven departments,” a senior bureaucrat said, requesting anonymity. A statement from the chief minister’s office said: “With a significant decrease in permissions and licenses, it would boost the sector, bring in more investment and subsequently increase employment opportunities.” State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray in a tweet termed the decision “landmark” and said it was long overdue. The bureaucrat added that the tourism department is also setting up a single-window system for one online application for permissions to facilitate faster approvals. Riyaaz Amlani, CEO, Impresario Entertainment and Hospitality, and a member of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said it is a “move in the right direction”.”Hospitality industry is one of the most over-regulated industries. We need 32 different licences and NoCs to sell a sandwich. There are multiple licences and several duplications in it. We are highly grateful for this ease of doing business because a restaurant owner spends 50% of his time to liason with different government departments. This is a welcome move and offers a ray of hope for this beleaguered industry. Making it easier to set up restaurants and hotels will unleash the true potential of the employment generation capacity of this industry.” In another decision, the state cabinet also approved a proposal to seek financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to implement the High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) programme in the state. The ₹2,248-crore (USD 346 million) loan will help the state connect grids in rural areas which do not have a proper irrigation system and help farmers increase output. The Maharashtra government through Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) will secure counterpart funds worth USD 357.1 million towards the USD 703.1 million programme. The project will be implemented by the Maharashtra Energy Department MSEDCL. The state government approved the HVDS programme on May 5, 2018, for electrification of agricultural pumps. “The HVDS programme is being implemented through MSEDCL for all the agriculture pump farmers who have made the payment by March 31, 2018. Agriculture output in Maharashtra has been impacted due to lack of irrigation, inefficient use of electricity and water and availability of storage and market facilities,” said the bureaucrat. Restaurants and bars can remain open between 8am and 10pm The Maharashtra government on Wednesday said restaurants and bars can remain open from 8am till 10pm. The clarification was issued by the directorate of tourism following confusion over timings for operations of hotels, restaurants and bars started from October||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-maharashtra-only-10-not-70-licences-needed-for-hospitality-business/story-JhfUOFzG8HlFGoZ0BWpYGI.html

No firm exists on the given address and the mobile number, along with the email ID given in the registration form, is also wrong,” he said. “Bills worth ₹12.43 crore were issued from December 2018 to November 2019. He had transferred input tax worth ₹2.23 crore to firms in other states, thus causing a loss to the state’s revenue,” Kumar alleged. An FIR under sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the IPC was registered against the accused at the Ambala City police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-man-booked-for-2-crore-gst-fraud-in-ambala/story-KOvZuG8iFFSQC6WtTb8KhP.html
08-10-2020||City||Drive-through testing facility, 3 special centres launched in Mohali||Punjab Youth Development Board chairperson Sukhjinder Bindra on Wednesday inaugurated a drive-through testing facility and three special open-air testing centres in Mohali. The drive-through facility has come up at the sports stadium in Sector 78 while the open-air centres have been set up in Phase 6, Kharar and Lohgarh. Bindra said that maximum people should avail benefit from these centres and come forward for Covid-19 testing to make ‘Mission Fateh’ a success.With the addition of these facilities, the Mohali administration has augmented the testing centres in the district to facilitate maximum public footfall, said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan.“Aggressive Covid-19 sampling mandates ample testing facilities. So, we have increased the testing centres. To allay the public fear of going to hospitals, the new testing centres have been set up in open air,” said Dayalan. One open-air testing centre each has come up at Shaheed Major Harminderpal Singh Government College in Mohali’s Phase 6, Ram Bhawan at Kharar’s Dussehra Ground and Lohgarh Government Senior Secondary School. Now, the district has total 13 Covid-19 government testing centres which are being complemented by 16 private testing centres and six authorised labs, the DC said. At the drive-through facility at GMADA sports complex in Sector 78, people can arrive at the testing location in their vehicles. They can register themselves at the entry gate and drive to the sampling counter to give the swab without disembarking from the vehicle. The entire exercise takes about five minutes and the test result is conveyed through a message on phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/drive-through-testing-facility-3-special-centres-launched-in-mohali/story-ADE1g3nTbpgWEfnCTEjLLP.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||We are going to be more aggressive this year to fight pollution: Gopal Rai||As the air quality in the national capital turned ‘poor’ on Wednesday, for the first time since June this year, HT spoke to Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on the government’s action plan to control pollution, which coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, may pose a big public health crisis. Excerpts:Q. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a mega plan to control pollution. How is it going to be different from your efforts in the past to reduce pollution?A. We have been working on it for the past five years and have become the first state to have reduced pollution levels by 25% despite increasing traffic and economic activity. This year, because of the pandemic, we are going to be even more aggressive. We are working on a war footing. Unlike last year, we have prepared specific action plans to target major sources of pollution. For instance, an anti-dust campaign has already been launched. Then we have initiated preparation of an anti-stubble burning solution, which will be sprayed across 800 hectares of farmland in Delhi where crop residue is burnt. Q. But farmers have said that they know little about the new technology. Do you think that the drive should have been launched at least a month ahead of the harvest period?A. We had been pursuing it for a long time with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, who have developed the technology. The consultations had been going on for long but due to the pandemic, the work was slightly delayed. We have already started creating awareness and around 1,200 farmers have already registered with us for spraying the solution in their fields. We will also ensure that harvest and sowing is not delayed. The farmers can start sowing rabi crops within three days of the solution being sprayed on the field. It will also increase the fertility of the soil. We will set an example for neighbouring states on how to curb stubble burning.Q. The construction activities are picking up slowly after the Covid-induced lockdown. How do you plan to implement the ban on construction, under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap)?A. This year the situation is peculiar because of the lockdown and the resultant economic slowdown. Now that economic activity has started picking up gradually, we will have to consider all aspects. We will not take any step without having a dialogue with the people. We will find out a way to resolve the situation as and when it arises and with proper public consultation.Q. Last year, the odd-even road rationing scheme was announced in October. Any plans of introducing it this year given the fact that public transport has resumed fully now?A. Again, this year is different because of the pandemic. It is a measure taken in emergency-like situations. Also, since we are familiar with the implementation strategy now, even if it has to be brought in, it won’t take us long to prepare. This year, we have added 1,200 new buses to the state-run fleet and, therefore, implementation should not be an issue. However, currently there are no talks to implement the odd-even plan.Q. You said Delhi reduced pollution by 25% over the past five years. What are the major focus areas to reduce it further in the future?A. We have set long-term goals to reduce air pollution levels even further. These include increasing the green cover with massive plantation drives. Even this year, despite the pandemic, we are certain to complete our target of planting 31 lakh saplings by March 2021. Also, the tree transplantation policy is to be approved soon. Experiments have already been done in several areas, where it has been a success. Though there are some problems as well because of different soil conditions at different locations, but they will be resolved in due time. Besides, the electric vehicle (EV) policy is a major step in reducing vehicular emissions and we hope to achieve our target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/we-are-going-to-be-more-aggressive-this-year-to-fight-pollution-gopal-rai/story-hprTks6dudxwiyes9pJnQO.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||Air quality poor, may deteriorate further||Delhi’s air quality entered the ‘poor’ zone on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index on Wednesday -- the first time since June 28, according to the data maintained as per CPCB’s daily AQI bulletin.When air is in the poor zone (AQI value between 201-300) most people can experience breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure, according to the central pollution watchdog. As per the CPCB bulletin, Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI) was 215 on Wednesday with PM2.5 and PM10 being the prominent pollutants. If inhaled, the fine particulate matter can settle in the breathing tract and lungs and studies have shown that it is associated with increased cardiovascular disease.As the air quality in the Capital plunged, the CPCB wrote to Delhi chief secretary, stating that complaints of waste burning and dumping of construction and demolition waste are not being addressed expeditiously. “As many as 1,228 (40%) of the 3,041 complaints regarding these issues received on social media portal are yet to be resolved. Please take swift action to address these complaints and abate air pollution in Delhi,” stated the letter dated October 6.Bhure Lal, chief of the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), said, “We are observing the air quality trends. A meeting regarding implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) with state governments of Delhi-NCR to curb the deteriorating air quality is scheduled on Thursday.” Delhi witnesses a spike in air pollution every year during winter due to a combination of changing meteorological conditions which makes dispersion of pollutants difficult and burning of crop stubble in the neighbouring states. The Epca enforces several mitigating measures under Grap such as sprinkling of water on roads, ban on construction and use of diesel generator (DG) sets, depending on the severity of pollution levels.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the Central government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, Delhi’s air may deteriorate further till October 10, still remaining in the poor zone though. “Further deterioration in AQI is expected by October 9-10 but it may stay in the poor category. An increase in stubble burning was observed yesterday (Tuesday) around Punjab and Haryana. The wind direction and speed are favourable for transport and accumulation of pollutants in Delhi and worsening of air quality in the coming days is expected,” the Safar bulletin said.According to the Safar bulletin, 336 fire fires were reported across the northern region on Tuesday.This year, after January and February, which had several ‘poor’ days, only two ‘poor’ category days were recorded each in the months of March, May and June. Previously, Delhi had recorded ‘poor’ air quality on June 28 with an AQI of 209 and on June 29 with AQI value of 230. April, July, August and September had only ‘satisfactory’ and ‘moderate’ days. In fact, August was the cleanest month since 2015 when four ‘good’ air days were recorded.“The weather is slowly transitioning to winter. There are calm winds during the early morning hours. The wind speed picks up only during the day and gain slow down by evening. The average wind speed during the day was 15-16 kmph. The wind speed as well as both day and night temperatures will further reduce after October 15. The calm winds and falling mercury coupled with smoke from stubble burning is not favourable for dispersion of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-poor-may-deteriorate-further/story-OphPqjF0bKtHgUuLI38lWM.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||Daring Cities 2020: Kejriwal speaks on EV policy, odd-even scheme at global meet on climate change||Addressing an international summit on climate change, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday expanded on his government’s recent electric vehicle (EV) policy, the new crop stubble decomposer and other measures taken to tackle air pollution in the national capital over the past few years. Addressing the ‘Daring Cities 2020’ virtual conference, Kejriwal also spoke about how his government had shut thermal power plants and introduced the odd-even road space rationing scheme in order to reduce pollution in Delhi during the winter months.The conference is being hosted in Germany and is a forum for global leaders to interact on how they are tackling climate change, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Kejriwal was invited to address the delegates, alongside urban leaders and decision-makers from Bogota (Colombia), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Los Angeles (USA), and Entebbe (Uganda), and also to discuss multilevel action needed to tackle climate emergency and ensure environment sustainability, the CM’s office said in a statement.“During the past five years in Delhi, we have taken several measures to tackle the twin problems of climate change and air pollution. This has resulted in a reduction in pollution by 25% , in terms of average PM 2.5 levels. Some of the main initiatives that we took were the introduction of the odd-even scheme, the closure of thermal power plants, the ban on the use of polluting fuels, and the launch of a mega green drive,” Kejriwal said.He further said, “Our aim is to make Delhi the EV capital of the world. The Delhi government has recently notified a very progressive EV policy that will enable large-scale transition to EV vehicles -- 25% of all new vehicles by 2024 will be EVs. With a mix of financial incentives, creation of citywide charging infrastructure, and extra fee/taxes on polluting vehicles, we are laying the ground for the wide adoption of EVs in Delhi. The policy has been widely appreciated and it is our dream to put Delhi among the top cities globally in terms of adoption of electric vehicles.”“In an effort to devise sustainable solutions to crop stubble burning, we have joined hands with Indian Agricultural Research Institute to introduce the bio-decomposer technique. Every winter, in north India, millions of tonnes of crop stubble is burnt in fields at the end of the harvesting season. This is done since there is very little time left between the harvesting of one crop and the sowing of the next. And with a lack of other viable alternatives, farmers are compelled to burn the crop stubble to be immediately rid of it,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/daring-cities-2020-kejriwal-speaks-on-ev-policy-odd-even-scheme-at-global-meet-on-climate-change/story-n6iHUrCYNXajKsV2mdW5YJ.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi records most new Covid cases in 5 days, but testing dips yet again||Delhi reported the highest number of new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in five days on Wednesday, even as testing fell by over 2,000 from the previous day. The Capital added 2,871 new cases of the viral infection on Wednesday, pushing the positivity rate back over 5% after a single day dip. Positivity rate is the fraction of samples that test positive among total tested and reflects the trends in ongoing transmission.According to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region. The positivity rate on Wednesday stood at 5.57%, an increase from 4.99% a day before — the first time in several months that the number fell below 5%. Even though the number of new cases have declined from the peak of around 4,400 cases in mid-September, the city continues to report an average of 2,627 cases over the week. The number of tests, however, have gone down since then. In the 11 days between September 9 and 19, when the Capital added a daily average of 4,160 new cases, the city collected a daily average of 58,485 samples for Covid-19 tests. However, around 49,000 tests for detecting the infection were done during the last seven days, while over 54,600 were done the week before that. The number of RT-PCR tests, considered the most accurate diagnosis of the infection, dropped marginally as well on Wednesday. In any case, the gold standard tests only account for 18% of the total tests. The rapid antigen tests that are widely used are cheap, easy to perform and give results within 15 minutes. However, they are more likely to throw false negatives. On average 9,232 RT-PCR tests were performed over the last seven days as compared to an average of 10,203 a week before. The Delhi high court had rapped the government for not using its entire capacity of 14,000 RT-PCR tests a day. The Delhi government had also communicated to the district authorities in the third week of September that there should be no lapse in testing every symptomatic person using the RT-PCR method. This came after they found data of 1,400 symptomatic people who were not checked using the more accurate test. “The RT-PCR test is more accurate and will be better reflective of the situation on the ground. If the number of cases are going up or down we will come to know if we are performing a lot of RT-PCR tests. The rapid antigen tests did help in scaling up, but there are set guidelines for where these tests should be done and that has to be adhered to,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at ICMR. “The number of cases might have gone down for now, but there should be no laxity in control measures. This is because the cases of most respiratory illnesses go up during the winters – people are in close proximity within enclosed spaces increasing the risk of transmission. The immunity also goes down when there is a dip in temperature making people more susceptible to all kinds of infections,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, head of the department of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/most-new-covid-cases-in-5-days-but-testing-dips-yet-again/story-qBGFDAgApSrooUxG8oPeUN.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi allows cinema halls with 50% capacity, opens all weekly markets||The Delhi government on Wednesday permitted reopening of cinemas, theatres and multiplexes with up to 50% of their seating capacity from October 15 and allowed all weekly markets to function in the city with immediate effect.An order announcing the fresh relaxations was issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday. All such establishments, however, will remain closed in Covid-19 containment zones, the order said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter that the decision to reopen weekly markets, in particular, would benefit the poor, who relied on them for employment.“Now all weekly markets in Delhi will open. Till now, only two markets per zone per day were allowed. Poor people will get a lot of relief from the markets being reopened. Cinema halls will also open from October 15. They have to follow guidelines issued by the Centre,” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.The DDMA’s decision came after the Centre on Tuesday issued guidelines regarding the operation of movie theatres and multiplexes. In Delhi, cinema halls, multiplexes and theatres are shut since March 12, much before the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25 to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The standard operating procedures (SOPs) for reopening of cinemas, issued by the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) ministry, make it mandatory to have a six-foot distance between people watching films. It mandates staggered entry and exits from cinema halls, including intervals. Also Read | Arvind Kejriwal announces further relaxations for weekly markets, cinemas to reopen from October 15Sanitisation of halls after each screening is mandatory. Seats have to be left vacant for social distancing and marked with fluorescent markers and crowding in lobbies, common areas, and lifts is barred. The guidelines suggest longer intermissions to allow audiences seated in different rows to move in a staggered manner.Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Cinemas, said they will follow the global standards of health and sanitisation which have been planned by the company in consultation with the Global Cinema Federation.“We are all set to reopen in a phased manner, wherein the first phase beginning from October 15 will focus on rebuilding the trust in customers to normalise stepping out of their homes. Our idea is to give our consumers sufficient opportunity and reason to act as both, our health inspectors and auditors as well as our evangelists. We have some very promising content lined up in the coming months and are currently extremely grateful for all the developments in the favour of our industry,” said Dutta.The multiplex association of India said in a statement: “We are committed to ensuring a safe, secure and hygienic cinema-going experience for the movie lovers…The permission from the Delhi governments to reopen cinemas will help to ensure that the cinema exhibition sector is able to quickly recover from the dire economic and financial impact of the epidemic. We look forward to welcoming back moviegoers to a safe and amazing brand-new experience at our cinemas.”Weekly markets, the DDMA stated, will be selected by a joint team of district magistrate, district, DCP and zonal deputy commissioners of municipal corporations in consultation with resident welfare associations of the areas.“In case it is observed by the joint team of officers that any weekly market is unable to function on its fixed/regular place or at roadside due to obstruction to traffic, strictly as per the SOP/guidelines of DDMA, then such weekly market can be allowed to function at some other nearby ground/school ground, purely on a temporary basis, where the SOP/guidelines of DDMA can be strictly implemented. If it is found in any market that vendors and/or customers are not following the instructions prescribed in SOP, such market shall be closed forthwith,” it said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-allows-cinema-halls-with-50-capacity-opens-all-weekly-markets/story-hVDw4TOfJt5tXdOH8rxhMP.html

08-10-2020||Delhi||Focus on students who are still out of contact with online learning, DoE tells govt schools, district officials||The Directorate of Education (DoE) has asked district education officers and principals of all government schools to focus on students who are not attending online classes and are out of touch with their teachers and lessons ever since physical classes were suspended in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.According to an education department official, who requested anonymity, at least 5.5% of the 15.5 lakh students in government schools are completely out of contact with their teachers and are not attached to virtual learning in any manner. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, schools across Delhi are conducting classes online, and sending links for study materials via WhatsApp and emails and as text messages. According to the minutes of a DoE coordination committee meeting held on October 1, DoE director Udit Prakash asked all district education officers to focus on students who are not reverting to WhatsApp communications with respect to online classes. The district education officers also held several meetings with heads of government schools over the past few weeks asking them to step up measures to trace students who are totally out of touch with teachers and online classes. One such meeting was held in district north-west-B on Monday.Keeping in mind that not all have access to gadgets and internet connectivity, government schools have also started giving out hard copies of assignment sheets to students -- these are collected from school once every week. However, despite all efforts, several schools said some students could not be reached either on phone or via SMS and WhatsApp.The senior official from the education department, quoted above, said of the 15-lakh odd students in government schools, 89% are in contact with teachers over phone or WhatsApp. About 5.5% are students who collect hard copies of assignments from schools as they do not have internet connectivity/devices. The remaining 5.5%, the official said, are completely out of contact with teachers and not in any way attached to virtual learning. “Even of the 89% that are connected via WhatsApp or phone, only 70% are responding to teachers’ directions and submitting their worksheets online. The remaining 11% are receiving messages and calls but not participating in the online education. The DoE has directed all schools to step up measures to engage all students in virtual education. Schools have also been asked to make more effort to trace out-of-contact students,” the official said. On August 30, HT had reported that several government schools are making extra efforts to reach out to such students. Besides, sending letters and assignments to their postal addresses, school officials are making door-to-door visits in residential areas and resorting to loudspeaker announcements. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini’s Sector 8, said 60 to 65 of his students were still out of contact. “We have sent out staff to the postal addresses of these students and also sent letters to their permanent addresses in Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. But 60 to 65 students are still untraceable,” he said.Officials said a majority of out-of-contact students are those who have left for their home states after their parents lost their jobs to the lockdown. Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV) in Tilak Nagar, said that around 26 of her students, enrolled in classes 6 to 8, continued to remain out of touch. “All of them are not living at the addresses mentioned in school records. Their phone numbers are either not working or have changed,” she said. The schools managed to trace some students who were missing online classes by forming area-wise teams comprising support staff and the school management committee (SMC) members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/focus-on-students-who-are-still-out-of-contact-with-online-learning-doe-tells-govt-schools-district-officials/story-K9iOKU2OrSgnCm1N30xOnN.html
08-10-2020||Delhi||Cluster bus driver involved in two accidents, one of them fatal, held for driving drunk||Police have arrested the driver of a cluster bus that was involved in a fatal hit-and-run accident in north Delhi’s Kashmere Gate on October 1, after their probe and eyewitness accounts revealed that the 45-year-old driver was allegedly drunk at the time of the accident.Police said they questioned scores of potential eyewitnesses and checked the GPS data of multiple cluster buses to zero in on the errant driver, identified as Pardeep alias Nagraj, who had fled the scene of accident.On October 1, the Kashmere Gate police had responded to a call from a passerby and reached the Kashmere Gate Metro station to find a man, a pedestrian, crushed to death. He was identified as 33-year-old Sanjay, the father of three children and a resident of Maujpur in north-east Delhi. He worked as a clerk with a private firm in Chandni Chowk.Police said Nagraj may have gone scot-free had it not been for another accident that his bus was involved in, in west Delhi’s Mayapuri, soon after the one in Kashmere Gate.“In Mayapuri, his bus collided with a truck. He was caught and the bus seized. Nagraj’s medical examination after that accident revealed that he driving under the influence,” said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north).The marshal and conductor on the bus also said Nagraj was driving in an inebriated condition. “They told us that they had refused to board the bus that night as he was drunk,” the DCP said. Although it is against the rules to ply a cluster bus without the conductor and marshal present on board, Nagraj went ahead anyway, police saidNagraj, police said, was previously involved in 13 other crimes, including murder, attempt to murder and even two cases of fatal accidents. While he was acquitted in both fatal accident cases, he was convicted in a case registered under the Arms Act, the police said. How such a person managed to gain employment as driver of a cluster bus is being ascertained, police said.Police said when CCTV footage failed to provide actionable leads in the Kashmere Gate hit-and-run case, they started speaking to potential eyewitnesses. “We managed to find a few eyewitnesses who said the accident was caused by a cluster bus. After the accident, the bus took a U-turn and travelled on the wrong side of the road,” said the DCP.So, the police got a list of 30 such cluster buses which had left the Mori Gate terminal around the time of the accident. “We checked the GPS locations and movement of all those buses and found that one plying on Route Number 753 had taken a U-turn and travelled on the wrong side of the road,” Alphonse said.Once details of the driver was obtained, Nagraj was arrested from his home in Issapur village in outer Delhi on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cluster-bus-driver-involved-in-two-accidents-one-of-them-fatal-held-for-driving-drunk/story-B9RlKBoHaonmP4WmyoanqM.html

08-10-2020||Pune||Centre-state blame game leaves insurance claim of 57 pvt docs in Maharashtra on paper||Pune: Insurance applications of at least 57 doctors from Maharashtra, who lost their lives while on duty, have been rejected by the state government at the local level. All 57 doctors died after contracting the Covid-19 infection. The state government is now blaming the Centre for not insuring private hospitals, while the Centre says it does not differentiate on such a basis. Doctors from across the state had applied for the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package – the insurance scheme for healthcare workers fighting Covid-19. Of the 57 deceased doctors, 17 are from Mumbai, 13 from Thane, and six from Pune. The insurance scheme provides insurance cover to healthcare providers, including community health workers, who may be in direct contact with, and taking care of, Covid-19 patients, and who are at high risk of Covid-19 infection. The scheme provides a life insurance benefit of Rs 50 lakh for death due to Covid-19 infection or accidental death during Covid-19-related duty. However, the claims of doctors from private hospitals who applied under the scheme, have been rejected at the state-level. The reason cited in an official document which HT is in possession of, is: “The said doctor was working in a private hospital and was not working in any local civic body DCH, DCHC or CCC, and so, the doctor is not found eligible under the said insurance guidelines.” While the state officials claim that the central government scheme does not cover doctors practising in private hospitals, the Central government’s ministry of family and welfare clarified that the scheme covers all doctors irrespective of private and public hospitals. Sadanand Rawat, additional personal secretary to Harsh Vardhan, Union minister of health and family welfare, said, “I have checked the guidelines of the policy and it does not differentiate between doctors working in private and public hospitals. The scheme is applicable for all in case there is any particular case then that can be investigated. If the state has anything in writing where the central government has stated that the scheme is not applied for doctors working in private hospitals, then they can send it to us. Our scheme does not exempt anyone, be it private or public; doctor is a doctor and we have no partiality.” Another officer from the Union ministry of health, who was part of drafting and sending out the letter to state secretaries, requesting anonymity, said, “The guidelines are quite clear and they are followed. Also, I believe that the matter is now sub-judice as one of the widows of a doctor has taken up the matter in the court.” IMA, in its statement issued to the press, said: “In the official meeting held on 11th August 2020 with the representatives of IMA, Health Minister of Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope had also agreed that the insurance of Rs 50 lakh would be applied to all the private doctors. Accordingly, on 17th August 2020, Dr Sudhakar Shinde, (IRS) Chief Executive Officer, Maharashtra State Public Health Department, State Health Insurance Society, issued a circular in this regard.” Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, IMA Maharashtra chapter, said, “The same government which threatens to take action against doctors under MESMA act for not providing services for Covid-19 patients, or even shutting clinics during the pandemic, is now rejecting claims of all the doctors. We had asked the state government to send condolence letters to the bereaved families and also decorate these warriors to boost the morale of the community. Instead, now, the claims are being rejected despite the fact that a circular has been issued in place for the same.” Dr Shinde, CEO, State Health Insurance Society, said, “I do not look after the package and it is a central government scheme. It is my job to forward the letters that come to the concerned departments. The central government is now saying that the scheme will only be applicable to those who worked in government hospitals or those that the state government later requisitioned to Covid centres. I have only communicated this decision. The families can approach the central government since the scheme belongs to the central ministry. The definition of Covid warriors is defined by the central government. The director of health services is handling this issue.” Dr Archana Patil, director of health services said, “The guidelines framed by the government of India states that only those private doctors, whose services have been requisitioned by the state government, only those would be applicable in its original letter. We cannot change it. Earlier, the claims we were sending to the central health ministry were being rejected. During our weekly meetings too we have raised the issue, but the insurance scheme is already formulated and maybe, now they are not able to change it. So we are not sending the claims. We truly believe that private hospitals are doctors and should also be covered under this insurance. To repeatedly send the claims which do not fit into the central government’s guidelines would not be right.” She also said that currently there is no such scheme offered by the state government currently. She further added, “Currently about 20% of the Covid-19 patients are admitted in private hospitals and the remaining are in medical education, government hospitals or local civic bodies. Of the total active patients now, about 68% are admitted in various hospitals and the remaining are in home isolation.” She also added that the state government has sent about 76 proposals which have been received, of which 19 have been approved, 31 are ineligible and 25 are under process. These 76 include all the proposal claims, including private and public hospitals. She added, “We have approved claims of three doctors from private hospitals as the hospitals were requisitioned by the government, of which two were in Mumbai and one was in Pune.” Dr Bhondwe said, “The state government is putting the blame on the central government, if that is the case then why are they rejecting the claims instead of putting them on hold.” The guidelines mentioned by the central government states, “public healthcare providers including community health workers, who may have to be in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and who may be at risk of being impacted by this. Private hospital staff and retired /volunteer/localurban bodies/ contracted/daily wage/ad-hoc/outsourced staff requisitioned by States/Central hospitals/autonomous hospitals of Central/ States/UTs, AIIMS and INIs/ hospital of Central Ministries can also be drafted for Covid-19 related responsibilities” are covered under the insurance scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-state-blame-game-leaves-insurance-claim-of-57-pvt-docs-in-maha-on-paper/story-eZ3qH3BMWcsfwuVZh3NZzO.html

08-10-2020||Pune||Covid impact: 2K of 8.5K restaurants open; several shut shop for good in Pune||PUNE: Many restaurants in the city have closed down permanently owing to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as the state government allowed restaurants and bars to restart business after six months. Of the 8,500 restaurants associated with Pune hoteliers association in Pune city, only 2,000 have resumed their services. The dine-in services at restaurants and bars were resumed across Maharashtra from October 5 with 50 per cent customer capacity. Some of the restaurant owners said that they had to take drastic steps as business was severely hit during the lockdown with limited orders unable to cover even 20% of rent and staff salaries. Among the issues listed out by various restaurant owners that led to closing down of eateries in the city are financial burden in view of bank loan, unable to pay rent, salaries of staff and maintenance of restaurant. Sarika Bhagat, the owner of Rayat non-veg hotel in Shaniwar peth area, one of the popular non-vegetarian food outlets in the city that closed down during the lockdown period, said, “We had three restaurants in the city before the lockdown and all premises were on rent. During the lockdown, it became difficult to manage rent, salaries and maintenance of all the three food joints. We had to close down our main restaurant in Shaniwar peth and another hotel near Sarasbaug area. We are running only one restaurant and that too with the help of family members.” Veg Marathon, a restaurant on Tilak road near Swargate chowk, also could not survive the lockdown. Its owner requesting anonymity said, “I was earlier working in another restaurant as manager and quit the job to start my own restaurant. We had hardly started the restaurant for a couple of months and the lockdown began in March. I was left with no option, but to down shutters as I had taken loan and borrowed money to start the restaurant.” On Bajirao road, another outlet, Kiga ice cream, has also been closed down due to lockdown. Besides finance, shortage of staff after workers returning to their hometowns during lockdown have also added to the issues that many restaurant owners face to resume business. Vaishali and Roopali, the two prominent restaurants on Fergusson College road, have not restarted due to shortage of workers. Abhishek Shetty, the owner of Kalinga’s Veg Gourmet restaurant at Erandwane, said, “There are multiple issues, including shortage of staff, that has left us to decide to not reopen.” Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association (PRHA) president Ganesh Shetty said, “It’s been three days since restaurants and bars are allowed to restart the dine-in services, but not all of them have resumed. Out of the total 8,500 major restaurants in the city, only around 2,000 have started. Most of them are yet to restart. Many have cited costly rents, financial crunch to pay staff salaries as reasons for permanently closing down. More food joints will reopen once staff return from their hometowns.”Rohan Nalawade, owner of Tasty Punjab veg non-veg restaurant in Katraj, said, “We were running the restaurant in partnership since last three years and during the lockdown we had to shut it down. Initially for a month we thought that we will survive and restart, but as the lockdown got extended we were left with no option but to close down. The rent was very high and few of our staff had stayed back in Pune, so we had to pay them as well. We finally closed the restaurant in May.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-impact-many-restaurants-permanently-closed-some-may-take-time-to-resume-business-in-pune/story-KJeTrg1JYH9oWaIyFsxuMP.html

Civic officials said that the trials will be carried out within two months. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) initiated the Bhama Askhed water pipeline project in 2014. It was designed to meet the drinking water needs of 14.5 lakh residents of eastern Pune. As per the plan, a 42-km pipeline will be laid from the Bhama-Askhed dam to Pune. The dam is located near Chakan Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). According to PMC, the lake tapping work was completed when the city was under Covid lockdown. Lake tapping involves the excavation of a tunnel from the bottom of the lake for the water to flow down the tunnel. PMC executive engineer Sudesh Kadu said, “Only 500 metres of the total 42 km water pipeline work is remaining. With the help of police protection, PMC completed the 10 km pipeline work near the dam. Around 200 metres of the pipeline work near the dam that connects to the jackwell is yet to be completed and another 300 metres work is remaining in Pimpri-Chinchwad area. As land acquisition work is not done for roads, PMC is unable to lay pipelines. We are awaiting the land acquisition clearance to lay pipeline in Pimpri-Chinchwad area.” Kadu said that as the project is extensive running into 42 kms, many trials will have to be carried out before getting the final go-ahead. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “Though the administration is busy handling the Covid pandemic, we pushed many development works. The delayed Bhama Askhed water project is nearing completion. Even farmers are now cooperating to complete the project.” Benefitting residents The 42-km water pipeline that is laid from Bhama-Askhed dam to Pune will address the water needs of residents living in eastern Pune mainly Ahmednagar road, Wadgaon Sheri, Kharadi and Kalyaninagar areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhama-askhed-dam-water-project-with-95-work-complete-pmc-plans-to-begin-trials-in-two-months/story-sQ7WI4N7gYGJJ4wkqr4i2N.html
