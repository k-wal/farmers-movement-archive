BMC wary of Covid-19 cases surge in Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday expressed concern about a spike in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai after the Maharashtra government proposed to the Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR) to let all commuters use the suburban train services. The civic body said allowing the general public to use local trains around Diwali is likely to lead to a surge in Covid-19 infections, as people are more likely to then step out during the festive season. “One cannot deny that there is likely to be a surge in Covid-19 cases because of the state government’s proposed move. Public is expected to mingle and go out for their Diwali shopping,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (AMC), BMC. “Wearing of masks, sanitising hands and other precautionary measures must be complied with.”The government on Wednesday had written to the general managers of both zonal railways and proposed three time slots during the day for general commuters, while two time slots for essential services staff. The government had also sought a ladies special train every hour.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s Covid-19 taskforce, said, “We need to understand that train services are already functional and we are increasing the load now by opening for all. There are time slots for it and it should not be an issue. “But, we need to be careful and cautious, and masking and sanitsation should be followed. At the same time, overcrowding at stations and inside trains should not happen.”The WR and CR, in their resp-onses to the state’s proposal, had on Thursday sent letters raising concerns about overcrowding. In its letter, WR suggested capping daily passengers to 9.6 lakh and wrote, “Even if we start all 1,367 local train services, we can transport a maximum of 9.6 lakh passengers daily, which is much less than the 35 lakh passengers who were travelling in the pre-Covid regime.” CR told the state it can transport 12.4 lakh passengers daily if all 1,774 of its local train services resume. Approximately 45 lakh passengers travelled daily by CR prior to the lockdown. “Hence, the state government needs to take a call for means of transportation for the balance 33 lakh passengers,” states CR’s letter. The state, however, said these concerns are unwarranted as guidelines are in place to restrict the number of commuters.Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said the Railways should not play politics over the issue. He said the state has taken “every precaution to avoid the crowding in the trains”, despite which the Railways is raising doubts over operations. “Railways should cooperate with the state government in the interest of commuters in Mumbai,” said Deshmukh.Meanwhile, Joshi said along with further unlocking, the government also plans to increase testing. “Currently, BMC is testing around 15,000 samples daily and it is trying to reach 20,000 tests daily by optimising capacity. Lastly, citizens should still understand that we should go out only when it’s for a purpose, and avoid when not necessary.”The BMC, too, plans to ramp up its daily testing mechanism after the state government’s proposed move. The civic body plans to organise free testing camps in Mumbai. “We have sufficient hospital beds that can cope up with a possible spike in Covid-19 cases,” Kakani said.Medical experts feel people need to be responsible and follow norms to avoid catching the infection, as number of cases rising is inevitable. Subhasree Ray, clinical nutritionist and public health professional, said, “Post the festive season, there will be an inevitable rise in Covid-19 cases. Until there’s a vaccine, the focus should be on enhanced testing, early detection and hospitalisation, preventing complications and mortality. Most importantly, citizens must not behave complacently and adhere to basic preventive protocols to avoid contracting the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/local-trains-for-all-diwali-to-coincide-bmc-wary-of-covid-19-cases-surge-in-mumbai/story-JRPIyJVzHUc5XHwYKGIkaK.html

According to sources, it was Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari who had asked Thackeray during their meeting to speak to Pawar on the issue. “Rajsaheb has sought time to meet Pawar. He has also apprised Pawar of the difficulties faced by citizens [owing to the inflated bills] and stressed the need for the state government to intervene into the issue and provide relief to the people,” said an MNS leader. The inflated power bills have led to wide-spread resentment among citizens. Thackeray had in July written to his cousin and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking him to resolve the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-navnirman-sena-chief-raj-thackeray-raises-issue-of-inflated-power-bills-with-sharad-pawar/story-OFItJFk7BQ45XvscfOqc0N.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man booked for hiding his baldness to get married||A 29-year-old man from Mira Road and his family members were recently booked for cheating by Naya Nagar police, based on a complaint from his 27-year- old wife that he had hidden the fact that he was bald. “The main accused got married to the complainant, a chartered accountant, in September this year. The woman later discovered that he was bald and had been wearing a wig,” said Kailash Barve, senior inspector of Naya Nagar police station. The woman took up the issue with her in-laws and alleged that they had cheated her by not informing her about her husband’s baldness. On Tuesday, she approached the Naya Nagar police station and filed a complaint against her husband and his family members. She also alleged that her in-laws were harassing her for more dowry. She told police that her husband was suspicious of her and would hacked into her phone and check her chats and call records. She claimed he also performed forced unnatural sexual acts on her, said Barve.“We have booked the husband and his parents under sections 498 (enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent of a married woman), 377 (unnatural sex), 406 (breach of trust), and 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 66 and 66(c) of the Information Technology (IT) Act,” said Barve. “While the other accused got anticipatory bail, the Thane court rejected the husband’s bail application and ordered him to surrender before the police. We will arrest him in a day or two,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-booked-for-hiding-his-baldness-to-get-married/story-PYrLbuRjVjlfEUTOV3RUvI.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police book 3 for duping 19 people of ₹1 crore in investment fraud||Sir JJ Marg police are on the lookout for three men who have been booked for allegedly duping 19 people of ₹1 crore though a fraudulent investment scheme. The victims were promised that they would earn double the amount they invested in a period of nine months in the scheme. The police suspect that the trio may have duped many more people, but they may have not filed a police complaint. The complainant in the case, 45-year-old Naeem Ismail Shaikh, is a businessman from Teli Mohalla, Nagpada. In his complaint (of which HT has a copy), Shaikh said that in 2017 a man named Haji Nasib Ali, whom he knew through his business contacts, informed the complainant about a “money doubling scheme”. Ali told Shaikh that he knew two people, identified as Amir and Rizwan, who can double the investment money in three months. The police have not disclosed the real names of the accused. At first, Shaikh did not believe Ali, but later he told the complainant that Amir and Rizwan own a big tool cutting store at Chor Bazaar. After Ali told him that he himself got his money doubled through the scheme, Shaikh decided to invest money in the scheme. In January 2017, Ali introduced Shaikh to Amir and Rizwan. On Ali’s insistence, Shaikh then invested ₹5 lakh and earned ₹10 lakh after three through the scheme. Shaikh again invested money in the scheme and also informed his relatives and friends about it, following which seven more people invested their money. However, Amir and Rizwan told them that they would get the money doubled in nine months on this occasion. However, after nine months, when the investors did not get their money back, they tried to contact the three accused. At first they kept delaying the payment and later stopped answering the calls. The investors also discovered that the shop that Ali said belonged to Amir and Rizwan was actually owned by someone else. After trying to contact them for several months, Shaikh finally lodged a police complaint against the three. “We have registered a case of cheating and investment fraud worth ₹40 lakh against the accused. We also have information that there are other people who have been duped by the three and a total of 19 complainants have been duped of ₹ 1 crore. We will arrest the accused soon,” said a Sir JJ Marg police officer, who is a part of the investigation. “I had to close my business owing to the lockdown and the money lost owing to this fraudulent scheme. I suspect that Ali was fully aware of the plot and is involved in the crime. He is also not answering my calls,” said Shaikh. The three have been booked for cheating and criminal breach of trust under sections 406, 420 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-book-3-for-duping-19-people-of-1-crore-in-investment-fraud/story-iV9OLOtV1mRshtu95JeNrK.html

According to the tehsildar, the building, which is around 30-years old, couldn’t bear the load of the heavy machinery operated within.Around 4.45am on Friday, the second floor of the ground-plus-two-storey structure collapsed. Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) said the structure, located in a rural area, was a packaging godown for a cake shop. At the time, five workers were in the godown and had to be evacuated by firemen. Local police and a fire tender from BNCMC reached the site soon after the incident.“The second floor of the godown collapsed on the floor below. After reaching the spot, we rescued five persons stuck in the debris. Three of them suffered minor injuries in the incident,” said Rajesh Pawar, chief fire officer, BNCMC. The injuries were to the workers’ hands and legs, but were not serious enough to require hospitalisation. The three left the site after being rescued. Bhiwandi tehsildar Aadik Patil visited the spot after the incident and said the collapse may be due to heavy machinery being operated in the godown. “I visited the collapse site and found there were huge machines inside the godown. We suspect the load might have caused the collapse. We will inquire about it and take needful action,” said Patil. Earlier this week, on Thursday, 18 families had a narrow escape in a ground-plus-two-storey structure in Kopar village, in Dombivli.Three people suffered minor injuries after a major portion of a godown collapsed on Friday morning, at Bhiwandi’s Shriram compound, in Dapoda village, nearly 33 kilometres from Mumbai.

The members, who were on two-day mass leave till Friday, will decide on the next course of action in the coming week.The engineers are protesting against the recent appointment of Tej Ram Kathnoria as the superintending engineer of GMADA besides other deputations in various regional offices of PUDA across the state. Kathnoria, who has joined from the Punjab public works department, has not only been given the charge of SE, but has also got special powers of chief engineer.Mandeep Singh, president of PUDA Engineers’ Association, said it was only Kathnoria’s appointment, but they are again bringing 10 more employees with him from other departments. “The deputationist has even been given one post higher than their rank in the parent department. We will fight tooth and nail and would chalk out a strategy of protest,” he added.It may be recalled that the then state government has appointed Surinder Pal Singh alias Pehelwan on deputation from Mandi Board as the executive engineer in GMADA in 2012 and was later given the charge of chief engineer. In June 2017, Punjab’s vigilance bureau had registered a case against him after it unearthed 92 properties worth ₹59 crore he had allegedly amassed. He was jailed and is currently out on bail.Mandeep Singh said the incident of Surinder Pal had tarnished the image of PUDA. “Now, with the appointment of fresh deputationists, it is feared that it may lead to the same situation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/puda-engineers-up-in-arms-over-fresh-appointments-from-other-department/story-t0e4hsnrybUKEq9BLkv6MK.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||2 weeks after reopening, occupancy at Chandigarh cinemas remains low||Pandemic paranoia, limited options and “poor selection” of films are keeping moviegoers out of Chandigarh’s cinemas, which were allowed to open from October 15.As per online ticketing service BookMyShow, there weren’t more than five to six bookings for any show on Friday, a trend that is expected to continue over the weekend. This comes even as two new English movies – ‘The Rental’ and ‘The New Mutants’ – were released on Friday. Only older Hindi and Punjabi films are currently being screened in cinemas. A Korean movie about K-pop group BTS will also be released on November 3, bookings for which are, however, yet to pick up. Sarabdeep Singh, a city-based PR professional, who would regularly watch movies in cinemas before the Covid-19 crisis, said, “I have been waiting to watch Christopher Nolan’s Tenet for a long time, but it still hasn’t been released. I haven’t watched a single movie since cinemas reopened and I won’t mind donning all the safety equipment required for watching a movie these days. But the movie has to be worth the effort.”Meanwhile, PVR Cinemas launched a one-week ‘Halloween Film Festival’ on Friday, wherein movies such as ‘It Chapter 2’, ‘The Conjuring 2’ and ‘Lights Out’ will be screened. The entertaining company had also organised a special show for 35 ‘corona warriors’ at its cinemas at an IT Park mall. Single screen cinemas to reopen next yearSingle screen cinemas in the city, including Neelam Theatre in Sector 17 and Kiran in Sector 22, are yet to restart movie screenings. Manager of Neelam Theatre, SK Sharma, said, “I have written to the Chandigarh deputy commissioner, stating that it is not feasible for us to reopen before January 1, 2021. We had opened the theatre for a couple of days, but nobody is interested in coming. The cost of running a cinema hall, including power bills and salaries of workers, will be too much. Until hit Bollywood films start releasing, it will not be suitable for us to reopen.”Sharma said the administration should help single screen cinemas, which are already suffering big losses, during reopening. He has also asked the UT administration to offer some rebate on taxes on tickets and electricity. But I haven’t heard back from them on this, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-weeks-after-reopening-occupancy-at-chandigarh-cinemas-remains-low/story-pY1kwn0lZ8K00tyC1APiWM.html
30-10-2020||City||Ban on single-use plastic, polythene in Ambala Sadar from tomorrow||The Ambala Sadar municipal council has announced a complete ban on the use and sale of single-use plastic and polythene in its jurisdiction from November 1. Officials said the ban comes following the guidelines of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Centre. The violators will have to deposit a fine ranging from ₹500 to ₹25,000. Rajesh Kumar, secretary, Sadar municipal council, said the ban will be imposed from the first day of the month and efforts are being made to make maximum residents aware.“Single-use plastic and polythene are dangerous for the environment. Our motive of implementing the ban is not to collect fines, but to spread awareness. We expect the residents to avoid usage of polythene when they buy anything from market and carry a jute/cotton bag with them,” he added. Ritu Sharma, coordinator of Swatchh Bharat Mission, said that initially, the violators won’t be fined, but the polythene bags will be seized from them and they’ll be handed over the items they’ve bought. “But, later they will be penalised as per the weight of the confiscated item. Since January, we have collected nearly ₹1.5 lakh in fine for littering and burning of polythene in open,” she added. “We have held meetings with bodies representing the commercial and religious organisations and most of them have agreed to comply. We will also ensure that there is no use of disposable items at religious events,” Sharma said.On the ban, locals have given mixed response. Residents are hopeful about the ban, while shopkeepers are worried. Dr Neena Malhota, a resident of Ajeet Nagar area, said the authorities should ensure that small hawkers selling fruits and vegetables are inspected properly. “We have been using cotton bags since long and will be happy to see others doing the same. Polythene had been banned earlier too, but there was no proper execution and the entire exercise remained on papers only,” she added. A plastic disposable items’ seller in the area, Aniket, however, said it took too long for the authorities to realise its hazards.“We are small traders and sell the items as per their demand. But, I think there should be a check on the manufacturing of these items more, rather than on shopkeepers or residents,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ban-on-single-use-plastic-polythene-in-ambala-sadar-from-tomorrow/story-FOT3fnfRSGwAPuGCiAMJWI.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 6,190 Covid-19 cases, 127 deaths||Maharashtra on Friday recorded 6,190 cases, pushing the case count to 1,672,858, making it the 13th consecutive day when daily cases recorded were less than 10,000. A steady fall in active cases continued even on Friday, as it further reduced to 125,418, which means 7.49% patients are taking treatment at various hospitals and Covid care centres in the state at present. The toll reached 43,837 as 127 casualties were reported in the past 24 hours, health officials said. The state has reported 289,566 cases in October, compared to 593,192 in September and 371,238 in August. Mumbai continued to record the highest cases in the state with 1,145 fresh infections on Friday. Its case count reached 256,505. The number of active cases in the city also increased to 19,027. The city’s toll touched 10,261, with 32 new casualties, Nagpur city stood second with 432 cases, taking its tally to 77,483, followed by Pune district with 322 cases, pushing the case count to 76,966. Maharashtra’s case fatality rate (CFR), however, stayed at 2.62%, keeping it on the second position after Punjab (3.14%) (with 4,168 deaths) till Thursday. The state has completed 89 lakh Covid tests with 69,693 conducted on Friday. Its tally stood at 8,906,826. The positivity rate for the day dropped to 8.88% against the overall positivity rate of the state that stood at 18.78%. The number of recovered patients also crossed the 15-lakh mark with 8,241 recoveries recorded in the past 24 hours. The tally stood at 1,503,050. The recovery rate was recorded at 89.85%. “Herd immunity has also played a role in the drop, whether people agree or not. When a section of the population gets infected, the number of people who are likely to be attacked with the virus goes down. It is not the only factor for the decline, but one of the contributory factors,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state and public health expert. The other reason for decline in cases is that the people are also responding to the appeals and advice of the state government and they want this to be continued for next two months, he added. Herd immunity occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease, making the spread of that particular disease from person to person unlikely. Even individuals not vaccinated are offered some protection because the disease has little opportunity to spread within the community, it is said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-6-190-covid-19-cases-127-deaths/story-VIUDd8pFDDz6xXohH2KqHI.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Sweeping changes required for waste management||Compost pits in every sectorWe must focus on decentralised waste management through which households must segregate waste at source to manage it as a resource. Compost pits should be dug in every locality to process organic waste. Well engineered landfills have to be created or waste-to-compost and bio-methanation plants set up to reduce the load of landfill sites. Economic opportunities generated by recycling garbage could lead to waste minimisation and ensure protection of human health and environment. Smart waste technologies involving in-vehicle monitors, innovative tools for fast sorting processes with optical sensors, magnets and advanced disk screen are eco friendly, improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs and collection frequency. This acts as an ongoing evolution which eliminates particular job functions at which humans are inefficient or are exposed to risk. The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) must subject unskilled workers to rigorous training as flexibility and adaptability are likely to remain key human advantages. They must initiate mapping and integration of various stakeholders like urban local bodies, commercial centres, markets associations and hotels to take the bull by the horns. Komal Singh, Chandigarh Privatise system Strikes should be banned by the government. By launching strikes, the workers pay attention only to their demands instead of doing their work. The garbage collection system should be privatised as it will mean a cleaner city and efficient safai karamcharis. Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali Lessons on cleanliness for youthEach and every resident of this city has to be made aware of the garbage disposal system, especially children. Lessons on waste and its control should also be included at primary levels in schools. This is likely to encourage youngsters to actively participate in ensuring the cleanliness of their surroundings and be acutely aware of the consequences of allowing dumping of garbage just about anywhere. Strict implementation of littering laws and the two-bin system is a must. Sunibala Laishram, Chandigarh. Zero tolerance to garbageThere should be zero tolerance to garbage and waste material. The road near the Central Library in Chandigarh’s Sector 34 is a case in point. One can see waste piled up there, emitting an unbearable stench. Residents must take the initiative to take care of their city and not dump garbage randomly. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali What happened to reduce, reuse, recycle?The MC has failed to follow the three R’s of waste management: Reduce, reuse and recycle. The garbage problem is getting worse by the day due to this problem. The Sehaj Safai Kendras remain dirty, the garbage processing plant at Dadumajra has run out of space. The effluent treatment plant is not operational. Toxins such as dioxins and furans are being released in the atmosphere. The challan of Rs10,000 for littering is yet to be issued to any individual till date as is the other fine of Rs 5,000 for dumping unprocessed construction/ demolition waste in low lying areas, landfills and public places. The UT administrator, MP, mayor and councillors need to stand up and handle this health issue on an emergent basis. The imposition of heavy fines is right. But, creating awareness by conducting road shows, multimedia campaigns, visiting schools and educating children to make them aware of the need to keep our city ‘clean and green’, has to be an ongoing exercise. Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurMC, don’t bow to pressureWhenever MC attempts to improve the waste management situation in Chandigarh , the sanitation workers and door to door garbage collectors launch an agitation and stop work, as a result of which garbage piles up in every corner of the city and the MC authorities have to bow to the pressure. This should not be allowed to happen. Subhash Chugh Set up resource management centresPeople have to realise how important it is to segregate waste at source. Dry waste such as paper, cardboard, clothes and polythene rappers should be put in one bin and wet waste, mostly leftover food, vegetable peel etc should be put in another bin to be given to waste collectors separately. Resource management centres should be set up in every sector where wet waste should be dumped into large composting bins to convert it to organic manure. Tiles, eco bricks and other useful products can be made by compressing dry waste through hydraulic means. TBS Bedi Adjust collectors in new setupWaste collectors should be adjusted in the new setup and continue to earn their livelihood. The public must be educated through audio and video messages to coordinate with their RWAs and collectors and keep their surroundings clean. The area councillor can play an effective role in this respect. The MC should arrange for vans for door to door collection of garbage on alternate days in the beginning. It will be better if perishable black and green plastic bags are provided on nominal charges to the residents for segregating dry and wet garbage. Charges for collection can be claimed through water bills. Accountability for any kind of lapses should be fixed at each level. Sham Sunder Sharma Citizen engagement mustCollective and collaborative citizen engagement can stem the rot. For optimal management all stakeholders – residents,welfare associations and the civic administration must coordinate work responsibly. Aggregation should be done at the initial stage itself, with use of green and blue bins. People should reserve two bags – for plastic/polythene waste and hazardous waste. Welfare associations can liaison for spreading awareness and keeping an eye on the ground situation; and the administration should own its duty of collection, transportation and disposal. Sanitation workers should not be allowed to put at risk the health and hygiene of the residents and ensure that all areas are kept clean. Discipline is not antithetical to democracy. It’s time to tame this bane of democracy where vote bank politics override professional order to the detriment of public purse and convenience. Directions of the National Green Tribunal and higher judiciary mandates on waste management should be enforced quickly and heads must roll for non-compliance. Lalit Bharadwaj, Panchkula Fix waste and service conditionsImmediate steps need to be taken through scientific and innovative means to clean up the city. Waste should be collected through covered vans with separate days fixed for picking up biodegradable and other garbage. A wage structure with service conditions agreed upon by all worker unions should be fixed to prevent frequent strikes. The public and resident welfare societies must organise frequent mohalla meetings/workshops to make residents aware of the importance of segregation of biodegradable and other waste besides ensuring adequate cleanliness in their surroundings. SS Arora, Mohali All for tokenismThe plausible reasons for the avoidable mess are the piecemeal measures, coupled with tokenism, adopted by the MC authorities and administration to fix the waste collection problem. The authorities must act and put cleanliness measures in place and implement them strictly instead of turning every minor event into a photo opportunity.Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Focus on waste processingThe MC should closely monitor the amount of garbage/waste generated and processed. Out of the 450 metric tonnes (approximately) being generated daily only one-fourth is processed, so this gap has to be fixed with a ‘fast action plan’ with focus on urgent changes required and amendment of defunct rules. Budget sharing with teams concerned working at the ground level for collection and processing of waste should be done with daily achievable goals set. Madhav Bansal, Chandigarh Recycling the keyDifferent categories of garden/kitchen waste can be composted to procure organic manure. Waste materials generated from construction of buildings can also be used to make bricks and waste paper can be recycled. Usha Verma, Chandigarh Put dustbins everywhereThe government should ensure that green and blue dustbins are installed at each nook and corner of the city. Garbage collectors should be paid on time and their legitimate demands taken care of to ensure they don’t adopt unethical practices like strikes and closures. Sanitary workmen need to keep the city clean and act as proactive members of the society by effecting the small changes desired to keep the city clean. Priyam Aggarwal, Chandigarh. People have to take the initiativeWe citizens have to develop a better civic sense, not only to solve the problem of garbage disposal but also to keep the city clean. How many of us pick up a banana peel lying on the road? Very few. But there will be many who will not think twice before throwing out paper packets and other waste material on the streets from their cars; or urinate in the open or spit anywhere and everywhere. One of the ways to dispose of garbage is by chemical decomposition. In Chandigarh, garbage can be turned into fuel, energy, and manure. With Indian Institutes of Technology and so many engineering colleges in the country, why can’t we find ways to convert garbage into an asset, rather than letting it be a problem? Recycling and conversion is the answer. At home, let us have colour coded buckets for wet and dry garbage. If the waste collectors do not turn up, we ourselves dispose it in a garbage bin on our way to work. Take initiative, do it yourself. Finally, the authorities have to be serious in treating waste management as a priority issue. Colonel R D Singh (retd), Ambala Cantonment Monetary benefits can workGPS watches might not be a very effective way to get safai karamcharis to work, but offering small monetary benefits to the good performers can make them work harder and therefore improve the waste management system. Avinash Goyal Reduce garbage at household levelThis ‘throwaway’ culture has to end with citizens making every effort possible to reduce garbage generation at the household level. However, when it comes to garbage collectors, they should be encouraged to sell recyclable items to make some money. RWAs should come forward with innovations to make compost. Best out of waste competitions in sectors can also get locals interested in coming up with interesting ideas. MC authorities and even RWAs can come together to identify the cleanest areas in the city and award the waste collectors and safai karamcharis working there.Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliOpposition to use of MC trucks unfairThe opposition by garbage collectors to the MC authorities’ move to introduce garbage collection vehicles is unjustified. The workers can be taught to drive and can collect the garbage in these vehicles. The trucks should collect waste from all localities and segregate it properly. These changes should be carried out immediately. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhGet on with compostingPeople need to adopt environmental friendly practices. Start by composting your food waste or garden waste instead of dumping it. If it sounds like too much work send your organic waste to a recycling facility instead of dumping it in landfills. For effective waste management, waste minimisation, reuse, recycle and energy recovery are more sustainable than conventional landfill or dumpsite disposal technique. Avoid using single use plastic and try as much as possible to reuse and recycle material. Do not hoard and collect things you do not need. Ishita NaraPromote exemplary work cultureOn October 2, 2014, the Union government launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to implement effective scientific municipal waste management and bring about behavioural change among the people. At the beginning of the mission, various cleanliness drives were organised with much fanfare by politicians and bureaucrats. Three years back, two small dustbins were distributed to each house but the MC failed to implement segregated garbage schemes properly. From then on, Chandigarh has been performing poorly in the Swachh Survekshan. All of this happened because of the neo-liberal policies under which every project related to this mission was been assigned to contractors. During Covid-19, the work of sanitation workers assumed greater importance but their contribution was not recognised or rewarded. If we want the city to return to its past glory as one of the cleanest places in the country, the MC will have to fill up all vacancies of safai karamcharis, make arrangements for equipment like bins and dumpers. Exemplary work culture has to be promoted with discipline, dedication, and honesty the principal value of all MC employees.SK Khosla, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-chandigarh-readers-take-mc-needs-to-make-haste-to-dispose-of-waste/story-fe0esfNr2x1njbsT7gG70N.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn is geared up for second Covid wave, says Badnore||After a sharp spike in coronavirus cases, the pandemic has considerably subsided in the past couple of weeks in Chandigarh. Hindustan Times talks to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on how the administration has fared so far, and what are the challenges ahead, including fund crunch in the wake of the pandemic.Q. What is your assessment of the current state of Covid-19 pandemic in Chandigarh?A. The situation in Chandigarh is well under control as positivity rate has come down and active cases have also decreased substantially. The number of micro containment zones has also decreased. There is no positive patient at Covid care centres in Panjab University (Hostels 9, 10 and International Hostel) and their functioning has been temporarily suspended. All efforts are in place to prevent second surge during the festival season as testing has been stepped up.Q. How is the administration gearing up for a second wave?A. UT is already geared up for any second surge, if it happens, as adequate infrastructure has been created at PGIMER, GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and Dedicate Covid Hospital, Sector 48. As of today, there are 432 vacant Covid beds out of 550. There are 294 vacant oxygenated beds out of 390. There are 138 vacant ICU/HDU beds out of 160. There are 79 vacant ventilator beds available out of 95. Even during the peak on September 13, sufficient beds were available. In addition to this, Covid care centres were requisitioned. Sufficient medical and paramedical staff has been recruited and trained and are ready to tackle any second surge. Q. Centre’s expert panel flagged some missteps in handling the pandemic in initial weeks, such as poor testing, high positivity rate and high mortality. What are the lessons learnt?A. The Union health ministry did not find any missteps or lacunae in our handling of Covid. They gave some suggestions, which have been accepted.Q. Administration could spend less than half of Covid funds allocated by the Centre, as per the Union health minister. Why did this happen?A. Most of the PPE equipment, including gowns, face shields and N-95 masks, were provided by the Centre for free. Chandigarh already had adequate health infrastructure and there was no sudden expenditure on infrastructure and healthcare workers in the three premier health facilities. Initially, only RT-PCR tests were being done, for which the Centre provided free kits. In the past couple of months, rapid antigen testing has started, for which kits have been procured from Covid funds. Out of ₹ 10.43 crore, ₹ 6.77 crore (65%) have been spent to date. Further purchase of diagnostics, drugs, equipment and manpower is in process. Q. Lack of coordination between UT, Punjab and Haryana again came to the fore, with the three often adopting different strategies for lockdowns, resulting in confusion. What steps should be taken to have a better institutionalised system for coordination?A. The three administrations were following health ministry and ICMR guidelines issued from time to time and were in constant touch with each other. Regular war room meetings of the UT administration were also attended by deputy commissioners and civil surgeons of Mohali and Panchkula. A common pattern of lockdown and curfews was followed for the tricity after due deliberations. Q. The PGIMER and UT administration differed on a number of issues. The PGIMER kept on suggesting targeted testing and was reluctant on allowing patients from outside. Did this impact Covid management?A. At all times, PGIMER, GMCH-32, health department and Chandigarh administration were on the same page, as daily war room meetings were held. All decisions were taken after detailed discussions. Central guidelines for testing and treatment protocols were followed at all times, and there was no adverse impact on Covid management.Q. Since the onset of pandemic, some of the UT’s big ticket projects, such as shooting range, GMCH-32 and GMSH-16 upgrade, and Tribune flyover, are in limbo. How do you plan to bring them back on track even as the Centre has put restrictions on spending?A. Fifteen-acre land has been earmarked in Sarangpur for the proposed GMSH-16 medical college, and the detailed project report has been submitted to the Centre. The Tribune flyover is being funded by the ministry of road transport and highways, but the matter is pending in the high court. For the shooting range, the ground work for issuance of NOC by the forest department has been started.Q. MC’s revenue has also dried up and ongoing works such as road repairs have been affected. How does the administration plan to help?A. The MC is constantly making efforts to increase its revenue at its own level from advertisements and increase in certain user charges. The administration has made no cut in grant-in-aid approved in the budget estimates despite the cut on spending by the Centre. The administration has also approved collection of cow cess and corona cess on sale of liquor. Additional grant-in-aid is being sought in the revised budget estimates, and would be released if approved by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-is-geared-up-for-second-covid-wave-says-badnore/story-zqdQfdZYO7VNEcAq5C8zVK.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||HC hands over NRI’s property grab case in Chandigarh to CBI||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday roped in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe an alleged attempt to grab an NRI’s ₹30-crore property in Chandigarh’s upscale Sector 5.The detailed order, passed by HC bench of justices Daya Chaudhary and Meenakshi Mehta, is awaited, but a number of lawyers associated with the case have confirmed the development. The case came to light in August, when Padamjit Singh, 84, a former United Nations executive who lives in the US, alleged that a petition filed on July 8 using his name was not, in fact, filed by him. The property — House No. 17 in Sector 5 — as later verified by the Chandigarh administration is owned 50% each by the NRI and his brother’s family. The July 8 plea had claimed that Singh never sold his 50% share of the property to a woman named Pritam Kaur. However, Singh’s affidavit in August stated that he had sold his share of property to the woman and that he had authorised none to file the July 8 plea.When the lawyer appearing in the July 8 petition was questioned, he told court that the matter was brought to him by another lawyer and all requisite permissions to file the plea were obtained on mail. Subsequently, the HC had sought response from all parties involved, including family members of the NRI’s brother who had further given power of attorney to a third person, and the woman who had bought the property.On October 12, seeing gravity of the case, the HC had hinted at handing over the matter to the CBI and asked all the parties to complete their pleadings, further observing that not only the fraud is alleged to have been played by the parties in different manners, but a tactic has also been adopted just to cheat the other parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-hands-over-nri-s-property-grab-case-in-chandigarh-to-cbi/story-rSZP32xXgqTFXA7IX1WWYL.html

30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Soon, register pollution complaints in Chandigarh through an app||Acting on a National Green Tribunal directive, the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee has developed a mobile app to facilitate residents’ complaints regarding air pollution.Created with the assistance of the National Information Center (NIC), Delhi, the Android-based app is currently in the testing stage. It has been developed on the lines of the Central Pollution Control Board app “Sameer”.“The tribunal had directed CPCC to develop a public grievance redress portal for complaints on air pollution, along with a supervisory mechanism for its disposal mechanism,” said a UT official.NGT also told the committee to evaluate functioning of such portals on a real-time basis in the interest of protection of environment and public health, and to enforce the rule of law. “In particular, analysis may be undertaken about the number of complaints received, nature of issues raised and remedies provided. Such exercise has to be ongoing,” the tribunal’s order stated.Worsening air qualityChandigarh’s air quality index (AQI) was largely under the “satisfactory” category before the Covid-19 lockdown in March. Thereafter, it shifted to the “good” category.The air quality is measured through the AQI. An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe. In the months following the lockdown, the pollution levels have been consistently rising following lifting of restrictions and increase in economic activity and are currently at the “moderate” level.Emergency preparednessCPCC has also developed a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) as part of the city’s emergency preparedness in case air quality dives severely. This was stated by the committee in its recent meeting with the NGT.The strategies include reduction in number of vehicles and effective traffic management. It also lays down closing of polluting industries, shutting schools, control of diesel generator set usage, stopping construction activities, odd and even scheme for private vehicles, and closing of brick kilns, stone crushers, hot mix plants and power plants.Besides this, the plan includes mechanised cleaning of road, sprinkling of water, curtailing open burning of coal/wood at open eateries, road dust, construction dust and entry of trucks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/soon-register-pollution-complaints-in-chandigarh-through-an-app/story-lhMGip17jeAMGxh95e9MUK.html

Kamalpreet Kaur, a Class 8 student of Government Senior Secondary School, Sohian, bagged the second position in general category, while Dilnaz Kaur of Government Senior Secondary School, Billowal Chaminda, bagged the first position in the children with special needs (CWSN) category. District education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, congratulated the winners and the staff for guiding them.Rajinder Kaur, Kamalpreet’s guide teacher, said, “Kamalpreet joined our school in Class 6 and has participated in all art competitions since then. When the state education department announced the competitions to be held online in July, we started the preparation, took some time to finalise the ideas and then selected students started preparing their paintings.”“Kamalpreet was quick and impressive with her colour selection and brought uniqueness and brilliance in the painting. She beautifully portrayed a ship caught in a storm and Makhan Shah Lubana, a Sikh devotee, offering prayers to Guru Tegh Bahadur,” she said.Dilnaz Kaur, a Class 12, had earlier bagged first position in two competitions at the district level, poster making and painting. Paramjit Kaur, Punjabi teacher, helped her with the poster-making competition.Her guide teacher, Maninder Kaur, said, “Kaur has suffered from polio since childhood, but this disability has never stopped her from achieving her dreams. She is unable to walk without support, so her father drops and picks her from school daily. This is a big achievement and she has worked hard to clinch this position. She is a brilliant student in the class and always performs outstandingly in competitions. We have just helped her with ideas and she has come up with a beautiful and impressive painting.”In the painting, Kaur has tried to show that how Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed his life to save Kashmiri Pandits who were forced by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to convert to Islam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-ludhiana-girls-clinch-top-spots-in-state-level-painting-contest/story-B701nWTOA2BvYooge8yzjJ.html

A narco-tourism destination, even as every government has tried to wean villagers away from the trade, the village that traces its origin to ancient times, is known for fiercely guarding its independent traditions, which it has successfully preserved. Over 15,000 tourists visit it during a normal year. “The panchayat banned the entry of outsiders much before the lockdown. Thankfully, there is no case of covid-19, but villagers now face livelihood issues,” says Malana panchayat secretary Tek Chand. “Tourism activity has halted, villagers are facing difficulty in fending for themselves. Potato is the main cash crop, but there are no buyers for that also this time,” says panchayat pradhan Bhagi Ram, adding , “Barring few, residents have small land holdings in Malana,” he said, adding that the government should make provisions for granting land to villagers who are landless to help them to wean away from the narcotic.”Traditionally, inhabitants of this land-locked village used to make baskets, ropes and slippers from hemp. In the late 1980s, however, visiting foreigners taught villagers to extract the intoxicant resin from cannabis. Hippies made this forest land their transit home and introduced drug culture to the Kullu Valley, which is known for its splendour and scenery. Malana panchayat comprises two villages Saura behad and Dhara Behad and has a total population of 2,000 in 475 households. Successive governments have tried to wean villagers away from narcotic trade, there is no other cash crop to rival cannabis in Malana. Maize and potatoes that villagers grow don’t fetch handsome returns. “Even now, the village wears a deserted look as most of them are camping in forest to extract herbs,” said a local youngster, a member of Navyuwak Mandal, who did not want to be blamed.Cannabis extracted from the hybrid hemp plants is grown in a clandestine manner is sold at exorbitant prices in the international market as well in key tourist spots in the country, particularly in Goa. To market the local charas, drug peddlers have invented their own brand names like Skunk balls, AK-47. The Malana cream, which is the charas extracted from hemp in the forest land of Malana village, remains the most sought after.Villagers also claim that they the descendants of the great Greek King Alexander, with some of his soldiers also believed to have settled here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tourism-no-option-2-000-villagers-in-kullu-s-malana-face-livelihood-issues/story-DOZ560150yrfPlJQwLtdWK.html

30-10-2020||Delhi||North-east Delhi violence reminiscent of carnage during days of partition, court observes||Parts of North East Delhi gripped by a communal frenzy in February this year were reminiscent of carnage during the days of partition, a Delhi court observed while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea of an accused in connection with a case related to the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma during the violence.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav, in his order on Thursday, said that the riots spread like wildfire across the smoke-grey skyline of the national capital engulfing new areas and snuffing out more and more innocent lives.The court made the observations while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea of Muntajim alias Musa, who had moved the court for relief citing the medical ground of his wife’s illness.“I have also gone through the medical documents qua the wife of the applicant filed along with the application. Most of the documents are prescription slips and one ultrasound report, all of which pertain to the year 2018 and are not recent ones. In any way, the said medical documents are of no help to the applicant, as the same do not prima facie establishes that the wife of the applicant is suffering from any serious ailment or otherwise,” the order said.“Considering the facts and circumstances of the case in totality vis-a-vis gravity of the offence, I do not find it to be a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant. The application for anticipatory bail is accordingly dismissed,” it added.The court also noted that the custodial interrogation of the applicant is necessary to unearth the conspiracy for planning, instigating and executing the riot action plan. “The allegations against the applicant are grave in nature. His presence/custodial interrogation is also necessary for his identification by way of judicial Test Identification Parade from public witnesses,” it noted.Advocate Mohd Athar, representing the applicant, submitted that he has been falsely roped in the matter merely on the basis of disclosure statements made by co-accused persons and added that he has not been captured either in any CCTV footage or any viral videos.“His call detail records location is of no help to the investigating agency as he is resident of the same locality. It is further argued that the applicant has not been identified by any of the public witnesses cited in the matter,” Athar submitted.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary strongly opposed the anticipatory bail and submitted that this is an unfortunate case of the brutal murder of a young officer of Intelligence Bureau by the riotous mob in the evening of February 25 and added that the applicant was an active member of the said riotous mob.“It is emphasised that the applicant is a resident of Nand Nagri and his presence at the scene of the crime at the time of the incident was not natural. His CDR location has been found to be at the scene of the crime on both February 24 and 25, when the intensity of the communal riots was maximum,” Chaudhary submitted.Chaudhary further argued that CDR analysis qua the mobile phone of the applicant clearly establishes that he had been in regular touch with two co-accused persons, both of whom played an active role in the murder of Ankit Sharma.“Co-accused Haseen had in his disclosure statement categorically admitted to having stabbed Ankit Sharma number of times with his knife and his accomplices having hit him with ‘dandas’ and thereafter throwing his body in the ‘nala’,” he added.At least 53 people were killed and hundreds of others were injured in the violence that took place in northeast Delhi between February 24 and 26 sparked by clashes between groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-east-delhi-violence-reminiscent-of-carnage-during-days-of-partition-court-observes/story-g4jyixDOUXwShFH4uq9thL.html

The respondents are also directed to consider the claim of the applicants for release of salary, which they have not yet paid as per the submission made by the learned counsel for the applicants.”But the teachers, who have also written to the district education officer (DEO) about this, said the department had not followed the tribunal’s directions even after 10 days.“For so many months during the pandemic, we have survived without any pay and it’s still held up. We hope the department pays our dues soon,” said a junior computer instructor, wishing anonymity.On the department’s part, UT director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “The UT finance department has been apprised of the matter, which will be resolved soon.”Till May 31, these employees had been drawing salaries through the Society for Promotion of IT in Chandigarh (SPIC). After the contract was given to a company in June through the Government E-Market (GEM) portal, the contractor had allegedly demanded Rs 12,000 per person from the instructors to pay their salaries. The instructors had also lodged a complaint regarding this with the UT education department and written to the UT administrator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-computer-instructors-awaiting-salaries-despite-relief-from-tribunal/story-x5pC1QixRgKn9Lc1XtbaOK.html
30-10-2020||City||Haryana space centre, Ambala administration lock horns over farm fire data||Ambala district administration and agriculture department have found substantial difference in the farm fire cases reported through satellite by the Hisar-based Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) and the actual stubble burning incidents.As per the data provided by the agriculture department, there had been 464 active fire locations (AFL) of kharif crops reported by the Hisar centre till last week, of which stubble burning was detected at merely 31 sites, about 6.7% of the total number. Deputy commissioner (DC) Ashok Kumar Sharma said there was regular monitoring of stubble burning incidents by the agriculture department and pollution control board. “Our daily reports have found a stark difference between multiple data and the actual fire cases are only 6-7%. Around 20% locations were cross-checked by a team of senior officials comprising deputy director of agriculture, area tehsildar, and block development and panchayat officer and it was found to be true,” he added. Till October 25, 14 FIRs had been registered against farmers for burning the crop residue and 17 challans were issued. The authorities have collected ₹42,500 as a penalty from violators. Sources in the agriculture department said that such anomalies were also pointed out earlier too, where the thermal scanners captured the images of cremations or garbage burning that were mistaken for AFL. Meanwhile, HARSAC director VS Arya said there could not be a fault in the satellite capturing. “There was a navigation problem in Yamunanagar and Kurukshetra and the department was helped by the centre’s team,” the official added. “The resolution of the satellite is 375×375 metres and an AFL is within this area. If an AFL is not found at a particular area, that could also mean that the officials may have been checking just the specific farm or site. The fire could be near or around the captured area. Also, the satellite doesn’t capture small fires like those of cremation or heaps of burning garbage,” the director said. Deputy director of agriculture Girish Nagpal said to check an AFL, the department officials are accompanied by a panchayat secretary and patwari to a village. “The team reaches the location with the help of longitude and latitude coordinates. To report if a fire is found or not, a photo of the farm/area along with the coordinates is taken,” he added. As the pollution levels deviated between “poor” and “very poor” category, the pollution control board is keeping tabs on the construction and industrial activities in the district. Board’s regional officer Nitin Mehta said, “The body is also inspecting the mining screening plants and has given guidelines on dust suspension to a few construction activities in the city area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-space-centre-ambala-administration-lock-horns-over-farm-fire-data/story-uQ1bcPcZiqmbRWEkmvHmGK.html

Besides Razia, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal and Transport Secretary K Siva Prasad were present at the meeting.Though the transport department had initially suggested waiver up to 50 per cent of tax till December 31, the chief minister, responding to the concerns of transporters, overruled the department to announce 100 per cent relief, the statement said.The transporters were earlier provided 100 per cent relief for two months, till September 30, by the state government.“The chief minister took note of the problems faced by the transporters, who pointed out that with less than 10 per cent commuters availing the bus services, they were unable to meet even the cost of diesel to run their vehicles.    “Though the state transport and PRTC (state transport), being prime routes, were in demand, private bus operators continued to suffer due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” representatives of the transport associations told the chief minister.  Amarinder agreed with the transporters that their industry, run entirely by Punjabis, needed further support from the state government in the present situation and accepted their demand for total tax waiver till the end of this year, the statement further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-extends-100-per-cent-tax-waiver-for-bus-operators-till-december-31/story-uZyTwWDA5qnpz97bcrPIcL.html

However, the school was running regular classes and had not taken precautions against the virus. An FIR will be lodged against the school’s owner under the Disaster Management Act,” the SI said.Bhiwani district education officer (DEO) Ajit Sheoran said, “Students were sitting close to each other without face masks. The parents, too, did not flag the matter. Had a student gotten infected who would be responsible. The school authorities, teachers and parents were all at fault.” A teacher, requesting anonymity, said, “We started classes at the parents’ request as there are very few Covid cases in the area. Many parents said they will not pay the fee unless classes were resumed. Another reason for starting classes was that many students did not have access to a phone and could not attend online classes. Our school was raided but politicians who are brazenly flouting norms while taking out rallies in Baroda are not being censored.” This week, Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal had indicated that the decision regarding re-opening of the primary and middle schools was likely to be taken in the first week of November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-cm-s-flying-squad-raid-private-school-found-holding-regular-classes-in-bhiwani-village/story-sMuQUb7xgz8KR9arqDr3PL.html

30-10-2020||Patna||‘Murder plot of Janata Dal Rashtravadi’s Sheohar candidate hatched in Tihar jail’: Police||The conspiracy to kill Sheohar assembly candidate Srinarayan Singh of Janata Dal Rashtravadi party was hatched in Tihar Central jail, police said on Friday. Police claimed that the killing was the result of a gang war. Santosh Jha’s gang has taken the responsibility of Singh’s death. Seven criminals on three motorbikes gunned down two people, including Singh while he was campaigning in Bihar’s Sheohar assembly constituency on October 24 after which one of the attackers was lynched by the slain leader’s supporters. Investigations have revealed that the plan to murder the leader was chalked out by Vikash Jha alias Kalia, a gangster lodged in Tihar Jail. Vikash is a close associate of dreaded gangster Santosh Jha who was serving a life term for the murder of two engineers and facing trial in 20 criminal cases and was shot dead in Sitamarhi’s court on August 28, 2018. Two of the shooters were arrested late on Thursday night and the police recovered two pistols, eight live cartridges and three motorcycles used in the crime. Sheohar Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar said that the preliminary investigation suggested that following the murder of dreaded gangster, Vikash took all the command in his hand and gave directions to eliminate Singh. He hired seven criminals, including Gauri Shankar Maharaaj alias Kisan Jha, Niraj Pathak alias Chinese, Babu Saheb Jha, Purshottam Kumar Mishra and three others. The gang members continuously recce Singh’s movement and were staying in Patna to eliminate him at a political party’s office when he was roaming about for party tickets. During the interrogation, they confessed that Vikash frequently got in touch with them through WhatsApp call for three months. When Singh filed nomination, the arrested criminals tried to kill him but due to heavy deployment of police forces, they changed their plan. Finally, the assailants fired on him when he, along with supporters, were returning from Hathsar village after campaigning for the elections. Singh, along with Santosh Kumar Mahto and Alok Ranjan Mahto, received bullet injuries. Singh and Santosh died during the treatment while Ranjan is said to be out of danger. Also read: ‘Conversion just for marriage’s sake not acceptable’ - Allahabad High CourtThe police said that on the fateful day, Gaurishankar Jha was beaten to death by a mob while Niraj Pathak was caught with firearms. The Sheohar SP constituted an SIT under the supervision of sub-divisional police officer to nab the accused at the earliest. The SP said that Vikash Jha is also made the prime accused in the double murder case and raids are on to nab three more culprits. Singh, who was earlier with the RJD, was facing 30 criminal cases. He was contesting as a candidate of the Janta Dal (Rashtravadi), which is part of the Upendra Kushwaha-led alliance that has Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and Mayawati’s BSP as members. Bihar’s Sheohar assembly segment is witnessing a keen contest between sitting JD(U) MLA Sharfuddin and RJD candidate Chetan Anand Singh, son of jailed former MP Anand Mohan. Vikash Jha alias Kalia, serving life term in the sensational double murder of two engineers in Darbhanga, escaped from the prisoners’ ward of Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH) in Bhagalpur on August 18. Earlier he had escaped twice from remand home and Sitamarahi judicial custody. The STF managed to arrest him from Nangloi area of National Capital on October 18, 2019 and the police recovered a pistol and seven live cartridges from his possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/murder-plot-of-janata-dal-rashtravadi-party-s-sheohar-candidate-hatched-in-tihar-jail-police/story-kG9cU2xMsxFuA6nSJDeSiP.html

Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida), Bulandshahr, Hapur and Baghpat districts of UP are part of the NCR which now falls under the ambit of ‘Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020’.After promulgation of the new ordinance by the Centre to check air pollution in NCR, industrialists of Uttar Pradesh’s NCR want the state government to make sure there will be no harassment of industrialists.The ordinance stipulates a fine of up to Rs 1 crore with imprisonment of five years. “The state government must make available subsidised PNG to all industrial units in the state’s NCR. The government is already doing this for industrial units in Agra and Firozabad districts,” said Pankaj Kumar, national president of Indian Industries Association (IIA), a lobby group of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector. “We will soon hand over a memorandum to chief minister Yogi Adityanath with the list of suggestions for industrial units in the NCR,” added Kumar. A majority of UP’s industrial units are in Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), Ghaziabad and Meerut, which are considered maximum revenue and employment generators for the Uttar Pradesh government. Maximum investment in Uttar Pradesh is also in Noida and its adjoining regions. Smoke emanating from boilers of industrial units is considered among major air-polluting factors in the NCR along with burning of stubble. In these boilers, coal and wood is used as fuel.Also read: LeT behind killing of 3 BJP leaders in Kashmir, says senior police official“Industries have always been a soft target for any action. An industrialist contributes to the nation’s growth and economy. He is not a criminal. Prosecution of an industrialist cannot be accepted in any way,” said Kumar.“We are in favour of all measures to check pollution in NCR. But we will oppose any coercive action against an industrialist in the name of checking pollution,” Kumar added. In Ghaziabad alone, there are around 110 industrial units that use coal and biomass as fuel for boilers. According to the new ordinance, a committee will be constituted to manage air pollution in Delhi-NCR and its adjoining areas for better coordination and resolution of problems related to the air quality in Delhi. The 18-member committee will be headed by a chairperson appointed by the Centre. Its member-states will be Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. It will have the authority to stop the power supply or take action against any industrial unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-new-ordinance-to-check-air-pollution-covers-state-s-most-industrialised-districts/story-4YFOSFRwQGKhbzCI3M45lK.html

30-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Amid tall claims on jobs, total silence on revival of industrial units shut for 30 years||Even as the issue of unemployment has gained resonance this Bihar election and at least two political parties have promised to create jobs in huge numbers, there is near-total silence on the revival of industrial units, private or public, which once used to dot the landscape in north Bihar before they shut shop over the last three decades.On an average, these small-scale industrial units used to employ nearly 1,000 people each and produced or manufactured a wide range of products, ranging from sugar, medicines, heavy machinery to oyster buttons, popularly known as sap button industries.Talking about sugar factories alone, there were 15 of them in north Bihar only, each employing at least 1,000 people and buying produce from 25,000 farmers.“At least 11 of them were shut in mid-nineties, mainly due to demand of extortion money from local strongmen. Some had to shut because of power supply problems. No initiatives were made to reopen them, except for two at Sugauli and Lauria which were restarted on the initiative of the then secretary with the government of India and now MLA from Bagaha, RS Tiwari,” said Sanjay Kumar Pandey, a marginal farmer from Sugauli.Radheshyam Sah, a former employee of Motipur sugar factory in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district, says, “I was the sole bread earner in my family. But the mill was closed in 1996 after two temporarily closures. Since then, 600 of its permanent employees and 1,200 temporary workers have been left to fend for themselves. Neither the state nor the union government has taken any initiative to reopen it.”Things are no better for oyster button-based industries at Mehsi in east Champaran district. The industry was started by an enterprising inspector of schools, Bhulawan Lal, an inhabitant of Mehsi, who began handcrafting buttons from oysters found in the river Sikrahna in 1905.Also read: Historical, mythological characters figure in personalised barbs“We earned Rs 10,000 to 50,000 every month. But things completely changed in mid-nineties when criminals started demanding extortions. Small-time entrepreneurs shut their establishments. The big ones shifted their trade to places outside the state,” says Md Maqbool of Mehsi, who once ran his own oyster button business.Maqbool says more than 10,000 people in the area were engaged in nearly 150 oyster-based units which manufactured buttons and fancy wall hangings.The latest industry to shut shop is Bharat Wagon, an enterprise of Railway ministry, which used to produce 200 goods wagon every year at very low cost at two units situated in Muzaffarpur and Mokama. Both were shut last year.“Around 1,600 employees from Muzaffarpur unit have lost their livelihood,” said SK Verma, president of its employee’s federation.Apart from these, nearly 150 industrial units engaged in production of agricultural products and chemicals and located in industrial estates closed in the last 30 years.Experts feel that if these industries are opened again, the issue of unemployment would be resolved to a great degree. “And once the youths start getting jobs, the crime rate will also go down. But no government showed inclination. The Nitish Kumar’s government, which paid attention to issues like safe drinking water, uninterrupted power supply to each household and sanitation, apart from concrete roof topped houses, never thought of it,” says Krishna Mohan Prasad, a retired university teacher.Md Iqbal Shami, general secretary of the RJD and spokesperson, claimed efforts were made to revive some of these units during the RJD’s tenure. “I am sure this issue is on Tejashwi Yadav’s mind when he makes announcements of providing jobs to youths,” he said.Suresh Kumar Sharma, MLA from Muzaffarpur and minister for urban development, said PM Narendra Modi-led union government had tried a lot to save the Bharat Wagon units. “But both units were running in heavy losses. Even the decision to shut these units was taken during the UPA government. To compensate, we have started a rail engine manufacturing unit at Madhepura,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-amid-tall-claims-on-jobs-total-silence-on-revival-of-industrial-units-shut-for-30-years/story-YGKxgQtKCn91ssPR39afnM.html

30-10-2020||Pune||PMRDA identifies three sites for Pune traders to shift business outside city||Pune: Days after Pune traders sought land outside the city, Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) has shortlisted three sites located on the outskirts. According to PMRDA officials, the sites showed to representatives of Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) are Uruli Kanchan, Markal and Wagholi in Haveli taluka. The move comes after the representatives of FTAP, an umbrella body of various trader organisations, met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and sought 1,000 acres on the outskirts of city to shift 30 wholesale and semi-wholesale markets. These markets are currently located mostly in peth areas, where traffic congestion has become a major problem. According to PMRDA commissioner Suhas Divase, a visit for traders to the three sites will be organised next week. “We had a joint meeting with the members of FTAP and PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar, where we showed them the integrated concepts of marketplaces on the outskirts of city limits such as China, Dubai, and Chennai in India. We have identified locations in Uruli Kanchan, Markal and Wagholi. All these lands are government owned and easily accessible. We will be visiting the sites along with a contingent of revenue officials, FTAP team and PMC officers,” said Divase. Vikram Kumar, who was present with his team at the presentation, said, “We are happy to support the decision of traders and PMRDA. Our team created concept designs and showed Google maps pointers for the land plots available to be developed as wholesale markets. Shifting traders will make peth areas traffic-hassle free.” Fatehchand Ranka, president, FTAP confirmed of being shown the land located in the eastern part of the city on map. A delegation comprising FTAP, commissioners PMC and PMRDA will be making a visit next week, he said. “We took the decision during the pandemic to shift wholesale and semi wholesale market on city outskirts considering the fact that peth areas are congested and difficult to get thoroughfare. We approached the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the government with this idea and also had a meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar,” said Ranka.

RaghopurRashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, the chief ministerial face of the Grand Alliance, is seeking re-election from the Raghopur seat. He had won the seat on his maiden outing in electoral politics in 2015. His main rival is Satish Kumar of the BJP, who had defeated former chief minister and Tejashwi’s mother Rabri Devi from the same seat in the 2010 polls and had also contested in 2015 where he lost the RJD’s stronghold of Raghopur to Tejashwi.2. HasanpurRJD candidate, the elder son of party chief Lalu Prasad and brother of Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap Yadav is fighting the Bihar assembly from the Hasanpur constituency this year. Tej Pratap has moved out of his constituency Mahua in Vaishali district to Hasanpur in Samastipur and is pitted against two-time sitting MLA Rajkumar Rai of the Janata Dal(United).3. BankipurThe Bankipur assembly seat is set to see a contest between Congress’ Luv Sinha and the BJP’s Nitin Nabin. Luv Sinha is the son of actor Shatrughan Sinha who lost Patna Sahib to Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in the Lok Sabha polls last year when he fought on a Congress ticket. Incumbent Nitin Nabin is aiming a third term from the seat and has been the head of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) till recently and has now been appointed as the party’s in charge for Sikkim.4. JhanjharpurJhanjharpur assembly constituency that falls in the Madhubani district will witness a tight contest between sitting RJD MLA Gulab Yadav and the BJP’s candidate Nitish Mishra.

His late uncle Lalit Narayan Mishra was also a well- known politician. 5. ManerThe state BJP spokesperson and close confidant of Union minister of state Nityanand Rai, Nikhil Anand is fighting from the Maner assembly seat against two-time sitting MLA of the RJD Bhai Virendra.

GovindganjSitting MLA and the Lok Janshakti Party’s (LJP’s) Raju Tiwari, Congress leader Brajesh Kumar and the BJP’s Sunil Mani Tiwari will be in a triangular fight in Govindganj.

30-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC waives cooling off period for divorce in view of woman’s pregnancy||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday accepted a Mumbai-based woman’s plea in dissolving her troubled marriage on an urgent basis on the grounds that she was pregnant from some other person, whom she wanted to marry soon, and granted her prayer for waiver of the compulsory six-month cooling-off period before the customary grant of divorce by mutual consent.The woman got married on August 15, 2014. However, she had started living separately from December 2018 following a marital discord.The estranged couple decided to get legally separated by filing for divorce by mutual consent and presented a joint petition under section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, to the family court at Bandra on August 4. The couple had also filed an application seeking waiver of the six-month cooling-off period, as per section 13B (2) of the Act. Also Read: Bombay HC refuses bail to former IL&FS executive Ramchand KarunakaranUnder section 13B(2) of the Act, a court can grant divorce by mutual consent only after six months and before 18 months of presentation of a joint petition by a married couple.The wife moved HC after the Bandra court rejected the waiver application on September 9.At HC, she and her husband pointed out to Justice Nitin Sambre that they were living separately since December 2018 and were leading independent lives. They also cited that they had decided to get legally separated and had also finalised the consent terms, as they were unable to live together.The wife’s counsel drew the court’s attention to the fact that the woman was pregnant by another man, whom she wanted to marry soon. As a result, there is urgency in securing the decree of divorce and also the need for waiver of the cooling-off period.The husband supported her plea for the waiver. His lawyer submitted that the request was justified since both the man and his estranged wife had led independent lives for over two years and the latter was pregnant and carrying the child of the person she plans to marry.Justice Sambre accepted the request in view of the 2017 ruling of the Supreme Court (SC) in Amardeep Singh’s case, which had said that the period mentioned in section 13B (2) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 was not mandatory.The apex court had ruled that a court is empowered to use its discretionary powers to waive the cooling-off period on a case-by-case basis, especially where there is no possibility of a man and a wife to reunite and there are chances of their alternative rehabilitation.“In this backdrop, it will be appropriate, particularly having regard to the health condition of the petitioner, to allow the joint application moved for waiving the period as specified under section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,” said Justice Sambre while granting the prayer for the waiver.HC also directed the family court to dispose of the divorce petition as expeditiously as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-waives-cooling-off-period-for-divorce-in-view-of-woman-s-pregnancy/story-YKkXl8NsQKavfrzm3oTFCO.html

The protest started at 11 am outside the SPPU main building.Later, the protesting students surrounded SPPU pro-vice-chancellor Prof NS Umrani when he came to talk with them.Students said that they will not leave the varsity campus before having a meeting with vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar. After a wait for more than five hours, Karmalkar met the protestors and assured to take steps to address their demands.“Since last more than a month, even before the final year exams started, we have been demanding that the exam be conducted with adequate planning so that students do not face any inconvenience. The mismanagement of SPPU administration has caused thousands of students appearing for final year exams to face difficulties. We have been meeting SPPU officials regularly and raising our concerns, but no one is ready to hear it and so we decided to hold the protest today. The students are facing any issues, including test paper going missing, wrong questions and login issues. Till now more than 14,000 complaints have been lodged by students related to examination and we demand it to be addressed at the earliest,” said Anil Thombare, ABVP Pune functionary.Umrani said, “We will be holding re-examination for those students who faced issues while appearing for online/offline exams in the first week of November. We have checked the complaints sent by students in detail and special exams will be conducted on November 5, 6 and 7. I met students on behalf of the vice- chancellor. I assure that appropriate steps will be taken to address their complaints.”Issues faced by studentsSoham Narkar, a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Legislative Law (LLB) third year student, said, “We used to earlier get BA degree along with LLB, but now it has been cancelled by SPPU. The Savitribai Phule Pune University’s law department dean, a newly appointed madam, said that she is unaware about the changes.“She doesn’t know why this degree has been cancelled. The ‘Criminal Justice’ paper which was scheduled three days ago was cancelled it did not show in the exam system.”Another final year Bachelor of Arts student Radhika Purohit said, “I am appearing through online mode for examination. I have faced late login issues due to technical problem. It is a common inconvenience faced by most of college students appearing for the final year examination. Most of the online questions does not show any answer options. On the day when we were to appear for German language paper, French language paper was given to us. It is complete exam mismanagement by Savitribai Phule Pune University.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-varsity-to-hold-re-exams-after-abvp-affiliated-students-stage-protest/story-fGibETrm2D7jfCyH1u95tN.html

30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Goods trains will stay off track in Punjab till farmers lift blockades||With farmer organisations in Punjab extending their protest against the Centre’s farm laws, the Railways on Friday said freight movement in the state will remain suspended indefinitely. Ferozepur additional divisional railway manager (ADRM) Sukhwinder Singh said no goods trains will operate to and from the state till all tracks and railway stations are cleared of protesters. He said as farmer unions are sticking to their decision of holding protests on and near tracks at various spots, it was decided not to resume services. “After a thorough assessment of the ground situation, it was felt that the situation is not fit to restart freight services to and from Punjab. The railways will resume services once the situation eases on the ground,” he said.FARMERS TARGET SUPPLY TO PRIVATE POWER PLANTS Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) members started an indefinite dharna to disrupt coal supply to private thermal plants by blocking the tracks last Friday. The BKU activists started squatting on the rail route to the Vedanta Group-owned Talwandi Sabo power project at Banawala village in Mansa district. Last Saturday onward, they began blocking the rail line to the Rajpura thermal power plant, a subsidiary of the Larsen and Toubro (L&T) Group, for an indefinite period. Train services to a mega foodgrain silo operated by the Adani Group in Moga district were disrupted by BKU activists on Friday. TRADE UNION STEERS CLEAR OF BLOCKADESThe Left-leaning trade union disassociated itself from other farmer organisations’ rail roko and ended blockades by its activists on October 13. Activists of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), the organisation that spearheaded the rail blockade since September 24, shifted the dharna from Devidas Pura to Jandiala Guru station on Monday. Its members refused to lift the blockade. A three-member committee of state ministers met BKU leaders on Thursday but they did not agree to allow train services to private thermal plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/goods-trains-will-stay-off-track-in-punjab-till-farmers-lift-blockades/story-NgKtsGJl3Llllv3Se0B96M.html

30-10-2020||Election:||Bihar poll campaign gets acerbic; historical, mythological characters figure in personalised barbs||With the first phase of Bihar elections over, the state’s poll atmosphere has now become more acrimonious with jibes flying thick having shades of personalised attacks and references of historical characters and episodes adding more colour to the high decibel campaign. On Thursday, Union minister Giriraj Singh attracted eyeballs when he likened Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Singh said the 31-year-old Yadav scion had sidelined his parents - jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad and former chief minister Rabri Devi - by projecting himself as the face of the RJD in all party posters, akin to what Aurangzeb had done after taking the throne from his father Shah Jahan who was held captive at the Agra Fort for long after being deposed, as per historical records. “Pictures of Lalu and Rabri are missing in the RJD posters. Tejashwi has come to politics on the Lalu Yadav’s legacy but the latter is missing in the pictures. It’s the same like many emperors have done in the past just like Aurangzeb,” he said. The reference of infamous Jallianwala bagh tragedy – one of the dark episodes of pre-independence movement when hundreds were killed during a peaceful demonstration inside a park in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, in a police shootout by General Dyer - too got a mention. Tejashwi, on Wednesday, drew parallels between the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy and Munger police firing on Monday night in which one person was killed and 27 got injured. The Grand Alliance leaders wondered who was playing “General Dyer” - an indirect attack on chief minister Nitish Kumar. Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Tejashwi as ‘Jungle Raj Ka Yuvraaj (prince of the Jungle Raj)” without naming the 31-year-old in his election speeches in Patna, Muzaffarpur. PM Modi’s veiled jibe had undertones of a personal attack and accentuated the NDA’s poll narrative against the RJD promoting “Jungle Raj” - a euphemism for poor governance and law and order during previous the RJD’s 15-year rule. The Yadav scion has not reacted to it. Also read: Eating out, grocery shopping more dangerous than air travel during Covid-19 - StudyA few days back, the RJD’s chief ministerial face had invited big flak when he remarked how “the weaker sections dared to sit in front of ‘Babu Sahebs’ during his father’s tenure as the CM,” giving the BJP a handle to call the remark a casteist slur against the upper caste Rajputs. The RJD leaders were quick to go for damage control saying Tejashwi had made the remark in the context of bureaucrats and ‘babu culture’ and that the BJP had purposely given a spinoff to give caste colour. Even chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is known for making less off the cuff remarks, has shown signs of being temperamental when he recently said, “some leaders have yearning for sons despite having several daughters showing how they have little respect for women” - a remark seen as an indirect attack against his bete noire and jailed RJD chief who has nine children including seven daughters. Tejashwi called it an insult to all women, including his mother Rabri Devi, by the JD(U) chief. “Does it behove of a Prime Minister to speak against Tejashwi? PM Modi has lowered the dignity of the post he holds by making such a statement. Even CM Kumar, fearing of losing power, is using street language. Such utterances have not affected Tejashwi and shows how the young RJD leader has shaken both the PM and CM in this election,” said RJD’s national vice president Shivanand Tiwary. On his part, JD(U) state spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan defended PM Modi’s barb against Tejashwi saying it mirrored how the Yadav scion is carrying the legacy of the previous RJD rule marked by lawlessness and poor development. Political observer and former principal of Patna College, professor Nawal Kishore Choudhary said the political discourse turning more personalised and getting acerbic is sign of how the ruling NDA is under pressure from its rival RJD. “The NDA thought it would be a decisive victory but it’s not a cakewalk now. Tejashwi’s unemployment issue has put pressure on the ruling BJP-JD(U), which is now harping on ‘Jungle Raj’. It is relevant because Tejashwi is carrying the legacy of his father and cannot avoid it. The attacks are getting shriller as both the NDA and the GA want to aggressively mobilise their core voters in the next two phases,” he said. Also read: Generational shift in Bihar’s political arena?The use of such acerbic political lingo has happened in the past elections in Bihar. In 2015 assembly polls, PM Modi’s statement at a Muzaffarpur rally, saying there was something wrong in the political DNA of chief minister Nitish Kumar had raked up a big furore. The PM had thrown the jibe at the CM for breaking off with the BJP before the 2014 parliamentary polls and later also withdrawing support from Jitan Ram Manjhi, who served as the CM for a short while. Kumar had called PM Modi’s remark against him an insult to the people of Bihar. The JD(U), which was part of the Grand Alliance with the RJD in 2015 election, had also demanded withdrawal of the words spoken by PM Modi and launched a campaign by sending lakhs of samples of hair and nails to PM’s office to test the DNA of the people of Bihar. In the same polls, the RJD chief had stirred a controversy when he had called PM Modi a political ‘Ravana’. In 2019 parliamentary polls, a senior JD(U) leader Sanjay Singh had called RJD chief’s eldest daughter and Rajya Sabha MP “Shurparnakha” to assert how Bharti was playing a role of causing friction between her two brother Tej Pratap and Tejashwi in the RJD’s first family similar to the mythological character in Ramayan who had caused differences between demon king Ravana and brother Vibhishana. The RJD had hit out at the JD(U) saying it was a party harbouring devils and evil spirits who cause harm to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-poll-campaign-gets-acerbic-historical-mythological-characters-figure-in-personalised-barbs/story-uxiDNp5mndBHAfYWq6xPpO.html

The state government is developing a web-based application (app) and planning to introduce a colour-coding mechanism while allowing the public to use the suburban trains during non-peak hours.Also read | In Covid-19 crackdown, commuters without masks in Mumbai local trains to be finedThe state government, which had requested Western and Central Railways to allow all commuters, was in turn told by the rail authorities to use technology for crowd control.The state government has started work on the railways’ proposal.“We will develop the app. We are also working on the colour-coding mechanism to restrict the number of passengers in suburban trains,” said Kishor Raje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department of the state government.An official from Mantralaya, the state secretariat, said the app would help passengers to book tickets and decide the time slot they wish to travel. This will enable the railway authorities to issue a stipulated number of tickets in a bid to prevent overcrowding in trains. The tickets will be issued to passengers with the colour-code, specifying the time slot during which they are expected to travel.Western and Central Railway authorities have raised concerns about their capacity. They can run 3,100 trains daily. They have pleaded helplessness and stated that they would allow 700 commuters per train and around 22 lakh passengers daily, as compared to 70 lakh during pre-Covid-19 times.The state government has maintained that appropriate steps are being taken to prevent overcrowding in trains. “We have allowed 30% of private sector employees to travel by trains, which have reduced around 20 lakh daily commuters. Besides, another 20 lakh commuters have become less owing to closure of schools, colleges and other educational institutions. If the railway authorities operate at their full strength of 3,100 train services, no overcrowding will occur during peak hours. We have also suggested running a special train for women passengers every hour. The move is in line with encouraging staggered office hours. More ladies specials will help women commuters to travel during non-peak hours,” said a state government official, requesting anonymity.He added: “We don’t want to impose more restrictions, but encourage passengers with staggered timings. Now, it’s up to the railway authorities to operate at their full strength.”Mumbai’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said that the state administration would work out ways to ensure reopening of train service for all commuters at the earliest, despite the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-plans-app-colour-coding-to-control-crowd-in-local-trains/story-d0M7QWASR837V0QvBQiVFN.html

According to the police, the couple identified as Manish Sharma,42, a resident of Pali Hills, Jalandhar and his wife Manisha Sharma, 40, had been hiding in Jalandhar, their home town, for the past six months since they left Bhopal after defrauding at least 5 people of Rs 60 to Rs 70 lakh. They shut all their social media accounts and switched off their mobile phones leaving hardly any clue with the police to track them down. “The couple Manish Sharma and Manisha Sharma did everything they could think of to the evade arrest. We didn’t have any clue to reach them. But a food delivery site helped us nab them. After fleeing from Bhopal, the couple once ordered food online in Jalandhar from a popular food delivery site but instead of ordering the food from a new account, they ordered it from their old registered account which they used to order food online in Bhopal too. The cyber team tracked them down in Jalandhar,” said Gopal Dhakad, additional superintendent of police (ASP), crime branch, Bhopal. Also read: India registers 48,648 new Covid-19 cases, lower than Thursday“A resident of Bhopal, Santosh Bairagi, lodged a complaint at Crime branch Bhopal a few months ago that he had invested Rs 9 lakh in a company owned by Manish Sharma who stayed at Katara Hills in Bhopal as he had promised to return double the money invested. But in April, they left the house and switched off mobile phones. Even their Facebook accounts were also deleted,” said the police officer. “After getting the clue regarding their whereabouts from the food delivery site, a team of crime branch was sent to Jalandhar recently. The team had a house to stay in on rent near the accused’s house and having been convinced about their identity, arrested them. The couple was brought to Bhopal on Tuesday and arrested on Wednesday,” said the officer. During interrogation, the couple confessed their crime. They said they used to befriend rich people and convince them to invest in their company to get double the amount of investment. There may be more victims which may come to light during the interrogation, said the police officer. The accused have been booked under sections 420 (cheating) and 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). They were produced before the court on Thursday and the court sent Manisha on judicial remand while Manish Sharma on police remand of three days, said Sai Krishna Thota, superintendent of police, Bhopal (south).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/love-for-food-lands-couple-in-police-custody-after-evading-arrest-for-6-months/story-wM5oF7TAcy3nLyj0OLR11O.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Govt proposes throwing Mumbai local trains open to all around Diwali, BMC expects spike in Covid-19 cases||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has expressed concern about a spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases following the Maharashtra government’s proposed move to throw the suburban trains – the lifeline for Mumbai and the adjoining densely populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) – open for all commuters around the Diwali festival, which will be celebrated on November 14, at three specific time slots during the day.The BMC authorities said allowing the public to use suburban trains around Diwali might lead to an uptick in Covid-19 cases as more people are likely to go out for shopping and mingling with their friends and relatives because of the festival of lights.Also read | In Covid-19 crackdown, commuters without masks in Mumbai local trains to be finedThe civic body reinforced precautionary measures for the public such as the use of masks and sanitisers in a bid to rein in the spread of the contagion. The Maharashtra government on Wednesday proposed to the Union Ministry of Railways to allow all commuters to travel by suburban trains. The government has written to the general managers (GMs) of Western Railway and Central Railway and proposed time slots to allow all commuters to use suburban train services. Three time slots during the day have been proposed for all commuters and also a ladies special train for women passengers after every one hour. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (AMC), BMC, said: “One cannot deny that there is likely to be a surge in Covid-19 cases because of the state government’s proposed move. The public is expected to mingle and go out for their Diwali shopping.” He added: “Wearing of masks, sanitising hands and other precautionary measures must be complied with.”BMC is also planning to ramp up its daily testing mechanism because of the state government’s proposed move. The civic body plans to organise free testing camps in Mumbai and management of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. “We have sufficient hospital beds that can cope up with a possible spike in Covid-19 cases,” Kakani said. BMC’s data showed that around 54% of Covid-19 beds are lying vacant in Mumbai. The city has reported 2,55,360 Covid-19 cases and 10,229 viral disease-related deaths till Thursday. At present, Mumbai has 19,082 active Covd-19 cases. So far, 2,25,526 Covid-19 patients have recovered from their viral infection. In a separate move, all restaurants in Mumbai have been allowed to operate at 50% of their capacity from Sunday (November 1), as compared to the existing 33%. In early October, the state government had allowed reopening of restaurants with 50% of their capacity across Maharashtra. However, in Mumbai, the BMC had capped it at 33% till Saturday (October 31).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-proposes-throwing-local-trains-open-to-all-bmc-expects-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-rBjdEaxuU8Onm2L4TErRNJ.html

30-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses bail to former IL&FS executive Ramchand Karunakaran||The Bombay High Court on Thursday rejected bail application of Ramchand Karunakaran, former managing director of IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd. (ITNL), who has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the money laundering investigation being conducted by the agency.Karunakaran was arrested by the ED on June 19, 2019, in connection with the proceedings under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.According to the ED, the committee of directors of IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. (IFIN), in connivance with promoters of IL&FS group, sanctioned loans to several group companies which were under financial stress and unable to discharge their outstandingloans. The new loans were sanctioned to repay their earlier loans and to be utilized by the groups, otherwise than, as mentioned in the Credit Approval Memorandum, and committed schedule offences. It is further alleged that the committee did so in order to maintain the credentials of the IFIN and in lieu to continued to receive high remuneration.Karunakaran sought bail contending that he was neither part of the committee of dire torture nor was he included in top management of the group, and therefore no accusations could be attributed to him.Besides, he pointed out that, three members of the committee, Ravi Parthasarathy, Ramesh Bawa and Hari Sankaran were not arrested by the ED, in fact, they have been granted bail under section 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) by the designated court on September 23, 2019, and sought relief for him on the ground of parity.Also read: JP Nadda condoles BJP workers’ killings in J-K’s KulgamED’s counsel Hiten Venegainkar opposed the bail plea pointing out that the applicant faced serious allegations. He pointed out that the forensic audit conducted by Grant Thorton has revealed that Karunakaran was a member of the IFIN committee of directors and was this equally liable.As regards his ground of parity, Venegainkar submitted that at least two members of the IFIN committee - Ramesh Bawa and Hari Sankaran - have been arrested by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office, which has also initiated proceedings under relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 against IL&FS group.In this backdrop, Justice Bharati Dangre refused to accept the submissions made on behalf of Karunakaran and rejected his bail plea.“The magnitude of the offence involving the applicant is enormous and the amount involved is huge,” said the judge, while rejecting his bail plea. The court said the effect of the conspiracy hatched by the accused, focusing on a desired result, makes it a serious economic offence. HC said the IFIN was facing a serious liquidity crisis leading to the inability to fulfil debt obligations. “Investigation has revealed that those at the helm of affairs played a hoax and in a disguised way duped the stakeholders and general public whose monies were at stake.”The HC also noted that the investigation brought out that while the profit of the IFIN declined, the remuneration and commission etc. paid to directors increased substantially.“This had a wide impact on the economy of the country since the IL&FS is a finance company which subdued the equity from shareholders like the LIC, HDFC, Central Bank of India and State Bank of India,” said justice Dangre, commenting upon the overall adverse impact caused by IL&FS crises.“The default crisis in the IL&FS has adversely impacted the growth of non-banking finance companies. It has jeopardised hundreds of investors, banks and mutual funds associated with IL&FS and sparked panic among equity investors, as several NBFC faced turmoil amid a default scare,” said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-former-il-fs-executive-ramchand-karunakaran/story-Qq2xemrEr88xu535ecS9yK.html

30-10-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: PIL to be filed to restrict gathering during Kali Puja, Jagadhatri Puja, Chhath Puja||A Kolkata lawyer is likely to move the Calcutta high court on Monday seeking orders to restrict the gathering of devotees and visitors during Kali Puja, Chhath Puja and Jagadhatri Puja, all three of which are scheduled in November. On October 19, the Calcutta high court, while hearing a PIL filed by the same lawyer, had banned the entry of visitors in Durga Puja pandals and mandated the erection of barricades. The court had also capped the number of puja committee members who could enter the pandals. “We are planning to move the high court again early next week. Kali Puja, Jagadhatri Puja and Chhath Puja will take place in November. Lakhs of people are expected to gather in some districts where these pujas are celebrated in a big way. We will seek orders to restrict gatherings as there is a pandemic and relaxation could lead to a massive surge in Covid-19 cases,” said Sabyasachi Chatterjee, the lawyer who filed the Durga Puja PIL for petitioner Ajay Kumar De. Also Read: India scales up Covid-19 testing capacity; positivity rate dropsWest Bengal has witnessed a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases during the festive season with people coming out in large numbers for puja shopping, eating out and pandal-hopping without wearing masks and without maintaining physical distance. Even though because of the pandemic and the high court order, Durga Puja celebrations were muted this year, the state is now reporting around 4,000 new cases every day. “While Jagadhatri Puja is celebrated in a big way in Hooghly district, some places such as Barasat in North 24 Parganas celebrate Kali Puja in a big way. In 2019, devotees had violated the National Green Tribunal directions while celebrating Chhath Puja in Kolkata. The pandemic is going on and there need to be some restrictions,” Chatterjee added. In West Bengal, the maximum number of cases is being reported from Kolkata and North 24 Parganas. Around 900 new cases are being reported from each of these two districts. Citing the example of Kerala which witnessed a massive surge in Covid-19 cases after guidelines were relaxed during the festival of Onam, a doctors’ forum in West Bengal had warned the Mamata Banerjee administration that a similar situation could arise in the state after the festive season if the authorities showed laxity. On October 26, West Bengal had reported 4,121 new Covid-19 cases, which was the second-highest number of cases in India after Kerala. While Kerala with 4,287 cases topped the list, Maharashtra with 3,645 cases ranked third.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-pil-to-be-filed-to-restrict-gathering-during-kali-puja-jagadhatri-puja-chhath-puja/story-DxfslAUa8c5gJ2fifQvJZN.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Farm fires harming Punjab more than Delhi: PAU study||Stubble burning in Punjab is a localised problem and doesn’t add to air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), rather farmers are choking their own children and brethren by setting the fields on fire, finds a study by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). The study says that the south-easterly direction of wind is highly unlikely to affect the air quality in the neighbouring states of Haryana and New Delhi. The study says that the detailed analysis of wind speed done over three years shows that fall in temperature in October and November reduce the formation of air currents. “So, a stable atmosphere is created in which only little vertical movement of air current occurs and horizontal transport of air is also reduced,” says the head of the department of climate change and agriculture meteorology of PAU, Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, who has compiled the study. LOW WIND SPEED, DIP IN TEMPERATURE CREATES CLOSED-ROOM SITUATIONShe, along with her team, has analysed the data of three years from 2017 to 2019 to conclude that the low wind speed and dip in temperature lead to a closed-room situation in which hardly anything enters or goes out. She observed that only once, the wind speed exceeded 5km per hour (6.11 per hour) and “the wind direction was towards the south east (opposite Delhi)”. “Every paddy-growing state is suffering from factors adding to its air pollution. In simple terms, Punjab’s smoke is not travelling 300-400 km to choke the lungs of Delhi, rather Punjab farmers are harming their own children and brethren by setting the fields on fire,” said Sidhu. FIRECRACKERS AROUND DIWALI WORSEN THE PROBLEM She said firecrackers around Diwali worsen the problem. While quoting the data of previous three years, she said smog was witnessed for 12 days till now this year, 10 days in 2019 and 11 days in 2018. She said the number of smog days may increase this year as the incidence of stubble burning was relatively high. The PAU finding is the second such study that claims Punjab farm fires are not contributing to Delhi’s pollution. In 2018, a joint study by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, and Punjab Pollution Control Board had concluded that a significant contribution to Delhi’s air pollution was from within the NCR or Uttar Pradesh. However, the PAU’s study has been criticised by local environmentalists, who says such studies could encourage more fire fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farm-fires-harming-punjab-more-than-delhi-pau-study/story-Vu9coUA0AvgIYuKKQp2LMN.html

30-10-2020||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: SP, BSP start new chapter of bitterness||The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the two main regional political players in Uttar Pradesh (UP), are back to their old ways of playing bitter rivals, where tit-for-tat is the name of the political game.The rivalry, which began due to the infamous guest house incident on June 2, 1995 and lasted for a good 24 years, had a momentary reprieve ahead of last year’s parliamentary elections. Also read | Mayawati suspends 7 MLAs, says will back even BJP to defeat SPThough both the SP and the BSP had fought last year’s parliamentary elections in an uncharacteristic alliance on the lines of 1993, the bonhomie came unstuck after the polls, as the political formation made little impact at the hustings.The 1995 incident refers to a ruckus caused by SP lawmakers and supporters at a state-run guest house, where Mayawati, the then BSP chief Kanshi Ram’s closest aide and the then general secretary of the party, was meeting her legislators purportedly to pull the plug on the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led coalition government. The SP lawmakers and workers had gone on a rampage, forcing Mayawati to lock herself in a room, while they detained several of her legislators, claiming they had defected to the SP.The echoes of the unsavoury episode lingered on for years.The latest chapter of SP-BSP discord traces its origin to the biennial Rajya Sabha elections for 10 seats from UP, when an independent candidate Prakash Bajaj filed his nomination papers at the last moment on Tuesday (October 27) with 10 SP lawmakers in tow. His entry into the fray implied that there would be an electoral contest, as there were 11 candidates for 10 vacant RS seats. The SP’s manoeuvre had cast a doubt over the prospects of BSP candidate Ramji Gautam, who was fielded by the party even though it is short of the requisite 37 votes to record an outright win. The crisis worsened on Wednesday afternoon, when four BSP members of UP legislative assembly (MLAs), who had proposed Gautam’s candidature, petitioned the returning officer (RO) seeking withdrawal of their names. Later, they met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at his party headquarters in Lucknow along with three more BSP MLAs.On Wednesday evening, the RO found Gautam’s nomination valid and rejected the nomination papers of Bajaj, who enjoyed the support of 10 SP lawmakers.On Thursday morning, Mayawati suspended the seven rebel BSP MLAs and promised to pay the SP back in its own coin. She also raked up the guest house case.“The BSP made a mistake by withdrawing the (guest house) case,” she said.Mayawati owned up to another mistake such as the decision to contest last year’s parliamentary polls in alliance with the SP. Earlier in 1993, the SP and the BSP had got into an alliance for UP assembly polls. Later, though they had formed the government, differences cropped up in no time.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had stepped in and offered to make Mayawati the chief minister. She was weighing in on the BJP’s offer, when the SP lawmakers and supporters had attacked the guest house on June 2, 1995. The SP and the BSP had buried the guest house hatchet and contested last year’s parliamentary polls in alliance in UP, but Mayawati walked out soon after the election results were declared. “It is behenji (Mayawati), who drew first blood. We were flabbergasted, when she broke the alliance on her own. Now, she has sided with the BJP and her MLAs and party leaders are upset. They are looking for an opportunity to join the SP. She herself is playing games. She has no business to blame us,” said a SP leader. Rajendra Chaudhary, spokesperson of the SP’s UP unit, on Wednesday termed the charges levelled by Mayawati as “baseless allegations”. He said, “The truth is that the BSP has sided with the BJP. The SP had sincerely followed the alliance dharma with the BSP till it decided to snap ties. We had successfully transferred all SP votes to the BSP candidates. The SP suffered at the BSP’s expense, as we managed to win only five seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The BSP needs to do a number crunching before it talks about teaching us a lesson. How many MLAs does it have? The BSP suspended seven MLAs on Thursday. How many MLAs does the party have now? Our party chief fulfils the promises he makes. He respected all opposition parties, when he was the CM. He believes in the democratic system.”The RS polls will be held on November 9 and the results will be declared on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-sp-bsp-start-new-chapter-of-bitterness/story-3dGrxcbaWTus779NsEE8xH.html

30-10-2020||City||Gauhati HC seeks affidavit from NRC coordinator on inclusion of ineligible names in list||The Gauhati high court (HC) has asked Hitesh Dev Sarma, the Assam coordinator of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), to file a comprehensive affidavit on how some ineligible people managed to get included in the final NRC list for the north-eastern state released in August, 2019. The two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Manojit Bhuyan and Soumitra Saikia, directed Sarma last week to file the affidavit within three weeks, when the next hearing of the case is slated to be held. The court was hearing a petition by Rahima Begam, a resident of Mukalmua in Assam’s Nalbari district, who had challenged a 2019 order of a foreigner’s tribunal, which had declared her an alien. Begam’s name figured on the NRC list that aims to weed out illegal foreigners. The NRC list, which was released on August 31, 2019, had excluded 1.9 million applicants. Around 33 million applicants had applied for their inclusion in the list. Also read | Assam NRC list: The eligibility issue and other latest developmentsThe list, which was a revision of a similar exercise first introduced in 1951, was compiled following a Supreme Court (SC) order and the exercise was conducted under the apex court’s supervision. The HC noted that the present case was of “great importance” and was not a “solitary instance” and stressed that insertions of names of ineligible people in the NRC list was “against the law”. “This is not an isolated case. Let the Assam NRC coordinator file a comprehensive affidavit and bring on record the situations along with necessary particulars, where inroads into the list may have been created by individuals, who are undeserving and not legally entitled to be included in it,” the court said. The court stated that the affidavit should not be restricted to Nalbari district, to which the petitioner Begam belongs, but must include details from all 33 districts of Assam.Earlier in October, Sarma had written to all deputy commissioners (DCs) and district registrars of citizen registration (DRCR) and directed them to issue speaking orders for deletion of the ineligible people’s names from the list. The letter didn’t mention the number of such ineligible people.However, reports, quoting sources, said that around 10,000 ineligible people have been identified, whose names will be removed from the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gauhati-hc-seeks-affidavit-from-nrc-coordinator-on-inclusion-of-ineligible-names-in-list/story-lMudlDua4fMSNlvH3ZSHCI.html

Already the Union health minister and the Prime Minister have said that all citizens in the country will get the vaccine free,” said Singh.Talking about preparations, Singh said that the state was preparing for the logistics, transportation and cold-chain maintenance of the vaccine when it is ready.Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine update: Brazil expects vaccine by June 2021, Russia temporarily pauses trialsVaccination became a political issue in Uttar Pradesh and other states when the BJP’s Bihar assembly polls manifesto and leaders’ speeches promised free vaccine to residents of Bihar.Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav, in a tweet on October 22, attacked the BJP government over the issue. He said: “Today the ruling BJP, in its Bihar polls manifesto, is saying that it will administer free Corona vaccine to people of Bihar. Why was such an announcement not made of the people of UP and other states? In forthcoming polls, in UP and other states, people will teach BJP a lesson for such opportunistic and narrow politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-government-to-provide-free-covid-19-vaccine/story-NST5oLN6UuLNL6iJmEgsBJ.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi AQI remains in very poor category; likely to improve from Saturday||A day after the Air Quality Index (AQI) dropped to the severe category, pollution levels in the national Capital remained in very poor category on Friday morning. According to the data shared by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI value was 380 at 7 am. On Thursday, the air quality was “severe” for a major part of the day. However, the average AQI for the day settled at 395 – dangerously close to the severe category. Also read | Centre brings new law to tackle NCR air crisisAir quality enters the very poor zone between 301-400 mark and crosses over to the severe zone after exceeding 400 causing distress and respiratory illnesses, especially in children and those exposed to the bad air. Till 1pm on Thursday, the average AQI oscillated between 402 and 408. At monitoring stations in Mundka, Bawana, Narela, Wazirpur and Anand Vihar, pollution levels neared the 500 mark, the worst AQI recordings since January. Scientists attributed the bad air to calm surface wind conditions that have led to the accumulation of pollutants in the atmosphere and stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana that is affecting the National Capital Region (NCR). Satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) showed a thick cover of smoke over the Delhi-NCR region on Thursday.VK Soni, head of the environment monitoring research centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said the wind speed was below 4kmph on Thursday. He added that the situation was expected to improve from Friday. “By Saturday, there will be a significant improvement in the air quality,” Soni said. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) of the Union ministry of earth sciences said stubble fires spotted over Punjab and Haryana were the highest (2,912) this season on Wednesday and their share (36%) in the city’s PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels too hit a new high on that day. A day after Delhi reported the coldest October in 26 years recording a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal, IMD has predicted a misty day on Friday with minimum temperature likely to drop to 12 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature is predicted to remain at 32 degrees Celsius – marginally lesser than Thursday’s 32.2 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-aqi-remains-in-very-poor-category-likely-to-improve-from-saturday/story-5aA55MgXG1C6J7GxwPoWEI.html

30-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Tests increase by 11.6% in October, positivity rate drops in Mumbai||Covid-19 tests in Mumbai have increased by 11.6% in October in comparison to the last month. Civic officials attributed this rise to several initiatives taken under the door-to-door survey of ‘My Family My Responsibility’ to check cases.According to data analysed by HT, during September 1-27, as many as 315,563 tests were conducted. While in the last 27 days, 352,430 tests have been done in the city. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said ramped up testing resulted in more cases being detected. Around 13,000- 15,000 tests are being held every day since September. “We have increased Covid-19 testing since August. Until August 24, we were testing around 5,500 people per day in the city. But now, this number has gone over almost 15,000. At three instances, the daily testing had crossed the 16,000-mark, including rapid antigen tests,” he said.As a result of increased testing, positivity rate has seen a drop to 14.26% this month which was 17% till September-end. According to the BMC dashboard, the overall doubling rate in Mumbai stands at1 49 days. “Despite increasing testing to over 16,000 per day, the number has remained stable and constant. We haven’t noticed any sudden surge in the number of cases which gives the assurance that the situation might have come under control,” added Kakani. Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayFor instance, as per the civic body’s dashboard, on October 27, 15,825 people were tested for Covid-19. Out of this, 734 people tested positive -- 4.6% positivity rate. Civic officials believe door-to-door survey under the ‘My Family My Responsibility’ has also contributed to increased testing . “Whenever we see any one with symptoms of Covid-19 during the survey, we run tests on them. This has helped in early diagnosis,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, part of the state Covid-19 task force.At present, almost 40% daily tests are being conducted by the rapid antigen test which gives reports within 15 minutes. “The false negativity rate of the rapid antigen test is lesser than 1%. So, we have decided to extend its use. Now, hospitals also test suspected cases with rapid antigen kits,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital. Early diagnosis has also helped trace close contacts faster which has helped to break the chain of infection among people. In Mumbai, so far over 3.1million close contacts of positive cases have been traced. Social workers have welcomed the growing number of testing in the city. “With the ongoing festival season, it is important to run tests on the maximum number of people, including asymptomatic cases. An early detection also increases chances of recovery,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-tests-increase-by-11-6-in-october-positivity-rate-drops-in-mumbai/story-3vjxFrhfKzfTDmN2Z7H5fJ.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Air pollution: New law, new hope, old challenges||Union government’s decision to set up a new umbrella agency to fight air pollution may run into the same problems that dogged the Supreme Court-appointed Epca, experts warned, while some others also said that any renewed focus on the problem was welcome and the answer to the long persisting problem could lie in a new federal body.Till Thursday, the most crucial agency monitoring and acting on the pollution issue was the environment pollution (prevention and control) authority (Epca), which was set up in 1998 and had a mandate empowered by the top court.“There are several concerns with this ordinance, starting with the fact that legal and regulatory changes to tackle public issues like air pollution need a democratic conceptualisation. At the outset it is clear that the central government has taken control over the pollution control matters in the Delhi NCR region. This starts with the fact that the chairperson of this commission is a central government appointee. The commission will be heavily dominated by bureaucrats, to whom the legal frameworks gives various powers. The enforcement mechanism clearly top down and so far there is no indication that it will include third party monitoring and citizen-driven enforcement,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.She added, “One important issue is limiting the adjudication to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and not any other court. This is problematic as the appointments of the chairperson and members of both the commission and the NGT will be done by the Centre.”SN Tripathi of IIT-Kanpur, however, welcomed the move, saying the commission will better coordinate efforts to curb air pollution among National Capital Region (NCR) states. “There was no single body, authority, ministry or state which was empowered or dedicated to do that. This ordinance is an excellent example of learning from what the US did in California. While the US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) was an autonomous and empowered body set up to manage air pollution across the country, California posed a singular challenge as a hotspot, that’s when the California Air Resource Board was set up to tackle that particular airshed. The problem of dealing with air pollution in California has a striking similarity to NCR in terms of meteorological and other conditions that we see in the Indo-Gangetic plains,” said Tripathi, who heads of the civil engineering department.Legal experts said the commission may not be able to do much more than what Epca was already doing. Environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta said the commission has been given powers similar to the one conferred on Epca by a 1998 notification. Epca had powers under section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.“Epca, in its 22 years of existence, has rarely exercised its statutory powers and had become an advisory body to the Supreme Court. The same situation is likely to take place with regard to the new commission. Section 12 gives power to entertain complaints. Such power already existed with Epca, but was never exercised. The same is likely to continue with the new commission. The reason is simple. Under the ordinance, if an offence has been committed, a complaint has to be filed before the judicial magistrate first class. Given the fact that a majority of members of the commission are serving government servants, including chief secretaries and secretaries, it would amount to filing cases against themselves. It is for this very reason that Epca never filed a single complaint before the magistrate in 22 years of its existence,” Dutta said.The environment ministry in a note issued to journalists on Thursday said actions and orders made by Epca shall continue to be effective and deemed to have been done under this ordinance.Legally, however, the commission would be more powerful than Epca, said Dutta. He said that the commission will have parliamentary mandate after the ordinance is passed. “It will become an Act of Parliament, independent of other statutes. For NCR and adjoining areas this commission will operate. It is a complete code in itself,” he said.Shibani Ghosh, a public interest lawyer and a CPR fellow, said that even under the new body, criminal conviction would be used as the primary tool to deter environmental offences.“The commission has to file a complaint in a criminal court for non-compliance or contravention of its directions and orders. Whether it decides to exercise this power, and how often, would depend significantly on its staff and resources as criminal prosecution is a very time intensive process. The fear of criminal conviction has failed to deter environmental offences in India so far and it is unfortunate that the new law continues to use that as the primary tool for enforcement,” she explained.Dutta said the commission’s initiatives could reduce judicial intervention. “With the commission, it will now be a completely bureaucrats driven exercise,” explained Dutta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/new-law-new-hope-old-challenges/story-5sn2w4GUk7x4lX9ekiGgFO.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||At 12.5°C, Delhi logs lowest temperature in October in 26 years||The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degree Celsius on Thursday, the lowest in October in 26 years, because of a thin cloud cover and other weather conditions including slow wind speeds, scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The normal minimum temperature for this time of the year is 15-16 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre. The city had recorded a minimum temperature of 12.3 degree Celsius on October 31, 1994.The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature for this month -- 9.4 degree C -- on October 31, 1937. The absence of a cloud cover was among the reasons for the below-normal minimum temperature at this time of the year, the senior IMD scientist said. “The main reason behind this is that we did not have much cloud cover, which causes the surface to cool rapidly. In the next two-three days, too, the minimum temperature is expected to be around 12 degrees Celsius,” Srivastava said, adding that another possible reason was slow wind speeds that allow the formation of mist and fog.Minimum temperatures are likely to dip to 11 degrees Celsius in Delhi by November 1, the IMD scientist added.Low temperature and low wind speed also exacerbate air pollution in the city -- which has become an annual health crisis with the onset of winter every year -- as pollutants settle closer to the land and are unable to disperse. “Temperature plays a huge role in determining the pollution levels. If the early morning temperature is low then the pollution particles get trapped closer to the ground. Low temperature was one of the reasons that kept the pollution levels close to the severe zone on Thursday,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre.Delhi on Thursday recorded an average Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 395 (“very poor” category) while the air quality was “severe” (above 400) in some parts of the capital earlier in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-12-5-c-delhi-logs-lowest-temperature-in-october-in-26-years/story-DrSBYfuLZ3rNGZxJYDtrMI.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 crisis in Delhi: Positivity rate nears 10%||The graph of Covid-19 disease in Delhi continued to climb, with the city registering 5,739 new cases in a day — a record high again — on Thursday. Reporting a record number of new cases for the third day in a row, Delhi’s tally of Covid-19 cases now stands at 375,753, which includes 338,378 recoveries and 6,423 deaths. On Wednesday the city had added 5,673 new cases of the viral infection, after reporting 4,853 new cases a day earlier on Tuesday.On average, Delhi has now reported 4,491 cases every day in the past week, which means the trajectory has now surpassed the previous peak of 4,174, which was reported for the week ending September 17, at the height of the second surge.The positivity rate, which went past 9% on Wednesday for the first time since early September, increased further to 9.55% on Thursday. Delhi had seen the first surge in cases in June — the week ending June 26 — when 3,446 cases were reported in a day at its peak..Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at ICMR said the government now needs to stay focused on keeping up with the testing numbers and spread mass awareness on wearing masks. “Delhi’s current situation is a culmination of many things — temperatures have come down making the environment moret conducive for the virus, the festive season because of which there is probably the highest interaction between people that the city has ever seen since the advent of the virus in March. And then there is air pollution, because of which many are already suffering from flu-like symptoms,” he said. Earlier this week, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had said in a press briefing that Delhi is inching towards its third peak. On Thursday, state health minister Satyendar Jain too said it “appears that Delhi is heading towards a third wave”, but said there would be clarity on this only by next week.“The trend of Covid cases is on a decline across the country. However, it has remained a matter of worry in three states and Union territories. Delhi is inching towards its third peak, while an unprecedented rise is being witnessed in Kerala and Bengal,” Dr Paul said on Tuesday.On Thursday, the government conducted 60,124 tests of which 17,029 were through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), considered the most reliable Covid-19 testing method so far. It was on Sunday when Delhi had for the first time conducted over 17,000 RT-PCR tests. Testing in the city was scaled up from September onward but most diagnoses were conducted using the rapid antigen method.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-crisis-in-delhi-positivity-rate-nears-10/story-vZCdBXDuxeYKdVJuowTGVM.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Lesser-known historical edifices||Every granny needs a monument. And every granddaughter, another one close by.This double requirement is perfectly fulfilled in south Delhi’s breezy Green Park locality, which is home to two of the city’s lesser-known historical edifices—Dadi-Poti ka gumbad (big dome), or the domes of grandmother-granddaughter.Both stand next to each other, perched upon a gentle slope. This evening, there’s no one around. The setting sun is streaming through the leafy foliage of surrounding trees. The Aurobindo Market is a stone’s throw away, but this compound radiates such intense vibes of solitude that it is hard to imagine any shopping place for miles around. That’s not what makes this twin monument so special. In a city where almost all monuments commemorate male rulers, it is a relief to come across centuries-old landmarks enshrined to women— who, additionally, might have nothing to do with royalty. They might indeed be as common as we are. One can only regret not knowing who these two women were, beside being somebody’s “Dadi” and “Poti”.But well, here’s a blooper. According to the all-knowing Archaeological Survey of India slab, the names for these tombs were “perhaps coined (so) because of the fact that one tomb is bigger than the other.” It adds that there is absolutely no information about who were buried there.Whatever, the buildings evoke the melancholy caused by faded grandeur. The walls are especially impressive—very rough, and composed of uneven chunks of rubble, as if the monuments had been built, then immediately demolished, and quickly rustled up again from the broken stones.It is dark and musty inside the bigger mausoleum, Dadi’s gumbad. About half a dozen graves lie on the eastern side. Sky light is streaming in from a pair of arched entrances placed side-by-side, like two friends whispering into each other’s ears. Through another opening, one can enjoy the glimpses of a lush bougainvillea tree. One more opening, high up towards the ceiling, gives a view of Poti’s gumbad. Its entrance is locked. According to the book Delhi, the Built Heritage, Dadi’s dates to the Lodhi era and Poti’s is from the age of Tughlaqs. By now, two other visitors have come. Both are lying on the grassy slope, their back turned towards the gumbads. The man’s head is on the woman’s shoulder, almost romantically.What will Dadi say?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-lesser-known-historical-edifices/story-1QEJL6kC6qa2Yv3Y93mblK.html
30-10-2020||Lucknow||Unnao Ex-MP Annu Tandon quits Congress||Senior Congress leader and former Unnao MP Annu Tandon said on Thursday that she had resigned from the primary membership of the party, accusing the state Congress leadership of “misalignment” with her and not supporting her work. State Congress leaders, however, said that she was expelled for anti-party activities. Another party leader from Unnao and UP Congress Committee general secretary Ankit Parihar also resigned from the party. Tandon, who was associated with the party for 15 years, sent a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday. Her resignation comes at a time when a bypoll is scheduled to take place in Bangarmau, one of the six assembly segments of Unnao, on November 3.  “As far as my future path goes, I will be consulting with my workers, who are core to everything I have believed so far and I am confident that we will continue to be a force for good, a force for change and a means to truly represent the voice of the people,” Tandon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/unnao-ex-mp-annu-tandon-quits-congress/story-HrdfYhoCOMCbx7pp270QkI.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Overcharging by roadside vendors burning holes in Chandigarh residents’ pockets||Already reeling under exorbitant prices of onions, Chandigarh residents allege roadside vendors are overcharging for other vegetables as well in the absence of a check on their pricelist.With apni mandis closed, residents say they are forced to rely on roadside vendors and those who have set up temporary stalls. But, their prices are not being monitored.On Thursday, HT found that capsicum and tomatoes were the most overpriced. Vendors in Sectors 18, 19, 35, 46 and 48 were found selling capsicum for Rs 120 a kg against market committee’s price of Rs 70 per kg, while tomatoes, priced at Rs 55 per kg, were being sold for Rs 70 per kg.Locally grown vegetables like bottlegourd and cucumber mostly had the same rates. When questioned, Guddu a vendor in Sector 18, said, “We buy up to 25kg vegetables in wholesale, but around 2kg gets crushed under their weight, so we have to adjust the cost to curtail the losses. Softer vegetables like tomatoes and capsicum are more prone to this, hence more expensive rates.”Some residents alleged that even though vendors, who had been allotted space to set up stalls, charged fairer rates, those trading through carts fleeced them the most.“Even though the quality of vegetables was poor, I was charged Rs 80 per kg for onions and Rs 65 per kg for potatoes. I’m a senior citizen and don’t mind paying a little extra to have vegetables delivered to my house, but vendors make the most of residents not having other options,” said Nirmal Singh, president of the Sector 38-D Resident Welfare Association (RWA).Administrator of the Chandigarh Market Committee, Nazuk Kumar said she will look into the matter.Meanwhile, members of the Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) said it was high time this practice was reined in.“Every week we get complaints of fleecing from various RWAs of the city. We will be holding a meeting on November 1, where overcharging for vegetables will be one of the top agendas to be discussed,” said CRAWFED chairman Hitesh Puri.Onion prices drop slightlyMeanwhile, from Rs 75 for a kg last week, onion prices have reduced to Rs 65 a kg.The rates decreased slightly with improvement in supply from Maharashtra, but will remain on the higher side till the end of November, officials at the Sector 26 vegetable market said.Meanwhile onions from Afghanistan have also started coming in. “We got two truckloads on Thursday, which were sold at a wholesale price of Rs 25 per kg,” the officials said.Potato rates have also dropped from Rs 55 to Rs 45 per kg with the usual supply from Himachal Pradesh improving. Along with these, locally grown potatoes, which are of better quality, are also being supplied.DISPARITY IN PRICESRates of various vegetables (per kg) as found on ThursdayVegetable Market committee VendorCapsicum Rs 70 Rs 120Tomato Rs 55 Rs 70Onion Rs 65 Rs 70Potato Rs 45 Rs 55||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/overcharging-by-roadside-vendors-burning-holes-in-chandigarh-residents-pockets/story-vXFvJpaEKOxe2ljU4gPHqJ.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC House revokes hike in water charges, admn to take final call||Pending approval of the UT administration, the municipal corporation on Thursday decided to rollback the increase in water charges notified in September.The resolution passed in the General House meeting asked for continuation of the rates effective before the new rates, comprising a hike of up to 200%, were notified by the administration on September 11.“We will send the House decision to the administration. But, till a new notification is issued by UT to this effect, the increased tariff notified in September will remain in force,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav.Against an expenditure of around Rs 225 crore on city’s water management, the corporation earns only around Rs 70 crore. With the tariff increase, MC had expected to earn additional Rs 80 crore. “In my note with the House resolution, I will mention the losses incurred by MC in water management,” Yadav said.Heated arguments exchangedTempers flared as the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sparred over the water tariff hike. Both parties brought separate agendas on the matter.While the Congress demanded cancellation of the tariff hike notification, the BJP sought a discussion on the issue, to be followed by a revised notification.The House rejected Congress’ agenda, as the BJP councillors led by party’s state chief and councillor Arun Sood contended that it was illegal as the House didn’t have the power to cancel a notification issued by the UT administrator. This prompted heated arguments between the councillors of both parties. Congress’ Devinder Singh Babla and BJP’s Gurpreet Singh Dhillon even had a verbal spat, with one of the councillors heard saying, “Haath lagake toh dikha (I dare you to touch me)”.It was only after BJP councillors intervened that the duo took their seats.BJP targets MC officialsFollowing their recent public criticism of MC officials, BJP councillors targeted them at the House meeting as well.On the issue of fines imposed by the enforcement department on vendors, the BJP councilors alleged that the department was selectively targeting small vendors, who were already struggling to make ends meet amid the pandemic, while larger commercial establishments were being allowed to go scot-free.On the management of the gaushala in Industrial Area, councillors from the saffron fold accused the MC officials of willfully ignoring decisions taken by the House. “This shows, they don’t respect the House,” Sood said.He said MC officials were even ignoring the corporation’s commitment made to the Prime Minister’s Office in 2019. “The civic body had committed that within 100 days of the second term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sector 38 West motor market road will be converted into a cemented road. But even as 2021 nears, they haven’t started the work.”Congress demands mayor resignationLeader of Opposition and Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla trained guns at mayor Raj Bala Malik over her alleged failure to deliver on any development agendas and demanded her resignation.Even as most BJP councillors stood up in the mayor’s defence, she responded to the Congress demand, saying, “I will not resign. I was not elected by you (Congress). We are 20 and you only five.”No garbage charges in villages for of nowThe House also deferred the imposition of user charges on door-to-door garbage collection in 13 villages and markets. Councillors contended that the civic body had yet to completely and effectively collect garbage from these areas. The charges are mandated under the Solid Waste Management Bylaws 2018. MC was planning to impose charges varying from Rs 50 to Rs 100 for houses and Rs 200 to Rs 2,000 for commercial establishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-house-revokes-hike-in-water-charges-admn-to-take-final-call/story-EujzndaMscyBx8KCa1aTuL.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Fissures erupt between cultural academies’ office-bearers, UT administration||Work at the three state-funded academies of the city that patronise performing arts, literature and fine arts has come to a standstill, but for an odd online show here and there, as funding has not made available to them since the first lockdown was imposed. However, a controversy has erupted over the unceremonious removal of some academy heads after they had completed their terms. The term of the chairpersons of the three academies was to end on March 15. While Madhav Kaushik of the Chandigarh Sahitya Akademi (CSA) did not seek an extension, it is learned that Kamal Arora of the Chandigarh Sangeet Natak Akademi (CSNA) and Bheem Malhotra of the Chandigarh Lalit Kala Akademi (CLKA) expressed interest in extending their tenure. While Malhotra continues in his position, UT adviser Manoj Parida wrote to the academis, saying that since the terms of the CSA and CSNA chairpersons were over, interim charge was being given to secretary cultural affairs Vinod P Kavle. Their positions have been advertised and will be filled in as per constitutional procedures. Meanwhile, CSA vice-president Gulzar Singh Sandhu, who believes that the post should have come to him constitutionally, has resigned in protest. Sandhu, who is experienced at heading literary bodies and was also former chairperson of the Punjab Arts Council, said, “Due to administrative delays, the resignation took time to process. They have even asked me to return the honorarium that I received during the period. All I was getting was ₹12,000 to cover conveyance expenses. Asking for a refund is in poor taste. My wife and I have contributed ₹6 lakh to Covid victims. Why would the paltry sum matter to me?” Meanwhile, Arora said, “For years, I worked as vice-chairperson and chairperson of the CSNA. I have worked with dedication and done good. It was hurtful that copies of the notice were sent to the other academis, too. The matter could have been handled with more grace.” UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “Government money cannot be left to private hands. Culture department manages these academies as the nodal department. It ensures that rivalry among artists is contained and political selections are curtailed.”Meanwhile, eyebrows are being raised about the CLKA being left unscathed. There is a buzz that works made by artists at workshops over the past decade and more have been gifted to bureaucrats, including those by some well-known artists of national and international fame, whose works are expensive. It is an inside joke that the paintings hang in the restrooms of bureaucrats’ homes. Kaushik, whose hands are full as vice-president of the national Sahitya Akademi and as member of the Press Council of India, said, “The art academies need more autonomy and should not be under the direct control of the administration. Also, there should be an age restriction on the office-bearers and those touching 80 or beyond it should not be in running for these appointments.” Same old names doing the rounds However, it has been seen that many are reluctant to leave. Surprisingly, Sandhu who was the CLKA chairperson, continued to work as vice-chairperson under Kaushik. Painter Madan Lal, who has also been an office-bearer of the CLKA in the past, said “The road to creativity is tough and artists are required to prove their worth. Yet, the power these administrative posts bring is cherished and thus the performer turns promoter with ease.” Ironically, the names of the same office-bearers keep circulating in the academis housed in the city whether under the union territory or the state governments of Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fissures-erupt-between-cultural-academies-office-bearers-ut-administration/story-Du0SxrAIffG55Ifw0bEZPO.html

He was opposed to the policies of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.“His whole life, Dogra relentlessly led the struggle for ‘Ek Nishan, Ek Vidhan, Ek Pradhan’. The scrapping of J&K’s special status and introduction of the new land laws is a real tribute to Praja Parishad’s movement. Everybody needs to understand it in an appropriate context,” said Ashwani Kumar Chrungoo, senior BJP and Kashmiri Pandit leader in a statement.He said the disgruntled elements under the banner of “Gupkar-Circus” can’t export their political narrative to Jammu and Ladakh.“The befitting reply of the leaders warning them to keep their hands off Ladakh is a well-timed caution to all in J&K. Their stand is not only appreciable but also worthy of being followed by the people of Jammu region,” he added.“When the people of J&K can have properties and assets all over India, how can the same rights be denied to others from different states in the scheme of equal rights for all in our Constitution? The Gupkaris should first abandon their acquired properties in places like Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Kochi, Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore etc. and then advocate their theory on moral grounds,” he argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-land-laws-realise-dream-of-pt-premnath-dogra-says-j-k-bjp/story-UeHZwYhBh2ctC58w7PGgJP.html

The HC bench of Justice SN Satyanarayana and Justice Archana Puri acted on the plea of one Col (retd) BS Rangi, who had alleged violations of various norms and claimed that the developer had started further construction even as environmental clearance was pending. The developer, Amarnath Investment Private Limited, had argued that environmental certificate was already taken, but it got expired. However, the court did not agree and directed that the developer and its agents should not take up further construction until the environmental clearance is renewed. The matter pertains to the development of extension of the enclave across over 2.6-acre land in Bhagwanpur village. The court was told that the licence was granted to developer in 1996 for the development of group housing colonies in Bhagwanpur, Islam Nagar and Chandimandir. It was in 2010 that it got permission for the extension of the enclave, where as per the petitioner, construction has been started without environmental clearance.The petitioner had alleged non-compliance with the Haryana Building Code rules and fire safety norms. The court was also told that three blocks constructed under earlier society have come up “dangerously” and even in medium-density earthquake, heavy destruction can be caused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-restrains-amravati-enclave-developer-from-further-construction/story-b0SnkZabRVTBDuK1yJXX5L.html

Gautam Budh Nagar, meanwhile, suffered one more death from the disease, taking the toll to 68. According to the state control room records, Ghaziabad had last had fewer than 1000 active cases on August 13. Since then, it reached the peak active case count of 2,126 on September 14, a day after it recorded the highest single day spike at 303. The control room figure of October 29 stated that the district has reached total of 18339 cases which includes 83 deaths and 17427 discharges so far. “We had increased daily testing in October to detect positive cases which spiked the active cases in the district. However, with this strategy we were able to detect more and more positive cases and this finally led to decline in overall active cases,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. According to the health department figures, the district till October 28 had taken up 423148 testing which also includes 249705 tests through rapid antigen kits. “We will now focus testing on different groups ahead of the festival season. They will include autorickshaw drivers, cycle-rickshaw drivers, beauty salon workers, shopkeepers, etc. This is being done under a 15-day drive directed by the state officials ahead of the festival season,” Dr Gupta said. The Uttar Pradesh government appointed nodal officer, Senthil Pandian C, also reviewed the situation with Ghaziabad officials on Thursday. “Public awareness and adherence to social distancing norms will be of prime importance during festivals along with enforcement. We do not wish cases to rise when people come out in large numbers in markets and mix up,” Pandian, said. He added that he has also directed officials to enhance testing from 3100, directed by state officials, to about 5000 per day. The special drive for focussed testing of different groups ahead of the festivals has been initiated at state level. “We have seen in other countries and nearby states that there is surge in cases and there is also, probability of a second wave of cases. To tackle this, we have directed for a special drive in which focussed testing of different groups will take place on different days. Since such groups are likely to come in contact with large number of people during the festivals days, we intend to test them beforehand,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).On Thursday, Ghaziabad saw 83 new cases, taking the total count to 18,339. There were no new deaths, which meant the toll stood at 83 and mortality rate fell further to 0.45%. The recovery rate is 95%. Gautam Budh Nagar had 130 new cases taking the total count to 17422. The recovery rate was 93.4% and 1086 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/active-cases-fall-below-1000-mark-after-77-days-in-gzb-focussed-testing-ordered-ahead-of-festivals/story-hRXLaEao6xJhkDwgJlIoLM.html

The Delhi Police said they were investigating the matter and that the protesters, who gathered responding to a social media campaign, were dispersed after senior officers intervened. Baisla lived in Delhi’s Rohini and ran used to sell amenities to hotels. On September 29, his father, Man Singh, found him dead in his office. In the FIR, filed at Delhi’s Shahbad Dairy police station on October 4, Singh stated that Baisla had once told him that his former business partner had borrowed some money from him. “She was threatening to file a rape case when my son asked her to return the money. The woman’s two accomplices were threatening him. On September 29, I counselled my son and returned home,” he said. When Baisla did not return home by 11pm, the complaint read, Singh returned to the office and found the door locked from inside. He claims to have broke open the door and found Baisla hanging.The case was registered against unknown persons under sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). On Thursday, police on both sides of the Delhi-Noida border, it seemed, were caught off guard.Over 200 people parked their cars on the DND Flyway and blocked the traffic movement on both sides from 11am to 4pm.Baisla’s grandfather Hari Kishan, who was among those who protested, said the Delhi Police had picked up the two suspects but later released them. “We demand the police interrogate the suspects and arrest them,” Kishan said. Manish Awana, the family’s advocate, said, “We came to know that the suspects were seen with some Delhi Police personnel in a photo. The suspects are influential and hence we demand police security to the victim’s family.” The Delhi Police, in a press statement, said, “A call for protest at DND Flyway was given on social media for #justiceforamanbaisla. Around 1500 to 2000 people gathered at around 11am at DND Flyway toll bordering UP and Delhi. Later they proceeded towards Delhi to go to PHQ (Delhi police headquarters). Protesters were stopped and negotiated by senior officers ... and finally made to disperse peacefully.” “Case has been transferred to Crime Branch and is being investigated quickly and on priority. If there is any apprehension about photo of some persons with local police, it will be inquired into and necessary action will be taken on it . If there is an apprehension about security threat to any person, proper assessment will be done and security can be provided under the witness Protection Program after due assessment,” it read.Ganesh Saha, DCP Traffic, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the traffic was diverted on the route due to protest at DND Flyway. “The Delhi-bound traffic was diverted to Mayur Vihar link road and also to Kalindi Kunj road. Delhi police had restricted Noida bound traffic till the evening,” he said. While the police had diverted the traffic, some commuters were trapped in the middle. “I had taken my son to a doctor in Delhi. On return I am caught in traffic jam for one hour,” said Rakesh Arya, a Noida resident Sector 30 resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/protesters-block-dnd-flyway-for-5-hrs-seeking-justice-for-dead-businessman/story-vdodEzyCFpqdyasBLcyH9O.html

30-10-2020||Noida||High contribution of stubble burning affects AQI in NCR||Ghaziabad: A sharp decline in air quality on Thursday in the national capital region region was primarily attributed to stubble burning that contributed nearly 36% to the pollution, according to the system of air quality and eather forecasting and research.Around 2912 incidents were recorded, the agency said. According to statistics from the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory, the instance of stubble burning combined in three states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have reached 24819 during the period October 1 to October 28 with share of Punjab at 21335. During the same period in 2019, the total counts were 21015 with Punjab’s share of 15575 while the counts during the same period in 2018 were 187708 with Punjab’s share at 12878. The officials of the Indian Meteorological Department said that low speed north-westerly winds brought the effect of stubble burning to NCR. “Even if we assume that stubble burning has about 36% contribution, the other factors including vehicular and industrial emission, dust generated from roads, construction sites and garbage burning, etc share the rest of the percentage. There is absolutely no decisive plan to deal with such sources. Even if the Centre has announced to bring in a new law to control air pollution for the Delhi/NCR, it will take time for implementation,” said Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist. “It would mean that this winter season too, the residents of NCR will have to battle the high pollution levels. Even during the period when stubble burning is not in prevalence, the pollution levels remain high throughout the year.”During the current month when the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is already in effect from October 15, there had been regular instances of stubble/garbage burning at Kushaliya, Morta, Indirapuram and Mohan Nagar among others. “We are keeping checks on instances of local stubble or garbage burning and FIRs are also getting lodged. On Thursday, the major factor responsible for deterioration in AQI was due to high contribution of 36% due to stubble burning besides the local polluting factors. The Ghaziabad city was more affected as the pollutants affecting Delhi further came down towards Ghaziabad and deteriorated the AQI here further,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “The monitoring station at Loni was affected as AQI went to 431 under ‘severe’ category while the other three stations remained under higher side of ‘very poor’ quality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/high-contribution-of-stubble-burning-affects-aqi-in-ncr/story-qlXWKAsyD7PApw41WMV4tN.html
30-10-2020||Noida||Air quality falls sharply, Greater Noida most polluted in state||Following a short breather, Noida and adjoining areas saw a sharp deterioration in air quality on Thursday with several areas of the city plunging into the “severe” category when even healthy people are affected. This is the first time this season that the air deteriorated to this level.On the day, Greater Noida was the most polluted city in Uttar Pradesh and second most polluted city in the national capital region (NCR), second to Charki Dadri in Haryana, about 90 kms west of Delhi. Slow wind did not help ventilation and pollution levels were almos nine times the standard in Greater Noida and seven times in Noida and Ghaziabad. “We are ensuring that adequate dust and emission control measures are taken to avoid further drop in the air quality, but the issue is that the met conditions are highly unfavourable at time leading to the spike in pollutants,” said Archna Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida. The Air quality index (AQI) of Greater Noida on Thursday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 412 or ‘severe’ against 324 a day earlier. The AQI of Noida was 383 against 301 a day earlier, while the AQI of Ghaziabad was 389 against 317 a day earlier. Meanwhile, sector-1 area of Noida also turned ‘severe’ with an AQI of 405. According to the pollution monitoring agencies and experts, weather conditions and higher share of stubble burning among the local emissions in the region led to the sharp deterioration of the air quality. The wind speed, according to the weather analyst was nil for most of the day, while some areas across Noida and Ghaziabad saw a wind speed of around three to five kmph for some time. “The wind speed was negligible for most of the day and only for a very short time the winds reached a maximum speed of five kmph, which was not enough for the dispersion of pollutants. The forecast is however promising as winds are likely to increase from October 30 up to 10-12 kmph, while on October 31 the winds will increase further,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), both PM2.5 and PM10 values of Noida and Ghaziabad saw sharp rise. For Greater Noida, the PM10 was 589.02 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) and PM2.5 levels were 275.6µg/m³. For Noida, the PM10 and PM2.5 levels were 459.99µg/m³ and 275.05µg/m³, respectively. For Ghaziabad, the PM10 level was 438.36 µg/m³ and PM2.5 was 255.13µg/m³. The CPCB standard limit for PM2.5 is 40µg/m³ while that of PM10 is 60 µg/m³. “PM10 or the large particles causes health issues like breathing issues by reaching up to the lungs however the PM2.5 damages the body further by mixing in the bloodstream thereby causing heart related issues,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air pollution, centre for science and environment (CSE). Meanwhile, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the stubble burning share in PM2.5 in the entire region of NCR, including Noida and adjoining regions was estimated to 36 per cent. “The stubble burning share in PM2.5 is estimated as 36 percent for today…Increased surface wind speed and better ventilation conditions are likely to significantly improve the situation by 31st October,” said a SAFAR statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-falls-sharply-greater-noida-most-polluted-in-state/story-d71DcEgpEHIRHx0hkTZIGM.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Security guard, secretary of Tardeo society booked for harassing nurses of Mumbai Hospital; society says complaint false||Tardeo police on Wednesday night booked a security guard and secretary of a south Mumbai housing society for restricting the movement of nurses of Bhatia Hospital and harassing them. The Tardeo Court Cooperative Housing society has countered the allegations, claiming a false case has been registered against them.Around 24 nurses working at Bhatia Hospital, which is a Covid-19 treatment centre, have been given accommodation by the hospital administration in three of their four flats in the society (one flat is under litigation). One of the nurses, Jency Thomas, on Wednesday filed a complaint with Tardeo police station, against the security guard and secretary of the building for restricting their movements. Thomas alleged that on Wednesday when she tried to move out of the society with her colleague, they were stopped by the security guard, who claimed that they were not permitted to go out. The nurses were told that they would have to take permission from the secretary of the society Kartik Mehta if they chose to step out of the property. The nurses returned to their room and called for help from the hospital administration. In her complaint, Thomas claimed that they were allowed to leave their rooms only after the head of the human resources department of the hospital, Nitin Warde intervened with the help of police. Denying the allegation that the nurses were stopped on Wednesday evening, Mehta said, “The incident is wrongly portrayed, as the hospital forcefully brought 12 more nurses to the building for their accommodation, which is why the security guard too had called on the police helpline. When we narrated the forceful entry, the police did not register our complaint, but registered a case against us,” Mehta alleged. Warde claimed that the nurses have been facing harassment from the society ever since the pandemic began in March. “There have been several instances of such harassment and a written complaint was also given to the police,” he said. The society claimed there has been a dispute between the society and hospital over accommodation of nurses. “There had been an issue for use of the flats of Bhatia Hospital. The flats were being used by nurses, whereby the hospital created a dormitory sort of system which is what the society had objected to,” said Mehta.”The nurses were given accommodation in the society since lockdown began. However, they were removed as the society objected. Later, in September, the hospital again wanted to accommodate nurses in the flats. After we reached an amicable solution, we had allowed 12 nurses to stay in three flats,” Mehta said. In the letter written by Warde on behalf of the hospital to the Tardeo police on August 20, several instances of harassment from the society towards the nurses were highlighted. “Due to the nationwide lockdown as well as suspension of train services, doctors, para-medical and nursing staff had to be additionally accommodated in the said residential premises. Although proper care was taken by the management of the said hospital, the office bearers of the society started raising objections and created unprecedented hurdles for the staff to continue their stay, including restricting their movements in and out of the society owing to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation,” the letter stated. In another letter written on September 28, the hospital continued to highlight continuous harassment of the nurses as they were not allowed to enter the building. The hospital had last month requested the deputy commissioner of police and assistant commissioner of police to book the society members for constant harassment of the nurses. It also requested the police to grant them protection. Mehta denied the allegations of harassment of the nurses, saying they have been given all support possible. “We have taken good care of them and a separate lift was allotted for them,” Mehta claimed. Nitin Warde said the flats were not being used as dormitory and are being used for accommodation of doctors and nurses for more than 30 years. “We used to give the flats for accommodation of doctors. Subsequently, when we got Mumbai-based doctors, we started giving accommodation to nurses. The society took objection since the beginning of the pandemic and nurses were asked to leave the premises overnight in April,” Warde said. “On Wednesday, after taking due certificate from BMC over purpose of use of the flat, 12 nurses with the help of hospital management entered the society. We tried to submit a letter to the manager, but it was not accepted. This was all video recorded. The society guard later came to the flat and threatened them, saying they would not be allowed to go out now and called the police. In front of the police, the issue was discussed and after verification, the complaint was registered,” Warde said. Warde said the society had been resisting the accommodation of nurses since the pandemic began. “The hospital owns three flats in the society since 1963, and hospital’s staffers live there. There have been issues since the beginning of the pandemic as the society feared for the health of senior citizens and small children who stay there. However, police had intervened and resolved the issues,” said Firoz Bagwan, senior inspector of Tardeo police station. “On Wednesday, the complainant was going out to buy food after returning from duty. The watchman stopped her. Following the statement of the nurse, a case was registered under section 341 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and a notice under section 41 was sent to the watchman and secretary of the building, instructing them to be present at the police station for inquiry,” Bagwan added.Refuting the allegation that society made a complaint against the hospital for their forceful entry of the nurses in the society, he said, “The complaint was made by the nurse only, about restraining her from leaving the society premises, which we have registered . After proper investigation, a report will be submitted to the court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/security-guard-secretary-of-tardeo-housing-society-booked-for-restraining-harassing-nurses-of-mumbai-s-bhatia-hospital/story-qJ5cdQBUatHb9fMJDOoyiK.html
30-10-2020||Education||‘Committed academician; indecisive administrator’: Academicians on DU V-C Yogesh Tyagi||People familiar with Delhi University (DU) vice-chancellor (V-C) Yogesh Tyagi -- who was suspended by the President on Wednesday on charges of dereliction of duties, abuse of power and lack of commitment – had mixed reactions to offer on his tenure as an academician. Some said he is a “dignified person, a committed academician, a remarkable teacher” while others termed him as an “indecisive administrator and an incompetent V-C”. A native of Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut district, Tyagi was appointed the 22nd VC of DU in March 2016. Before that, he was a professor and dean of the faculty of legal studies at South Asian University (SAU) in New Delhi. He was a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) School of International Studies (SIS) and served as its dean between January 2009 and December 2011.VG Hegde, chairperson of International Legal Studies at SIS, who knows Tyagi from the days when he was a student in JNU, said, “He is a remarkable academician and his achievements in the field of international law is commendable. He has been a meticulous person who would take a lot of time in taking decisions. During his tenure as dean, some colleagues felt his nature in delaying the decision-making process made him unsuitable for the administrative posts”“However, he was a fabulous teacher who was admired by his students. He was so dedicated that we used to teach for 2-3 hours at a stretch. He was one of the best teachers I have seen,” said Hedge, who had also worked with Tyagi at SAU between 2012 and 2016.JNU registrar Pramod Kumar, who was a student at the university when Tyagi was warden of Narmada hostel, said, “I can’t recall any fellowship or scholarship that he did not win. He was internationally known for his academic credentials.” Tyagi was on deputation from JNU when he had joined SAU and later DU as the V-C. He continued to stay in his allotted house in JNU even after joining DU till January 2019. He shifted to the VC lawns – which houses the V-C’s residence – in DU’s north campus after retiring from JNU last year.He had been working in DU at a salary of Rs 1 per month since 2016.Tyagi’s personal records, including his date of birth, are not available on DU’s official website. According to officials at JNU, he is 67 now. He received his LLM from Columbia University School of Law in New York and did his MPhil and Ph.D. in legal studies from JNU. Recalling a 2010 incident when Tyagi was dean of SIS, a professor at the school said, “Tyagi was chairing a board meeting. Some bills were placed before him to clear but he did not sign. It was strange. It’s not the first time. He would not sign a piece of paper just like that. He had some kind of paranoia.” Another faculty member at SIS, who wished not to be named, said, “Tyagi was an executive council member in JNU in 2010 and there was some issue we wanted him to raise during a meeting. Later, we got to know, he came out of the room when the issue was raised in the meeting. How can a dean do something like that?”Around 10 years down the line, similar allegations have been levelled against Tyagi in his capacity as the V-C of DU. Delays in appointments to key posts and implementation of flagship schemes of the education ministry, pending inquiries in vigilance and sexual harassment complaints, and alleged lack of commitment, were among the charges levelled against him, according to an order issued by the union education ministry while announcing his suspension on Wednesday. A senior DU official, who wished not to be named, said Tyagi refrained from signing any paper or file from day one in his capacity as the V-C. “He would rather ask the officiating pro-VC or the registrar to sign files. However, as per norms, all files should be signed by the V-C. Due to his reluctance to sign files, work got delayed year after year. During an academic council meeting in his initial days, he was asked to make a decision on some matter. Replying to which, he had said, ‘God will take care of it’ and deferred the matter,” the official said.JL Gupta, an EC member at DU, who has been associated with the university since 1962, said Tyagi’s “lack of trust” and “indecisiveness” made his tenure a “complete administrative failure”. “He had always appointed people on key term posts, such as Pro-VC, dean of colleges and controller exams, on a temporary basis, which is totally in violation of the university’s norms,” he said.Students said he remained “unapproachable”. Amit Tanwar, who was president of DU Students’ Union in 2017 when violence broke out in Ramjas College, said, “He took it very casually and did not even receive calls we made to inform him about the incident when it was happening. It’s after a lot of pressure from students that he met us. ”But some of his close associates at DU remembered Tyagi as a “man of dignity”. “He is a no-nonsense person. You would spot him taking morning and evening walks with his old mother in the Viceregal Lodge. He never took anyone’s favour even for a cup of tea. He worked without any salary at DU. This is so unfortunate that all this has happened just a few months before his term was already ending (March)”.Tyagi could not be reached for a comment/||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/committed-academician-indecisive-administrator-academicians-on-du-v-c-yogesh-tyagi/story-5em33mBg2ynbnSRyDJQBnJ.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department releases SOPs for teachers, non-teaching staff in state schools||After the Maharashtra government allowed 50% attendance for teachers and non-teaching staff in schools across the state, the education department has now released a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the same.As per the SOPs, teachers can be called to school for work related to online learning or other academic business. Schools have been asked to ensure that they sanitise their premises and regularly check temperatures. Teachers have been instructed to follow safety guidelines like wearing masks, following physical distancing, etc.Even as teachers have been asked to attend school, physical classes will not resume for students at least until October 31. Similarly, schools need to follow the policy of “staying home if unwell” for teachers who are feeling sick – especially those who have comorbidities or are above the age of 50 years.Responding to the SOPs, schools said that the guidelines had created a lot of confusion about the nature of attendance required. “Teaching is currently taking place online, so there is no clarity on whether teachers need to come to school even if they are teaching online from their homes. Similarly, there is no mention of the dates for Diwali vacations. Also, the government is not able to give us any funds for all the precautionary measures listed in the SOPs,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals’ Association.Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of the Teachers Democratic Front, said, “It is wrong to expect physical attendance from teachers even as they continue to hold classes for students online daily. Travelling in Mumbai is still not easy with restrictions on public transport, and teachers are unnecessarily asked to attend school when they can complete their work from home more efficiently.”On October 7, the Maharashtra cabinet decided to physically reopen schools only post Diwali. The state education department will draw up guidelines with respect to reopening in the next few days. The state government’s extension of lockdown rules until November 30 means that schools in the state are likely to remain shut for students until then. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “We will not risk the lives of students by reopening schools at once. While plans about partial reopening post Diwali are on, priority will be given on reopening higher standards [Class 9 to 12].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-releases-sops-for-teachers-non-teaching-staff-in-state-schools/story-gSmHNIZZgbiD2tlBfvZKOP.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government approves incentive scheme for bulk drug park in Raigad, medical equipment park in Aurangabad||The Maharashtra government on Thursday approved a 10-year special incentives scheme to set up a bulk drug park at Raigad near Mumbai and medical equipment manufacturing park at Auric City in Aurangabad. The Centre has proposed three bulk drug parks to be set up in the country to reduce the dependence of Indian drug manufacturing companies on China. It has asked the states to send their proposal for incentive schemes and the top three will be selected by the Centre for setting up the bulk drug park, said a senior state minister, on condition of anonymity. If selected, the state has proposed the bulk drug park to be set up in Raigad district and has earmarked 5000 acre in 17 villages in Roha and Murud tehsils for the project, he added. If approved, the projects will offer a big scope for production of drugs as well as medical equipment in the state, the official said. The estimated cost of the bulk drug park and medical equipment manufacturing park is ₹2,442 crore and ₹424 crore, respectively. In a bid to promote indigenous manufacturing of drugs and medical equipment, the Central government in July has announced guidelines and schemes for the development of bulk drug and medical device parks. According to the cabinet decision, the state has decided to waive of 100% goods and services tax (GST) on the first sale of the product. It has waived electricity fees against power consumption for next ten years, a waiver in stamp duty for buying a plot, taking a plot on lease, bank loan and other related activities. The state has also decided to give a concession of ₹1.5 per unit in power tariff for a period of 10 years against power consumption. Besides, they will also get a concession of ₹2 per unit against power consumption for sewage management, water supply, solid waste management and other related activities for 10 years. This particular concession will be provided by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) against which the state government will pay ₹50 crore per annum to the industrial body. The state government will also assist MIDC in getting a license for power supply for the parks, said an official from the state industries department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-approves-incentive-scheme-for-bulk-drug-park-in-raigad-medical-equipment-park-in-aurangabad/story-qt57pcVULMS4UP9mYlG8MP.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC standing committee does not approve increase in telescopic charges for water consumption in Mumbai, Covid-19 expenditures||In its second meeting since the lockdown was imposed in March, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee on Thursday did not pass a proposal to increase water charges in the city, if Mumbaiites’ consumption increases over 150 litres per day. The committee also did not pass proposals on emergency expenditures related to the coronavirus outbreak made by the administration in the past eight months that were tabled before the committee for post-facto approval, citing lack of details about where the money was spent. The proposal for increasing water charges was recorded by the committee to warrant the need for more water usage in households during the Covid-19 outbreak, as people required to wash hands more often, and rinse other items purchased from outside. Called telescopic rates, the BMC presently charges citizens twice the normal rate, if water consumption is between 150 and 200 litres; three times the rate if it is between 200 and 250 litres, and four times the rate for consumption above 250 litres. The civic administration had proposed to increase these charges to four, five and six times the rate, respectively. Ravi Raja, leader of the opposition in the standing committee, said, “All parties unanimously supported and recorded the proposal. During Covid times, it is not proper to burden Mumbaiites financially.” Asif Zakaria, a member of the standing committee and corporator from Bandra, said, “The World Health Organization (WHO) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have directed and justified frequent washing of hands. It is obvious that water consumption will increase. But now is not the time to charge citizens more for it.” A senior civic official from the hydraulics department, said, “Telescopic rates were approved by the standing committee in 2008, to discourage people from excessive use of water. However, despite these rates, use of water did not reduce. So the department had proposed to increase telescopic rates by four, five, and six times. Our production cost for water is presently ₹14.99 per kilolitre, and BMC charges residents ₹5.62 per kilolitre, up to consumption of 150 litres.”The committee on Thursday also referred back proposals related to Covid-19 expenditure done by the administration so far, that had been tabled before the committee for post-facto approval. The committee noted that the proposals lacked details about how and where the money had been spent. Meanwhile, over 100 other proposals related to infrastructure work of roads, stormwater drains, gardens and other civic departments were cleared by the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-standing-committee-does-not-approve-increase-in-telescopic-charges-for-water-consumption-in-mumbai-covid-19-expenditures/story-ECveQdbkmYiQIuDnCj7wyO.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||In line of fire, Chandigarh Police scramble to bring gangsters for interrogation||Facing the heat for heightened criminal activities in the city, Chandigarh Police have claimed that they are making efforts to interrogate all local active gangsters to crack down on their network. This comes after UT administrator VP Singh Badnore expressed concern over the rise in shooting incidents during the crime review meeting with senior functionaries of the Chandigarh administration on Thursday. Badnore made it clear that police action on ground was more important, while directing the police department to nab the culprits at the earliest to instil confidence into the public. Meanwhile, DGP Sanjay Baniwal assured that “no effort will be spared in solving these cases as expeditiously as possible”. “Actions have been taken such as identifying the people working for such gangsters and running extortion rackets. The details of FIRs registered against them have been shared with the senior administration officials,” said a senior police officer, who attended the meeting. “We have already identified the criminals operating in the city – members of Lawrence Bishnoi and slain gangster Davinder Bambiha’s gangs. As several gang members are lodged in jails, we have initiated the process of getting them out on production warrants. They will be brought to the city to identify and break the network,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. He also apprised the senior administration officials of the real-time information exchange between different wings of the police department and their counterparts in other states regarding movement of gangsters, intelligence and regular checking of pubs and bars — one of the favourite visiting spots of gangsters and their men. Talking about the initiatives taken, the police said that intensive patrolling, increased number of nakas and enhanced visibility of cops on Chandigarh streets are among the measures implemented to nab the active criminals. Badnore said for better quality of policing, Chandigarh administration should urgently set up mechanism to fund research at Panjab University’s cyber and psychology department for police and related work. Cops fail to secure gangster Dilpreet’s custodyThe Chandigarh Police have for the second time failed to secure the custody of gangster Dilpreet Singh Dhahan alias Baba to question him regarding his role in the murder of Gurlal Brar, a former student leader and aide of gangster Bishnoi. Gurlal was gunned down outside a city mall on October 11. Two persons have so far been arrested, who had supplied motorcycle to the shooters, which as per the police investigation was arranged by Dilpreet. Police have now applied for Dilpreet’s fresh warrants, who is in a Sangrur jail. Rise in motor vehicle thefts cause of worry Swelling number of vehicle thefts and low recoveries was also a cause of concern for the administration. UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida asked the Chandigarh Police to make concrete efforts to recover the stolen vehicles. It was deliberated that how vehicles parked in markets, houses and offices were being stolen with impunity and without fear of law. “The beat staff have been directed to actively work towards checking the vehicle thefts and police are also working to have security guards deployed at various public parking places. The police data pointed out that lesser number of vehicles were stolen from paid parkings,” said a senior officer of the Chandigarh Police. Data base of bouncers being createdConsidering the frequent visits of gangsters to discos and pubs and involvement of bouncers in violence, UT administrator Badnore directed DGP Sanjay Baniwal to make sure that all bouncers deployed at pubs and bars are verified and their proper records are maintained. Moreover, licensing authorities have been asked to take action against clubs/bars operating without proper verification of staffers and bouncers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-line-of-fire-chandigarh-police-scramble-to-bring-gangsters-for-interrogation/story-FdmGB1Uef6NjIYj2x2qG5M.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government and Railways look at options to prevent overcrowding in Mumbai trains, encourage staggered workplace timings||In response to the state government’s proposal to the Railways, to resume local train services for all, Central (CR) and Western Railways (WR) have raised concerns of overcrowding. However, the state on Thursday said these concerns are unwarranted as guidelines are in place to restrict the number of commuters.The state government on Wednesday had proposed resuming regular local train services for all citizens, but with stipulated time slots. Those with valid passes and tickets should be allowed to travel in the day’s first service up to 7.30am; then between 11am and 4.30pm; and finally, between 8pm and the last train of the day. The state also suggested increasing suburban local train services for women to an hourly frequency to incentivise travelling during non-peak hours. On Wednesday, CR and WR both sent letters to the state, raising concerns about overcrowding. Aslam Shaikh, guardian minister of Mumbai city, said, “The letter by the Railways is in response to the one we sent to them for opening up railway services to all. Chief secretary will hold a joint meeting with the Railways in response to the queries raised. We are positive about the dialogue and expect Railways to start operations for all at the earliest.”In its letter, WR suggested capping daily passengers to 9.6 lakh and wrote, “Even if we start all 1,367 local train services, we can transport a maximum of 9.6 lakh passengers daily, which is much less than the 35 lakh passengers who were travelling in the pre-Covid regime.”CR has told the state it can transport 12.4 lakh passengers daily if all 1,774 of its local train services resume. Approximately 45 lakh passengers travelled daily by CR prior to the lockdown. “Hence, the state government needs to take a call for means of transportation for the balance 33 lakh passengers,” states CR’s letter. WR also asked the state to introduce a mobile application to ensure passengers are segregated and social distancing is maintained on trains. An official from Mantralaya said the concerns raised by CR and WR are unwarranted. “We have allowed only 30% of employees in private sectors, which has reduced commuters by 20 lakh. Another 20 lakh have been reduced owing to closure of schools and colleges. If the Railways operate at their full strength of all 3,100 services, there will be no question of crowding during peak hours,” said the official. Passenger associations expressed doubts about the practicality of staggered train timings as proposed by the state. “The timings mentioned by the state are not correct for regular office goers. The offices should also agree on staggered timings. The Railways and state government should reconsider the stipulated timings,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. The state official said the government expected private offices to introduce changes in their timings to complement the proposed timings of train services. “If the Railways are operating at their full strength, there shouldn’t be any problem in encouraging commercial establishments to go for changes in office hours,” said the official, who said the state is in the process of developing an app to facilitate staggered travel.Rajiv Podar, president, Indian Merchant Chamber and Industry, said, “The last seven months lockdown has made work from home a reality and many businesses will continue the same partially at least. That itself will reduce the load of passenger traffic. Staggering office timing is also difficult to monitor and control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-and-railways-look-at-options-to-prevent-overcrowding-in-mumbai-trains-encourage-staggered-workplace-timings/story-MiHfeZpMRl1QO89Ll1SctO.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||260 applications for firecrackers licences received in Delhi, 138 get permission to sell||More than a fortnight ahead of Diwali, a total of 260 applications for firecracker shop licences have been received so far by Delhi Police, which issued 138 licences till Thursday -- a number much higher compared to 2019 when only 97 had applied of which 62 had received permission to sell firecrackers.Eligible shopkeepers can start selling from Monday.Suvashish Chaudhary, joint commissioner of Delhi Police’s licensing unit, said only those who met requirements prescribed by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) were allotted licences. “All firecrackers sold in the market have to be green in nature and PESO-certified,” Chaudhary said.“Eligible shopkeepers have been allowed to begin selling from Monday,” Chaudhary said. The process of issuing licences had commenced on October 23 and Wednesday was the last day. Many of those whose requests were rejected can file an appeal, which may be considered over the next few days. The highest number of applications was received in the central police district this year. Thirty-three shopkeepers had applied, of whom 24 were granted licences.Pollution caused by firecrackers on Diwali night is a huge cause of concern in Delhi-NCR, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels every year after the festival, which will be celebrated on November 14 this year.A day earlier on Wednesday, environment minister Gopal Rai announced an enforcement campaign to stop the use of traditional firecrackers and to ensure only green and less polluting varieties are available this time. As part of the campaign to be launched on November 3, 11 squads of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and police will inspect firecracker manufacturing units and shops to ensure polluting firecrackers are not sold. According to Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central), apart from selling PESO-certified firecrackers only, shopkeepers have to ensure social distancing and allow only customers with face masks.“Then, there are other requirements such as having a six-metre road in front of their shops, having fire clearance and operating out of commercial areas,” said Bhatia.Narendra Gupta, president of the Sadar Bazar Firecrackers Association, said the stock of green firecrackers this year is better than last year.“Last year, we had only about four varieties of green firecrackers. This time we have about 40,” Gupta said, adding that while the influx of customers has been encouraging, shopkeepers are apprehensive as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Delhi.Teams of Delhi Police and PESO will carry out checks in markets and licensed shops to see if traditional polluting crackers were being sold. “Sellers will be booked under the Explosives Act and even arrested if they are not following norms,” Chaudhary said.An official of PESO, who didn’t want to be identified, said licensing permission was entirely Delhi Police’s prerogative and his organisation can carry out checks at shops to ensure only green firecrackers were being sold.In 2017, ahead of Diwali, the Supreme Court had put a temporary ban on the sale and purchase of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. In the last two years, however, the court had ordered that only low-emission and improved fireworks could be sold in Delhi, owing to concerns over rising air pollution. Residents were allowed to burst only green crackers between 8pm and 10pm. These green crackers are said to have 30% lower emission as compared to traditional fireworks. The noise levels are lower -- 125 decibels against 160 decibels in traditional ones. In 2018 and 2019, despite the ban on the sale of crackers and due to the low availability of low-emission varieties, pollution levels in the city saw a major spike after Diwali as people openly burst firecrackers. Till last year, only ‘phuljhari’ (sparklers), rocket and ‘anar’(flower pots) were available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/260-applications-for-firecrackers-licences-received-in-delhi-138-get-permission-to-sell/story-9os4fGnVDDMhoC2zUJCiCO.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi air quality stays severe for most parts of day, settles at very poor||Low wind speeds coupled with an increase in cases of stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana pushed the air quality to “severe” for a major part of Thursday. The 24-hour rolling average of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings at 4pm showed that while the overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi settled at 395 --- in the “very poor” category --- the hourly average AQI was above the “severe” mark for most part of the day. Till 1pm, the average AQI oscillated between 402 and 408. At monitoring stations in Mundka, Bawana, Narela, Wazirpur and Anand Vihar, pollution levels neared the 500 mark, the worst AQI recordings since January. On October 23, AQI reached perilously close to the “severe” zone with a reading of 366. An AQI of 201 to 300 is considered “poor”. A reading of 301 to 400 is in the “very poor” category and is associated with respiratory illnesses, especially in children and those exposed to the bad air. An AQI of 400-500 is considered “severe”.Scientists attributed the bad air to calm surface wind conditions that have led to the accumulation of pollutants in the atmosphere and stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana that is affecting the National Capital Region (NCR). VK Soni, head of the environment monitoring research centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said the wind speed was below 4kmph on Thursday. He added that the situation was expected to improve from Friday. “The wind speed through the day was below 4kmph. But the situation will improve from tomorrow (Friday). By Saturday, there will be a significant improvement in the air quality,” Soni said. He said wind speed will pick up to 8-12kmph on Friday. And by Saturday, the wind speed will be around 15-18kmph. Satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) showed a thick cover of smoke over the Delhi-NCR region on Thursday. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) of the Union ministry of earth sciences said stubble fires spotted over Punjab and Haryana were the highest (2,912) this season on Wednesday and their share (36%) in the city’s PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels too hit a new high on that day. Pawan Gupta, a senior scientist of earth sciences at the Science and Technology Institute (STI), Universities Space Research Association (USRA), said the number of farm fires spotted over Punjab and Haryana are likely to have crossed the 2,000 mark for the third consecutive day on Thursday. “It appears we are entering the heavy burning period. The satellite recording shows that the stubble fires crossed the 2000 mark for the third consecutive day. The impact of this can be seen in the thick haze over the northern India,” Gupta said.Low temperatures on Thursday also led to the accumulation of pollution particles closer to the surface. The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday, the lowest in October in 26 years. IMD recordings showed that the maximum temperature in the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading of the city, was 32.2 degrees Celsius. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-stays-severe-for-most-parts-of-day-settles-at-very-poor/story-pgz3z7mClmavhfioxAh6KM.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Baroda assembly bypoll: Congress, BJP lock horns in Jat-dominated Hooda bastion||A head to head contest between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress is in the offing for the Baroda bypoll in Haryana. The seat fell vacant following the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda on April 12. While the BJP has fielded Olympian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, who lost by about 4,800 votes to Hooda in 2019 assembly election, the Congress has put its money on a newcomer, Indu Raj Narwal, a former member of Sonepat zila parishad. Battle of prestige for Hooda The bypoll is a battle of prestige for former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda since the Baroda assembly constituency is considered his backyard. The constituency in Sonepat district lies adjacent to Hooda’s own constituency, Garhi-Sampla Kiloi in Rohtak. A win here will underscore Hooda’s hold in the Deswali belt and restore the Congress tally in the assembly to 31. The by election also holds significance for the ruling BJP as the outcome will be construed as a reflection on the one-year rule of the BJP-JJP alliance. Also, the enactment of three farm laws by the Centre, which led to protests across the state, may affect the complexion of the contest in a constituency which is primarily agrarian in nature. Jat domination, a plus for Congress The Congress and Hooda are banking heavily on the support of Jat voters who have a brute 50% majority in this Deswali belt constituency. The Congress nominee, Indu Raj Narwal,40, is a Jat who comes from Rindhana village in neighbouring Gohana tehsil, a village known to spring up international kabbadi players. A rank newcomer, Narwal got the Congress nomination due to his proximity to Hooda. He was a surprise pick after Hooda’s original choice Kapoor Singh Narwal, a turncoat from the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) stable and who till recently was in the BJP, was not given a Congress nomination. Narwal draws confidence from the fact that Hooda, his MP son Deepender and their loyalists are industriously canvassing for him. Narwal’s prospects have also improved after Kapoor Singh withdrew his candidature as an independent at Hooda’s instance. Had Kapoor Singh stayed in the contest, he would have hurt the prospects of the Congress candidate. Champion wrestler banks on charisma, non-Jat votes His BJP rival, Yogeshwar Dutt,37, a Commonwealth gold winning wrestler is a Brahmin and banks heavily on being a sporting icon and the BJP’s ability to sway the non-Jat votes. Dutt who comes from Bhainswal Kalan, a Jat dominated village had made his electoral debut in 2019 assembly polls after securing a BJP nomination from Baroda. He lost the assembly election by about 4,800 votes to the Congress candidate, Sri Kishan Hooda. His second shot at Baroda will depend on his star power and consolidation of non-Jats in this Jat dominated constituency. Brahmins account for about 12% votes in Baroda. Om Prakash Chautala’s Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has fielded Joginder Singh Malik,41, a candidate who badly lost the 2019 assembly election from Baroda. Malik, a Jat candidate finished a poor fifth securing only 3,145 votes, less than 3% of the total votes polled. Former BJP MP from Kurukshetra, Rajkumar Saini, who had floated his own outfit last year has also thrown his hat in the contest. However, the INLD candidate and Saini are unlikely to affect the outcome of the Congress versus BJP contest. Quotes Yogeshwar Dutt, BJP “This battle is to elect an MLA, not a chief minister. Till 2024, ML Khattar will remain the CM. All the political parties have betrayed you. The BJP has carried out development projects worth Rs 500 crore in Baroda constituency. My sole aim is to serve you with honesty in the same way as I did for the nation as a wrestler. I never believed in caste and a wrestler does not belong to any caste.” Indu Raj Narwal, Congress “I was born in a poor farmer’s family. I owe my candidature to Bhupinder Singh Hooda and in fact he will be your MLA if I win. This election will set the tone to elect your own government. This is the right time to defeat the anti-farmers’ government, who brought three farm laws against the wishes of the agrarian community. After my win, the BJP government will fall on its own as many MLAs are not happy with functioning of this government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/baroda-assembly-bypoll-congress-bjp-lock-horns-in-jat-dominated-hooda-bastion/story-pfK8VTSfQ3DM9DPQZJk66N.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Farmer bodies oppose air pollution ordinance; Haryana,UP govts welcome it||Farm bodies and Punjab government termed the ordinance promulgated by the Centre to set up a commission for air quality management in National Capital Region (NCR) as “anti-farmers” whereas governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana welcomed the decision, saying it would help in curbing air pollution which has been in very poor to severe category for the past fortnight in the region.President Ramnath Kovind on Thursday notified the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Area Ordinance which creates a statutory body to manage air pollution with powers to issue directions to the state governments and initiate criminal proceedings against the violators leading to fine of up to Rs 1 crore and jail term of five years.Terming the ordinance as dictatorial, Balbir Singh Rajewal president of a faction of Bharatiya Kisan Union, said, “The central government has failed to give compensation to farmers for stubble management as mandated by the Supreme Court. Now, the new ordinance has been enacted to arm-twist the hapless farmers”.He asked how would small farmers pay a penalty of Rs 1 crore for failing to arrange additional Rs 5,000 per acre to manage paddy stubble. “There is no infrastructure to store 160 lakh tonnes of stubble which is almost equivalent to the paddy crop of a single season,” he said.Rattan Mann, Haryana state president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Tikait) said the law again reflects anti-farmer face of the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre. “The farmers of Haryana cannot blamed for air pollution in Delhi, there are several other reasons are behind it. Buy we want to make it clear that we will oppose any anti-farmer decision and soon a state level meeting of farmers will be called in this regard,” he said. Even Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the ordinance fails to recognise ground reality. “Rules and laws passed by the Centre invite so much criticism and leads to upheaval because people on the ground are not consulted,” he said, adding his party opposes the new provision for setting up of a commission. Government response Punjab’s minister, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, said the ordinance was “ridiculous” for having very severe provisions. “Most of the farmers in Punjab do not have the entire property of the value of a penalty amount. I think the Centre has made up mind to eliminate farmer and wants the corporate to usurp their land,” he said, demanding a re-think of the new proposal. A Haryana environment department official, requesting anonymity, said that the ordinance would help the administration to enforce the environment regulations more strictly and there would be fear of violation because of stringent punishment provisions.Uttar Pradesh principal secretary, environment, Sudhir Garg, welcomed the ordinance and said it was a step in the right direction. “Once we get the copy, the government will study it minutely--all the board aspects and fine prints. We will have internal meetings. Only then will we be able to comment. But, overall, it is a welcome step,” he said.Industry upset Different industry body leaders said that the Ordinance will further slow down the industry output which is facing dire straits due to Covid-19 and economic slowdown.Pritam Singh Sachdeva, president, Northern India Roller Spinners’ Association, said targeting industries alone will not help until the government ensures that people are made aware about the impact of air pollution.“The efforts should be made to cut air pollution especially by reducing vehicular emission. Targeting industries alone will not help,” he said.Bhim Rana, president of Panipat Dyers’ Association said the Ordinance may adversely impact in Haryana, as most of the industries in the state falls in the NCR region. Jugal Kishore Bhiana of the Haryana Plywood Association, however, said the commission should provide a time period of at least a month for the violating industrialist to appeal.President, Ludhiana based All Industries and Trade Forum, Badish Jindal, said their fear was creation of another commission could lead to further harassment by the government departments. “The government talks about ease of doing business but it is continuously taking steps which are putting the industry under unnecessary pressure,” he said.Another Ludhiana based Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) president, Gurmeet Singh Kular, said, “Establishing a new department means that the government is not satisfied with the working of NGT, CPCB and PPCB. The government is trying to put more pressure on the industry, which is already struggling to come back on track in the post-lockdown period due to ‘rail-roko’ agitation by farmers.” Uttar Pradesh based Pankaj Kumar, national present, Indian Industries Association, a lobby body of medium and small scale industry (MSME) sector, “We are in favour of measures to check pollution in NCR but will oppose any coercive action against an industrialist in the name of checking pollution.” The industry bodies in three northern states claimed that they have been targeted in the name of controlling air pollution even though they contribute the most for nation’s growth and economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmer-bodies-oppose-air-pollution-ordinance-haryana-up-govts-welcome-it/story-JJfmIVQRIM3ni2VnKzwZMO.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Pollution commission is just old wine in new bottle, implies Delhi govt||The Union government’s Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region and Adjoining Area Ordinance, promulgated late on Wednesday, has raised questions about the relevance and powers of the city’s pollution control board, and by extension the Delhi government’s role, in controlling alarming levels of pollution in the Capital.The Delhi government on Thursday suggested that the move will not succeed, with state environment minister Gopal Rai saying that instead of forming committees, the Centre should have focussed on ensuring action on the ground. “The powers to monitor and enforce pollution control norms were with Epca, and are also with our state-level body, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the central body, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). But unless there is action on the ground, no agency can help,” Rai said.The new CAQM will replace the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, or Epca, and the Delhi government claims that the Centre’s ordinance has politicised the air pollution issue. “We do not see how the new commission is any different from the existing bodies like Epca and CPCB. What is needed is actually a body to be headed by the Union environment minister with representation of all state chief ministers. This body should meet on a regular basis and agree on a measurable, timebound action plan,” a statement by the Delhi government said. “We need to fix targets and accountability, else we will keep passing the buck from one commission to the next and the result will be the same,” it added. Several senior government officials and experts said that the Commission will render state pollution control boards, including DPCC, toothless. “It seems like the air pollution part will now be looked after by this Commission. This essentially means that the Centre is withdrawing the powers to enforce the Air Act (1981) from DPCC as well as from the state pollution control boards of NCR states. This new Commission will have all the powers -- to direct, to enforce and to make any rule pertaining to air quality. In a state at the same time two bodies cannot operate,” a DPCC official said, asking not to be named.To be sure, however, nether Epca nor the state pollution boards have been able to tackle the NCR region’s annual winter pollution crisis that plunges the city into a public health emergency. Even on Thursday, the air quality was well above safe limits, hovering around the “severe” mark through the day.Some officials expressed concern that with the air quality slipping to “severe”, dissolving Epca may compromise the winter segment of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) -- under which various measures are taken and restrictions imposed depending on AQI levels -- by leading to laxity in enforcement. “Even though the ordinance says that anything done by Epca will not be repealed, the Commission is yet to be appointed. Who takes the call on enforcement till the commission is formed?” a second DPCC official said.Union environment secretary, in an interview to HT, however, said that the Commission would be constituted in quick time, and will take steps to ensure better implementation of Grap in coordination with the states, rather than derail it. “The implementation of Grap will not stop under the ordinance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pollution-commission-is-just-old-wine-in-new-bottle-implies-delhi-govt/story-FQCEEi8T5p99759Ko9oaqO.html
30-10-2020||City||New body may face similar challenges as Epca, say experts||New Delhi: The Union government’s decision to set up a new umbrella agency to fight air pollution may run into the same problems that dogged the Supreme Court-appointed Epca, experts warned, while some others also said that any renewed focus on the problem was welcome and the answer to the long persisting problem could lie in a new federal body. Till Thursday, the most crucial agency monitoring and acting on the pollution issue was the environment pollution (prevention and control) authority (Epca), which was set up in 1998 and had a mandate empowered by the top court. “There are several concerns with this ordinance, starting with the fact that legal and regulatory changes to tackle public issues like air pollution need a democratic conceptualisation. At the outset it is clear that the central government has taken control over the pollution control matters in the Delhi NCR region. This starts with the fact that the chairperson of this commission is a central government appointee. The commission will be heavily dominated by bureaucrats, to whom the legal frameworks gives various powers. The enforcement mechanism clearly top down and so far there is no indication that it will include third party monitoring and citizen-driven enforcement,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.She added, “One important issue is limiting the adjudication to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and not any other court. This is problematic as the appointments of the chairperson and members of both the commission and the NGT will be done by the Centre.”SN Tripathi of IIT-Kanpur, however, welcomed the move, saying the commission will better coordinate efforts to curb air pollution among National Capital Region (NCR) states. “There was no single body, authority, ministry or state which was empowered or dedicated to do that. This ordinance is an excellent example of learning from what the US did in California. While the US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) was an autonomous and empowered body set up to manage air pollution across the country, California posed a singular challenge as a hotspot, that’s when the California Air Resource Board was set up to tackle that particular airshed. The problem of dealing with air pollution in California has a striking similarity to NCR in terms of meteorological and other conditions that we see in the Indo-Gangetic plains,” said Tripathi, who heads of the civil engineering department.Legal experts said the commission may not be able to do much more than what Epca was already doing. Environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta said the commission has been given powers similar to the one conferred on Epca by a 1998 notification. Epca had powers under section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, which include power “to direct --- the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or process; or stoppage or regulation of the supply of electricity or water or any other service to the polluter. It also had powers to take suo motu action on the basis of complaints, take steps to ensure compliance with vehicle standards, powers to enter, inspect and seize material from premises of polluters and many others”.“Epca, in its 22 years of existence, has rarely exercised its statutory powers and had become an advisory body to the Supreme Court. The same situation is likely to take place with regard to the new commission. Section 12 gives power to entertain complaints. Such power already existed with Epca, but was never exercised. The same is likely to continue with the new commission. The reason is simple. Under the ordinance, if an offence has been committed, a complaint has to be filed before the judicial magistrate first class. Given the fact that a majority of members of the commission are serving government servants, including chief secretaries and secretaries, it would amount to filing cases against themselves. It is for this very reason that Epca never filed a single complaint before the magistrate in 22 years of its existence,” Dutta said.The environment ministry in a note issued to journalists on Thursday said actions and orders made by Epca shall continue to be effective and deemed to have been done under this ordinance.Legally, however, the commission would be more powerful than Epca, said Dutta. He said that the commission will have parliamentary mandate after the ordinance is passed. “It will become an Act of Parliament, independent of other statutes. For NCR and adjoining areas this commission will operate. It is a complete code in itself,” he said. Shibani Ghosh, a public interest lawyer and a CPR fellow, said that even under the new body, criminal conviction would be used as the primary tool to deter environmental offences. The commission will have the powers to levy a fine which may extend up to ₹1 crore or imprisonment for a term of up to five years or both. Ghosh said it is not practical. “The commission has to file a complaint in a criminal court for non-compliance or contravention of its directions and orders. Whether it decides to exercise this power, and how often, would depend significantly on its staff and resources as criminal prosecution is a very time intensive process. The fear of criminal conviction has failed to deter environmental offences in India so far and it is unfortunate that the new law continues to use that as the primary tool for enforcement,” she explained.Dutta said the commission’s initiatives could reduce judicial intervention. The SC was monitoring the air pollution issue in NCR until now through Epca. “With the commission there will be little judicial monitoring. It will now be a completely bureaucrats driven exercise as the body mainly consists of bureaucrats,” explained Dutta. The commission doesn’t include members from ministry of health, ministry of labour and ministry of rural development who are also stakeholders in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-body-may-face-similar-challenges-as-epca-say-experts/story-HCwkM2BrbNn6U15x3QEcXJ.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||‘New body shows govt intent’: Epca bows out with grace after 22 years||The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) on Thursday welcomed the ordinance to put in place a new anti-pollution agency that replaces the 22-year-old monitoring body. In a letter to union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, Epca chairperson Bhure Lal and member Sunita Narain said the move shows the intent and determination of the union government to mitigate the high levels of air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region. “Over the past many years, we have worked to find solutions and to recommend action through our reports to government and to the honourable Supreme Court. We are grateful for the consideration given to our work and to the fact that many of our recommendations have been implemented,” the letter read. Enlisting the action taken by Epca to tackle pollution, the members said there were some initiatives that the monitoring body was overseeing and now that the central commission has taken over, these can be implemented. “...The next phase of the agenda for clean air; fourth generation reforms need to be deliberated upon and implemented. That will necessitate the massive augmentation of intra-city public transport, and to move industries, power plants and other users away from polluting fuels like coal to natural gas, electricity and renewable to ensure clean combustion,” the letter read. It added, “We hope that the above listing will help your ministry in following up the necessary actions for combating pollution in this region.” Meanwhile, in an informal meet with the media, senior environment ministry officials said, “Only two members (Sunita Narain and Bhure Lal) of Epca were calling the shots. Other members hardly participated. We thought it was necessary to dissolve the body.”While the Epca members put up a brave face, officials in the Delhi government said the body was an appointed by the SC, which meant that all action taken by them was monitored by the apex court. “This (new) body will be full of bureaucrats. At least with Epca, the SC was constantly monitoring action and action-taken reports were submitted regularly. Political interference will be more. Earlier, the problem was implementation and even now it will exist and there is no solution to that,” a senior government official said. Javadekar said, “To reduce air pollution in NCR, the government has set up a commission through an ordinance. It will be very effective because Delhi-NCR is an airshed and cannot be treated separately. Courts have set up various committees working independently. Instead of that, this new law will have higher penalty and stricter punishment and I believe it will be far more effective.”Many experts said the commission could help reduce Supreme Court oversight as it was monitoring the issue through Epca. “With the commission, there will be little judicial monitoring. It will now be a completely bureaucrat-driven exercise,” explained environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta.“The critical departure is the attempt to limit the role of the judiciary and assertion of the role of the executive and the power of the elected representative in decision-making related to air pollution matters. The ordinance states this is the “highest degree of democratic oversight for effective implementation” and the commission will function under the oversight of elected representative with regular reports to the Parliament,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment. “The implication of this super structure for the federal framework is not yet clear. Even though the membership of the commission will include key ministries and state governments at the level of secretary to the government of India and chief secretaries to the state governments, its power to take measures, issue directions and entertain complaints will require central political oversight,” Chowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-body-shows-govt-intent-epca-bows-out-with-grace-after-22-years/story-lr7zIQkrokJhzB2yXaCisI.html

The Delhi Waqf Board is assisting the panel in matters concerning the violence in north-east Delhi that claimed 53 lives and left over 600 people injured.The board said the home department has been directed by the Delhi Assembly panel to write to police and demand an explanation on why no case has been registered against BJP leaders such as West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra, who unsuccessfully contested the assembly polls in February, for allegedly delivering provocative speeches in the run-up to the polls and days before the riots.“Several videos were played during the proceedings in the House. Kapil Mishra and Parvesh Verma can be seen in them,” the statement said. The House panel is chaired by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Amanatullah Khan, who is former chairperson of the Delhi Waqf Board.In response, Verma said, “The police have probed the cases and submitted their findings to the court of law. I have a clean chit. The intervention of the panel in this regard makes no sense.”Mishra said, “Some people in AAP are desperate to divert attention from people such as Tahir Hussain (AAP’s municipal councillor) who is accused of murder, Umar Khalid, Khalid Saifi, etc. And, hence, they are repeatedly trying to make false cases against me and Mr Parvesh Verma. All of their attempts have failed in the past. I have firm faith on law and Constitution.” The panel took note of several cases in which riot victims did not get appropriate compensation. People related to four such cases appeared before the panel on Wednesday.One was a minor who had sustained a bullet injury and the bullet is still stuck inside his leg. His case was recorded as a simple injury and so received only Rs 20,000 compensation. There is another case in which a person sustained severe injuries on the head leading to partial loss of memory. His case too was recorded as that of simple injury, the Waqf Board said.It said that out of 3,300 cases of compensation, 657 were dismissed after a survey. The committee has asked for the survey to be done again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-home-dept-will-seek-legal-help-on-police-refusal-to-share-firs-on-riots/story-Xh6WsqsDH6451RucP9wz9O.html

The Kalwa hospital provided timely treatment when most private hospitals refused to admit her on Thursday.The Yadav family residing in Waghoba Nagar, Kalwa, was shocked when Divya fell into a bucket of water while playing in their house. “She was playing in the house and we did not realise when she went near the bathroom and fell into the bucket of water. We heard a splash and saw her head down in the bucket. We immediately took her out and saw that she was unconscious. Upon taking her to a private hospital, they refused to admit her and recommended that we take her to Thane Municipal Corporation’s Kalwa Hospital. The doctors there put her on oxygen support immediately and rescued my child,” said Umashankar Yadav, the child’s father.As soon as the child was brought to Kalwa Hospital, the paediatric department took charge. The child was unconscious as water had entered her lungs through her mouth and nose.“Her body was turning cold and blood circulation was not proper. We first removed the water from her lungs and provided oxygen support so that her body would start functioning normally. She responded well to our medical procedures and treatment. She is recuperating well now,” said Dr Vandana Kumavat, paediatrician, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Kalwa Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-year-old-falls-into-bucket-of-water-saved-by-kalwa-civic-hospital-after-private-hospitals-refuse-admission/story-tUy0eAflJUJionxws1wOgL.html

BJP candidate Jaya Makhija got seven votes. Also, the resignation of Prakash Nathani from BJP two days before the elections led to the failure of the party in the elections.“Vijay Patil had worked closely with Sena earlier and for the last four years, he was with BJP after he won the civic elections from BJP’s ticket. However, he was not satisfied with the treatment he got from the party and hence he came back to us. We decided to support him based on the work he had done for us earlier,” said Rajendra Chaudhari, city president, Shiv Sena, Ulhasnagar.BJP’s former standing committee chairman, Rajesh Vadhrya, said, “Sena has always played this role of taking away our party leaders and winning the elections. We lost because one of our members resigned prior to the elections. Although Sena does this every time, when they need to come into power, they join hands with BJP.”Earlier, in the November 2019 civic mayor elections , the BJP lost the mayoral post to Shiv Sena’s Leelabai Aashan, who won by 43 votes against BJP’s Jeevan Idnani.The previous standing committee of UMC had 16 members out of which nine represent BJP and 7 Shiv Sena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-rebel-patil-wins-ulhasnagar-civic-body-elections-with-sena-s-help/story-JszeqXKJHGvhX2DiCiCWKJ.html

It will comprise those from the health department, Thane Task Force, and representatives of the related hospitals, administration officers, health officers from the respective wards and officers appointed for Covid care. A daily audit has to be conducted such that we can decide a solution or method that will be beneficial in the future if a similar situation arises.”Mhaske also suggested that this audit would help keep an eye on the private hospitals and understand if they followed the prescribed manner of treatment for all the patients. The audit will not only be for the deaths happened so far but also for any that happens in the coming days as well.The TMC has recorded 1,206 Covid deaths till now. “Although the civic body has managed to control the pandemic within the city, we can still adopt many ways that will help us to handle the situation better in the future,” added Mhaske.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/audit-all-deaths-to-handle-covid-situation-better-in-future-mayor-asks-thane-civic-body/story-dEMPAmJeAvSZv9esyfGZpO.html

It is a part of the government’s seven-point action plan to combat air pollution, which also includes dust control strategies, encouraging electric vehicles and the tree transplantation policy.“Through this application, people can take a photo or shoot a video and audio of instances of garbage burning, industrial pollution, construction dust, etc., and upload them on the app to report it. While reporting the activity, we will automatically get your location and that of the source of pollution,” said Kejriwal at the web-launch of the application from his office. Kejriwal said that a complaint lodged on the mobile application will be dispatched to the concerned departments, which will have to resolve the complaints in a “time-bound manner”.He said, “There will be specified timelines for each type of complaints. When the issue is resolved, the concerned department will also upload a picture that should show that the complaint has been resolved within the specified timeline. If the complainant is not satisfied with the resolution of the complaint, she can reopen the complaint.”The agencies and departments include the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the environment department, forest department, the police, the public works department, Delhi Development Authority, the National Highways Authority of India, the three municipal corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the revenue department. Representatives from each of these agencies and departments had attended a meeting held in this regard by environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday.The monitoring of the resolution of all complaints and the number of complaints received will be done in the government’s 24x7 green war room, which was inaugurated in the premises of the Delhi Secretariat earlier this month, said the chief minister adding, “Around 70 Green marshals have also been deployed for effective resolution of complaints registered on the app.”Helpline numbers operated by agencies including the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board would continue to function parallelly, a senior government official said.(end)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-launches-green-delhi-app/story-Tr0E8vH1w5Ez6UmgEIs1rO.html

In a few instances, his teenage daughter’s teachers have also received demands for money from the hacked account. The Kamothe police are now investigating the case.According to Kamothe police, the complainant, Kishore Mahale, works at a private company. Mahale’s daughters, aged 16 and nine, have been using the devices for their online classes during the lockdown. Police suspect the accounts were hacked during the usage.Mahale noticed that two phones belonging to his wife and daughter, along with two laptops, were completely hacked since August 21. Since then, Mahale’s contacts have been receiving abusive messages. The abusive messages, at various instances, were also being sent from one hacked phone to the other as well in their house, said police.To prevent further harassment and difficulty in online classes for his daughters, Mahale reset the phone and laptop and even got the internet service provider to reset the WiFi router, officials said.However, that still did not help. Eventually, the family realised that the elder daughter’s teachers were also getting demands of money along with other threats and abuses from the daughter’s account. Mahale, then, approached the police on Friday and lodged a complaint.“We have registered a case based on the complainant’s statement. It appears to be a targeted hacking and we are investigating if someone known to the family is behind the mischief,” said Sanjay Patil, senior inspector at Kamothe police station.The Kamothe police have registered a case against an unknown person under Indian Penal Code and Information and Technology Act for Criminal Intimidation and Defamation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kamothe-family-s-gadgets-hacked-police-probe-on/story-XD3S5nu23ceGGmGPMTTQsL.html

The police also issued them a warning to use them. The drive was carried out along Khalapur Toll Naka, Mumbai-Nashik highway and Gujarat highway.Assistant police inspector of Palspe region, Subhash Pujari, said, “We have stationed teams across highways to check those vehicles, especially truck and trailer drivers, if they were wearing masks and carrying sanitizers. We provide them with masks and sanitizers and explain to them the dos and don’ts for safety.

The campaign also aims at encouraging both the rider and pillion to wear helmets.In 2019, 991 road crashes were reported in Raigad, killing 221 persons while 613 sustained grievous injuries, as per the Maharashtra highway traffic police.Among the crashes reported, bikers alone accounted for 50 per cent of the vehicles involved followed by 21 per cent of light motor vehicles like cars, taxis and vans.Another highlight of the study conducted by the highway traffic police showed that out of all the bikers involved in such crashes, not wearing helmets while riding resulted in 19 per cent of the deaths and 43 per cent of the bikers were grievously injured.Ashok Dudhe, Raigad police superintendent, said, “Since Raigad district is a rural area, many people are either uneducated or unaware about road safety. We noticed that bikers are nonchalant with the use of helmets. So, our first step to curb this was to appeal to the citizens to follow the traffic rules and learn the importance of helmets. This will be followed by implementation of the rules.”The Raigad district has four important major routes including the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Mumbai-Goa Highway, Pali-Khopoli Road and Alibag-Pen Road. Several spots along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and the Mumbai-Goa Highway are accident-prone.With road construction work going on at several stretches along the highways including Pali-Khopoli Road, police said they are urging motorists to be extra cautious on roads and culverts, especially bikers, who are more at risk.Police have set up check posts at 28 locations across the district to catch violators. While the traffic department of the Raigad police has only close to 100 personnel, the department is conducting checks with the help of local police stations when required.Wear helmets, ride safely (SUBHEAD)Within a week of launching the road safety campaign, the traffic branch of the Raigad police registered over 2,200 cases against bikers riding without helmets and those riding triple seats in the district.Suresh Yamgar, spokesperson for Raigad district police said the campaign was needed after it was noticed an increase in bikers riding without helmets. “Families have lost their loved ones in tragic crashes. We hope the campaign will instil a sense of civic awareness among the bikers and help reduce fatal crashes,” said Yamgar. Welcoming the campaign, Ranjit Gadgil, programme director at Parisar, an organisation that has worked for the cause of road safety in Maharashtra, called it a very important step in the right direction.“Looking at the data, the importance of wearing helmets cannot be ignored. After the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act increased the fine for helmetless driving, bikers will get into the habit of wearing safety gear. For the pillion riders, especially women and elders, there is extreme reluctance on their part when asked to wear a helmet. In the light of a crash, while the rider may be alerted, the pillion rider is most often taken by surprise and becomes a victim,” added Gadgil.Police claimed that there have been some results in just about a week and those riding triples have considerably reduced. Police said they will eventually carry out sustained campaigns for other offences like honking, speeding, etc.“While we are on a war footing to take this campaign forward, our aim remains only to get people to grow serious about how important it is to follow road safety rules for their own well-being. Our aim is not only to show a record number of cases but each interaction with a violator is such that they do not repeat the offence,” said Ravindra Shinde, inspector (traffic), Raigad police.Officials said they were conducting more checks and issuing challans since the start of the year, more so during the lockdown period.Last year, till September, the Raigad police had collected ₹1.46 Cr from 57,825 offences. This year, the police collected ₹3.5 Cr from 1.41 lakh offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-wheelers-account-for-majority-of-accidents-in-raigad-district/story-B4ryKu1Xe4ISCfmpN4geeI.html

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad had also written a letter to the chief election commissioner seeking appropriate action against the duo for allegedly intimidating the voters in Rohtak.The police had recovered 15 rounds of 0.32 bore, wooden sticks and registration number plates of vehicles from Lohar’s SUV during checking outside the booth after which he was arrested.Yogeshwar Dutt said he has no idea when Lohar boarded his jeep and denied any links with him. “This can be a conspiracy of the Congress to send that man to board my open jeep to tarnish my image,” he added.Cong accuses BJP of ‘shielding criminals’Accusing the ruling BJP of ‘shielding criminals’, Congress MLA from Rohtak BB Batra said the notorious criminal Ramesh Lohar was seen with former minister Manish Grover and other senior leaders earlier too. “Lohar’s presence with Yogeshwar Dutt has once again proved that he has strong links with BJP leaders. He was arrested for booth capturing last year. Is the BJP trying to attempt the same bid during the Baroda bypoll? It is not the first time that Lohar has shared the stage with BJP leaders. The saffron party has been protecting him,” Batra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baroda-bypoll-history-sheeter-ramesh-lohar-accompanies-bjp-nominee-yogeshwar-dutt-during-campaign/story-ZhRVHM5Su75psrff0fe8oK.html
30-10-2020||City||Day after V-C’s suspension, DU sets up fact-finding team to probe power tussle||New Delhi: A day after President Ram Nath Kovind suspended Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, the executive council (EC) -- the highest decision making body of the institution -- on Thursday constituted a fact-finding committee to look into last week’s developments that plunged the university into an unprecedented crisis. EC member Rajesh Jha said, “The order issued by the education ministry on Wednesday was tabled today. A fact-finding committee was constituted over the developments on this matter following October 21. Geeta Bhatt will be issued a memo and the administration will decide action on that basis. In the meantime, PC Jha will not be given any administrative responsibility.” On October 22, V-C Tyagi had approved Bhatt and Jha’s appointments as interim pro-vice chancellor and interim registrar following a high-stakes tussle between two rival groups -- one led by pro vice-chancellor PC Joshi and another backed by Tyagi -- appointing their nominees as the new registrar simultaneously. Last week, the education ministry intervened and backed Registrar Vikas Gupta, who was appointed by PC Joshi in the last executive council meeting held on October 21. As per university norms, the EC has the power to appoint registrar, librarian, and principals among other posts. In the past one week, Gupta issued two memorandums to PC Jha – on October 24 and 27 – asking him to explain why he was issuing various notifications and “claiming to be Registrar (Acting)” which led “to an impression of confusion in the University to its stakeholders and society at large.” According to discussions in the EC on Thursday, Jha responded to these memos on Wednesday saying he was issued the necessary appointment letters obeying V-C’s instructions. “I was under the impression that as per DU acts, statutes and ordinances, I have to obey instructions given to me verbally or written by the vice-chancellor. Therefore, I replied to all letters communicated at the appropriate time and issued various notifications. I understand that there were contradictory communications amongst the academic community which led to some scale of confusion,” Jha wrote in his response. Despite repeated requests, Jha and Bhatt did not comment on the matter on Thursday. The university has also been witnessing a flurry of appointments, transfers, and removals with the crisis unfolding since last week. On Thursday too, the university administration withdrew the appointment of chairperson and member of the governing body at Dyal Singh College. Sisodia reacts Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, reacted to the developments in DU on Thursday and said that the Centre reacted too late. He pointed out to the education ministry order which also cited that there had been a delay in formation of governing bodies in the university – a claim often put forward by the Delhi government. “There was a problem in functioning of DU, including mismanagement in Delhi government-funded colleges. I have been raising this for two years. It’s too late for central government to react and the delay shows that they are unable to handle prestigious institutions like DU,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-v-c-s-suspension-du-sets-up-fact-finding-team-to-probe-power-tussle/story-TgSNNFOhcr5eXIqLZxZeBO.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Kasturba Hospital doctors call off stir, paramedics to continue pen-down strike||New Delhi: A day after resident doctors of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital called off their strike after pending salaries were released, their colleagues at Kasturba Hospital withdrew their fortnight-long agitation on Thursday. The paramedic staff of Kasturba Hospital, however, announced a “three-hour pen-down strike” every day from Thursday until their salary backlog of four months is cleared.Resident doctors of both hospitals had been protesting against non-payment of their salaries for the last three months.Yogesh Kumar, a representative of Kasturba Hospital Paramedical Staff union, said the corporation’s move to selectively release salaries of doctors and other health workers was “dividing” in nature. The corporation had on Tuesday released salaries of doctors till September 2020. Salaries of nursing staff were released till July 2020 and that of other health workers only till June.“They cleared our salaries only till June 2020 while salaries of higher paid doctors were released up to September 2020. Why this division? Don’t we need money to survive? Salaries of four months remain pending and so we have decided to observe a three-hour long pen down strike everyday till our dues are cleared,” Kumar said.Meanwhile, Dr Sunil Kumar, president of the Kasturba Hospital Resident Doctors’ Association, said the doctors decided to call off the strike after salaries till September were cleared on Wednesday.Kumar said the pending salaries of paramedical and nursing staff of the hospital should be cleared soon.“Our demand of a permanent solution to this problem is yet to be fulfilled. The civic authorities should make some arrangements so that no municipal employee, including paramedic and nursing staff, should suffer due to pending salaries. It’s hard for them too to work without money,” Kumar said.Doctors of Kasturba Hospital had begun their strike on October 14 and those from Hindu Rao from October 5. The situation had come to such a pass that Covid patients had to be shifted from Hindu Rao hospital, which was a designated Covid facility, to Delhi government hospitals .North mayor Jai Prakash said, “We are making efforts to make the salaries of all our employees up to date. Efforts are being made to release the salaries of the remaining categories in a phased manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kasturba-hospital-docs-call-off-stir-paramedics-to-continue-pen-down-strike/story-heiepoLQHikLnynv8SKT0H.html

30-10-2020||Delhi||Court ends defamation case after Kapil Mishra’s apology to Satyendar Jain||A Delhi court has closed a criminal defamation case against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra after he tendered an unconditional apology to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and health minister Satyendar Jain, who had filed the complaint over Mishra’s remarks against him and chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in 2017.The case was closed on Wednesday after Mishra agreed to tender an unconditional apology before additional chief metropolitan Magistrate, Vishal Pahuja. In a press conference held in 2017, Mishra, who was then a cabinet minister in the AAP government, had accused Jain of handing over a bribe of Rs 2 crore to Arvind Kejriwal. “It is submitted by the accused (Mishra) that he is ready to make a statement before the court, tendering an unconditional apology. Complainant (Jain) submitted that in case the accused gives his statement before the court, he shall withdraw the present complaint,” the court recorded. After recording the statements of Mishra and Jain, the court disposed of the defamation complaint as withdrawn. If convicted, the offence of defamation entails a maximum punishment of two years.Reacting to the development, Jain said Mishra’s statements were “baseless and politically motivated” in nature and it had caused him “distress”. “Kapil Mishra had said objectionable things against me but he could never provide any proof. That is why I had filed a defamation case against him. It caused me distress. I hope Kapil Mishra does not repeat such things after the unconditional apology. His allegations were baseless and politically motivated,” Jain said in a press conference on Thursday.AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, “Kapil Mishra has exposed how he was taking orders from the BJP. He should immediately make the apology public through his social media handles as he has assured the court. If he doesn’t, he should be sent to jail.”Mishra had then claimed Jain “settled a land deal worth Rs 50 crore of Kejriwal’s relative”. On social media, Mishra went on to state that Jain would go to jail in a few days. He was removed from the cabinet and party membership.In August 2019, Mishra, who was an MLA from Karawal Nagar constituency (representing the AAP), was disqualified from the Assembly. In the same year, he officially joined the BJP and unsuccessfully contested the Delhi assembly election with a BJP ticket from the Model Town constituency in February 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-ends-defamation-case-after-kapil-mishra-s-apology-to-jain/story-4CyK2t875LpbbIFQd339xO.html
30-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra extends Covid-19 lockdown till Nov 30; places of worship, cinema halls, swimming pools to remain shut||The Maharashtra government issued orders extending the Covid-19 induced lockdown for another month, till midnight of November 30, with no further relaxations annou-nced on Thursday. The state is yet to reopen places of worship, swimming pools, cinema halls and theatres, and allow social, political, sports, entertainment, religious, academic and cultural functions. State officials, however, said the government will widen scope of Mission Begin Again — a staggered plan to unlock activities — in the coming month. The government has already on Wednesday written to Western Railway and Central Railway to let all commuters use Mumbai’s local train services. Thursday’s order, signed by Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, said what’s already allowed and open will continue to stay that way. Earlier this month, the state let restaurants and bars open at 50% capacity, all women were given permission to travel on suburban trains during non-peak hours, and gymnasiums were allowed to operate. “We have reopened most activities… But we have to keep in mind what has happened in France and the United States (US), where there is a second wave. Both countries are recording 50,000-100,000 cases daily. We are not saying such a wave will come to India and Maharashtra, but we have to remain alert,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope, adding that the government’s primary concern is that another wave of Covid-19 infections in Maharashtra could burden the poor health infrastructure in the state. Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 5,902 fresh infections, taking the state’s tally to 1,666,668, with 127,603 active cases.Thursday is the 12th consecutive day when the state reported below 10,000 fresh cases. Maharashtra also reported 156 fatalities on Thursday, pushing up the toll to 43,710. The case fatality rate of the state stands at 2.62%. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 1,120 new cases, taking the city’s tally to 255,360. It also reported 33 fatalities, taking its toll up to 10,229. Mumbai has 19,082 active cases.Tope said the government does intend to reopen other activities, but with caution. “Some activities are still not allowed like places of worship, political functions and local trains for general public. Everyone in the government wants to open these activities, but there is concern that if we get a high number of cases then our health infrastructure will be burdened. There is a huge difference between our country and European nations and America, therefore we must tread cautiously,” he said.Meanwhile, the positivity rate in the state in the past two weeks has dipped against what it was in the second fortnight of September. Between September 15 and 30, Maharashtra’s positivity rate was 20.97%, while it has dropped to 11.24% between October 15 and October 29. Which effectively means, for every 100 samples tested, 11 people test positive. For three consecutive days, the state’s positivity rate has been under 10% as of Thursday. So far, Maharashtra has tested 8,837,133 samples and has an overall positivity rate of 18.86%. In the past 24 hours, 68,254 samples were tested across the state.Senior health department officials said the slowdown in spread of infection is a good sign, but further relaxations coupled with people’s movement during the festive season could reverse the trend. “The next two incubation cycles will be crucial. If the rate of infection remains around the current percentage then we woukld have successfully dealt with the pandemic. People will have to remain cautious; self-discipline in sanitation and wearing masks is needed,” said an official, on condition of anonymity.Maharashtra also reported 7,883 recoveries on Thursday, taking the tally of recovered patients to 1,494,809. The recovery rate of the state stands at 89.69%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-extends-covid-19-lockdown-till-nov-30-places-of-worship-cinema-halls-swimming-pools-to-remain-shut/story-7mbrQbZBIa52iYya2kLApK.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Manish Sisodia writes to mayors, asks them to ‘rise above petty politics’||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday wrote to the three mayors of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)- ruled municipal corporations (MCDs), urging them to “rise above petty politics” and focus on the “real issue” of corruption and financial mismanagement within the civic bodies, while also asking them to demand Rs 12,000 crore from the Central government as an ex-gratia amount. In his letters, which has been seen by HT, Sisodia said not only has the Delhi government paid all dues to the MCDs as per the Fifth Delhi Finance Commission, but it has also paid over and above this amount, resulting in a huge outstanding loan. “Based on the latest records, MCDs have outstanding loans from the Delhi government to the tune of Rs 6,008 crore. They have arrears to the tune of Rs 2,596 crore that they owe tot the Delhi Jal Board. Hence, in all, they owe over Rs 8,600 crore to the Delhi government,” the government said in a statement later. Sisodia said that the MCD’s own internal audit reports have indicated complete financial mismanagement of the three corporations. “In the internal audit report of 2016-17, North municipal corporation’s chief municipal auditor found Rs 3,299 crore worth of financial irregularities. Additionally, the audit reports pointed that South corporation has Rs 1,177 crore outstanding arrears of property tax, but there is no attempt to recover this amount – we all know what that means,” read Sisodia’s letter. Asking the mayors of the south, east and north corporations to demand the “unpaid amount” of Rs 12,000 crore from the Central government, which he termed as a “right of the people of Delhi”, Sisodia also said, “The facts clearly show how the financial mess in the three MCDs is of its own making and a result of the endemic corruption that has now become synonymous with the three corporations.”. Reacting to the allegations, Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “The deputy chief minister’s move to send letters to mayors of the corporations shows the frustration of the Delhi government as they know that they have to pay dues of Rs 13,000 crore to the three civic bodies. According to recommendations of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Delhi finance commission, the state has to pay Rs 6000 crore to the north corporation alone. Instead of showing frustration and writing letters, the deputy CM and the government machinery should focus on clearing our dues so that this financial problem can be solved.”East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain too hit out at the government. “This is an effort to divert attention from the issue that the Delhi government has to pay dues to the east civic body. As per 4th and 5th Delhi Finance Commission, we have to get Rs 2,985 crore from the state government. Not only this but the Delhi government has to pay us Rs 1,200 crore in first two quarters of the financial year, but so far we have got only Rs 301 crore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-writes-to-mayors-asks-them-to-rise-above-petty-politics/story-j0G2ehAYJAguX3s2fVrwRN.html
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||Air quality in four Haryana cities worsens to ‘severe’ amid spurt in farm fires||As farm fire incidents continued to be reported from across Haryana, the air quality index (AQI) of Jind, Charkhi Dadri, Bahadurgarh and Dharuhera cities on Thursday deteriorated to the “severe” category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). By 4:00pm, the AQI of 10 other cities—Yamunanagar, Rohtak, Panipat, Manesar, Kaithal, Hisar, Gurugram, Fatehabad, Faridabad, and Balllabgarh—had moved into “very poor” zone. The air quality of eight more cities—Ambala, Bhiwani, Kurukshetra, Narnaul, Palwal, Sirsa and Sonepat—was recorded as “poor”. The AQI between 0 to 50 is considered good, 51 to 100 satisfactory, and 101 to 200 moderate, but the AQI enters ‘poor’ zone when it is between 201 to 300. The AQI is categorised ‘very poor’ between 301-400 mark and it crosses over to ‘severe’ zone at 401. Haryana had detected 4,211 active farm fire locations until October 30, 2019, prompting the BJP-JJP coalition government to take a slew of steps to stop stubble burning and contain air pollution in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR). However, during the ongoing paddy harvesting season that began on September 25, the number of active fire locations have already increased in comparison to the same period last year with 4,837 farm fires (626 more than last year) detected till October 28. About a dozen-odd Haryana districts are in the NCR and the pollution control board authorities attribute air pollution in the NCR in October-November to multiple factors, including construction, demolition and stubble burning. Karnal leads in stubble burningHaryana produces nearly 68 lakh metric tonne (LMT) paddy, including more than 25 LMT basmati, sown on about 32 lakh acre land. As stubble burning is being blamed for pushing air quality index level in Delhi-NCR to critical levels, the Haryana government has been issuing challans and imposing fine on farmers for burning crop residue. Listing out eight different steps taken to reduce farm fires, Haryana chief secretary Vijai Vardhan in his October 15 affidavit had assured the Supreme Court that the state government has been taking all necessary steps required to curb stubble burning and to prevent environmental pollution. As per the latest data of Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), 114 new Active Fire Locations were detected in past 24 hours. Karnal leads the tally with the highest 872 farm fires in the district. As per the HARSAC data, between September 25 and October 10, there were 941 active fire locations in the state. This number rose to 2,075 in next 10 days, beginning October 11. And from October 21 to October 28, there were 1821 fresh stubble burning incidences in the state. After Karnal, Kaithal has the second highest number of farm fires (861), Kurukshetra (756), Ambala (643), Fatehabad (452), Hisar (133), Jind (317), Palwal (77), Sirsa (179) and Yamunanagar (355).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/air-quality-in-four-haryana-cities-worsens-to-severe-amid-spurt-in-farm-fires/story-PovhJzFUt5egVudxABR1CI.html
30-10-2020||Delhi||Health minister Jain puts spike on better tracing, but numbers don’t really add up||As Delhi set a new record for the highest single-day infections for the third day in a row pushing the outbreak in the city to worse levels yet, health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday attributed the surge in cases to the festive season, and a “change” in the administration’s contact tracing strategy that was helping identify more patients.Cases in Delhi have been soaring to unprecedented highs over the past week. For the third day in a row, the Capital set a new daily case record with 5,739 new Covid cases taking the city’s tally to 375,753, including 338,378 recoveries and 6,423 deaths. What is alarming is that the positivity rate has risen from 5.3% on October 8 to 9.55% on Thursday, indicating that the Capital is not testing adequately. This rise appears too sharp to be attributed to better contact tracing, experts said.An expert committee headed by NITI Ayog member (health) VK Paul has warned that the number of cases in Delhi could go up to 15,000 a day during the winter months. But the Delhi health minister refuted the figure, and said cases would not rise to that level. Jain also insisted that Delhi was “well-prepared” to tackle a winter surge. “We have changed our strategy by strengthening our contact tracing system now. We are seeing a surge in daily Covid-19 cases not only because more people are coming out owing to the festivities, but also because of this change in strategy,” Jain said. Jain added that until last week, the government used to test contacts of people who tested positive for Covid-19 only if they exhibited symptoms. “Now directions have been issued to test every person who came in close contact with the Covid-19 positive case, even if they are not showing symptoms. This is why the positivity rate is increasing. So, now we are trying to test 5-7 contacts per Covid case to break the cycle of infection,” he said. Even at this rate, however, Delhi’s contact tracing target would be half of what Central experts say is ideal. At the Union ministry’s health briefing on Tuesday, Dr VK Paul said that “contact tracing can only be considered successful if at least 10 contacts” of every positive case are traced and tested by the local governments.Though cases in Delhi are increasing in what appears to be the third wave of infections, a senior government official ruled out the possibility of re-imposing any form of restrictions that were put in place during the lockdown. Many European nations, such as Germany and France, which are seeing a second wave of cases, have all announced restrictions over the past week, especially keeping in mind the festive season.RT-PCR tests scaled up The number of cases in the city started increasing in October as the government scaled up reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, known as the gold standard. On Wednesday, over 17,000 RT-PCR tests were conducted in the city for the first time.On Thursday, one in every 10 samples tested (9.55%) positive, and the average positivity rate rose more than two percentage points in the past two weeks. The positivity rate should drop to 5% or below for two weeks if a region’s testing programme is adequate and is keeping the outbreak in control, according to the World Health Organization.HT reported on Monday that the data showed the tests need to be scaled up now irrespective of the daily volume since the positivity rate was well over the acceptable 5%-7% level, and rising.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the true impact of the festive season, which started with the Navratras on October 22, is likely to be seen from mid-November.“It is from mid-November that the daily cases may see a further uptick because and the trend is likely to continue till December because Diwali is on November 14 and it takes around 1-2 weeks for the symptoms to show. Contact tracing and containment zones should be the focus in such a scenario. Wherever contact tracing is not possible, the areas should be turned into mini containment zones so that there are no spreaders of the infection,” said Kant. The Delhi health minister, meanwhile, also said that there would only be more clarity next week on whether cases had entered a third wave. “It is a bit early to say that Delhi is experiencing the third wave. We must wait for another week in order to definitively say that. But it is also possible that we’re already in that phase or are headed towards it,” he said. Delhi saw its first peak in mid June, which was followed by another spike in the number of cases around September 17, and cases have been rising at a fast clip again over the past two weeks again. While Jain said the city administration is “well-prepared” for the coming days, senior health department officials said the number of hospital beds, especially intensive care unit (ICU) beds, will be increased on a “need basis”. Jain said that more than 10,000 beds were vacant in the city hospitals for Covid patients. “If 5,600 persons are testing positive in a day, it does not mean that all would need a hospital bed. Going by previous data, only around 10% of the daily cases need a hospital bed. Sometimes it is even less. In any case, the Delhi government is preparing for all scenarios,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-minister-jain-puts-spike-on-better-tracing-but-numbers-don-t-really-add-up/story-vWSZqmy1qB8N7aFTKHynAM.html

30-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet authorises CM Uddhav Thackeray to recommend 12 names for nomination on Council by Governor||The Maharashtra Cabinet on Thursday cleared a proposal authorising chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray to send 12 names to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for the legislative council. The CM is likely to send the recommendations to the Governor by Monday. The term of 12 legislators nominated to the Upper house from the governor’s quota had expired in June. The positions have been vacant since then as the state had not made any recommendations to the Governor. The Governor nominates 12 people as members of the legislative council (MLCs) for a tenure of six years. The appointments are made by the Governor on the state Cabinet’s recommendation.“The proposal of appointing 12 MLCs by the Governor was discussed in the state Cabinet today. We have decided to authorise the CM to send respective names to Raj Bhavan. The official recommendation will be made soon,” state textiles minister Aslam Shaikh told reporters after the cabinet meeting on Thursday. Each of the three ruling parties — Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress — will nominate four people and send their names to the CM. State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat has submitted the nominees’ names to the CM in a sealed envelope, said party insiders. A senior Congress leader, requesting anonymity, said those appointed are from districts like Konkan, Nashik and Beed, where no Congress legislators were elected in the last assembly elections.NCP submitted the names of its four candidates to the CM on Thursday evening. Shiv Sena is yet to finalise the names for the vacant MLC seats.As per Article 171 (5) of the Constitution, those nominated to the Upper house “shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely — literature, science, art, co-operative movement and social service.” However, over the years, political nominees have been appointed to these seats, which led to apprehensions that the appointment may lead to another tussle between the Governor and Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.Possible nominees:The candidates likely from NCP are Eknath Khadse, Raju Shetti, Anand Shinde, Yashpal Bhinge. From Shiv Sena, Sunil Shinde, Sachin Ahir, Aadesh Bandekar, Milind Narvekar and Urmila Matondkar are the contenders for the position while from Congress, their names are Sachin Sawant, Muzaffar Hussain, Rajni Patil, Anirudha Wankar, Satyajeet Tambe and Arif Naseem Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-authorises-cm-uddhav-thackeray-to-recommend-12-names-for-nomination-on-council-by-governor/story-Au6mB8IIY3JIdPHHUEqhIK.html
