26-10-2020||City||Two kids rescued after arrest of serial kidnapper||Police have arrested an Uttar Pradesh resident and rescued two children, aged four and eight, whom he had allegedly kidnapped and pushed into begging. The kids were found at a migrant quarter in Moti Nagar on Monday.The accused has been identified as Krishan Kumar, a native of Jaunpur in UP. As per the police, the accused used to lure kids playing on streets with crackers and sneak them away. He would then torture the kids by burning them with matchsticks to psychologically condition them into following his command. The children would then be made to beg or take up rag-picking. To avoid suspicion, the kidnapper had taught the kids to address him as ‘papaji’.Confesses to kidnapping five childrenThough the accused has so far confessed to kidnapping five children, three of whom had managed to escape, police suspect he may have had a hand in the abduction of a four-year-old who had gone missing recently.Police have so far established that Krishan had been operating in Focal Point area, Jamalpur and Bhamian road. He used to look for small children, preferably under the age of 10.Sharing details, joint commissioner of police (JPC, rural) Kanwaldeep Kaur said they are seeking police remand of the accused for questioning.“It is not clear at the moment if Krishan had kidnapped the four-year-old child who had gone missing recently. We had tried to gather some details from the rescued children but they are currently under trauma and we do not want to put any kind of pressure on them,” Kaur said.She added that the accused was notorious in the area for his child lifting activities. “In December last year, the accused had kidnapped two children aged 10, from Focal Point area. But both kids had managed to escape and reach home safely,” said the JPC.She added that on September 22, Krishan had kidnapped a nine-year-old. Fortunately, this child also managed to escape. “We had got a clear shot of the accused on the close circuit television (CCTV) camera in the area but he used to shift base frequently, thus escaping arrest,” said Kaur.During the preliminary investigation, it came to fore that the accused used to live alone and was using the children as bonded labourers so that he could earn more money.Rescued:A four-year-old, who was kidnapped from Mahavir Colony, Bhamian Road, on October 11.An eight-year-old who was kidnapped from Focal Point area on October 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-kids-rescued-after-arrest-of-serial-kidnapper/story-eCgoFyIJtufbtZEgdhCwKK.html

26-10-2020||Noida||Gzb police lodge FIR over ‘conversion’ claims||The police on Monday lodged an FIR against unidentified persons, who claimed on social media that 100 people “converted” to Buddhism on Sunday. The incident comes on the heels of a similar development on October 21, when locals of Valmiki Basti in Karhera claimed that 236 persons “converted” to Buddhism to demand justice for a 19-year-old woman who was allegedly gang-raped and murdered in Hathras.The FIR was filed on a complaint by advocate Ganga Sharan, who stated that he is the district president of Buddhist Society of India’s Ghaziabad branch and some unidentified persons were spreading false information that he was taking up religious conversion.“Yesterday (Sunday) on Vijaya Dashmi (Dussehra) that was an event of Budh Vandana held at Jait Van, Budh Vihar. There, we distributed some certificates in prize distribution for an earlier event which was held at Kalka Garhi Chowk on February 16. But some anti-social elements are levying allegations that I was involved in religious conversion. These are false and baseless allegations. The allegations are denied and are only rumours,” Sharan said in a video statement, which was released by the Ghaziabad police on Monday.However, he did not respond to repeated calls on Monday.The pictures circulated on social media showed groups of people taking part in an oath. The police registered an FIR under sections 295a (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sihani Gate police station.“On October 25, there was an event held and some people were spreading false information over the social media that it was an event for religious conversion. The officer bearer of the Buddhist Society of India has given us a complaint in which he has said that there were allegations of religious conversion. We have received a complaint and legal action is under underway,” superintendent of police (city) Abhishek Verma said in a video statement on Monday.However, he did not take calls for further queries in the matter.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the administration officials came to know about the incident through social media and directed the officials to conduct an inquiry. “The police have lodged an FIR against unidentified persons in this connection. I have written to the police to identify such persons for spreading false information and lodge FIR against them. I have also directed that we will take action under the National Security Act against such persons,” Pandey said.“Subdivisional magistrates have been asked to collect information through field officers and collect evidence against such persons, whose list will be compiled by an additional district magistrate. Moreover, I have also directed that any person who helps us arrest such persons or provide information will be suitably rewarded,” Pandey said.During a recent incident on October 21, locals of Valmiki Basti in Karhera said that 236 persons had “converted” to Buddhism in an event held on October 14 and demanded justice for the Hathras victim.The district administration, on the other hand, said that the residents had raised their local issues and no religious conversion took place.A day later, one Montu Chandel Valmiki, a resident of Pappu Colony in Sahibabad, gave a police complaint based on which the Ghaziabad police registered an FIR against unidentified persons under IPC sections 153a (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc) and 505 (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill etc).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gzb-police-lodge-fir-over-conversion-claims/story-Nll0KoKSCZGEiZgLAGuoeN.html

There was a ransomware screen which asked us to contact them on a particular email id in order to decrypt the data back to the original format,” said Sumit Chowdhary, director (operations).He added that when the company contacted their anti-virus provider, they were advised not to engage with the ransomware.“They said that the hackers may then be able to hack into our email as well. So we never replied to the mail. All our data is still there in the encrypted form. We are hoping that technical experts will be able to decrypt it eventually,” said Chowdhary.The company has 12 sweets outlets of across the national capital region, while the main factory and corporate office is located in Sector 63.Based on their complaint, a case has been registered at the Phase 3 police station against unidentified hackers under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. Officials said that a police complaint was submitted by the firm after the incident took place, however, the matter was probed by the cyber cell before an FIR was registered.“The cyber cell is investigating the matter and will share the necessary information with us. They are working on tracing the IP addresses of the hackers. Once that is done and they are identified, we will nab them,” said Jitendra Dikshit, station house officer, Phase 3 police station.On July 13, the servers of Haldiram Snacks were hacked by unidentified persons and their data was stolen.

26-10-2020||Mumbai||Protection for Bhandup wetland planned as Maharashtra government to regulate entry to Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary||The Maharashtra forest department has decided to regulate the entry of visitors to the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS) from its Bhandup entry point in the city’s eastern suburbs. The move is aimed to protect the 11-hectare Bhandup pumping station area – a satellite wetland of the sanctuary.The decision was announced on Monday by the state mangrove cell under the forest department.So far, visitors’ entry to the sanctuary was only from the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre (CBMC) at Airoli, Navi Mumbai. Now, regulated entry from Bhandup will open up entry to the sanctuary from Mumbai as well.The cell has decided to erect check posts, place barricades, set up a time frame for entry and exit, and levy entry fees for visitors, vehicles, and camera use.“We expect all regulations to be in place by mid-November,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell), adding, “The idea behind this is to enhance security measures around the sanctuary as proposed under the TCFS management plan. Fees collected from visitors will be utilised for the maintenance and development of the area. This will also provide much-needed protection to the Bhandup pumping station (BPS) – TCFS’ satellite wetland under the management plan.”According to Tiwari, the tentative entry fee will be ₹50 per person, ₹50 for two-wheelers, ₹100 for four-wheelers, and ₹100-200 as camera fee. “These are still tentative amounts. Final figures will be updated close to the date regulation commences,” said Tiwari.A team of eight security personnel from the Maharashtra State Security Corporation (MSSC) will be deployed at the Bhandup entry point. “We are planning to keep the entry point open between 6am and 10am and 4pm to 6pm. The security staff will work round-the-clock and will also be in charge of patrolling inside the sanctuary. We also plan to set up a board on the eastern express highway directing visitors to the sanctuary,” said Tiwari, adding that the check post will be opposite BPS. “There will be a barrier on the road where the counter will be placed for fee collection.”According to the Bombay Natural History Society (BHNS), BPS is surrounded with mangroves, except eastern patches occupied by salt farms. The area has 30 bird species and 14 migratory species.Last Sunday, the mangrove cell and environment group Vanashakti removed 400kg waste during a clean-up drive at BPS and areas adjacent to the sanctuary. “We have always maintained that BPS is a forested area, and the department should have a permanent posting. This is now being done. It will help to protect the sanctuary habitat much better and prevent misuse. This had been a long-standing demand as it automatically protects BPS as well,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/protection-for-bhandup-wetland-planned-as-maharashtra-government-to-regulate-entry-to-thane-creek-flamingo-sanctuary/story-EBofGyxxoS2SaEM1elmlxL.html

26-10-2020||Noida||Work on elevated stretch over DSC road put on fast track||NOIDA: The work on 5.5km elevated stretch, which is being built over Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) road to facilitate commuting between Noida and Greater Noida, has been put on fast track, officials of the Noida authority said on Monday. About 15% work on the ₹467-crore project has been completed and it will be completed by December next year, they said.Earlier, the authority had extended the deadline to March 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The proposed six-lane elevated road will start from Sector 39/43 crossing and end at Sector 82 T-point. Once developed, the elevated road will decongest major traffic in Noida’s Barola, Bhangel, and sectors 49, 45, 47 and 46, among other areas.“It is a big day today as we have completed 1,000 piles (the foundation on which elevated stretch will rest) in less than four months. The work on this project is being completed on war footing so that we finish it even before the deadline,” said Rajeev Tyagi, chief engineer of Noida authority.Recently, the authority diverted the traffic to make sure commuters don’t face inconvenience during massive construction work underway on the project. The authority has repaired Bhangel-Gheja road to divert the traffic as an alternate to the DSC road on which the elevated road is being constructed. Earlier Bhangel-Gheja road was not in use due to bad conditions.“We repaired and readied the Bhangel-Gheja road to make sure the commuters do not face any problem because the traffic is allowed only on two lanes on DSC road. The diversion is also important so that we can carry out the elevated road construction work with ease,” said Tyagi.The authority completed 82 piles in July, 212 piles in August, 467 piles in September and 239 in October this year. “We have also constructed 27 caps on which the pillars will be constructed,” said Tyagi.On March 3 this year, the authority had roped in state-owned agency -- Uttar Pradesh Bridge Corporation -- for constructing the elevated stretch that will provide seamless connectivity to thousands of motorists who travel from Delhi side to the special economic zone (SEZ) in Phase 2 area and Sector 82. The UP Bridge Corporation in March had started mobilizing the workforce to start work at the site and also done barricading of the site. But the work was disrupted due to the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In 2012, the authority had for the first time conceived the idea of constructing an elevated stretch over DSC road. In May 2016, it prepared a detailed project report of the project. But work could not start due to fund crunch. The DSC road, earlier known as the Dadri Link Road, passes from Noida’s Gole Chakkar to Greater Noida’s Dadri town.The proposed elevated road will have exit and entry at Sector 100 so that new group housing societies located in sectors 107, 47 and 104, among others, can benefit from the project, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/work-on-elevated-stretch-over-dsc-road-put-on-fast-track/story-O6ORI0skJYoLjPifaDKBmO.html

The police said the matter came to light on June 12, 2020, when the minor informed her father about persistent pain in her stomach.

The 750-metre-long underpass will benefit the newly developed group housing societies in Noida’s sectors 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 as well as Greater Noida West.“We have put the work on fast-track. About 82% work of this mega project has been completed and the remaining is scheduled to be completed by December-end,” said Rajeev Tyagi, chief engineer of Noida authority.The authority had in July last year started the work on the underpass project at the city’s major traffic intersection that used to witness heavy congestion particularly during peak hours. The underpass will also benefit commuters travelling from Sector 62 towards Dadri Road.“We have already opened the stretch from the road number six to Dadri Road above the underpass. We have used push box technique to build this underpass. Commuters will get immense benefit once this project will be ready and opened for use,” said Tyagi.In February this year, the authority had started shifting the sewer line to make way for the construction of the underpass. However, the shifting work got delayed due to the pandemic.“But now the delay due to Covid-19 pandemic has been covered, and the project will be completed by December end,” said Tyagi.The underpass is being built on the Master Plan-III road. The authority has shifted the sewer line a little towards Sector 51 (Hoshiyarpur) and Sector 52. After the sewer line has been laid, traffic disruption has eased to some extent in the area, the officials said.The Noida authority is racing against the time to finish ongoing infrastructure projects following the UP government directive that no project should miss the respective deadlines. The authority’s chief executive officer has directed the staff to expedite the work on several projects such as the 4.5-km Bhangel road being built above Dadri road, 5.5-km Chilla elevated road, sector 71/51 underpass, an alternative route to Dadri road, cleaning of vacant plots and other works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sector-71-51-underpass-to-be-ready-by-dec-this-year/story-wTSDrRdugxAUtHu5ox7kzO.html
26-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad completes four lakh Covid-19 tests||Ghaziabad: Ghaziabad has undertaken four lakh tests to detect the Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, with the last leg of the testing milestone having been reached in only 23 days.The health department said it has now undertaken more reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests as they have been asked to conduct only 2,000 tests through rapid antigen test kits. The RT-PCR tests are considered the golden standard in testing for Covid-19.The first case in the district surfaced on March 5. Subsequently, till June 25, the district had been conducting only RT-PCR tests, after which it started using antigen kits. The official records indicate that by July 30 (147 days since March 5), the district had undertaken a total of one lakh tests. The second lakh was undertaken from July 31 to September 1 – a span of 33 days. Later, as rapid antigen testing increased in share – from 57.15% to 58.5% – the district had administered another lakh tests by September 28 – 27 days since the last milestone. The last set of one lakh tests, however, took only 23 days to complete – September 29 to October 21 – which is the fastest so far. “The use of rapid kits has helped us achieve more testing and we were able to find suspected cases in containment zones and also at our testing centres, where tests were on a walk-in basis. Initially, we were conducting 2,000-2,500 tests daily but we increased it to about 4,500-5,000 and even reached 6,000 tests per day during last week of September,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Now, we will remain focussed on testing activities, besides trying to increase contact tracing efforts. At present, we are tracing an average of about 15 contacts per case and getting them tested. The number of cases is on the decline but testing will continue to find more suspected cases,” he added. The district conducted the highest 6,042 tests on October 5 which remains the single-day highest tests conducted so far. “Now, we have been given a target of conducting 3,100 tests per day, which includes 2,000 per day tests with the use of rapid antigen kits. So, in order to keep up testing, we are focussing on more RT-PCR tests which are more reliable than rapid tests,” said an officer from the district health department, who wished not to be named.According to records of the district health department, the district conducted 4,01,663 total tests till October 21 which included 2,37,846 tests conducted with the help of rapid kits, with a total share of about 59.22% in total testing. Till October 23, the district, with increased testing, had conducted about 397 tests per day per million of population since March 5. The World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) recommendation is of 140 tests per million residents a day. According to the figures of the state control room, the district on October 24 has a total of 17,818 Covid-19 cases which includes 16,637 patients who have been discharged while the number of active cases stood at 1099.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-completes-four-lakh-covid-19-tests/story-iIW06Qcqu4NTcz4SNXKLfL.html
26-10-2020||Noida||Air quality dips a day after Dussehra; Greater Noida and Noida worst polluted in NCR||Noida: Air quality of Noida and Greater Noida slipped a day after Dussehra as parts of the two cities continued breathing toxic air with pollutants more than ten times the permissible limits. The two cities also emerged as the top two polluted cities of the National Capital Region (NCR) on Monday.According to experts, festival rush along with unfavourable meteorological conditions and additional smoke from stubble burning could be the major reason behind drop in the air quality. Last year in 2019, the festival of Dussehra was on October 8, and met conditions were much more favourable. “There were no fireworks or Ravana effigies burnt this year, yet the air quality dropped this Dussehra. The plausible reasons could be that meteorological conditions this year were more unsupportive on days around the festival. The temperatures drop towards the end of October and stubble burning increases. The additional emissions due to the burning of the large effigies leads to further deterioration of air quality,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air pollution at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).According to the data assessed by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Greater Noida was 384 or “very-poor” – the worst in NCR – while the AQI of Noida was 376 against 362 a day earlier – second worst in NCR.The AQI of Ghaziabad, however, improved to 365 on Monday against 379 a day earlier. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.”Meanwhile, the air quality slipped further at Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park (KP) 5 monitoring on Monday. The AQI at KP 5, which is one of the two air quality monitoring stations in Greater Noida, was 435 or ‘severe’ against 419 (also severe) a day earlier. The AQI of KP 3, the only other monitoring station of Greater Noida, was 341 on Monday, against 364 on Sunday, both in “very poor” category.Officials of the state pollution control board, who inspected the area, held irregular construction activities as the reason behind further deterioration of air quality in the area. They also slapped a fine of Rs 50 lakh on a builder. “The KP 5 area has a number of construction projects nearby, generating excessive dust and thereby deteriorated air quality. We inspected the area Monday and found that grass was trimmed at a number of places, resulting in loose soil, thereby adding to dust. Officials of the concerned departments had been asked to start water sprinkling in the area to settle dust,” said Archna Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida. The PM10 concentration for KP 5 for the past 24 hours was 602.66 microgrammes per cubic metres, which is ten times the permissible limit, while PM2.5 concentration was 231.97 microgrammes per cubic metres which is five times the limit. “PM10 are larger particles suspended in the air and are quite harmful. Their major source is dust, either on roads or from construction. As the temperatures dips, the larger particles stay suspended in the air for a longer time and can lead to heart and lung-related issues,” said Shukla. Officials said that they also found irregularities while inspecting a large building project at Greater Noida’s Tech Zone 4. “We have found that a builder of a project in Tech Zone 4 has been carrying on heavy construction without taking appropriate pollution controlling measures. The building materials were not covered and the anti-smog guns were also not working. We have recommended a fine of Rs 50 lakh on the builders under the NGT guidelines,” said Dwivedi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-dips-a-day-after-dussehra-greater-noida-and-noida-worst-polluted-in-ncr/story-oPOHyA2QpaRx3PvH471fJN.html
26-10-2020||City||Mumbai records lowest active, daily cases in 2 months||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai dropped to its lowest in the past two months at 17,860 on Monday. Prior to this, the lowest number of active cases was 17,931, recorded on August 24.Over a month ago, active cases had peaked at 34,136 on September 18, the highest number recorded in Mumbai since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in March. Active Covid-19 cases comprise the total number of patients who are receiving treatment at present as well as those who are quarantined. As per Mumbai civic body’s data, nearly 50% of the city’s Covid-19 beds are vacant as of Monday.Civic officials said early admissions and better treatment protocols are key reasons for the reduction in the number of active cases. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The active cases gradually came down since mid-September even though the number of fresh Covid-19 cases rose. This is because people are much more aware and sensitive when it comes to getting admitted immediately after developing Covid-19 symptoms. This helps in quicker recovery. Also, treatment protocols are being stringently followed by all Covid-19 health centres, which is why the recovery rate has also increased.” City’s recovery rate stands at 88%.Meanwhile, on Monday, the city also recorded its daily lowest Covid-19 cases in the past two months after 804 cases were reported. Prior to this, the lowest daily count was recorded on August 24, when the city saw 743 cases. Mumbai’s case tally has reached 252,085, while its Covid-19 fatalities peaked to 10,142 after 37 deaths were reported on Monday. The case fatality ratio of the city is 4.0%. The number of fresh Covid-19 cases has reduced since September when there was a surge in the number during festivities with 2, 000-2, 600 cases being reported in Mumbai every day since the second week of the month. The number has now come down to 1,000-1,400 in the past week. This is despite the increase in the testing capacity by 43%. The daily testing figures went up from 4,000-5,000 in June to up to 15,000- 16,000 in September and August.Shashank Joshi, member of state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Overall in Maharashtra, there is a clear trend of decline in the cases in the past three weeks. We can see that the decline is coinciding with the departure of monsoon. It is definitely a reassuring sign. This might be because a large population that are in crowded clusters may have already been exposed to the virus and fought it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-records-lowest-active-daily-cases-in-2-months/story-K0MVINtNizLjbyRSoRIsaL.html
26-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: AQI better at Vasundhara monitoring station this year while Loni suffers the most||Ghaziabad: Three of out of the four online ambient air quality monitoring stations in Ghaziabad saw more number of days in the “poor”, “very poor” and “severe” air quality index (AQI) categories during the first 25 days of October this year, as compared to the same period last year. According to records of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), only the Vasundhara monitoring station saw a lesser number of days under the three AQI categories mentioned above this year, when compared to the same in 2019.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.”According to CPCB’s records, from October 1 to 25, 2019 the Vasundhara monitoring station saw AQI in the “severe” category on at least 10 days, but saw zero ‘severe’ pollution days during the same period this year. However, there were 11 days this year from October 1 to 25 when the station recorded “poor” AQI, while the number of “very poor” AQI days dipped from seven last year to four this year.The monitoring station caters to localities of Vaishali, Vasundhara, and Sahibabad Industrial area, among others. Likewise, the monitoring station at Indirapuram had, in the first 25 days of October last year, seen three and eleven days under “very poor” and “poor” categories, respectively. However, the count for the number of days when AQI was “very poor” has risen to five from last year’s three, while 15 days were recorded under the “poor” category during the same period this year from last year’s 11. “There has been improvement at Vasundhara as it is near to the industrial area where we have got the air pollution control systems in industrial units upgraded. Further, factories are running below full capacity, even though some lockdown has been lifted. In addition, last year works for the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) were taken up near UP-Gate. So, the Vasundhara station was being affected due to the construction activities there. Now, the work has progressed near Vijay Nagar, which is why the AQI is better at Vasundhara,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. He added that readings at the Indirapuram station are being affected by infrastructure works taken up at the CISF Road and also getting effect of work taken up under the DME project.“At Sanjay Nagar, we have stopped letting private buses operate from near the monitoring station, and water sprinkling at dust emission sources is taken up vigorously. Further, many school buses used to visit the CNG pump nearby and this caused pollution due to more vehicle idling time waiting in queues. Since school buses have not been in operation since quite some time, the pollution levels have come down here,” Sharma added. The officials said that the Loni monitoring station is a major problem issue this year as three different agencies are carrying out road infrastructure works nearby, besides instances of waste burning which have come to light. “Loni is a major issue this year and I have written to the district authorities of North Delhi for joint operation for enforcement and monitoring. It is so because there is a lot of e-waste coming in from Delhi and getting processed in Ghaziabad. So, joint efforts by authorities in Delhi and Ghaziabad are needed,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “On the other hand, we have taken up a lot of enforcement work in nearby areas close to other three monitoring stations. This is why no other three monitoring stations, except Loni, have gone to “severe” category this year and “very poor” category pollution has also gone better and now under “poor” category,” the DM added.At the Sanjay Nagar monitoring station, 13 days during the same period in October had “poor” and “very poor” AQI, while this year the count has risen to 19.The worst affected station – Loni – has suffered “severe” AQI readings on two days this October, besides 10 days under “very poor” AQI and 13 days under “poor” AQI. However, the overall pollution scenario in three cities of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida continued to remain under the “very poor” category. According to CPCB, the AQI values were at 376, 365 and 384 for Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida, respectively, on Monday.The officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said that wind speed is likely to pick up from Tuesday and dispersal of pollutants will be more. “The wind speed at present is about 6-8kmph on an average, while it is hardly present during the night timings. From Tuesday, the wind speed will pick up and is likely to be in the range of 12-15kmph, which will help in dispersal of pollutants during the day time. So, conditions are likely to improve for next four-five days but there is no prediction for rainfall,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-aqi-better-at-vasundhara-monitoring-station-this-year-while-loni-suffers-the-most/story-YxlwYcBXA7tAaYZ1o9LBFI.html

A similar initiative was taken in Nuh this month, where 250 houses had put name plates with their daughters’ name at the entrance of the houses.On Monday, Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner gave name plates to at least five families. In a statement issued by the district administration, Panwar said that villages with poor sex ratio have been identified for the initial phase of the initiative. Parents of five newborn girls from Sirhaul and Khandsa were given name plates by Panwar. They were also informed about the various schemes and the one-stop centre for women.Panwar said, “The initiative will bring a change in the society. Generally, we see name of the male member on the name plate. But now through this drive we can see name of the girl child on the nameplate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-initiates-a-move-to-put-daughters-names-on-address-plates/story-RPVCoTu3BBNx5I0KvX26YN.html
26-10-2020||Gurugram||Man who robbed passengers after sedating them held from Sector 9||The police on Sunday arrested a 30-year-old man from Sector 9 for his alleged involvement in robbing people by offering them shared cab rides from Gurugram to Jaipur and later giving them cold drinks laced with sedatives. Three of his fellow gang members have been identified but are yet to be arrested, said the police on Monday. The police said the gang used to steal cabs for robbing commuters. They also used to board e-rickshaws and rob the driver and passengers by offering them sedative-laced cold drinks. The police said that they received complaints this year about two incidents — first, the gang robbing an e-rickshaw driver and stealing the vehicle, and second, the gang robbing a Jaipur-based commuter. The gang usually befriended single passengers looking for cabs from Rajeev Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk for their travel to Jaipur, the police said. In one case, on May 7, two men boarded an e-rickshaw near Shishpal Vihar near Sohna Road and asked the driver to drop them near Ghata village and agreed to pay ₹350. After driving for a kilometre, one of the gang members offered the driver a cold drink. Although, he initially refused, he later agreed upon insistence.“I sipped only three sips from a cold drink glass, which the two men had offered, and half an hour later, I felt dizzy and fell unconscious near Arcadia Market in South City 2. I found myself lying in a hospital bed the next day,” recalled Mehrab Ali, a resident of Gangarampur in West Bengal, who lived in a rented room in Sector 50. He said had lost all his belongings worth ₹5,000. The doctors treating Ali, however, could not find any trace of the sedative.The police said Ali had taken an e-rickshaw on rent from a private company and used to ferry passengers from Sohna Road to a mall in Sector 50. In the other incident in June this year, Jaipur resident Anil Kumar was returning from Delhi when he boarded a cab from Rajiv Chowk, in which two passengers were already seated. As the journey began, one of the suspects asked the driver to stop the cab and got down to buy a cold drink and offered the same to all three. Minutes after he took a few sips, Kumar fell unconscious. The gang fled with ₹1 lakh cash, a gold chain, a gold bracelet, and his mobile phone. He was thrown out of cab on an isolated stretch close to expressway. In his complaint with Kherki Daula police station, Kumar gave a detailed description of the suspects. The police started an investigation and during the probe, they found that the description matched a suspect arrested last year in lift-and-loot case. Police traced the suspect identified as Saddakul-Islam of village Malihar in West Bengal and kept a close watch on him and on Sunday questioned him following which he revealed that how he along with his close aides used to target passengers and robbed them. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that there are 50 similar cases reported between May and September. We are suspecting the involvement of this same gang posing as cab drivers and passengers. “Two of the cases in May and June this year — one in Kherki Daula and the other under the jurisdiction of Sector 50 police station — have been identified by the police and the suspect has confessed to these incidents. Another robbery in Sector 50 was also committed by this gang,” he said. The police said cases have been registered under sections 328 (Causing hurt by means of poison, etc, with intent to commit an offence) and 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said “There is a rise in the number of cases of unsuspecting commuters being drugged by fellow passengers. The suspects source the sedatives from a local chemist in Jaipur, who should not be selling drugs without prescriptions. “It is actually difficult to buy these drugs without the proper prescription. But they source the drugs through their known chemist,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-who-robbed-passengers-after-sedating-them-held-from-sector-9/story-SmnB9M7flOxhO2RAWvUZ9J.html
26-10-2020||Gurugram||Haryana Vision Zero likely to restart next month, funding approved in principle||The funding for Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ), a road safety programme aimed at reducing on-road fatalities across Haryana, has been approved in principle, five months after the project folded up due to lack of funds. The programme is likely to restart next month, with officials of the Haryana transport department on Monday confirming that the process for formally doing the same has been initiated.HVZ is loosely based on the ‘Vision Zero’ concept of Sweden, and is aimed at achieving zero road fatalities in Haryana. Under HVZ, a team of road safety experts collaborate to analyse data of fatal accidents in a particular district and then audit stretches to identify whether human errors, engineering errors, or lack of infrastructure were the causes behind such incidents. The recommendations are then sent to public bodies concerned, for implementation.For instance, at the Khandsa exit on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, 21 pedestrian fatalities were recorded between 2017 and 2019, the highest in Gurugram. After auditing the stretch, HVZ had identified the lack of pedestrian amenities for crossing the National Highway 48 as the main cause of high fatalities and recommended the installation of a foot overbridge (FOB) at the exit. An FOB was installed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in May this year.“Last week, during a meeting, it was decided that since the funding for the programme had stopped, the Haryana government would step in. In principle, the decision has been approved and steps for formalising it have started. The remaining paperwork would be completed by the state government in due time,” said Anurag Rastogi, principal secretary, Haryana transport department.Rastogi added that the matter was put forward for discussion by Manoj Yadav, director general of police (DGP), Haryana, during a meeting in Chandigarh on October 22.“The proposal for reviving HVZ is important. During its operation, the programme was effective in reducing road fatalities at the district level through identification of black spots and coordinating with all relevant authorities to ensure that road engineering defects, which were leading to accidents, can be rectified. HVZ brought all stakeholders together and its results were visible,” said Yadav.During its three-year tenure, the total number of road fatalities recorded in both Haryana and Gurugram had declined. As per HVZ data, in Haryana, the total number of road fatalities was 5,390 in 2017, 5,356 in 2018, and 5,125 in 2019. Similarly, for Gurugram, the total number of road fatalities was 484 in 2017, 469 in 2018, and 401 in 2019.HVZ started operation in May 2017 and initially only covered 10 districts of Haryana. A year later, its coverage extended to all 22 districts in the stateHVZ was entirely privately funded. Every May, an automobile manufacturer and a software development and technology consulting company would cumulatively give annual funding of Rs 3 crore to HVZ, as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds.However, the companies withdrew the funding this year due to the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, forcing HVZ to shut operations on June 1.“Vision Zero is a modern, scientific and global approach to road safety and has been adopted by several progressive countries across the world to reduce road traffic deaths and serious injuries. Haryana was the first state to adopt this approach in India and has witnessed a tangible impact. Restarting HVZ programme will not only reduce deaths on Haryana’s roads but can also form a model that can be replicated across the country,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, programme coordinator, HVZ.An HVZ official privy to the matter said that in June, a communication was sent to the Haryana government regarding its closure due to lack of funds.“We had informed the state government about the closing of the programme via email. However, with the government caught up in curbing the spread of coronavirus at the time, there was no response as such. Last month, during a state-level road safety meeting, the matter was discussed and steps for reviving HVZ were subsequently initiated,” the HVZ official cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-vision-zero-likely-to-restart-next-month-funding-approved-in-principle/story-WWgyBIUwol26uvGuypiX8H.html
26-10-2020||Gurugram||Man who robbed more than 20 banks arrested by Gurugram Police||A 35-year-old man has been arrested for robbing more than 20 banks across eight states over the last decade, said the police on Monday. The suspect, identified as Gajraj Kumar of Karoli village in Rajasthan, was wanted by the police departments of Haryana and Tamil Nadu for the past two years. The police said he joined his friend’s gang who allegedly used to steal valuables from lockers of banks and courier offices in Rajasthan. He allegedly joined the gang after he lost a huge amount of money in gambling and was unable to pay back his debt. Based on a tip-off, Kumar was arrested from Jaipur on Sunday. According to the police, he had returned from Madhya Pradesh after allegedly robbing a bank last week. The police said Kumar, and three of his aides, had robbed the bank of gold and ₹10 lakh cash,, which are yet to be recovered. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, in early 2008, Kumar allegedly met a criminal in his village who helped him to pay off his debt. Together, they formed a gang to rob a local Gramin Bank. “He had lost nearly ₹80,000 in a month and had taken a loan from family and friends to gamble,” Sangwan said, adding that he had also started betting on cricket matches and mostly lost. “He first thought to target a bank which was close to his village. He allegedly broke the bank wall but could not succeed in entering the strong room. After spending four hours inside, he returned empty-handed,” said Sangwan recounting Kumar’s confession. The police said his first two attempts at robbing a bank were unsuccessful. However, between March and December 2008, he allegedly robbed nine banks in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Sangwan said Kumar allegedly paid off his debt and bought land in his village in Rajasthan with the loot money. “He was arrested for the first time in 2011 for an attempted robbery in Rajasthan, later by Himachal Pradesh Police and was lodged in Una Jail for nearly a year,” he said. The police said Kumar met criminals in the jail where he was lodged and made strong networks in nine states. Later, he started visiting places such as Jhansi, Gwalior, Aligarh, Haridwar,Allahabad, Jaipur, Raipur in Chattisgarh, Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu and Sheopur in Madhya Pradesh for recce and conducting robberies. Sangwan added that Kumar along with his associates would fly to all places, but never returned with any loot money or goods. He allegedly sold the gold locally and transferred the money through hawala. “He made sure he never kept more than ₹25,000 in his bank accounts to ensure he was never under the scanner,” Sangwan said. Kumar was taken on a six-day police remand on Monday and was sent to 14-day judicial custody. The police said they have informed Tamil Nadu Police who will visit Bhondsi jail to question him. He will be taken on production remand to Tamil Nadu for further investigation and for recovery of robbed items, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-who-robbed-more-than-20-banks-arrested-by-gurugram-police/story-YjKIlB1V7PwypHQN2YcMcO.html
26-10-2020||Gurugram||At 12%, Gurugram’s test positivity rate highest in two months||For the sixth consecutive day, new infections in Gurugram crossed the 300-mark, taking the test positivity rate(TPR) in the district to 12% — the highest in the past two month. Health officials said that the strong upward trend indicates the resurgence of the infection due to the movement of people during the festive season and complacency in following precautionary norms.Test positivity rate is the ratio of positive cases to the total number of tests conducted. A higher TPR can mean widespread infections in the community. Data shows that weekly average positivity rate has now reached its peak in the last two months. While in August, the TPR was 9%, in September, the positivity rate had reached 10%. Over the last six days, the TPR is hovering around 12%, thereby indicating that the infection is spreading fast. On Monday, the daily positivity rate touched 13%. According to World Health Organization (WHO), the ideal TPR should be five percent at least for at least two weeks to ensure that the outbreak is under control. Health department officials have pointed out that, starting from October 21, new cases have started crossing the 300-mark, reaching 398 on October 24. On Monday, 346 new cases were reported, taking the total number of infections in the city to 27,961. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “The weekly positivity rate has now increased to 12%, higher than both August and September. This is due to the festival season as more people are coming out of their homes. Further, they are hardly wearing masks and following protocols of social distancing.” Yadav said that nearly 3,000 tests are being conducted daily, with the government lab doing at least 1,200 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 700 rapid antigen tests. According to him, on Sundays, testing is comparatively low as most of the labs remain closed. Yadav cautioned that the numbers are likely to increase further as patients with influenza-like illness might get infected due to change of season. “Our target is to test and track people with infection,” he said.Due to spike in cases,hospitalisation is also on the rise.

26-10-2020||Gurugram||Digital learning vehicles deployed in six schools||The district administration on Monday said it had started conducting classes via two digital buses for students of select schools in the city. The ‘unique digital bus’ and ‘mobile hot spot vehicle’ have been arranged through support from three private organisations, which have jointly contributed to the initiative. The free service is currently being used across six government schools and will be scaled up in the coming days to cover 17 schools in the district, where students will be provided lessons digitally. In a statement released by the administration on Monday, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said that lessons would be imparted to the students of government schools via the digital bus which was equipped with state-of-the-art equipment including Wi-Fi facilities, charging points, biometric scanning, global positioning system (GPS), and cameras, along with 26 computers. Through this bus, students of classes 7, 8, 9 and 10 will be taught subjects such as mathematics, science, and English, among others. Khatri said that the content of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books would be taught digitally through the mobile van, which would allow students to view audio-visual e-content. Two resource persons have also been deployed on the bus to resolve any queries and explain concepts to students. District education officer Indu Bokan said that students in government schools of Manesar and Pataudi will also be connected through the digital bus in a phased manner. “The bus is equipped with smart gadgets that can be used by our students to access digital online classes. It will also run on two routes in Manesar and Pataudi,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/digital-learning-vehicles-deployed-in-six-schools/story-ML528igWb32yT9dIwySZ2O.html
26-10-2020||City||Ludhiana MC chief issues show-cause notice to A2Z company for failure to run RDF plant at full capacity||Municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal on Monday issued a show-cause notice to the A2Z company, the firm tasked with garbage lifting in the city, for failing to run the refuse-derived fuel (RDF) plant at its full capacity at the main dumpsite on Tajpur road.Sabharwal, along with other health branch officials, visited the site on Monday and inspected the ongoing work of disposal of over 1,100 tonnes of garbage that is generated in the city daily.It was found that the company was running the RDF plant at around 50% of its capacity and a few machines were not being put to use.Earlier in August, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had also withdrawn the consent to operate the plant as the company had failed to run it at full capacity as per the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).The consent was reissued after the civic body intervened and, the company gave an undertaking that it’ll run the plant at full capacity.An official of the company said that one of the main reasons to not run the plant at full capacity was that the municipal corporation had failed to arrange customers for purchasing the RDF generated and the same could not be stored by the company.Sabharwal said that a show-cause notice had been issued and would be delivered to the company soon and, strict action would be taken against the company if it fails to run the plant to its full capa-city as per the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-chief-issues-show-cause-notice-to-a2z-company-for-failure-to-run-rdf-plant-at-full-capacity/story-I3sU2HScWQXG3W9d5dQncI.html
26-10-2020||Gurugram||State education department to provide special assistance to drop outs||The state education department will be conducting a six-month long academic support programme for out-of-school children to bring them up to the age-appropriate standards of mainstream schools. The programme will cover children of migrant labourers who do not attend school, those who had to drop out of school or discontinue studies, thereby leading to a learning gap, and those who have no access to formal education. Earlier, in January this year, the department had conducted a survey to identity such out-of-school children. However, following the Covid-19 lockdown and pandemic restrictions, a fresh survey was conducted last month. Sangeeta Chaudhary, district project coordinator, said that as per the survey conducted in January, around 4,000 such children were identified for the academic assistance programme. The second survey that was conducted last month threw up similar figures with roughly 3,500 students being identified. “Due to the pandemic restrictions and lockdown, our plans got delayed. Since there had been a lot of movement of migrant population during the lockdown, we decided to hold a fresh survey last month. The new numbers are nearly similar as the past figures,” said Chaudhary. She said the department had approved a budget for 4,000 students in the Gurugram district who would be taught for a period of six months till they achieve competency levels that will enable them to get admitted to schools. “These students will be taught to achieve a level of competency expected from a school student. Once the academic support training is completed, we will get the students admitted in various government schools,” said Chaudhary The academic support programme will be conducted at various centres that will be established in identified locations. Each centre will have a student strength ranging between 25-50 depending on the number of students identified that area. The state education department will be appointing education volunteers in different localities to train these children before they can resume classes. “We will be putting out notices seeking applications for education volunteers this week. These volunteers are hired on a fixed monthly remuneration. They will be trained before they start teaching the students in centres that will be established across the district,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-education-department-to-provide-special-assistance-to-drop-outs/story-mOwsIS7Dm22r2Uz2fD82qN.html
26-10-2020||Gurugram||Haryana seeks genset exemption till November 30 for Gurugram||The Haryana power department has sought exemption on the usage of diesel generator (DG) sets for 19 residential societies in Gurugram and Faridabad till November 30, along with the exclusion of Information Technology (IT) companies in Gurugram. On Monday, the department submitted its final take on the diesel genset ban, as directed by the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (Epca).The decision on the November 30 deadline for residential societies and IT industry has been taken by the officials after consultation with Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday. On Monday, Trilok Chand Gupta, additional chief secretary, power department, wrote to Bhure Lal, chairman, Epca, in this regard. A copy of the letter was accessed by HT.In the letter, Gupta said that the ban on diesel genset has been reviewed in detail by the chief minister on October 23, along with departments concerned, including the environment department. “All the issues have been resolved, only in 19 cases, the exemption is sought for maximum up to November 30,” reads the letter.The detailed affidavits of these 19 residential societies in Gurugram and Faridabad have already been sent to the Epca. These societies lack regular electricity connection and are dependent upon diesel generator sets. In their affidavits, colony developers have given four to five different timelines to reach the final process of getting electricity connections. The steps to be taken include the application for a tender, submission of bank guarantee, land and facility to set up the power substation to finally switch from DG set to regular connection.DG sets are banned under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) implemented from October 15 to tackle air pollution from slipping to ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ category during winter months.Earlier this week, Epca chairman Bhure Lal directed the Haryana power department to submit a comprehensive affidavit on the power supply to societies still reliant on diesel genset. For the exemption, Epca asked the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL) to fix a time frame for residential societies to get the regular power connection.The state has also sought an exemption for IT companies, to allow operation of diesel generator sets as a secondary source of power in case of disruption in supply.“Representatives from Nasscom {National Association of Software and Service Companies} have given a presentation on their issue as these industries run on servers which cannot afford to have a power break of a second,” said Gupta.According to him, these companies will prepare a logbook of DG sets used by them when there is a disruption in the regular electricity supply. “If the IT companies are not considered for an exemption then these companies will have to look for an alternative back up source, like large-size invertors. Otherwise, the department will have to enforce the ban,” said Gupta.Sunita Narain, an environmentalist and Epca member, confirmed that a letter has been received from the Haryana government. She said, “In case of IT companies, they want diesel genset as a backup option. But our question is — how will they manage it? The backup could also become a primary source of power. The issue was raised last year too. A discussion on the societies requiring exemption will be held after going through the detailed affidavits submitted by them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hry-seeks-genset-exemption-till-november-30/story-2AV0SLtpmzdJQbnt2P7xrN.html
26-10-2020||Gurugram||Rs 86 lakh collected in Grap violations so far||Agencies implementing the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) in the city have cumulatively collected Rs 86 lakh in the last week from violators, with penalties imposed on motorists using vehicles older than 15 years accounting for Rs 51 lakh of the total. Grap came into force on October 15 to prevent air quality from deteriorating. The crackdown on violations started from October 19, after the agencies had formed enforcement teams and appointed nodal officers for the sameData collated by Haryana Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) from different departments shows that from October 19-25, a total fine of Rs 86.24 lakh has been imposed on 1,279 people for violations, a majority of which were stubble burning, unpaved roads, dust through construction and demolition waste, polluting industries and vehicles, and garbage burning. Around 60% of the total fines were imposed on unauthorised vehicles, most of which were being used without fitness certificates. The deputy commissioner of police (traffic), DK Bhardwaj, said, “As per the government notification, two and three-wheelers, cars, buses and trucks older than 15 years are not allowed, unless they have proper documentation. The smoke produced by these vehicles release high quantity of particulate matter and pollutes the air. By conducting special drive as directed by the state, we are actively challaning these unauthorised vehicles.” Another large chunk of the fines, of Rs 10 lakh, has been cumulatively imposed for dust emissions due to road construction or unpaved roads. As reported by HT last week, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) was penalised Rs 5 lakh for dust emission on the unpaved road connecting NH48 and Dwarka Expressway. Another fine of Rs 5 lakh has been issued for dust on Sohna Road. Violations of construction and demolition (C&D) activities accounted for Rs 6 lakh of the total, levied on 34 defaulters — mainly construction sites or those found dumping waste on roadsides. For dumping the waste, additional Rs 30,000 was imposed on five people. At least 18 were penalised Rs 15,500 for garbage dumping, while 15 violators were penalised Rs 41,000 for burning garbage. Of the total 1,279 violators, at least 166 were served with notices, a major proportion of it being farmers for stubble burning offences. As per the data, 138 notices were served for paddy straw burning, with over Rs 4 lakh imposed on the violators. Atma Ram Godara, district agriculture officer, was unavailable for comment.Shakti Singh, regional officer (south), HSPCB, who is also the nodal officer for Grap implementation, said, “Different agencies are involved in tackling air pollution. The impact of the activities can be seen on the air quality, if compared with other NCR towns. We are not reporting ‘very poor’ air quality like Faridabad, Delhi, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Ballabhgarh, among other cities.” He said that night patrolling, increased water sprinkling and strict implementation of penalties for violations play a key role in maintaining air quality.On Monday, Gurugram reported ‘poor’ air quality, with an air quality index (AQI) of 258, while Delhi was in ‘very poor’ category with an AQI of 353. Other NCR towns — Faridabad (323), Ghaziabad (365), Noida (384) and Ballabhgarh (337) — were also in ‘very poor’ category. Polluting industries in Gurugram are also under the scanner, with notices being served to four people and a fine of Rs 1.6 lakh imposed on them.Singh, however, said that the total collection of the fine from violators will be available only next month, as several landowning agencies and companies have been given time to submit their response on the action taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rs-86-lakh-collected-in-grap-violations-so-far/story-AJXuRSArN9vNYkTkrYTTrO.html
26-10-2020||City||PAU counselling goes offline as few turn up during online process||After not getting many takers during online counselling, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) on Monday started a three-day on-campus admission process for undergraduate courses.The second counselling for BSc (honours) agriculture at the Institute of Agriculture was held on the first day of the offline process.Around 35 out of 80 seats in BSc agriculture were left vacant during the first round of online counselling. Many students who got admission even failed to submit the fees. In the previous years, cutthroat competition used to be witnessed over seats in BSc agriculture. As many as 29 out of a total of 60 seats in BSc horticulture were left vacant during the online process. There were no takers for BTech biotechnology, microbiology, food technology while, there were few for MSc botany and MSc biochemistry courses.Students say that the reason local colleges are not finding many takers this season is because more and more students are trying to go abroad for studies.Navdeep Singh, a city resident who had appeared for the counselling, said that better pay scale and permanent residency (PR) after the completion of graduation courses are some of the reasons behind students opting to study abroad instead of here.Gurpreet Singh from Mansa also shared a similar view. “Prerequisite of every student is to get a job after graduation. But in our country, either they get paid less or do not get a job at all. So, opting to study abroad seems a safer option,” he said.PAU registrar RS Sidhu said that the online process had been adopted keeping in mind the Covid guidelines but it was observed that many students who had applied for the seats did not submit the fees so it was decided to conduct the counselling on campus.“While the seats in agriculture and horticulture have been filled, the vacant seats in other streams are expected to be filled in the next two days,” Sidhu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-counselling-goes-offline-as-few-turn-up-during-online-process/story-07PCO9ANw0E2rjoa8WOAZP.html
26-10-2020||Chandigarh||Sanitation workers and garbage collectors call off strike in Chandigarh||Sanitation workers and door-to-door garbage collectors on Monday called off their indefinite strike in Chandigarh. They will resume work from Tuesday.The strike was ended even though key objections of the unions — GPS-enabled watches to keep track on sanitation workers and takeover of door-to-door garbage collection by the municipal corporation — remained unresolved.In a meeting with the union representatives on Monday, MC officials reiterated that the two contentious decisions were being implemented only after the approval of the General House and the UT administration. It was decided that the unions will take up these issues with the authorities “at their own level”.However, the MC assured the protesters that the remaining demands, including regular jobs besides house allotment and pension benefits to all daily-wage employees, and payment to contract staff on ‘same work, same pay’ basis, will be addressed as per the prevailing laws and rules.Even councillors had a meeting with the union representatives. “After we assured them that their key demands will soon be resolved, they agreed to call off their strike,” said ex-mayor Rajesh Kalia, who is the MC sanitation committee chairman.Issues to come up in MC HouseSanitation workers went on strike on Friday, their main objection being to GPS-enabled watches introduced to keep a check on irregularities in attendance of the field staff.The civic body procured 4,000 watches on a monthly rent of ₹18 lakh to cover 2,400 sanitation workers, 1,000 work munshis and 600 gardeners.Krishan Kumar Chadda, president, Safai Karamchari Union, said: “We have been assured that in the next General House meeting, the issue of GPS-enabled watches will be tabled and decided upon. Till the House decision is reversed, we will continue to stage a protest, four people at a time, outside the MC office.”The private door-to-door garbage collectors had also joined the stir, suspending work across the city on Saturday. They have been up in arms over the MC’s plan to run garbage collection vehicles in all wards and collection of monthly charges from households on behalf of the collectors.Om Prakash Saini, president of Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society, said: “We have been assured that a five-member committee, comprising of three ex-mayors and two councillors and to be constituted by city BJP chief Arun Sood, will look into our demands. Our issues will also be taken up in the next General House meeting.With the strike being called off, residents heaved a sigh of relief. Garbage has been piling up on the roadsides across the city, with the situation worsening after Dussehra on Sunday. Although there were no big celebrations in view of the pandemic, small effigies were burnt in some localities. “While roads continue to be littered with garbage, children who organised Dussehra helped in clearing the mess,” said Surinder Sharma, president, RWA, Sector 15. In Sector 35 and 46, too, residents came together to clean the roads after the festivities. Physical House meet on October 29Mayor Raj Bala Malik has decided to call a physical MC General House meeting on October 29. The meeting held on October 20, through video conference, was adjourned as 18 BJP councillors had boycotted it. They were demanding a physical meet rather than a virtual one. City BJP chief and councillor Arun Sood, who was among those who remained absent from the meeting, said: “We will bring table agendas of GPS-enabled watches and issues relating to door-to-door garbage collectors in the House meeting. We will question the officials in the House that what difference has the watches made in the last three months, for which the cash-starved MC is paying ₹18 lakh per month.”The BJP also plans to bring table agenda on water tariff revision. The party has been facing public ire on the steep hike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sanitation-workers-and-garbage-collectors-call-off-strike-in-chandigarh/story-DyIHLxEFuO7KvHOtWiN2nM.html

The admit card issued to these students mentioned the examination time from 2 pm to 5.15 pm, however, the exam was conducted from 11 am to 2.15 pm at 20 examination centres in the district. After October 20, the board had issued new roll numbers to students and they were asked to download the same from the board’s website. PSEB controller of examination, Janak Raj Mehrok said, “We will inquire into the matter and reschedule the exam for students who missed it today.”Four students reached the examination centre set up at RS Model Senior Secondary School, Shastri Nagar, at 1.45 pm and were denied entry by the school authorities who informed them that the exam was conducted from 11 am to 2.15 pm. The students were then asked to go home.Another student Manpreet Singh who showed up at 1.30 pm at Government Senior Secondary School, (boys) Jagraon, was also denied entry. He said, “I had downloaded the admit card last week from the board website and the exam timing printed on it was 2 pm to 5.15 pm so I reached the centre at 1.30 pm. But the school authorities did not allow me to appear for the exam. I had to miss the exam due to the board’s apathy.”School principal, Gurvinderjit Singh, said, “We have asked the student to contact the board officials as the exam was scheduled from 11 am to 2.15 pm. Of the total five, four students appeared for the exam while one remained absent.”JP Bhatt, spokesperson of joint action front, associated schools, Punjab, said, “Many students missed their exam today and the same issue was reported from 2-3 centres. The authorities must reschedule the exam for these students.”PSEB exam centre changed The Punjab School Education Board has shifted the exam centre set up at Government Senior Secondary School, Jagraon Bridge to Government Senior Secondary School, Haibowal Khurd for Class 10 (open school) English board examination on Tuesday.The board took this decision after the district officials reported that the school has seven small classrooms and will not be able to accommodate 143 students as it will be difficult to maintain social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-open-school-students-miss-exam-due-to-pseb-goof-up/story-j6qW9lpJlqTnXWz7ZFtKUL.html

26-10-2020||Bhopal||‘Abductor’ boards train with 3-year-old toddler, turns out to be her father||A Thiruvananthapuram-bound train, with no scheduled stoppage between Lalitpur junction in Uttar Pradesh and Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, didn’t get any red signal during its three-and-a-half-hour long non-stop journey. This was to ensure that an abductor of a three-year-old girl travelling in the train got arrested. The detention of the abductor on Sunday night, however, proved to be an anti-climax as he turned out to the girl’s father, the officials said. As per the officials, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) of Bhopal got information on Sunday evening that a three-year-old girl was abducted by a man from Lalitpur and he boarded Gorakhpur-Thiruvananthpuram Raptisagar Express (12511) at Lalitpur junction on Sunday evening, said an RPF officer. The RPF, Bhopal, and government railway police (GRP) personnel cordoned off the particular platform at Bhopal railway station where the train was to pull in past 9 pm. They also cordoned off the stretch from where the train was to slow down as there was apprehension that the abductor might jump off the train to escape, said RPF Bhopal railway station in-charge Nihal Singh. Also read: Air pollution may hinder India’s fight against Covid-19, say scientistsEarlier, a message was conveyed to every railway station in between by the authorities concerned that there should be green signal all through to allow the train to run without any halt. The GRP and RPF personnel at all the railway stations were instructed to be on their toes in case the train had to halt at any railway station due to any unavoidable reason. They had to ensure to rescue the girl and arrest the abductor, the official said. “When RPF officials detained the abductor, Santosh Pandey, 28, resident of Azadpura locality in Lalitpur, from S-2 coach of Raptisagar Express, he told us that he happened to the girl’s father and had left his house with his daughter after an altercation with his wife.” The RPF team handed over the girl and the man to Government Railway Police (GRP) station at Bhopal Railway station. On Monday, the girl’s mother reached the police station and the couple returned home after a warning to them for wasting the time the authorities, said RN Rawat, in-charge, GRP, Bhopal. GRP Lalitpur railway station sub-inspector Anil Kumar Rana said, “Asha Narayan lodged a complaint with us that a man wearing beige colour shirt abducted her three-year-old daughter and boarded Raptisagar Express. She hid the fact that the man was her husband. We informed the officials at RPF control room Jhansi and later informed the officials in Bhopal, which was the next destination of the train.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/abductor-boards-train-with-3-year-old-toddler-turns-out-to-be-her-father/story-SM8MCVHQEw3itiK7uIKsXN.html

The Union minister, who is seen as a potential contender for the race for the chief minister’s chair, insisted that there were no plans for a change of leadership in the state government and Yediyurappa had been doing a fine job.Joshi is the second BJP leader in 24 hours to deliver a sharp rebuttal to a campaign within the state BJP that has targeted the chief minister. ‘Yediyurappa is performing well,” Pralhad Joshi told reporters.Joshi echoed Jagadish Shettar, a minister in Yediyurappa cabinet handling large and medium industries. Shettar, also a potential contender, brushed aside former Union minister and senior BJP lawmaker Basavraj Patil Yatnal’s statement that prophesied a leadership change in the state.“That is his personal view and the party as well as state BJP president have already refuted the same,” Shettar said.Union minister Pralhad Joshi went a step further in defence of Yediyurappa who has lately been the target of Congress barbs over his government’s handling of floods in the state and the disbursement of compensation to farmers. Joshi underscored that the BJP government had been able to provide more funds to help farmers, crediting the BJP-led national coalition for sparing more money for Karnataka farmers than the previous Congress-led UPA government.Congress leaders including leader of opposition in assembly Siddaramiah as well as Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar had earlier accused the state government of failing to get adequate funds for flood relief though people voted the BJP on 25 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka.Siddaramiah has demanded a special session of the assembly to discuss the destruction caused due to floods for the third successive year. The legislative assembly’s winter session was earlier truncated due to Covid-19 pandemic-related fears.Joshi mounted a counterattack on the Congress, saying its leaders had come to believe that only it was meant to rule. “Whenever there is a crisis within Congress, they try to project it as a crisis for the country and the state. The Congress does not believe in democracy. There is a fight in Congress for the CM’s post (in Karnataka) when the post is not even vacant,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/karnataka/yediyurappa-stays-as-cm-insist-2-bjp-leaders-seen-as-possible-replacements/story-I5bzAP8CGTVEiAkde0ncHJ.html

26-10-2020||Bhopal||Technical error halts probe into Madhya Pradesh’s multi-crore e-tender scam||The investigation into Madhya Pradesh’s multi-crore e-tender scam that appeared to be gaining momentum after the arrest of 8 people including three government employees in 2019 has hit a bump, people familiar with the matter said. An official of the state’s Economic Offences Wing said forensic experts recently told the investigating team that they had not been able to access at least five hard disks.Investigators at the state’s EOW had confiscated 19 hard disk drives, cloned the drives and sent them over to the forensic wing of Delhi-headquartered Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in July 2019. They were looking for evidence to back up charges of rigging and tampering of tenders worth Rs 3,000 crore. Some officials believe that the tenders floated by the Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation for various departments could be worth Rs 80,000 crore.“After waiting for 14 months, CERT recently informed the agency that it couldn’t open at least five drives that have details of more than 25 tenders due to a technical error which results in delays,” said the officer who is familiar with the matter.“Five of the clones of the hard disks were probably corrupted and CERT officers are not able to access the data in it. The CERT has returned the hard disk drives and asked for disk imaging of the hard drives,” the official said.The Shivraj Singh Chouhan government had recommended investigation of allegations of manipulation of the e-tenders in its earlier tenure May 2018. But it was only after a change in government that the economic offences wing registered the first FIR in April 2019.There has been no breakthrough in the case.The nine tenders valued at Rs 3,000 crore where there were suspicions of rigging were cancelled before any payment was made.“If the CERT report finds tampering in other tenders, which were already approved and payment were made, the EOW will start a fresh probe. But it will happen only when the CERT report suggests tampering,” said the officer. Rajesh Mishra, the superintendent of police of the economic offences wing said, “The whole investigation now depends upon the CERT report.”“As the CERT has returned the five hard drives, we will do disk imaging of the same and send it back to the organisation. We will have to wait for the report”, said the senior police officer.He added that the irregularities appeared to have been largely committed by a private company to benefit some other companies. “As of now, EOW hasn’t found any involvement of any politician in the scam.”Till now, EOW has filed only one charge-sheet and booked 21 people mainly directors of five companies which got tenders due to tampering. What is e-tendering ScamThe e-tendering scam was exposed by Manish Rastogi, the then principal secretary of science and technology department and head of MPSEDC. Rastogi detected issues in the tender process, which indicated tampering in the tender process. Rastogi had asked Antares Systems Ltd (ASL), an implementation agency appointed with TCS to ensure end-to-end e-procurement for submitting a root cause analysis of the error.In its report, ASL confirmed the tampering and told the MP government that a breach in the system had been detected. The directors of a Bhopal based private company were identified as the main accused. They were accused of hacking the system to access the e-procurement portal and approaching companies that had responded to the tender notice.It turned out that the company had been given access to the portal in 2016 to carry out tests to improve the speed of the website. They went on to use this access to modify the content of the bidding process after the last date for submitting the tenders was over. The company directors allegedly changed bids so that its clients were the lowest bidder and got the contract.A police officer said tampering had been established in three out of nine tenders while the reports of six tenders are being awaited. Those who were arrested include three directors of the Bhopal based company, a director of a Bengaluru based IT company, an officer on special duty (OSD) in MPSEDC, two personal secretaries to former water resource minister and a middleman. The directors of five companies, who were stated to be beneficiaries, are absconding, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/technical-error-halts-probe-into-madhya-pradesh-s-multi-crore-e-tender-scam/story-o3OvTZw1EYjOhrgmmsVKQP.html

Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad, Bhiwadi and other NCR towns all recorded ‘very poor’ category air on Monday.The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday suspended its earlier order that was issued on October 16 appointing former apex court Judge Madan B Lokur as a one-man committee to enforce a strict ban on stubble burning in neighbouring states of the national capital such as Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh (UP). The order was “kept in abeyance” by a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, after Solicitor-General (S-G) Tushar Mehta informed the court about a comprehensive law being planned by the Centre to control air pollution.Also read: Corruption taking place right under Nitish Kumar’s nose, says Chirag PaswanIndia recorded the highest annual average PM 2.5 concentration exposure in the world last year according to the State of Global Air 2020 (SOGA 2020) report released last week.India was followed by Nepal, Niger, Qatar and Nigeria in high PM 2.5 exposures.

26-10-2020||City||Czech national acquitted of girlfriend’s murder in Goa||The high court of Bombay (HC) at Goa has upheld the acquittal of a Czech national who was arrested for having allegedly murdered his girlfriend in a room of a guest house at Calangute in 2013. Initially, the accused, Pavel Neuhausel, was found by passersby below a railway bridge at Cansa, Tivim, in an unconscious state.Later, the police took him back to the guest house, where it was found that his girlfriend, Markita Horka, was lying dead in a pool of blood. Pavel had filed a police complaint, which stated that he and Horka were attacked by two unknown persons, who had kidnapped and dumped him on a road. However, the police concluded that it was Pavel, who had killed Horka by stabbing her on the neck and chest multiple times, following which he had filed a false complaint in a bid to deflect the blame for the murder. However, the HC agreed with the trial court that the police had failed to present a watertight case and did not take the complaints seriously among other lapses.“There was no serious investigation into the complaint of the accused even though it relates to the same incident in respect of which he was charged with murder. The prosecution had failed to carry out an investigation into the complaint of the accused. It is unsafe to rely upon the prosecution’s version that the accused had perpetrated the crime,” the HC ruled. Pavel, who was out on bail, had left India and his disappearance prompted the HC to seek a report from the Goa Police. Data showed that upto 90% of the foreigners, who were out on bail, were untraceable by the Goa Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/czech-national-acquitted-of-girlfriend-s-murder-in-goa/story-QlXLaNjuoVGdwfx15RX1mK.html

Partition has been the nature of Congress. For political mileage, they have divided Jaipur Corporation and promoted such elements who have divided society in the Pink City,” said Devnani, an in-charge of BJP for the Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation elections.

26-10-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Flood-affected residents need timely financial assistance||Farmers used for elections and forgotten These natural calamities strike farmers every year, every season. It is not a new phenomenon because agriculture is still dependent and destroyed by rains in this country even after many technological advancements. Politicians come and go, but no government has ensured how to ensure that losses are paid to farmers easily and timely. Farmers even today are used as an election issue and these visits come on the face of elections or as a tactic to attack the ruling party. A few days after the visit the situation is still the same and the state of farmers remain unchanged. If only every visit by elected representatives and politicians resulted in some change on ground, farmers today would have lived a much better life. Dnyaneshwar Inamke Mental support important during distress When natural disaster strikes, the victims become hopeless and lose faith as their hard work lies worthless in front of them. However, in case of such visits by politicians, we can also see that meeting local leaders, not just politicians but government officials, might prove as a sense of relief for distraught farmers. This mental support is also important. However, due to the current situation, the heavy presence of media, photo ops and social media might seem like politicians are taking undue advantage in the form of flood tourism. But I would say that it is important that the government machinery, including officials and ministers, visit the place immediately to gauge the damage caused by the calamity and also ensure that the administration works properly to provide all necessary help. Abhishek Bhosale Government must provide immediate monetary help In this disaster situation, no party should make it a political issue. Farmers are already distressed and are desperate for help. The connectivity with villages is affected and so help reaches late. There are children and elderly who are most affected during such natural disasters. Farmers have their entire families dependent on them and, in addition to this, their produce lies damaged and wasted. The government should appoint a special officer and a team to make the entire process easy right from filing a panchnama and get help. Help must be provided not just for the loss, but also immediate relief, including food and immediate assistance. The government must provide immediate monetary help and not delay and make the farmer run from pillar to post. The government must set aside a dedicated fund because such disasters are a routine nowadays. Sanket Lonkar Visits only photo ops Experts have already conveyed to the administrator as well as to the minister about the cause of the flood. For years they have been talking about encroachment on rivers, streams. Concretisation has stopped groundwater recharging which has dropped the water level. When politicians are aware encroachment is a problem and instead of solving it but paying visits are useless. Politicians should focus on removing encroachment and take care of clean flowing river streams. It is time to wake up and focus on citizen’s welfare and sustainable development. Such visits only seem like a mere vote bank photo op. Vaishali PatkarRelief to affected farmers are delayedIndian economy majorly depends on agriculture. The basis of livelihood of rural households is agriculture. Agriculture provides employment to majority of population. And agriculture depends on rains. Even though the country has made many advances in improving agriculture production and conservation, the dependence on seasonal rains is a major factor for sustenance. The usual picture when natural disasters strike is the visit by elected members, politicians and their supporters. While the affected farmers and their families look upon them as their saviours, many are left disappointed. The visitors come, announce promises and leave. Most of the times, the compensation and relief announced at the media event remain on paper. Farmers are left to pick up the pieces and carry on with their lives.Mona AgrawalTake steps to mitigate lossesI think farmers are generally taken for granted. Though they are provided exemptions for farming and related activities, many end up not being the beneficiaries. A recent order stated that all agricultural, horticultural activities and those relating to harvesting, transportation, procurement, mandis, farming operations and the like are exempted from the lockdown. The damage to homes and farms in the recent flash floods due to heavy rains have badly affected the farmers who were already overburdened with the economic strain due to coronavirus situation. In these difficult times, the visits by political leaders should bring a ray of hope. While compensation packages announced by authorities do benefit them, steps should be taken to find ways to mitigate the losses caused by natural phenomenon like rains and floods.

Rahul Shetty earlier was the city unit president of Lonavla and previously had as many as seven criminal cases, like attempt to murder and other crimes, lodged against his name at the Lonavla police station.”According to the police, two unidentified persons shot three bullets at Shetty, 43, while he was at tea stall near his house at Jaychand chowk in Lonavla, a hill station around 60 kilometres from Pune city. “One of them fired three rounds at Shetty when he was outside his tea shop,” said Deshmukh. The assailants also stabbed Shetty, son of former Sena leader Umesh Shetty, in his neck with a sharp weapon before they fled the spot at around 9am. “We have recovered the CCTV footage of the area. The motive behind the attack is being investigated,” said Deshmukh Police officials said that Shetty had sustained bullet injuries on head and chest. He was lying in a pool of blood when some people rushed him to a nearby private hospital. However, he was declared dead on arrival.His relatives and friends said that Shetty had informed the Lonavla city police station after receiving indications that he might be killed. Shetty’s father Umesh was also killed around 30 years ago in Lonavla as a result of personal enmity.Police inspector Manoj Kumar Yadav said, “The killing could be due to bitter rivalry regarding the behaviour of the victim in a 2012 case wherein he almost escaped death. The two sharpshooters involved in that incident are still at large and they had taken money to kill Shetty.”Meanwhile in another incident, one Ganesh Naidu was killed with sharp weapons near Hanuman Tekdi on Sunday around 10pm. One of the assailants also sustained injuries in the incident and he is undergoing treatment at a hospital. Lonavla city police are investigating both the incidents and are searching for the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/shiv-sena-leader-shot-dead-in-lonavla-one-detained/story-JXxvJrYufhunLzJbv4sIVN.html
26-10-2020||Mumbai||Won’t make any statement defaming Mahesh and Mukesh Bhatt: Livuena Lodh assures HC||Actor Livuena Lodh on Monday assured the Bombay high court that she will not make any defamatory and scandalous statement about film director Mahesh Bhatt and his producer brother Mukesh Bhatt.Advocate Prashant Pandey, who represented the actor, made the statement while responding to a defamation suit filed by Bhatt brothers, seeking damages of Rs. 1 crore from the actor.Senior advocate VR Dhond, who appeared for Bhatt brothers, mentioned an interim application filed in the suit for urgent hearing on Monday afternoon and pressed for urgent interim injunction against Lodh saying the actor was about to take a press conference and Bhatt brothers apprehended that she will reiterate the defamatory allegations.Justice AK Menon, however, refused to accept the request. “How can I restrain somebody from holding a press conference. How can you gag somebody like this,” asked justice Menon.Dhond, however, insisted for an interim order. The senior advocate pointed out the cause of action - a video of Lodh’s interview uploaded on Instagram on October 23, in which she has leveled serious allegations against both, Mahesh and Mukesh Bhatt.Dhond pointed out that in the video the actor had alleged that her husband, a close relative of Bhatts, was in the business of supplying drugs and women in Bollywood circles, and Mahesh Bhatt was aware of all this. Dhond said, in the video the actor goes on alleging that Bhatt is the biggest Don, he controls the entire system, and has ruined lives of several persons in Bollywood etc.Refuting that Lodh’s husband was not related to Bhatts, Dhond submitted that the Bhatts were unnecessarily dragged in the actor’s matrimonial dispute with her husband. He asserted that the allegations were per se defamatory and therefore Lodh was required to be restrained from making any such statements.Advocate Pandey opposed the request, by pointing out that the purportedly defamatory statements are directed against the actor’s husband, and the Bhatts are mentioned only to the effect that they were knowing her husband’s activities. He added that Lodh had filed a domestic violence complaint against her husband and she was willing to justify and make good the allegations.Justice Menon, however, noted that even the actor did not intend to defame Bhatt brothers and directed her from making any defamatory and scandalous allegations against them and also from further circulating the video uploaded on Instagram.HC, however, refused to direct Lodh to remove the offending video from her Instagram account, so that it is not further circulated some other person, after Pandey strenuously opposed the prayer. In this Pandey had complained that he was given notice about urgent hearing on the plea just a few minutes back and interim orders could not be passed by court without granting the actor opportunity to respond to the interim application.HC has now directed Lodh to file affidavit in reply to the suit and the interim application in four weeks. The court has granted two weeks thereafter to Bhatt brothers to file their rejoinder to her affidavits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/won-t-make-any-statement-defaming-mahesh-and-mukesh-bhatt-livuena-lodh-assures-hc/story-KYWFUyvK09JKKPMZXkzFOO.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi cop, accused of harassing, stalking women, to be dismissed from duty||A 35-year-old Delhi Police sub-inspector, who was arrested on Saturday for sexually harassing and stalking three women and a minor girl, is likely to be dismissed from duty by the evening, a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said. Between October 17 and 20, the cop had flashed, passed indecent remarks and stalked three women and a minor girl on the road in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka. The cop is currently in prison. Also read | Building contractor’s body found in bed box, friend missing“The order to dismiss the sub-inspector will be issued any time today,” the senior police officer quoted above said. Three incidents took place on October 17 at different places under the territorial jurisdiction of Dwarka South police station while another took place on October 20 under the Dwarka North police station’s territorial jurisdiction. Four separate cases were registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 354-D (Stalking), 354 (molestation), 354 A and 509 (sexual harassment) and sections 8 and 10 of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. While the minor girl and two women gave their complaints, one woman refused to file her complaint. The police spoke to her about the incident, took suo motu cognizance and filed a case. Also Read: Delhi: Building contractor’s body found in bed box, friend missingThe sub-inspector, Puneet Grewal, who was posted with the anti-terror squad Special Cell, was arrested from Janakpuri on Saturday. He has been sent to jail. He was briefly posted in the traffic unit as well, the police said. One of the senior officers said that the woman who did not file her complaint posted a video on October 21, on social media narrating the sexual harassment she faced from a grey car-borne man while cycling in Dwarka on October 17. The woman alleged that she was cycling near Dusshera Ground close to the DDA Sports Complex in Dwarka when she noticed a car following her. “While cycling I noticed a small grey car the rear glass of which was shattered and it was noticeable. As I was cycling near along the footpath, the car driver started driving parallel to me. Since I ignored it and did not look towards the driver, he honked. At this I signalled the driver to drive ahead. But the driver did not leave and he continued driving parallel to me,” the woman said in the video. She added, “When I realised that something was not right, the man started greeting me by saying Hello. As I stopped and looked at him, the man asked for directions to reach Dwarka Sector-14. Before I could reply, I saw that he had unzipped his pants and was flashing me. I screamed at him and asked him to leave. At this, he started saying nasty things...I realised there was nobody there, cars were passing by...I was thinking whether I should start recording his acts on my cellphone or leave the place...” According to the officer cited above, two more incidents had taken place on that day. One of the victims, a 17-year-old girl, had reported the incident to the police by calling the control room and filing a written complaint as well. The woman in the video did not file a complaint.“The woman in the video refused to file a complaint, even after we spoke to her on phone and counselled her. The other woman filed her complaint and we converted into an FIR on October 22, the day two more cases were registered. Apart from the three incidents on October 17, a similar incident took place on October 20,” said the officer. Since the three women and the minor girl gave similar descriptions of the car and the suspect, the police suspected that the same person was involved in all the crimes. The incidents were also almost identical – a man in grey car stalking, passing lewd remarks, touching the women and the girl inappropriately and making indecent gestures. Several teams were formed to investigate the cases, identify the suspect and bring him to justice. “We scanned footage from CCTV cameras installed around the crime scenes. The car was spotted. Our teams followed the routes the car took after the crimes and scanned footage from over 200 cameras. This exercise led us to the place where the car was parked. The suspect turned out to be a Delhi Police sub-inspector. We arrested him after collecting evidence. Till his arrest, we did not know that the suspect was a policeman as he was not in uniform during the crimes,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cop-accused-of-harassing-stalking-women-to-be-dismissed-from-duty/story-SijYB3g78Pf1cLKAAgxJQJ.html

Voting in the six assembly segments of Valmiki Nagar parliamentary constituency will be going to polls on November 7 during the third phase of Bihar assembly elections.The Election Commission announced a by-poll in the state’s Lok Sabha constituency on October 13. Votes will be counted on November 10.Here’s a look at the largely-rural Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha constituency : 1. By-polls in the unreserved constituency of Valmiki Nagar were necessitated following the death of Baidyanath Prasad Mahto in February this year.2.

26-10-2020||Chandigarh||No train services in Punjab till October 29 as defiant farmers back on tracks||Three days after protesting farmers stopped an empty passenger train at Romana Albel railway station in Faridkot district and forced its return to Ferozepur, the Indian Railways on Monday announced the suspension of all trains, including goods services, in Punjab till October 29. Ferozepur divisional railway manager (DRM) Rajesh Agarwal said the decision was taken as despite farmer organisations announcing the withdrawal of the rail blockade, protesters on tracks have again started disrupting rail traffic. He said no goods train will operate in Punjab till all tracks and railway stations are cleared of protesters. SUPPLY DISRUPTED TO PRIVATE PLANTS Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) members started an indefinite dharna to disrupt coal supply to private thermal plants by blocking the tracks last Friday. The BKU activists started squatting on the rail route to the Vedanta Group-owned Talwandi Sabo power project at Banawala village in Mansa district. On Saturday, they blocked the rail line to the Rajpura thermal power plant, a subsidiary of the Larsen and Toubro (L&T) Group, for an indefinite period. Train services to a mega foodgrain silo operated by the Adani Group in Moga district was disrupted by BKU activists on Friday. Incidentally, the Left-leaning trade union disassociated itself from other farmer organisations’ rail roko and ended blockades by its activists at various places on October 13. Activists of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), the organisation that spearheaded the rail blockade since September 24, shifted the dharna from Devidas Pura to Jandiala Guru railway station on Monday. FRESH BLOCKADES PUT SERVICES OFF TRACK Agarwal said managing railway traffic is a complex activity that requires strict safety audit of tracks, engines and wagons. “On Friday, the protesters did not allow an empty train that required servicing. They disrupted the movement of goods trains, too. In such conditions, it’s become challenging to plan the safe movement of trains so it was decided to suspend all goods trains till rail blockades are cleared,” he said. Thirty-two goods trains plied on different routes of Punjab under the Ferozepur and Ambala divisions on October 22, a day after farmers announced lifting their three-week-long blockade. Agarwal said 173 goods trains were put on tracks in Ferozepur and Ambala railway divisions till October 23. However, the authorities had earlier suspended goods trains services on October 24 and 25 in view of fresh blockades of tracks at different places. FARMERS OPPOSE PRIVATE PLAYERS IN POWER SECTOR The BKU leadership said it was against the corporate sector in power generation and farmers would unite to keep private players out. They said the Punjab government will be forced to make the best use of state-run plants to run on full capacity to generate electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-train-services-in-punjab-till-october-29-as-defiant-farmers-back-on-tracks/story-kBsd22AGI5HzOoYgVn4j5J.html

26-10-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Corruption taking place right under Nitish Kumar’s nose, says Chirag Paswan||Lok Janshakti Party chief Chirag Paswan Monday alleged corruption in Nitish Kumars flagship ‘Saat Nishchay’ (seven resolves) scheme and said if voted to power he will get it probed and send to jail those found guilty, including the chief minister. The LJP chief also raised accusing finger on Kumar in the implementation of prohibition laws in the state and accused the CM of gaining from smuggling of liquor into the state. “Why not, if found guilty. Just because he is chief minister he wont go to jail? Corruption is taking place right under his nose, Chirag told PTI-Bhasha over phone from Arwal when asked if he indeed intends to send Kumar to jail on charge of corruption in the implementation of seven resolves. “Saat Nishchay is a scheme formulated by him. We will get it probed after an LJP government is formed. And if found guilty, the chief minister will also go to jail,” he said. Earlier, talking to reporters at Patna airport before flying for his election rallies, Chirag said “12 crore Biharis, including ministers in his cabinet and media persons, know about widespread corruption in implementation of seven resolves”. Continuing with his tirade against Kumar, the LJP president alleged illegal trade in liquor is rampant in the state due to patronage of the bigwigs in the Nitish Kumar’s government. “Why doesn’t he gets this inquired too?” Chirag asked. While talking to PTI-Bhasha from Arwal, he made serious charge on Kumar saying, “he is promoting smuggling of liquor during prohibition and a fat sum of money from this illegal trade is going in his pocket for furtherance of his political ambition.” Kumar’s government has declared Bihar a dry state since April 2016. Chirag, who is campaiging for his party alone in the absence of his father late Ram Vilas Paswan, has been attacking Kumar on a daily basis in his election rallies as well as on social media. Addressing a poll rally in Nokha in Rohtas district, he alleged the chief minister “lied” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he has been able to build drainage and streets and provide piped water to everybody in the state. “The chief minister says there is no corruption in Bihar, whereas the corruption in Saat Nishchay is the biggest in the history of Bihar,” Paswan alleged. “Therefore, we have mentioned in our Bihar First Bihari First vision document that when voted to power we will identify those involved in corruption in Saat Nishchay and send them to jail, whether a small officer or the chief minister himself,” he said at his Nokha rally. Nitish Kumar had announced the Rs 2.70 lakh-crore ‘Saat Nischay’ scheme for Bihar’s development during the 2015 assembly election campaign. The scheme aims at making younger generation self- reliant through education, skill development and education loan, besides providing electricity connection to all villages, piped water to every household, and road and drainage in urban areas. The Bihar Cabinet had in February 2016 given nod to implement the scheme over five years. Until recently, the LJP was part of the NDA in Bihar whose primary constituents are the JD(U) and the BJP. After walking out of the NDA in the state, the LJP chief has been asserting that he would ensure that Kumar don’t return to power in the state. While, the chief minister himself is refraining from reacting to allegations of Chirag, his partymen and the NDA ally HAM hit back at the LJP chief. Bihar JD(U) president Basistha Narayan Singh has alleged that there was a “nexus between Chirag and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and both are making baseless charges against Kumar to gain publicity and also for their political survival.” Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s headed Hindustani Awam Morcha, an associate partner of the JD(U) in the NDA, made a scathing attack on Chirag. “You (Chirag) are a ‘videshi chiriyan’ (foreign bird) who is seen in Bihar only during election. Before claiming yourselve as ‘yuva Bihari’ you should know about Bihar,” HAM general secretary Danish Rizwan said in a tweet and asked the LJP president to correctly spell name of the place Dumraon in hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-corruption-taking-place-right-under-nitish-kumar-s-nose-says-chirag-paswan/story-iGRKUTONkJPCispOHbARKK.html
26-10-2020||Pune||Techie shares intimate videos of friend, booked||A 40-year-old IT engineer was booked by the Pimpri-Chinchwad police for shooting and sharing illicit videos of his former live-in partner, after she stopped living with him for lying about a previous marriage. The police are on the lookout for the 40-year-old who sent the illicit video that was shot without the complainant’s knowledge, according to the complaint lodged by the 38-year-old woman.The woman decided to quit her job after the accused sent the video to her boss through a social media platform on September 5, according to the 38-year-old complainant. “He stopped working in the company where he was employed around five to six months ago, from what we know so far. He went to his native place in Alwar, Rajasthan. We will be sending teams there to find him,” said senior police inspector Vivek Muglikar of Wakad police station who is investigating the case. The complainant met the man in 2016 when they were working at an MNC in Hinjewadi, according to the complaint. When they entered into a relationship, the woman was allegedly led to believe that the man was undergoing a divorce procedure with his earlier wife. However, the complainant told the police that she later found that he had not initiated the divorce procedure with his wife and had made false promises of marriage to her. In 2017, she moved to Australia for a year and the man started threatening her into sending him money while she was there.

26-10-2020||Pune||Pune hospitals find plasma therapy effective in moderate Covid-19 patients||The study spearheaded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found that convalescent plasma therapy was not found effective in bringing down mortality rate among Covid-19 patients, city doctors, however, feel that the treatment has been found effective in case of patients with moderate symptoms. Doctors feel that the study had to be wider and also such conclusions can deter doctors from prescribing the therapy while donors might also become reluctant to come forward. After efforts by the administration to create awareness and encourage Covid-19 survivors to come forward to donate their blood for plasma, which had come up as a promising treatment method, the ICMR study has found that this therapy is not as promising in bringing down the mortality rate. Based on this study, the government is now contemplating removing the therapy as a treatment protocol for Covid-19. However, city doctors believe that such a step might just discourage donors to donate their blood. Currently, the Pune division has 42 blood banks which have been authorised to collect blood samples for the separation of plasma from people who have recovered from Covid-19. These banks are located in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Sangli, Satara, Solapur and Kolhapur. The 42 blood banks have received blood donations from about 2,916 donors who have donated a total of 5,875 units of 200ml of blood of which 5,545 have been distributed as of October 24 and currently, there are just 301 units remaining. Maximum donors have come forward from Pimpri-Chinchwad. Of 2,916 donors, 669 donated their blood at PCMC’s YCM hospital while Sassoon, the district’s biggest hospital, has received 136 donors. Professor Dr Rohidas Borse, deputy head of medicine department at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said, “We have found that plasma treatment is effective in Covid-19 patients showing moderate symptoms. Depending upon the impact of the virus on the patient’s lungs right from mild, moderate or severe, the treatment protocol is decided. Plasma therapy is found to be effective in those suffering from moderate symptoms as of 70 patients who were given this therapy, it was found to be effective in about 30-40 patients.” Doctors have also said that currently all the treatment protocols for Covid-19 are experimental, including the drugs being prescribed. Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director of Sahyadri Group of Hospitals, said, “The therapy is found to be effective in those suffering from moderate symptoms. We have stopped prescribing it now, but the final call is of the treating doctor. We have our blood bank where we do get requests for the plasma from other hospitals and relatives keep coming for the same. The therapy has no interference with regards to comorbidity or age and works the same if the therapy is started in the initial days of infection or when moderate symptoms start appearing. Also, it is not a very expensive treatment as the price is capped by the government. The ICMR study needs to be on a wider base with more samples and cases being studied.”Dr Subhash Salunkhe, epidemiologist and chairman, state technical committee on communicable diseases, who heads the committee, said, “The ICMR study has limitations as their sample size is only about 400-500 patients. Such studies need to be carried out on a larger scale and only then can such conclusions be drawn. Plasma therapy is only considered once the tests are considered properly. The therapy is found to be effective in some cases while not in some cases, but then again all the current treatment protocol is only experimental and so it must be left to the wisdom of the treating physician. Also, such statements by an institute like ICMR will only confuse the physicians. Completely ruling out the therapy or treating it as the last stop solution for Covid-19 would be two extremes and so we must keep an open mind and let the clinicians make the decision based on case-to-case situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-hospitals-find-plasma-therapy-effective-in-moderate-covid-19-patients/story-9S5JPhgmtxZuZzzKSTbMLK.html
26-10-2020||Pune||Norms in place as gyms set to reopen||Nearly 3,000 big and small gymnasiums are likely to reopen on Sunday after the state government’s nod to allow its functioning seven months after the pan India lockdown was rolled out. However, with the reopening questions of safety measures and customers’ return plague the people in the industry. From allowing limited members entry for a particular period to disinfection of equipment after every session are some measures which gym owners are implementing. Pune Fitness Club Association president Nilesh Kale said, “Every equipment will be disinfected and limited members will be allowed in batches to prevent crowding. The reopening will save the industry from extinction and feed the families of the gym staff who have sustained the heaviest setback of their lives. We will follow all the restrictions and regulations of the government and ensure that norms like physical distancing, cleaning, use of sanitisers and masks are followed very strictly. The industry is facing issues related to loans, unemployment and closure and we urge the state government to provide financial assistance to this important segment of the society,” he said.Nearly 3,000 families have been severely affected due to closure of the gyms with protests organised by different gym owners and organisations demanding their right to livelihood. Shivajinagar MLA Siddhartha Shirole had vociferously demanded reopening of the gyms on grounds that lack of exercise on a daily basis at gyms was lowering the immunity of the citizens and termed the restrictions as unfair. As many as 200 gyms have shut down in the city while hundreds of gyms are in debt and many trainers and supporting staff have lost jobs. According to industry insiders, the annual turnover of the industry was between Rs 800-1,000 crore and now they are facing huge losses running over Rs 500 crore.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) based on the guidelines from the Maharashtra government, issued detailed guidelines for the gyms cautioning them to take extreme precaution and safeguard citizens’ health.Shambhuj Chauhan, who used to go to the gym regularly, said, “The gyms were closed for a long time and it led to loss in our fitness as we were forced to exercise at home. Fitness centres boost immunity and gyms are centres of health promotion and ensure that fitness is maintained.”Gym enthusiast Pooja Sharma, said, “I have been practising yoga and other exercises at home due to the lockdown. Reopening of gyms will make me fitter than I was before and it is a welcome step. However, safety guidelines must be strictly followed.”Daniel Dorabjee, owner of Danny’s gym at Royale Heritage Mall, said, “We are following the highest standards of sanitisation and disinfection at our gym and will ensure that the guidelines of the PMC and district administration are observed.

26-10-2020||Kolkata||CPI(M) criticises Bengal governor for sharing photos of ailing ex-CM on social media||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has criticised West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar for uploading photographs of Buddhadeb Bhattacharya after visiting the ailing former chief minister on Saturday evening. Dhankhar and his wife went to Bhattacharya’s two-room government apartment at Palm Avenue in south Kolkata to check on his health and offer greetings. Shortly after the visit, the Governor tweeted some photos of himself and his wife inside the apartment and Bhattacharya could be seen lying in bed. In the other photographs, Dhankhar could be seen talking to the former chief minister’s wife, Meera Bhattacharya. “Along with Mrs Sudesh Dhankhar today called on veteran communist leader and former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya and his wife Meera ji and wished them subhoy Asthami and good health,” Dhankhar tweeted around 8 pm on October 24. Reacting, the CPI(M) tweeted, “While we at @CPIM_WESTBENGAL appreciate Shri @jdhankhar1ji’s (Governor of WB) genuflection of visiting our ex-CM Comrade Buddhadeb Bhattacharya at his residence to inquire after his health we are deeply hurt by the pictures that were taken during your visit & shared by you.” “Photographing him when he is most vulnerable and then publishing them on social media has deeply hurt the sentiments of not only @cpimspeak sympathizers spread all across the globe but also general people at large. We would be appreciative if those pictures were taken down,” the party said in the second tweet. The Governor, however, had not remove the photos from his Twitter page till 1pm on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cpi-m-criticises-bengal-governor-for-sharing-photos-of-ailing-ex-cm-on-social-media/story-IzkblYs6eqnG7H2k9WfnhO.html

The court had on October 14 reserved the verdict on the quantum of punishment, which was to be pronounced on Monday.Also Read: Former Union Minister Dilip Ray convicted in 1999 Jharkhand coal scamRay was immediately granted bail after he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by a special CBI court in Delhi. Roy, who was asked to furnish a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh, did not comment on the judgement.Earlier,the CBI had sought life imprisonment for Ray and other convicts, arguing that white collar crimes are on the rise and maximum punishment would act as a deterrent Besides Ray, the court handed three years’ jail term to two former officials of the Union coal ministry -- Pradip Kumar Banerjee and Nitya Nand Gautam -- and also Mahendra Kumar Aggarwalla, director, Castron Technologies Limited. Banerjee and Gautam have been granted bail as well.A fine of Rs 10 lakh each was also imposed on all the convicts. A fine of Rs 60 lakh and Rs 10 lakh each was imposed on the corporate entities, Castron Technologies Ltd and Castron Mining Ltd, respectively.“There was a concerted effort by way of criminal conspiracy to facilitate misappropriation of the important nationalised natural resources of the country,” the court said.The court noted that they “had conspired together beyond shadows of all reasonable doubts to procure allocation of the Brahmadiha coal block in favour of Castron Technologies Limited”.The case pertains to allocation of 105.153 hectares (ha) of an abandoned coal mining area in Jharkhand’s Giridih district in favour of Castron Technologies Limited by the 14th screening committee of the Union coal ministry in 1999.Ray, an hotelier and one of the founding members of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in the 1990s, had parted ways with the regional party in 2002. In 2002, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha (RS) as an independent candidate with the support of some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmakers from Odisha. In 2004, he had joined the Congress and quit the party in 2009.He had joined the BJP the next year and was elected as a legislator from Rourkela constituency in the Odisha assembly polls in 2014.However, he had left the BJP in November 2018 after the CBI charge sheeted him in 2016 in the Brahmadiha coal scam case. There were speculations that he would rejoin the BJD last year ahead of the simultaneous assembly and parliamentary polls after he had met Odisha Chief Minister Navneen Patnaik a few times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coal-scam-case-cbi-court-sentences-former-union-minister-dilip-ray-to-3-years-imprisonment/story-qyV6UkV6Y1K39MynFUOQ2J.html

26-10-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: Idol immersion in River Ichamati to be a low-key affair this year||The idol immersion in the Ichamati river, located around 70 kilometres (km) east of Kolkata in the adjoining North 24 Parganas district, which used to attract thousands of revellers from both India and neighbouring Bangladesh every year, will be a muted affair this year because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. A local puja committee is only the one that will keep up with the tradition in the river, which forms a natural boundary between the two countries. The public from both India and Bangladesh used to gather on opposite banks of the river every year on the day of Bijoya Dashami, when dozens of idols would be immersed. “This year, there is no demand for immersion in the river because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, around a dozen idols were immersed in the middle of the river. We have received an application from a single puja committee,” said Somnath Mukherjee, chairman, Taki Municipality, North 24 Parganas. Also Read: 45,149 new Covid-19 cases take India’s tally past 7.9 million; lowest single-day spike since July-endThe members of the Durga puja committee in Taki, a small municipal town in North 24 Parganas in south Bengal, will load the idols on country boats and take them to the middle of the river for immersion on the lines of their counterparts at Satkhira in Bangladesh.Satkhira is located on the other bank of the river.The Border Security Force (BSF) and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel will patrol the river on speed boats and create a virtual line of control with the help of ropes in a bid to prevent infiltration from either country. Mukherjee said that out of the 44 pujas organised at Taki around a dozen would immerse in the river every year. “A few hundred boats, carrying thousands of visitors, would take to the river to watch the immersion of idols every year. However, this year, 50-odd visitors’ boats have requested permission. Each boat, depending on its size, will be allowed a maximum of 15 and 20 people, respectively,” said a police official. The North 24 Parganas district, where the annual event is organised, has recorded around 71,000 Covid-19 cases to date and is second to Kolkata as far as the viral outbreak is concerned. Kolkata tops the viral infection chart in Bengal with 76,000 Covid-19 cases. North 24 Parganas district and Kolkata have been reporting over 900 Covid-19 cases daily in the past few days amid growing panic about the contagion among the public.“Restrictions have been enforced regarding a cap on the number of visitors, who will be allowed to take a ride on a boat. Precautionary measures such as face masks and hand sanitisers have been made mandatory. Barricades have also been put up in a bid to maintain social distancing among the revellers. A fair, which used to be organised on the sidelines of the immersion, has been cancelled this year,” said an official of the North 24 Parganas district administration. The Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal is the longest international border in any state across the country. Out of the 4096.7 km border, Bengal shares 2,216 km with the neighbouring country. In south Bengal, the border is over 900 km, of which around 60% is riverine, including the Sunderbans delta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-idol-immersion-in-river-ichamati-to-be-a-low-key-affair-this-year/story-IJvPBe6pQoa9MSsj89hReN.html
26-10-2020||City||J&K government to install smart meters; to begin with Jammu, Srinagar||The J&K government has decided to install smart meters and will begin with the winter capital of Jammu and the summer capital of Srinagar. The process of installation will begin from November 15.Power development department principal secretary Rohit Kansal on Sunday convened a meeting to review the Centrally Sponsored Schemes and installation of smart meters. “During the meeting, the Project Implementing Agency (PIA) informed that installation of smart meters shall be started in Srinagar and Jammu cities from November 15. In the first phase 20,000 meters would be installed and the process would continue in a phased manner till all of the 200,000 meters sanctioned under the Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP) are installed,” the official spokesman said.Briefing the meeting, officers said that with smart meters, people will be able to know their electricity consumption pattern and bill on real-time basis, which will help them manage the load and also monitor their monthly bill. The consumers will also know the status of power supply and load in use when away from home, they added.Smart meters will bring about transparency in metering, billing and collection which will eventually reduce power losses and will ensure quality and reliable power supply to consumers,” the principal secretary said.Consumers can recharge their smart meters in the same manner as mobile phones, thus eliminating the requirement of manual meter reading and paper bill distribution. “The meters will be read remotely at the data centre in Srinagar and data recovery centre in Jammu, which will also allow the distribution corporations to know the status of power supply at consumer’s end and take prompt action in case there is disruption in the service,” he said.Out of 11 packages of independent power development scheme and PMDP- Urban schemes sanctioned at a cost of Rs 1,590 crore, six packages will be completed in this year in December and four in March, and one in June, 2021, the officials said. “Out of 19 packages of PMDP-Rural schemes, sanctioned at a cost of 1,777 crore, four packages will be completed in February 2021, and the remaining 15 in March, 2021. Out of the 28 town projects sanctioned at a cost of Rs 1,665 crore, 12 towns will be completed in November this year, 11 in June, 2021 and the remaining five in December 2021,” the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-government-to-install-smart-meters-to-begin-with-jammu-srinagar/story-SkIuDfoG6M1OOeE2V8ei3H.html

26-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court clears land required for stalled Pune Metro work||The Bombay high court last week vacated a June 2006 status quo order regarding some plots of government land at Pune and paved the way for resumption of Pune Metro project work in Yerawada section. The Metro project was stalled for want of a 5,213 square metre area out of the government land.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni also directed the Pune district collector to hand over in fifteen days the 5,213 square metres of land required for the project to Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL). MMRCL had moved the court seeking a direction to the Pune collector to hand over the land urgently required for the Metro project.Also read | Authorities can’t scuttle down welfare schemes: Bombay high courtSenior advocate SK Mishra, who represented MMRCL, pointed out that in November 2019, deputy collector (land acquisition) had informed MMRCL that as per revenue records, this land belonged to the state government and hence, there was no requirement to acquire the land.Mishra further pointed out that the Pune collector had, however, expressed difficulty in handing over the plot in view of a high court order of June 7, 2006, which came to be passed on a petition filed by Dr. FF Wadia.Dr. Wadia has challenged an October 1995 order of then revenue minister, by which two orders were passed by Pune district collectorate way back in 1954 in connection with a group of lands, including the land required for Pune metro project.Acting on Dr. Wadia’s petition, on June 7, 2006, the high court had restrained the revenue authorities from creating any third party rights in the lands by making any allotment or by changing status of the lands in any manner. MMRCL claimed that this June 2006 order prevented the district collector from handing over the land for the Pune Metro project.Shri. Mukund Bhavan Trust had also filed a separate petition challenging the same decision of the revenue minister passed in connection with some watan lands.Dr. Wadia’s counsel, however, accepted that he was not asserting any private right in the land required by MMRCL for Pune Metro. As regards the Trust, Mishra pointed out that the Trust had signed consent terms before a civil court at Pune and relinquished its rights over certain parts of the land in dispute and thus, there was no legal hurdle in handing over the plot to MMRCL.The bench said, “It is quite clear to us that neither Dr.Wadia has any claim over the said land nor the trust can have any objection for the land admeasuring 5213.84 sq.metres in Survey no.141 and Survey no.233 to be handed over to the MMRCL as per its requirement.” “If this be the case, it would be necessary as also in the interest of justice that the interim order dated 7 June 2006 passed be modified so as to enable the State Government / Collector, District Pune to hand over the said land to MMRCL for the Pune Metro Project,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-clears-land-required-for-stalled-pune-metro-work/story-QBnUM4nebrqwVvsZbdccIM.html

The contractor’s childhood friend, who was sharing the flat with the deceased for the past three months, is missing, Delhi Police said. The murder victim’s family members have alleged that he was killed for money, as around Rs 2.5 lakh in cash is missing from the flat. The police are conducting a probe on the lines of personal enmity and stolen cash. A murder case under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been filed at the Burari police station. The deceased, Sameer Malik, belonged to Moradabad in western Uttar Pradesh (UP). Also Read: 18-year-old woman found dead in Delhi’s TahirpurHe lived in a rented flat on the first floor of a building at Sant Nagar and worked as a building contractor. Malik also supplied labourers to construction sites in the neighbourhood. Malik’s childhood friend, identified by his first name Salman, was his business partner. Salman had moved to Malik’s flat around three months ago, a police officer, who is conducting the probe, said, requesting anonymity. Malik’s landlord in his statement told the police that the flat was locked from outside and both the deceased and Salman were not seen since Friday and their mobile phones were also switched off. On Saturday, the landlord saw Malik’s scooter lying in a drain near the building following which he went to his flat to check if he had returned. “The landlord became suspicious, when he found that the flat was still locked and a foul smell was coming from inside. Soon, he informed Malik’s brother, Zarif, about his suspicion,” the officer said. Later, Malik’s family members broke open the flat’s main door. They found his body stuffed in the bed box and blood was spilled in the room. Burari police station authorities were informed about the murder, who reached the spot and sent Malik’s body to an adjoining government-run hospital for post-mortem examination and also collected evidence from the flat. During the preliminary enquiry, Malik’s family members told the police that on Friday he had informed his brother-in-law about receiving a payment of Rs 2.5 lakh. “Salman is our prime suspect, as he is missing. The motive behind the murder can be ascertained after we nab and interrogate him,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-building-contractor-s-body-found-in-bed-box-friend-missing/story-qWxl3K4duyArOxUjaTVpqM.html

26-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air ‘very poor’ for fourth consecutive day||Delhi’s air quality remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday morning for the fourth consecutive day as per the data uploaded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reading at 7am was 344, a marginal improvement from Sunday’s 349.Air quality enters the ‘very poor’ zone between the 301-400 mark and crosses over to the ‘severe’ zone after exceeding 400.On Sunday, Delhi’s air quality plunged to ‘severe’ in at least three areas and remained in the ‘very poor’ zone for most other parts. On Saturday, the city’s overall AQI reading was 345.While scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have predicted that an improvement in wind speed might spell good news for the city, it could be negated by the likely high import of smoke from stubble burning from Punjab and Haryana, keeping the pollution levels in the ‘very high’ zone till Tuesday.Also Read: Delhi chokes on particles as farm fires rage in Punjab and HaryanaStubble fires in the two neighbouring agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana are major contributors to particulate matter (ultrafine particles with size ranging between 2.5 and 10 microns) in Delhi’s air. The particles can enter a person’s lungs and even the bloodstream, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.As per data uploaded on the CPCB’s Sameer app till 6pm on Sunday, air quality was ‘severe’ in Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar and Bawana with AQI readings of 403, 401 and 405 respectively.When AQI is in the ‘severe’ zone, the air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. On Friday, the air quality at 10 of the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi was in the ‘severe’ zone.The data showed that barring Lodhi Road and Dr Karni Singh shooting range, which were in the ‘moderate zone’, all other stations reported AQI in the ‘very poor’ zone.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that on Sunday the wind speed was nearly 8kmph, blowing from the north-western direction, bringing smoke from the states of Punjab and Haryana where stubble burning is at its peak now.“The weather conditions are likely to remain pretty similar on Monday, which means that even though we will get some wind, there will be no visible improvement in the air quality because the winds continue to carry smoke from Punjab and Haryana,” Srivastava said. He added that things might start improving from Tuesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-very-poor-for-fourth-consecutive-day/story-aSpoVJdjisE99H5CykoG5K.html
26-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Number of active Covid-19 cases lowest in two months||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai has dropped to its lowest in the past two months. On Sunday, the number of active cases in Mumbai was 18, 307. Prior to this, the lowest number of active cases in the city was 17, 931, recorded on August 24.Over a month ago, active cases had peaked at 34,136 on September 18, the highest number of active cases recorded in Mumbai since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in March. The number of active Covid-19 cases is the total number of patients that are receiving treatment at present and the ones that are quarantined. As per the Mumbai civic body’s data, nearly 50% of the city’s Covid-19 beds are vacant as of Monday. Also Read: Recovered from Covid? Get flu shot to keep pollution impact at bay: ExpertsCivic officials said that early admissions and better treatment protocols are key reasons for the reduction in the number of active cases. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The active cases gradually came down since mid-September even though the number of fresh Covid-19 cases rose. This is because people are much more aware and sensitive when it comes to getting admitted immediately after Covid-19 symptoms develop. This helps in quicker recovery. Also, treatment protocols are being stringently followed by all Covid-19 health centres, which is why the recovery rate has also increased.” Mumbai’s recovery rate has increased to 88%.The number of fresh Covid-19 cases has also reduced since September when there was a surge in the number during festivities with 2, 000-2, 600 cases being reported in Mumbai every day since the second week of September. The number has now come down to 1,000-1,400 in the past week. This is despite the increase in the testing capacity by 43%. The daily testing figures went up from 4,000-5,000 in June to up to 15,000- 16,000 in September and August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-number-of-active-covid-19-cases-lowest-in-two-months/story-gd79Wa0H3t8bxlXuYMG0PM.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||Cops convicted for 1997 CP encounter released||Ten Delhi cops who gunned down two innocent men during a botched operation in Connaught Place in 1997 were released from prison on Saturday, more than 23 years since they were first arrested over an incident that was then seen as a symbol of police excesses and prolonged trials in the country.On March 31, 1997, the ten policemen were part of a Crime Branch squad that opened fire on a blue sedan at the Barakhamba intersection, killing two of the three occupants -- Jagjit Singh and Pradeep Goyal. The target of the operation was a gangster named Mohammed Yasneen, who was also meant to be in a blue sedan.“In March 2020, the sentence review board (SRB) unanimously recommended the names of the 10 police officers for release. On Friday, after receiving an approval from the Union home ministry, the Delhi government’s home department issued an order,” said a prisons officer, asking not to be named.The case gained public attention at the time, becoming the subject of documentaries and films. The notoriety stemmed from the nature of the policemen’s actions: having realised that they killed the wrong people, the team planted weapons to show them as criminals. The day after the murders, the police held a press conference to claim a successful operation targeting gang members. Soon, the families of the victims began speaking up and the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). But, if the crime and the aftermath exposed the many flaws of India’s criminal justice system, the time the men spent behind bars and their conduct in this period may support the case for reformation of convicts.“What happened 23 years ago happened in the line of duty. It was such a bad coincidence that we spotted the vehicle of the same colour, at about the same time and in the same place. Maybe we would have been released sooner had we not tried to cover up our mistakes. But we were young then,” said Anil Kumar, who was then an inspector and was among the ten, after his release. “Life is about mistakes and correcting them. We spent more than 16 years behind bars. Spending even a night in prison is difficult. We saw what life is in prison. I will work for the underprivileged sections of the society. I have made this my aim to ensure that people do not suffer because they are poor”.Except for those convicted of terrorism or multiple murders, prisoners serving life terms are eligible for release after they have been behind bars for at least 14 years. The 10 policemen spent 16 of the last 23 years in Tihar jail, having secured bail while the case dragged on prior to their conviction in 2007.Unlike other cases relating to prisoners in Tihar, the release of the cops needed the Union home ministry’s nod, instead of the lieutenant governor’s as is usually the case. This is because cases investigated by CBI need to approved for early released by the central government. The 10 former police personnel were given good recommendations by the jail superintendent and the welfare officer, which helped their case, according to a second prisons official, asking not to be named. The most senior officer among the 10 -- former assistant commissioner of police SS Rathi -- studied law and later mastered in the subject. His then deputy Kumar helped prisoners with their cases using his knowledge of police work and started an in-house prisoner’s magazine, Tihar officials said. Former Delhi police’s additional commissioner Ashok Chand, who worked in police for over three decades, said: “I knew some members of the team. They were excellent officers who made a mistake in the line of duty. They paid for their mistake. The law has also taken its course. They have served their life imprisonment. It is time for them to move on.

26-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi chokes on particles as farm fires rage in Punjab and Haryana||Farm fires in Punjab and Haryana surged on Sunday, according to satellite data and authorities monitoring pollution, raising fears of the air quality in the National Capital Region deteriorating further from the “very poor” levels recorded in recent days.According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) in Delhi stood at 349 on Sunday, close to the 345 registered a day before. The number of farm fires spotted from satellites rose from around 911 on Saturday to 1,619 on Sunday, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa).Experts have said in recent days that the over 30 million people in NCR are largely left at the mercy of weather conditions. If the winds die down in the coming weeks, as they normally do, and the pollutants from farm fires have not cleared, the region could experience the sort of extreme pollution that has been seen in the last four years. “Stubble fires reduced on Saturday. There were about 940 fires in Punjab on Saturday, and a lower number of fires in UP and Haryana also. But the fires seem to have increased today,” said Vijay Soni, scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD air quality division).The highest number of farm fires spotted from satellites this season was 1,657 on Friday.Soni added that prevailing wind patterns are such that ultra-fine PM2.5 particles that are emitted as smoke from these fires are drifting in towards the Capital and adjoining areas. “Winds are northwesterly now, and they will remain the same for around a week,” he said, while adding that there could be a marginal improvement from Monday when winds are estimated to pick up. A second official agreed the wind patterns are bringing pollutants from the farm fires in. On Sunday, the wind speed was nearly 8 kmph, blowing from the north-west, bringing smoke from Punjab and Haryana, said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. “The weather conditions are likely to remain pretty similar on Monday, which means that even though we will get some wind, there will be no visible improvement in the air quality because the winds continue to carry smoke from Punjab and Haryana,” Srivastava said.Union ministry of earth sciences’ air monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) also predicted that any possible improvement that could have happened because of increased wind speed will be nullified by the incoming farm fire smoke. “AQI is predicted to remain in very poor range for the next two days but without further deterioration. SAFAR synergised stubble fire counts recorded a reduction and stands at 867 on Saturday. However, the boundary layer wind direction is north-westerly and wind speed is moderate. This will lead to an increase in pollutant transport towards the Delhi region and hence the SAFAR model estimate of stubble burning share in PM2.5 is 19% today (Sunday),” Safar air quality summary said. Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, Earth Sciences at the Science and Technology Institute (STI), Universities Space Research Association (USRA) said, “On Sunday, crop fires were seen clearly all over the state of Punjab. Not just the count the burning is also being reported from a larger area now.” Paddy farmers in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh set fire to stubble left after mechanised harvesting as a cheap and quick method to clear their fields. This year, with the rains having stopped sooner than usual, the farmers began harvesting early. “Harvesting of early paddy varieties is almost over. About 2% to 5% may be left. Rest are Basmati and other varieties which are not a problem as far as stubble is concerned. The stubble from Basmati is usually used as fodder. But it’s true that this year, a very high number of stubble fires were seen because farmers were extremely angry with the Centre on farm bills and this was a way to oppose the bills,” said Rattan Singh Mann, Haryana chief of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-chokes-on-particles-as-farm-fires-rage-in-punjab-and-haryana/story-JO4HXCnm7YaV5bXlydMNLP.html

26-10-2020||City||A year on, Zirakpur MC finally floats tenders for advertisements||After a gap of one year, the municipal council of Zirakpur will finally float a cluster tender for display of advertisements on unipoles and other outdoor advertising media on October 29. The cluster includes Zirakpur, Lalru, Dera Bassi and Banur.The contract of the agency called Degraphics, which was allotted the tender in 2016 for a period of three years at a cost of ₹2.06 crore for three years, had expired in September 2019. The council had, however, extended it till June 30, 2020, and again by four weeks.MC executive officer Sandeep Tiwari said, “We have got the approval from the local bodies department and we will be floating the tenders on October 29. We have also started a drive to remove illegal hoarding from the township.” As per the new Punjab Outdoor Policy, 2018, every corporation and council has been directed to publish new tenders to generate revenue from advertisements.There are several illegal hoardings erected on the highway, but no effective drive has been conducted for the last two years. In 1995, the Punjab and Haryana high court had issued directions to all deputy commissioners to have illegal hoardings on national as well as state highways removed, saying that not only were they eyesores, they also diverted the attention of motorists leading to fatal accidents. Since then, the court has issued several reminders in this regard, but no action has been taken by the authorities concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-year-on-zirakpur-mc-finally-floats-tenders-for-advertisements/story-ZM7EbsNXIz4yngFgTp7n4O.html
26-10-2020||City||Dussehra a muffled affair in Mohali||The Dussehra ground in Phase 8, Mohali, wore a deserted look on Sunday, which would otherwise become a traffic management problem every year.The Dussehra committee performed a prayer on the ground and effigies of 2-feet were erected. The grounds in Phase 1-6 and 9 were also deserted.Mohali Dussehra and Ramlila committee organiser Madhu Bhushan said, “We were not able to call expert artisans for making the effigies as there were delays in permission from the administration. We call expert artisans from Saharanpur or Moradabad 10 days before Ramlila begins.”A Ravana effigy named ‘Corona’ went up in flames at Dera Bassi and Kharar on Sunday, but there were no spectators.However, small effigies were privately torched at many housing societies, but without any crackers.In Bhabat village of Zirakpur, Shri Sanatan Dharam Ramlila Club celebrated Dussehra with fanfare. Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma and senior Congress leader Deepinder Singh Dhillon were the chief guests. Police were deployed by the administration on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dussehra-a-muffled-affair-in-mohali/story-hK4KQlbhZzcuCpdSJc0jsL.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||3rd day of 4k+ cases in Delhi; Positivity rate past 8%||The positivity rate for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has started rising again in Delhi with 8.43% samples tested in the past 24 hours coming back positive, and new infections crossing the 4,000-mark for the third consecutive day as the resurgence of the viral outbreak in the Capital continued to worsen.Daily positivity rate — the fraction of tests that return positive – touched the highest in 34 days, sending the weekly average positivity rate rising again. Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with an increase new cases, indicates that the virus is spreading fast.Cases, meanwhile, also continued to rise at an alarming rate – a total of 4,136 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Sunday, the highest single-day rise in infections in Delhi in 38 days, taking the total number infections in the Capital to 356,656. This rise in cases as well as the positivity rate is particularly worrisome because it comes right at the start of the festive season – a time of the year when people in the city tend to more socially active.The rising graph of cases in the city -- days after it was starting to come under control -- is being attributed to more people coming out of their homes in the festive season, and poor mask discipline and lack of adherence to safety protocols due to Covid fatigue.The seven-day average positivity rate is now at 6.84% and has been rising for the 13 consecutive days and is at its highest in nearly a month (it was 6.95% on September 27). This number was 5.88% the week before, and 5.49% the week before that.According to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control there. Delhi has never dropped below this threshold. The lowest the average positivity rate dropped in Delhi was for the week ending October 8 when it touched 5.34%, but has been rising again since.The seven-day average of daily cases, also known as the case trajectory, has also seen a strong upward trend for the third time since the start of the pandemic in Delhi. It has now has been rising for 13 straight days – it has risen from 2,661 on October 12 to 3,663 on Friday – highlighting a clear trend in rise in new infections.The Delhi government, however, said the situation is “contained” because they have prepared hospital beds and Covid facilities in the city to prepare for a larger surge during the winter.“The Covid-19 expert committee led by [Niti Aayog member] Dr VK Paul had said that due to cold and festive season, cases [per day] can spike up to 12,000-14,000, but right now it’s around 4000 so the situation is contained. We are focused on containment, contact tracing and isolation to tackle the situation. Hence, no relaxation in restrictions unless the vaccine arrives. Masks and social distancing absolutely mandatory. We will continue taking strict precautions,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/3rd-day-of-4k-cases-in-delhi-positivity-rate-past-8/story-B8reY6G47MnG9hjzfr6Q9J.html
26-10-2020||Chandigarh||Gurlal Brar murder: Aide of man who supplied motorcycle to shooters arrested||Probing into the murder of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi’s close aide Gurlal Brar outside a city mall on October 10, Chandigarh Police made another arrest on Sunday.The accused, Gurmeet Singh, alias Geeta, 25, is an aide of Gurvinder Singh, alias Dhadi, 23, who was the first to be arrested in the case on October 21. A member of the Davinder Bambiha gang, Gurmeet, along with Gurvinder, had provided the motorcycle used by the shooters to gun down Brar, 26, outside a mall in Industrial Area, Phase 1. Both hail from Rurki Pukhta village in Kharar, Mohali.Following his arrest on October 21, Gurwinder had told the police about Gurmeet’s involvement. He was nabbed from the Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Sector 43 while trying to escape the city, and will be produced in a court on Monday.According to police, Gurmeet was lodged in Nabha jail in an attempt to murder case where he met active members of the Davinder Bambiha gang. He used to cook for them, clean their dishes and wash their clothes. Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, who is running the Bambiha gang, had asked Gurmeet and Gurvinder to provide a motorcycle with a fake number plate to the shooters, Neeraj Chaska and Mani.Police said Gurmeet, himself a drug addict, also sold drugs. So, he was assured by Gaurav of 20gm heroin in exchange for the motorcycle. Gaurav was also going to provide him money to visit Gurdwara Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra.Gurmeet is already facing attempt to murder, NDPS and rioting cases in Kharar and Kurali going back to 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gurlal-brar-murder-aide-of-man-who-supplied-motorcycle-to-shooters-arrested/story-X2aZG96Wn8Hb3GcwjuQGfN.html
26-10-2020||Chandigarh||Dussehra celebrated with prayers, small effigies in Chandigarh||Due to difficulty in getting permissions and the challenges posed by the pandemic, the city celebrated Dussehra this year in a different vein, with people turning to prayers rather than burning effigies.President of the Chandigarh Kendriya Ramleela Mahasabha, Bhagwati Prashad Gaur, said, “Even though no Ramlila committee set up effigies this year, the stage was still kept occupied and aarti was performed. A 24-hour pooja to honour Lord Ram was carried out on Dussehra to mark the end of Navratri.”The Youth Welfare Club of Maloya was the only association to have permission to organise a Dussehra function, but they instead chose to take out a rath yatra. President Sobhit Kaushal said, “The yatra started at 3pm and we took a round around Maloya dressed in our festive garb. We followed all instructions by the administration for everyone’s safety.”Ashok Chaudhary, adviser of the Joint Ram Leela Sangh, who plays the character of Ravana in the Sector 20 Ramlila, said that despite the lockdown the actors had a lot of fun and the audience also enjoyed it.On Sunday evening, children in some areas had made their own effigies of Ravana, and the sound of crackers could be heard in the city even though no large functions were organised anywhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dussehra-celebrated-with-prayers-small-effigies-in-chandigarh/story-pwPR2l0VMJ3FOZMiU6APsO.html
26-10-2020||Chandigarh||With no big effigies on fire, Chandigarh breathes easy this Dussehra||As no major effigy burning functions were organised in the city on Dussehra, the city’s air quality index (AQI) during the festival fared better than the last year.Against the AQI of 147 on October 8, when Dussehra was celebrated last year, on Sunday, the figure was 122, as recorded at the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) in Sector 25. Both figures fall in the ‘moderate’ bracket. The air quality is measured through the AQI. Lesser the AQI count, better the air quality. An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe. AQI up to 100 can cause minor breathing discomfort among sensitive people, while that up to 300 can cause breathing discomfort among patients of lung and heart diseases. AQI between 301 and 500 is considered hazardous.According to officials of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), the AQI remained around 120 throughout the past week.“This time, Dussehra was held a bit late as compared to previous years. By October end, the city’s AQI usually shoots past 200. However, this year, despite the cooler weather, it remained around 120 for a week, which is a big achievement,” said Debendra Dalai, vice-president, CPCC.Last year on Dussehra, AQI had reached 149, followed by 206 on October 25. It had peaked to 335 in the first week of November 2019 after Diwali celebrations on October 27.Pandemic also had a positive impactDalai said apart from the subdued Dussehra celebrations, the pandemic also played a part in cleaner air. “Normal life hasn’t resumed completely, keeping vehicular emissions lower than usual. Even though AQI generally rises with drop in temperature, a green Diwali can help keep it low this year,” he added.Meanwhile, officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said there was no rain on the cards. So, if the AQI starts getting worse, it will take some time to return back to normal as rain helped clean the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-no-big-effigies-on-fire-chandigarh-breathes-easy-this-dussehra/story-rMo9oQnK55rbn1UZwWXDqI.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: In pandemic, a new beginning||This is how it was before the coronavirus pandemic: The walls had seen so many shifts of seasons that it would have been impossible to determine their original colour. The wood of the closets had been softened by time. The door looked like a precious collectible making one wonder why it hadn’t yet been stolen.Founded within a corner of an old mansion in 1938, the one-room Premier Shoe Factory in Gurugram’s Sadar Bazar was arguably the most curious shoemaker’s establishment in the entire Delhi region. Everything looked shabby but also looked beautiful — and the shoes were always new and gleaming. Ruling over this little world was the frail Jawaharlal Sherawat, quietly rustling out one shoe after another.As the coronavirus reached our part of the world, and as the ensuing lockdown forced many businesses to shut down, one could legitimately worry about the well-being of the shoemaking shop and of its owner. The infection can be lethal to the elderly and Mr Sherawat is in his 70s — could he still hold on to his establishment? It had been founded by his father, but lately he was the only one running it, his children having picked up other professions. Was there any way for the legacy to go on?As it happens, the shoe place as we knew it vanished. But this weekday afternoon, Mr Sherawat is still here, busy making shoes. It’s all looking very different, though. Gone are the familiar walls and the wooden closets. The world is looking like as if it were created just this morning. “My advocate son got the shop renovated during the lockdown,” Mr Sherawat mutters, as casually as if he was talking of the weather.The floor is now cushioned with a red carpet, and the walls are painted white. The shoes are stacked on gleaming glass racks, and a red plastic chair stands instead of the weather-beaten one. As for the old door, it is still there but has been painted white too, and hints nothing of its earlier past. The elderly owner is sitting, as always, on the floor. His rusty black century-old Singer sewing machine has remained, and so has his made-in-Germany equipments.Mr Sherawat has been in this trade since he was 15. Today, he must be one of the Delhi region’s oldest surviving shoe makers — if not the oldest one — to have worked continuously for decades, and even during the ongoing pandemic.That the old shop not only outlived the lockdown but also exploited the difficult period to reinvent itself fills one with positivity. Indeed, it is a rare place, for which the coronavirus has been a portal to bright beginnings. You ought to visit it for inspiration, and to personally see how boldly and optimistically it is coping with the times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-pandemic-a-new-beginning/story-L5lRYLM6ADrEytH9THecXP.html
26-10-2020||Chandigarh||Trash piles up in Chandigarh as garbage collectors’ strike enters Day 3||With no headway in talks between the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) and door-to-door garbage collectors, heaps of trash were seen at Sehaj Safai Kendras across the city on Sunday, which marked the third day of sanitation workers’ strike. Most of the city’s sectors and rural areas have been affected as the protesting garbage collectors enforced the withdrawal of services with more severity. Even as residents dumped their household garbage in safai kendras, sanitation workers, who are agitating under the banner of Safai Karamchari Union, didn’t clean those up. In some areas, there were complaints about people discarded trash in parks, parking and back lanes.“The problem is getting acute in some areas, while at many places, people are cooperating with each other. But, the state of safai kendras is getting worse with each passing day as nobody is clearing it of garbage,” said Col (retd) Gursewak Singh, adviser, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC).On Saturday, the meeting between MC officials led by municipal commissioner KK Yadav and garbage collectors’ unions had ended in a deadlock. The protesting sanitation workers and garbage collectors have threatened to step up their protest from Monday against the MC for not accepting their demands.Om Prakash Saini, president of Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society, said, “The MC is working against the interests of the garbage collectors and sanitation workers. Not long ago had they called us corona warriors for our dedicated work during the peak of pandemic. But now, they are ready to bring in our replacements at DC rates.”Fresh round of talks between civic body officials and MC sanitation committee headed by former mayor Rajesh Kalia are also expected on Monday. “It is an indefinite strike which will continue till the MC accepts our demands. If municipal officials ask us to meet them on Monday, we will surely oblige,” Saini said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/trash-piles-up-as-chandigarh-garbage-collectors-strike-enters-day-3/story-FDfSiA1AYbQL3xfX8T6PVN.html
26-10-2020||Chandigarh||Govt lab technician shot at outside his house in Chandigarh’s Sector 22||A 48-year-old man was shot in the right leg right outside his house in Sector 22-D on Sunday morning.The victim, Amrik Singh, was returning home from a local gurdwara when a youth, who seemed to be in his 20s, shot at him and fled on foot.Amrik, who works as a lab technician for the Punjab health department in Kharar, told the police that he visited the gurdwara around 5am and started walking back home at 6.10am. As he reached home, a youth, who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, shorts and a face mask, shot at him. Hearing the onlookers raising the alarm, the shooter fled the spot.Amrik was rushed to PGIMER, where he is stated to be stable.A live cartridge and a used cartridge were recovered from the spot. Locals said the unidentified youth had been waiting for Amrik.Superintendent of police (SP, City) Vineet Kumar visited the spot after the police were informed. So far, investigators have not established the motive behind the firing.They said there was no CCTV camera near the spot. “Since the suspect was masked, it will be hard to track him,” an official said. The incident happened right besides an outpost for a security guard. However, he wasn’t present there when Amrik was shot at.A case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act was registered against the unidentified accused at the Sector 17 police station. Had recently recovered from CovidWhile Singh was undergoing treatment at PGIMER, his son, Jashanjot Singh, paced outside their house in Sector 22-D, answering calls from worried relatives and friends.“My father had recently recovered from Covid. But, he will come through this just like he did with the virus,” he said. His father will undergo a surgery on Monday to remove the bullet from his thigh.According to his son, Amrik, a devout Sikh, visits the Sector 22 gurdwara everyday before 6am when the prayers start. He did the same on Sunday and was targeted by the shooter on his way back. “Our family has no enmity with anyone. It’s unfathomable why my father was attacked,” Jashanjot said.FOURTH SHOOTING IN OCTOBEROctober 10: Gangster Lawrence Bishnoi’s close aide and former SOPU leader Gurlal Brar was shot dead in his car in Industrial Area, Phase 1 on October 10October 11: Three shots were fired outside EskoBar Club in Sector 9 during a fight between two groups.

26-10-2020||Election:||Bihar campaign reaches fever pitch as first phase draws near||Chief minister Nitish Kumar lashed out at dynastic politics on Sunday in an apparent reference to the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), training his guns on the main rival of his coalition government on the penultimate day of the campaign for the first phase of assembly elections in Bihar on October 28.“For others, wife, son, daughter...are the families, but to me, the whole Bihar is my family,” Nitish Kumar said at a public rally in Phulparas constituency. “Serving people is my duty,” he said.He reminded the audience of the situation that prevailed in Bihar before 2005, when the RJD was in power. “Bihar was in a pathetic situation. A lot of crime happened here. The development rate was almost zero.” He added, referring to his Janata Dal (United), or JD (U): “We controlled everything. We kept saying right from the beginning we’ll go on the path of progress with justice.” He asked young people who were raising slogans against him to ask their parents about the situation in Bihar before 2005. “One could dare to go out after sunset. We improved law and order,” he said.. The reference to dynastic politics was clearly aimed at the RJD, whose chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is the chief ministerial face of the party this time. Prasad’s wife Rabri Devi was also chief minister for five years until 2005. Another rival of his is Chirag Paswan, son of the late Ram Vilas Paswan, founder of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) , who has pulled the party out of the National Democratic Alliance in Bihar citing ideological differences with the Bihar chief minister. “We have worked against crime, corruption and communalism and tried to create an atmosphere of brotherhood and harmony in Bihar. We believe in the development of every section,” Nitish Kumar said.“Women are getting their due respect. There was no female participation in public representation. We provided them a platform and a chance... Development is not possible unless women get the opportunity to work shoulder to shoulder {with men}. Furthermore, we have done a lot for women’s upliftment,” he said. Tejashwi Yadav was to address a dozen public meetings on Sunday, but had to restrict himself to six when his helicopter developed a technical glitch. Addressing a public meeting in Islampur, in the home district of Nitish Kumar, Yadav said: “Nitish Kumar has become energy-less, conservative and narrow-minded. He is questioning how I will provide jobs.” Yadav has promised a million government jobs to Bihar’s young if the alliance between his RJD, the Congress and three Left parties is voted to power. LJP president Chirag Paswan,who addressed meetings in Sitamarhi, said that if voted to power his party will construct a temple for the goddess Sita in the district that will be bigger than the Ram temple being built in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. “Lord Ram is incomplete without goddess Sita, and vice versa. So, a corridor connecting Ayodhya’s Ram Temple and Sitamarhi should be constructed,” Paswan said. Paswan, who also campaigned in Karagahar and Chenari in Rohtas district on Sunday, said the next government in the state will be “Nitish-mukt” (Nitish Kumar-free) . “I request you to please vote for LJP candidates to implement #Bihar1stBihari1st. Everywhere else vote for the BJP. The coming government will be a #Nitish-free government,” Paswan tweeted in Hindi.At Sheikhpura, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party president Upendra Kushwaha addressed a joint rally. Owaisi criticised the amended citizenship law and the proposed National Register of Citizens; Kushwaha said Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar had pushed Bihar back 30 years during their combined spells in power. “Assam is a case in point. As many as 20 lakh people don’t find themselves in the NRC list there. Out of which only 5 lakhs are Muslims, the rest 15 lakhs are Hindus,” said Owaisi, adding that the government should instead focus on education, employment and health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-campaign-reaches-fever-pitch-as-first-phase-draws-near/story-HvV3IAAPhOLWO0vLVBsAeI.html
26-10-2020||Chandigarh||Six Chandigarh cops suspended for Friday night’s violent brawl||Two days after police teams from the crime branch and Sector 26 station came to blows, leaving two cops injured, three police personnel from each team were suspended on Sunday. Those suspended include inspector Satvinder Singh, sub-inspector (SI) Neeraj and constable Sanjay, deputed with the crime branch of Chandigarh Police, and SI Navin Kumar, constable Kavipal and constable Sompal, all posted at the Sector-26 station. Inspector Satvinder and SI Navin are batchmates.Considering his injuries, no action has been taken against ASI Ramesh Hodd, who had suffered a fracture in the fight that took place in Sector 26. He was stationed at a check post and had intervened after noticing the commotion.Show-cause notice to team leaders The department has also issued show-cause notice to inspector Harinder Singh Sekhon, in-charge, crime branch, and inspector Narinder Patial, station house officer (SHO), Sector 26 police station. “They have been issued notices to explain why the matter was not handled maturely and the policemen were allowed to indulge in such unruly behaviour that has come as a major embarrassment for the force,” said a senior police official.The teams were out to catch “suspicious elements” moving in the city when they had come to blows on Friday night. Besides ASI Hodd, inspector Satvinder had also suffered a hairline fracture on the nose in the melee. Initially, senior officials tried to pass it off as an incident of “manhandling” due to “miscommunication” as the crime branch team was in civvies. But, a report on the incident was sought, which prompted action against the six cops. “We will not tolerate indiscipline. So, all policemen involved in the fight from both the teams have been suspended,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. “Show-cause notices have also been issued to the crime branch in-charge and Sector 26 SHO for explanation on how the matter went out of control,” he added.The brawl has once again brought to fore a long-standing tussle and “credit war” between the crime branch and police stations in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/six-chandigarh-cops-suspended-for-friday-night-s-violent-brawl/story-T0YWPiyxUNwKkf3dWoExkM.html

26-10-2020||Chandigarh||Sensory park for people with disabilities to come up at Sector 22||A special park will come up in Sector 22, which will focus on sensory engagement and be designed to encourage people of all abilities to play together, especially children. The project is being anchored by the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) and its board of directors will be presented with the final plan on October 27 for the approval.“The board will also finalise its location. Earlier, it was planned in Sector 35, but after failing to obtain approval from the UT administration, the location was shifted to Sector 22,” said NP Sharma, chief general manager, CSCL. The sensory park, which would come up at a cost of ₹2 crore, will boast of features that address multiple aspects of an individual, including mobility disability, motor skills, hearing and speech disability, cognitive disability, and intellectual skill disorders.The purpose of this initiative is to provide individual and combined sensory opportunities to users who may not normally experience them. “It will contain features that are accessible to the disabled individuals, such as scented and edible plants, tactile sculptures and sculpted handrails, water features designed to make sound and play over the hands, textured touch-pads, magnifying glass screens, braille signages and audio induction loop descriptions,” Sharma said.Depending on the user group, other provisions may further integrate sound and music more centrally to combine the requirement of younger users with their sensory needs.“At first glance, a sensory playground looks similar to an everyday playground. However, there are some key differences and considerations for such a facility,” Sharma added. A fenced-in playground will be constructed to prevent kids from wandering due to over-stimulation. “The floor will be specially prepared to protect children with autism. Impact-ready surfaces will be introduced that can soften a fall as children with autism have a tendency to climb higher or take riskier paths that could lead to falls,” the chief general manager said. Quiet spaces of refuge, such as grassy areas, domes, niches or playhouse, will also be created in the park. Adequate gaps between equipment will be provided to prevent children from running into each other and giving kids with mental disabilities their space.“Games a child can play himself or herself, such as learning/engaging panels, will be a part of equipment. These could include labyrinth, chimes, kaleidoscope, mirror, clock panels, variety of shapes and colours and music wall,” Sharma said.What’s special about this facility Fenced-in playground to prevent kids from wandering due to over-stimulationImpact-ready surfaces that can soften a fallQuiet areas of refugeAdequate space between equipmentLearning/engaging panelsLabyrinth, chimes, kaleidoscope, mirror, clock panels, variety of shapes and colours, music wallSENSORY FEATURESScented and edible plantsTactile sculptures, sculpted handrailsTextured touch-padsBraille signs and audio induction loop descriptions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sensory-park-for-people-with-disabilities-to-come-up-at-sector-22/story-dVsZl3GmvMUJkWNgJDxmvJ.html
26-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP’s interest lies in toppling govts: Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for being only “interested in toppling governments” and said that his former ally should rather focus on improving the economy.Addressing the Sena’s annual Dussehra rally, Thackeray said, “World over the economy is disrupted and during such a time, if BJP is interested in toppling governments instead of paying attention to the country’s economy, then I think, we are inviting anarchy.” The CM dared the BJP to topple his 11-month-old government and advised the Centre to protect its own government first. “If your foundation stone has weakened, you have no culture, no thoughts, then such a government will not last for long. I challenge you to topple our government but first protect your government. Because one-day people will look beyond you and say anybody is fine but not you. This thought has already started,” Thackeray said in a veiled attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Shiv Sena parted ways from its three-decade old ally, BJP, and formed government in Maharashtra by joining hands with Nationalist Congress Party and Congress in November last year after assembly polls. The Sena chief also slammed the BJP for indulging in politics during Covid-19 pandemic. “Despite Covid-19, the governments are being toppled in the country... give at least some attention to the country as it is going to the nether world.” Thackeray also hot out at BJP over Goods and Services Tax issue, Sushant Singh Rajput case and party’s free vaccine promise in Bihar assembly polls. State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye alleged that Thackeray had nothing to highlight about his government’s functioning. “We expected that Uddhav Thackeray will speak about his government’s performance... but he spent his entire speech criticizing central government and the BJP. He does not have anything to narrate even before his party workers,” he said in a series of tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-s-interest-lies-in-toppling-govts-uddhav-thackeray/story-lYunTfDdWlIf1IhLdKAv7O.html
26-10-2020||City||Minister Sidhu lays foundation stone of cattle pound in Balongi||Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Sunday laid the foundation stone of a cattle pound set to come up on 10 acres leased by gram panchayat of Balongi. Member of Parliament (MP) Manish Tewari, Mohali SSP Satinder Singh, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary And Animal Sciences University (Gadvasu) vice-chancellor Dr Inderjit, and Swami Chinnamya Nand and Swami Gurkripa Nand of Kamadhenu gaushala, Noormahal, were among those present on the occasion. Sidhu, who is also Mohali MLA, said that ‘Bal Gopal Gau Basera’ will be built in lines with modern cattle pounds for which expert advice would be sought. “Stray animals will be kept and cared for in appropriate conditions with separate enclosures for healthy and sick animals. Cattle breeding will be undertaken with the advice of experts,” he added. Sidhu said that a special place for stray dogs would also be set up in the cow shelter. “After the completion of pound, there would be no problem of housing stray animals in the city,” the minister said. He thanked all Mohali industrialists who came forward to share the construction and operational cost of the project, and the Balongi gram panchayat for leasing 10 acres for 33 years. MP Tewari said that setting up of a cattle pound was a commendable step “by the people of Mohali, for the people of Mohali”. It will be a cow shelter of its kind in Punjab, he said and added that other gaushala operators will also seek guidance from this state-of-the-art facility. While Swami Chinnamya Nand shared detailed information about the care of cows, Gadvasu V-C Dr Inderjit spoke about the breeding and care of animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minister-sidhu-lays-foundation-stone-of-cattle-pound-in-balongi/story-pXMgmo1ZkPJ42vHUzjIeGL.html

He at times would organise camps in schools.During the lockdown, Kumar organised a small library in his minivan, filled with books and writing materials collected from various houses, and started visiting slums and colonies to help students in need. He also gave away masks and sanitary napkins along with study materials. The motto of his foundation is ‘education from trash’.Kumar has collected about 40,000 books in the last three years and distributed almost 10,000 books to the children in the area during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-based-social-worker-finds-mention-in-pm-s-mann-ki-baat/story-hcTNFfyWAJoT55y1LfxmaJ.html

With results for the state common entrance test (CET) yet to be announced and a petition against the implementation of the Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBC) Act that mandates 12-13% reservation for the Maratha community still being heard at the Supreme Court, engineering college heads feel that the November 30 deadline given by AICTE for admissions might be difficult to meet. “Due to the prolonged emergent conditions in the country and requests from various state governments and looking at the ongoing admissions, the council has extended last date of admissions for first-year engineering courses (undergraduate and diploma lateral entry) to November 30. Accordingly, classes of the first year will commence on December 1, 2020,” states the circular released by AICTE last week. “The entire admission process, which includes the registration process as well as the seat allotment rounds, takes at least four to five weeks. However, the process can’t start unless there’s clarity in the status of reservation for admissions,” said the principal of a Pune-based private engineering institute. While CET exams were conducted in the first week of October, the state government decided to hold another session of the entrance exam for those students who could not attempt the paper in the first session either because they had contracted Covid-19 or were living at a quarantine zone. Registrations for the second phase ended recently and the exam will be held soon. “If the state and central government work together, it might be possible to finish the admissions process within a month to ensure that the new academic year begins on December 1 for the new batch. But it all depends on the fate of the SEBC Act in court,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal, Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/engineering-institutes-in-maharashtra-fear-sebc-quota-verdict-cet-results-may-delay-admissions-for-first-year-courses/story-bfAQKiPhMg0zDCurOt3fEL.html
26-10-2020||City||NCP leader Eknath Khadse attacks Devendra Fadnavis again over his daughter’s defeat in Maharashtra Assembly polls||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse, who recently quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has again hit out at former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis for his daughter Rohini’s defeat in the Assembly election last year. He also alleged that those who “betrayed” him had the backing of the party leadership at a higher level, as no action was taken against them. Khadse had on Friday, too, squarely blamed Fadnavis for his decision to quit the BJP and said that he has no grievances against any other state or central-level leaders of the party, which he had served for four decades. On Sunday, while addressing his former Assembly constituency Muktainagar on the occasion of Dussehra, Khadse renewed his attack on his former colleague.“I was denied candidature by the party leadership during the Assembly elections, and just to create a rift between me and my daughter, it was offered to her. She had never asked for any ticket. Later, party workers whom I had mentored were used to defeat my daughter Rohini. I had submitted videos and CDs as proof against the betrayers, but no action was taken against them. Not even a notice was sent out to them. This shows that they had the backing of party leadership. Fadnavis, who was the then CM and controlled the party affairs, was behind all this,” he said. Khadse said that he had experienced “political exile” in the BJP and added that had he not quit the party, he, too, would have been sent to “political banishment” like many senior leaders at national level.Meanwhile, Fadnavis has refused to comment on the allegations. Last week, when Khadse had hurled allegations at Fadnavis, the former CM said that the newly-inducted NCP leader was making him a villain and that he would speak at an appropriate time. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that Fadnavis had in the past replied to all the allegations made against him. State leaders tried to end my political career: Pankaja Munde BJP national secretary Pankaja Munde on Sunday said that a leader from her district Beed and some others from Maharashtra are conspiring to finish her politically. “A corona-infected leader from [Beed] district and some infected leaders from the state are conspiring to make me the ‘Abhimanyu’ of politics, but they perhaps do not know that I have excelled the skill of exiting the chakravyuh,” Munde said while referring to the character from Mahabharat. She was addressing a virtual rally on the occasion of Dussehra from Bhagwangarh in Beed. Munde said that like his father, late Gopinath Munde, she too, will hold a grand rally at Mumbai’s Shivaji Park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-attacks-devendra-fadnavis-again-over-his-daughter-s-defeat-in-maharashtra-assembly-polls/story-Xb3O7i56A21Q5U2y7RhB9I.html
26-10-2020||Mumbai||Our Hindutva is not about clanging bells, utensils: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray attacks BJP at Sena’s Dussehra rally in Mumbai||Launching a blistering attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, during his speech at his first Dussehra rally after becoming the chief minister, advised his ally-turned-foe to protect their government as the mood of the people was turning against the Centre and that people would accept any alternative to the BJP. At the event held at Savarkar Memorial in Shivaji Park, Thackeray took on the BJP on several issues ranging from Hindutva, governance, Goods and Services Tax (GST) system, political mudslinging and personal attacks on his family and the Shiv Sena. A total of 50 people, including Thackeray family members, party ministers, leaders, MPs, legislators were present. “If your foundation stone has weakened, you have no culture, thoughts… nothing, then such a government will not last long. I again challenge you to topple our government, but first protect your government. Because one day, people will look beyond you and say anybody will be fine, but not you. This thought has already started,” Thackeray said.“World over, the economy is disrupted and during such a time, if the BJP is interested in toppling governments instead of paying attention to the country’s economy, then I think, we are inviting anarchy…”Thackeray slammed the BJP for questioning the Shiv Sena’s Hindutva. He said his father Balasaheb Thackeray’s Hindutva was not “clanging bells and utensils”. Thackeray’s sharp comment came after a standoff with Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who questioned the chief minister’s stance on ‘Hindutva’ after he did not allow the reopening of religious places in the state. Thackeray quoted Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech on Sunday morning in Nagpur and in an indirect reference to Koshyari said that the RSS chief’s followers do not understand the meaning of Hindutva. “Those who wear black caps on their head agree with what the Bhagwat has said about Hindutva in his speech or not… RSS chief said there are people who are creating doubts on Hindu, Hindutva and Hindu Rashtra. Who are these people? Do you know? Where do they live? ‘Hindutva this term has been made narrow by associating it with pooja’. Why don’t you reopen the temples? Have you abandoned Hindutva, become secular… Our Hindutva is not narrow, is comprehensive,” he said. Thackeray and Koshyari were at loggerheads recently over opening of temples through exchange of letters between them over the issue. The governor had questioned if Thackeray had turned ‘secular’ and it had stirred controversy after the letter got public. “They say my Hindutva is different from that of Balasaheb Thackeray. Your Hindutva is about clanging bells and utensils, our Hindutva is not like that. Those questioning our Hindutva now were hiding with tail between their legs when Babri mosque was demolished,” said Thackeray, referring to tasks given by PM Modi during the lockdown. Referring to actor Kangana Ranaut’s remarks comparing Mumbai to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, Thackeray said those who come to Mumbai for livelihood are abusing Mumbai by comparing it with PoK. “You are able to put your foot in PoK. But, if a PoK is being created in a country that is ruled by Modi, then it is the failure of PM and is not of the state,” he said. Thackeray asked PM Modi to accept the failure of the goods and services tax (GST) system and rectify it and appealed to chief ministers of all other States to get together and revert to old taxation system if new tax system cannot be rectified. The Centre owes ₹38,000 crore in GST compensation dues to Maharashtra. “We are not getting our rightful GST dues and everyone (other non-BJP state governments) is complaining about it. The country is not a property that belongs to one political party.” Thackeray backed the Mumbai Police and said it would have found out if there was any wrongdoing in the suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, without naming the actor. On the portrayal of the lawlessness in the state and use of drugs, Thackeray said he is proud of Mumbai and Maharashtra Police as it is the only force that has caught a terrorist alive. “He might have become Bihar’s son suddenly, but you started mudslinging on Maharashtra’s sons? On Maharashtra government, Thackeray family and on Aaditya [Thackeray]... You cannot do anything as we are clean,” said Thackeray, on the conspiracy theories following the actor’s death by suicide. Targeting the BJP for promising free Covid-19 vaccination in election manifesto in Bihar, Thackeray said, “You are talking about giving free vaccines in Bihar. Is the rest of the country Pakistan or Bangladesh or Kazakistan? Those speaking like that should be ashamed of themselves. You are the central government.” Thackeray also asked if BJP has turned secular by allying with Nitish Kumar or has the latter turned pro-Hindutva. “We expected that Uddhav Thackeray will speak about his government’s performance in last one year, but he spent his entire speech criticizing central government and the BJP. He does not have anything to narrate even before his party workers,” said Keshav Upadhye, chief spokesperson, Maharashtra BJP, said in a series of tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/our-hindutva-is-not-about-clanging-bells-and-utensils-maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-attacks-bjp-at-dussehra-rally-in-mumbai/story-x4r4D5uzEZo0TzOSKMHuSK.html

26-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees lowest Covid-19 death toll since June 18||Maharashtra on Sunday reported its lowest one-day Covid-19 death toll since June 18 (in 129 days) as 112 fatalities took the count to 43,264. The state also reported 6,059 new infections, taking the tally to 1,645,020.Mumbai, which crossed the 10,000 mark for deaths two days ago, remained on top, in terms of mortalities, with 46 more deaths taking the toll to 10,105. Following Mumbai; Pune and Nagpur reported nine and six deaths, respectively, on Sunday. Out of 36 districts and 27 cities, 35 districts and cities did not report any death in the past 24 hours. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state, however, remained at 2.63%. An official from the health department said the lower number of cases and deaths is also because of holidays for the heath machinery for the past two days.Maharashtra’s CFR has, however, been hovering around 2.65%, when it has been dropping significantly at the national level and in some other states. From 3.24% on August 25, it dropped to 2.67% on September 26 and 2.63% on Sunday.Pune district clocked the second-highest number of cases, 651 (298 in city, 203 rural parts and 150 in Pimpri-Chichwad), after Mumbai. Nagpur added 396 infections, Sangli 433 and Nashik 194. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) remained the highest contributor to the state’s tally with 36.47% or 2,210 cases. The recovery rate, however, improved to 88.8%, after 5,648 patients were reported to have recovered on Sunday, taking the tally of recoveries to 1,460,755. The number of active patients dropped to 140,486, including 25,110 in Pune, 21,950 in Thane.“The CFR is highest in Mumbai as the cases from neighbouring cities are referred here due to the high standard health infrastructure. In some of the rural parts, the health infrastructure is still poor, leading to the deaths. The tracking of the contacts of the infected people has reduced and this has been resulting in late referral of patients to health facilities. Patients coming on 3rd or 4th day of symptoms leads to the high CFR,” said an official from health department, requesting anonymity.The daily caseload of infection has been steadily coming down over past four weeks, taking it to the level of cases reported in August. In first 25 days of October, 260,574 cases and 6602 deaths have been reported, against 508,216 cases and 10,178 deaths between September 1 and 25. In August, 281,705 cases and 7,800 deaths were reported in 25 days. Dr Sanjay Pattivar, public health consultant, has a word of caution. He said that if the daily caseload remained at low till November 15, we can say that downward trend has begun. “We will have to wait for at least two incubation cycles of 14 days each to assess if the unlocking measures, festive season have led to spread of infection. It is true that for last four weeks, the infections are on a decline, but people should not let their guard down. It may lead to a rise in infections. At least half the citizens on the street do not follow the Covid-19 protocol and norms of personal hygiene. Government should launch a campaign to create awareness about importance of these things,” he said.60,891 tests were conducted in 24 hours at a positivity rate of 9.95%, against the overall positivity rate of 19.11%. The has 2,518,016 people under home quarantine and 13,572 under institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-lowest-covid-19-death-toll-since-june-18/story-fQPYflbnI0uIV8mdBCXW0J.html
26-10-2020||Noida||Stubble burning continues in Greater Noida villages, air quality deteriorates to near severe||Noida: Even as some areas of Gautam Budh Nagar choked on ‘severe’ air quality on Sunday, stubble burning continues unabated in rural pockets of Noida, despite curbs.Several large mounds of stubble were set afire late Saturday on the agriculture field along the Yamuna Expressway near Jewar and Rabupura areas, with officials yet to inspect the areas. According to experts, instances of stubble burning are set to increase towards the first week of November, when paddy harvesting is in its last stage.Meanwhile, officials of the Uttar Pradesh agriculture department – which is responsible for checking stubble burning and acting against violators – said they will look into the matter and will visit the spot to ascertain the scale of burning, and take action.“We will get the said area checked and act against violators. We are vigilant about stubble burning and are aiming to minimise and discourage it. We act on the basis of satellite images and receive the reports on a daily basis, which contains coordinates of the suspected area that shows high light or fire intensity. A local official is sent to inspect the suspected area and based on the confirmation, penalties are imposed,” said Manveer Singh, deputy director, agriculture, Gautam Budh Nagar.He added that so far, one FIR has been registered against a farmer in Dankaur for alleged stubble burning.“We have so far found only one defaulter in Dankaur area and an FIR was registered against him. Since our aim is to discourage stubble burning and it was a first time offence, the department did not impose a penalty,” said Singh.He added that the penalty against stubble burning is ₹2,500 for a farm up to two acres, ₹5,000 for farm up to four acres and ₹15,000 for above four acres.“We are taking steps to encourage farmers through advertisements and awareness campaigns not to burn stubble. Farmers are also being encouraged to convert stubble into fodder or manure. However, instances still occur and are also dealt with strictly. We are actively monitoring such cases,” said AN Mishra, joint director, state agriculture department, Meerut.Meanwhile, experts said that stubble burning is responsible for at least 15-20% of the city’s air pollution.“As winters are approaching, the mixing height reduces and pollutants aggregate near the surface. Stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh makes it worse by contributing up to 20% (of the air pollution). The main contribution of stubble burning is the pollutant PM2.5, which mixes in the blood stream and affects health. Instances of stubble burning are likely to increase by the first week of November and that’s when the air quality will further deteriorate. In Noida, it’s already in the ‘very-poor’ category, while one monitoring station showed ‘severe’ air quality. Immediate curbs, such as discouraging stubble burning at least at the local level, are a must,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air quality at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).On Sunday, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 362 or ‘very poor’ against 347 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was at 379, also ‘very poor’, against 356 a day earlier.Meanwhile, Greater Noida turned out to be the most polluted area in the National Capital Region, with an AQI of 392, eight points shy from reaching the ‘severe’ category, on Sunday against 356 a day earlier.According to data from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), AQI at the Knowledge Park-V metro station in Greater Noida was 419 on a scale of 0 to 500, or ‘severe’.“The main reason of deterioration in the air quality in Greater Noida area is meteorological, but other sources such as unauthorised industrial and domestic waste burning, etc., aid the scenario. In the last three days, we have imposed penalties on five such violators and are actively monitoring any such violations,” said Archna Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/stubble-burning-continues-in-greater-noida-villages-air-quality-deteriorates-to-near-severe/story-RwTGNxHD1qCzsNDnt6j2QO.html
26-10-2020||Noida||Concessionaire floats tenders for safety rigs along Yamuna Expressway||GREATER NOIDA: The Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL), the concessionaire of the Yamuna Expressway, has started the process to select a contractor who can install guard rail and crash barriers, among other safety features, on the 165km expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra. This is being done based on the safety audit report of the expressway by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi, which had suggested that crash barriers be installed on two sides of the divider on the expressway for safety to motorists. The audit was conducted following directions from the Supreme Court.The JIL has invited bids from contractors or private agencies who can apply for this project, tenders for which have been advertised on JIL’s website. “Contractors or private agencies can apply for the project till December 26, 2020. All information on this is available on www.jaypeeinfratech.com. The guard rails and metal crash barriers have to be installed on two sides of the divider,” said Anuj Jain, the interim resolution professional, in a statement via this advertisement. According to officials of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), once the agency is hired, the work may take up to a year.IIT-Delhi was hired in August 2018 by Yeida to conduct a safety audit of this expressway. Following criticism from the Supreme Court on a petition seeking motorists’ safety on the expressway, the Uttar Pradesh government had, several times in the past, directed officials to beef up enforcement to contain speeding and other traffic violations, to contain the incidents of accidents and casualties on the expressway. In a follow up to the apex court’s directions, Yeida has asked JIL to take multiple measures for passengers’ safety, including installation of metal crash barriers. As per the deadline, JIL was told to install all safety features by March-end this year. “However Jaypee could not install all safety features so far. The metal crash barriers and guard rails are crucial for passengers’ safety because if a vehicle is met with an accident then the crash barrier can minimise the damage to a vehicle,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.The seven points suggested in IIT-Delhi’s safety audit report are additional signage (distance bar markings) before exit ramps, remove lane system, installation of rumble strips at entry and exit ramps, installation of crash attenuators at exit ramps, audible shoulder markings throughout corridor, removal of all signposts from the shoulders, shoulder guard rails to be reinstalled as per standard specifications, crash barriers and replacement of existing raised median (divider) with flush median, and central guard rail as per the standard. The management of JIL could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/concessionaire-floats-tenders-for-safety-rigs-along-yamuna-expressway/story-fQ7mT9zKZi1GBkFtZT4idN.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi marks a dull Dussehra||Dussehra in Delhi was a low-key affair this year, with restrictions in light of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic forcing several Ramlila programmes to shift online and only four organisers permitted to carry on with the effigy-burning ritual, as against 800 small and big ones last year.Senior officials in the Delhi revenue department said that last year, around 800 Ramlila organisers had got permission for the ritual, where effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnad are burnt at open spaces in public view. The height of the effigies can range from a few feet to over a hundred feet. Such events are often marked by gatherings, food courts, fairs and public celebrations across the city, most of which are restricted this year to prevent the further spread of Covid-19.“My greetings to everyone on this day which marks the victory of good over evil. Soon, humanity would stand victorious against the covid-19 demon,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia thanked residents of the city for keeping celebrations low-key in the light of the pandemic and rising air pollution. He said, “We must resolve to defeat today’s evils — pollution and Covid-19.”Delhi on Sunday recorded 4,136 new cases of Covid-19, taking the cumulative number of infections to 356,656 — even as 323,654 people have recovered and 6,258 have died of the disease. Some of the prominent Ramlila-Dussehra event committees in the city refrained from organising any programmes this year, so they did not seek any permission from the district administration and the police at any stage. The most prominent of these is the Luv-Kush Ramlila Committee, which organises the event every year in the Red Fort premises — an event attended by VIPs and senior political figures, cutting across party lines.“This is our contribution in ensuring a Covid-free and pollution-free Delhi. We have tried to set an example. Now we shall be campaigning for a firecracker-free Diwali too,” said Arun Kumar, the committee’s general secretary, who met Sisodia at his residence on Sunday, where the committee organised a symbolic celebration.Several other organisers in the city followed suit.“It is unsafe to organise anything that can lead to gatherings, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are performing the temple rituals, but there will be no Ramila and effigy burning,” said Yogesh Pahuja, office bearer in the resident welfare association in Lajpat Nagar 2, which is one of the prominent Ramlila organisers in the city.Some of them went on to organise laser-light shows and cake-cutting ceremonies instead, with no gatherings.The four organisers who got permission are in Shastri Park, Vinod Nagar, GTB Enclave and Karkardooma, and the size of the permitted effigies in these areas range between 30 and 70 feet. However, the crowd size was limited to 200 in the venues. As a workaround, organisers said they would stream the event live on their Facebook pages.“We have installed sanitiser dispensers at the gates, and all visitors will be thermally scanned. This year, we will burn four effigies. The fourth one will represent the coronavirus,” said Hareesh Chaudhary of Vishnu Avatar Ramlila in Shastri Park.Another revenue department official said that around 50 organisers in the city sought permission to burn effigies around a fortnight ago, but were not issued no-objection certificates (NOC) owing to safety reasons.In the last one month, a lot has gone into convincing these organisers for giving up on plans for the festivities this year, government officials said.“In one district alone, we have engaged with around 600 temple committees who participate in the Dussehra festivities. We communicated the problems that any potentially large gathering could entail. People have to be more cautious during the festive season”, said Neha Bansal, district magistrate (West Delhi).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-marks-a-dull-dussehra/story-tIwvwHETGTgwcuZK2It9aM.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||18-year-old woman found dead in Delhi’s Tahirpur||An 18-year-old woman was found dead in a house on Sunday afternoon in northeast Delhi’s Tahirpur, where she lived with her uncle and aunt. Police said investigation revealed the woman’s uncle and aunt begged for a living. Police said the woman’s uncle, who is the prime suspect, is on the run. “The victim did not have any visible injury on her body. We are probing the cause of the murder,” a senior police officer said.The woman had recently cleared her class 12 board exams, the police said, and her parents live in Bihar.The matter was reported around noon when Nand Nagri police station received a call informing them about the murder. The police team that reached the spot found the woman’s body in the house. “A woman, who introduced herself as the aunt of the deceased, told police that she and her husband work as beggars. She said the dead woman was her niece and lived with them. She said that when she returned home on Saturday night, she found the door locked from outside. She waited for her husband to return home, but when he did not return, she slept in the neighbour’s house,” said a police officer who wished not to be named. The officer said that when the woman returned home on Sunday morning, the door was still locked and her husband had not returned. “She then broke open the door with the help of her neighbours and found her niece lying unconscious on the floor,” he said.The police then took the woman to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead and her body shifted to a mortuary for a post-mortem examination. Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Ved Prakash Surya said a case of murder has been registered. “We are searching for the woman’s uncle who is absconding. He is our prime suspect. The woman did not have any apparent fatal injuries and an autopsy will confirm the cause of death,” Surya said.Police have also not ruled out the possibility of sexual assault and are waiting for the post-mortem reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-year-old-woman-found-dead-in-delhi-s-tahirpur/story-JOEtzSk6spoVWEEfsWoYTJ.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||AAP attacks BJP over strike by municipal doctors||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party over non-payment of salaries to doctors of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao hospital. While Delhi health minister Satyender Jain said that the MCDs, which are ruled by the BJP, have funds for putting up hoardings but not for paying doctors, AAP incharge of MCD affairs Durgesh Pathak said the North civic body was harassing senior doctors who were supporting their protesting colleagues. The BJP rejected the charges as baseless. “Salaries are paid by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Instead of paying doctors’ salaries, don’t know where MCD is spending its funds. They have money for hoardings but not for salaries,” Jain said. He said that the government has written a letter to the civic bodies asking them to hand over hospitals to Delhi government if they were not able to properly run them properly. “It is evident that the municipal corporations are not able to properly run and manage their hospitals. We have written a letter to BJP led MCD to handover hospitals to Delhi govt, to avoid any further inconveniences to the medical, para-medical staff, and the patients coming to the hospital,” he said.The resident doctors of the Hindu Rao hospital, the biggest municipal hospital in Delhi, and Kasturba Hospital are protesting to demand salaries of the last three months. Both facilities are run by North MCD. In a statement issued on Saturday, the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA) had said it has already has given sufficient time to concerned authorities to resolve the issue and pay the salaries, “but they have not done anything to solve the problem, and instead appear to be unconcerned with the plight of doctors”.Pathak said, “Doctors in the MCD hospital are protesting for not having received their salaries for around five months now. It is shameful that instead of disbursing their salaries, the BJP-led North MCD is threatening to remove four senior doctors who stood in support of the protesting resident doctors and nurses. Their transfer orders have already been issued.” He further said, “We demand that the BJP-ruled MCDs revoke the transfer orders against the four senior doctors, stop harassing them and pay salaries of the pending employees. If they cannot do so, they should hand over the charge of their hospitals to the Delhi government.” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Pathak’s statement on transfer of doctors is “baseless”. He further said: “North MCD has not transferred any doctor. It is a matter of short deputation from one hospital to another in the light of temporary staff shortage. Delhi BJP advises AAP leaders to stop playing dirty politics during the health emergency. Instead, the AAP government should come forward and extend financial package immediately to help ending the strike including of doctors in the MCD hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-attacks-bjp-over-strike-by-municipal-doctors/story-hY7r0uux0O4vGQpC6TyLKP.html
26-10-2020||Mumbai||Stubble burning: Researchers look for tech solutions as daily fire count crosses 1,000 mark in Punjab, Haryana||Burning of rice stubble has started earlier than usual this year with daily fire counts crossing the 1,000-mark in Punjab and Haryana combined, revealed the data by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), an independent policy research institution, on Thursday.Stubble or straw is the residue left behind in large quantities after harvesting the paddy crops. Most farmers are forced to burn the stubble as a quick way of getting rid of the residue so they can begin sowing the next crop. This mass burning of agriculture residue leads to emission of particulate matter (PM-10 and PM-2.5) and greenhouse gases (GHG), which contribute to the poor air quality in Punjab, Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). Between September 1 and October 20, the CEEW has recorded more than 9,000 fires. Simultaneously, the air quality in Delhi-NCR has dropped to a very poor category with air quality index (AQI) crossing the 300 mark. AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.The harvest of rice in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which usually peaks at the end of October, will mature early this year. In July a labour shortage induced by the Covid-19 pandemic forced farmers to sow their rice seeds directly in the fields instead of transplanting seedlings from nurseries. With rice crop maturing eight to 10 days earlier than usual, harvest season has kicked off, as have rice stubble burning incidents. While the central and state governments are trying out a host of policy measures and alternatives for collection and disposal of stubble, science and technology institutes are also working on interventions for processing the waste.Addressing problem at the rootPunjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, which has seen moderate success with the widely used happy seeder—a tractor-operated machine that can sow wheat seeds even in standing paddy stubble—has also developed hybrid straw management systems (SMS). A super seeder is a tractor-mounted machine that can plough the stubble and sow wheat seeds simultaneously. “It is a combined harvesting system,” said Mahesh Kumar Narang, principal extension scientist, farm machinery and power engineering, PAU. However, the super seeder throws the ploughed straw to the centre of the field and additional labour may be required to remove the straw. To address this, the PAU has developed Super SMS, which can be fitted to the super seeder. The Super SMS chops the ploughed straw evenly and distributes it evenly over the field. This helps manage the entire straw residue within the field. The super seeder is currently priced at ₹1.10 lakh, he added. “For a farmer, the price for using the super seeder is almost ₹350 to ₹400 more per acre than using a happy seeder. However, the labour cost of mulching the stubble is eliminated,” said Narang. Along similar lines, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has designed a stubble removing machine (SRM) and collection trolley, which can cut the stubble and collect the residue in a trolley at the same time. Happy seeder, super seeder and SRM are comparatively cheaper than traditional balers that are priced at ₹7-8 lakh, said Narang.High yield and green alternative to coalThe rice straw holds potential as an alternative to coal in thermal power plants is widely accepted. However, paddy residue has seen very little success in its use as fuel in power plants because it has to be processed before it can be used as a fuel in a thermal plant.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL) in Delhi, proposes heating the straw at very high temperatures in controlled conditions to convert the residue into high-yield bio coal—an environment-friendly alternative to coal.“There are inherent problems in using raw rice straw as fuel because there is high moisture content and the gross calorific value (GCV) is low, which makes it difficult to use in large scale,” said Sanjay Dhakate, chief scientist and head of advanced carbon products group, CSIR-NPL. The solution proposed by Dhakate is using heat in a controlled environment to convert agri-waste into coal-like material. This is called torrefaction. As a pilot, NPL has set up a small stainless-steel plant in its lab for torrefying rice straw by applying heat from 250 to 400 degrees Celsius. The plant redirects the gases emitted to generate power to back the plant in turn. “We have found that on torrefaction at 250°C, the GCV of the residue is 3,762 kcal/kg and it further increases to 4,342, 5,129 and 5,339 kcal/kg with an increase in torrefaction temperature from 300°C to 400°C,” said Dhakate. This is comparable to the calorific value of coal used in thermal plants (6000-8000 kcal/ kg). The NPL is currently working with National Thermal Power Corporation Limited for large-scale implementation of torrefaction of rice straw. Darpan Das, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University, USA, also endorses torrefaction. He offers the concept of ‘briquetting’ of rice straw to curb emissions, a process involving compaction of fuel to an energy-densified material. Formerly a PhD student at IIT-Bombay, Das has used the same, as a strategy to reduce emissions from domestic applications of coal in cookstoves. “This can be used for agro-residues for efficient conversion to bio-briquettes which can cater to the household energy needs of the country. Briquettes can also serve as additional support to the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme of providing LPG to every citizen,” said Das.Cost, feasibility a challenge for implementation, say expertsCollection of rice straws is a labour-intensive and expensive process, even with the machines in place, say experts. In Punjab alone, around 13,000 happy seeders and 200-odd super seeder machines were deployed last year, according to Narang. For a state that generates 19.7 metric tonne of paddy straw, the CEEW estimates the requirement of 35,000 happy seeder machines.“While there is a rise in takers for the machines with the subsidy offered by the government, there is a big gap in the number of machines that are required and are available,” said LS Kurinji, research analyst, CEEW. Large-scale dissemination of technology is a challenge in implementation, agreed Das.There are 290 manufacturers of various straw management machines empanelled with the government of India. In Punjab, individual farmers get a 50% subsidy on the purchase of a machine and cooperatives can avail a subsidy of 75%. “The subsidy for buying straw management machines should continue for at least three more years so that farmers continue to invest in them,” said Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairperson of the Punjab state farmers’ and farmworkers’ commission.For power plants to substitute coal with biomass, too, is not an easy task. “Technologically it is possible to use rice straw as fuel in thermal power plants. The problem is the plants are too far away from the paddy fields. This adds to the transportation cost. Ideally, Punjab and Haryana should buy up the agri-waste to fuel the power plants within the states,” said Ajay Mathur, director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute.“Instead of dictating a policy to promote the use of biomass as a coal substitute in power plants, the government should set out guidelines for disposing of rice straw in an environment-friendly way. This will give entrepreneurs and researchers to find disruptive solutions to the problem,” said Jakhar, adding that to promote innovation, the government should set up funds for competitions seeking solutions. BOX:The problem: The air quality in north India, particularly along the Indo-Gangetic plains, stoops to dangerously low levels between October and November every year. This is also the time when farmers in the region set fire to their agricultural waste after harvesting their paddy fields.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are the biggest producers of rice in the country in the Kharif season between May and November every year. In 2017-18, almost 62% of all the rice procured by the Food Corporation of India came from these states. Harvesting begins in October and peaks by the end of the month. At the end of the harvest, stubbles of paddy are left rooted in the fields. Farmers usually have barely two weeks to clear this stubble so they can start sowing the next crop, which is wheat. Left with a heap of unwanted rice stubble, with little time to dispose of it, farmers set fire to the heaps and use the ash as a fertiliser. However, stubble burning emits greenhouse gases and harmful particulate matter into the air, which leads to pollution. Punjab alone generates 19.7 million metric tonnes of rice straw in a year. Burning of rice straw releases particulate matter and harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. These emissions pose severe health risks and can be detrimental to lung functions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stubble-burning-researchers-look-for-tech-solutions-as-daily-fire-counts-crosses-1-000-mark-in-punjab-haryana/story-DHS8EBwXu1o7efGtjxTTjL.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||How Delhi’s RK Puram improved its air quality||In October last year, the air in south Delhi’s RK Puram was thick with pollutants. Smoke from garbage being burnt, dust from construction, and noxious fumes from vehicles zooming past Ring Road and Outer Ring Road had pushed this residential area into the infamous list of most polluted areas in the national capital. But this year, things are different. Data data shows that RK Puram — one of the city’s 13 pollution hot spots, where pollution levels are considerably higher than the rest of Delhi — showed the highest reduction in PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels compared to the other highly polluted spots. This, officials said, was brought on by stricter enforcement of anti-pollution norms and better participation by residents and the general public.In January this year, when the national capital experienced its worst spell of air, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that PM2.5 levels in RK Puram went down by 42% compared to 2019. This was the biggest improvement seen in any of the 13 hot spots. Similarly, levels of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) in January 2020 came down by as much as 34%, compared to the same period in 2019.In February, when enforcement teams withdraw from areas as wind speeds pick up, the reduction in PM 2.5 levels was 37% this year, even as eight hot spots saw spikes as compared to 2019. PM10 levels also recorded a marginal 2% drop.Data recorded between October 1 and October 25, also spells out a similar reduction. On Friday and Saturday, when Delhi’s air plunged to the ‘very poor’ category, and most hot spots slipped into the ‘severe’ zone, RK Puram managed to maintain an AQI value in the ‘very poor’ category throughout the day. Officials from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said that strict enforcement and public participation led to this change. Since 2018, when RK Puram entered the list of hot spots, enforcement teams said they have been able to control several local sources of pollution, a drive that resident welfare associations (RWAs) kept alive. Open garbage burning, which was one of the biggest problems in the area, has been controlled to a great extent. Open air eateries that relied on unclean fuel have either been shut down or have switched to cleaner alternatives. “RK Puram is among the few areas in the list [of hot spots] where controlling pollution sources was relatively easier, because it is a residential area, with no large polluting industries or transport hubs in the vicinity, as is the problem with some other areas like Bawana, Mundka and Anand Vihar,” a senior DPCC official said. The official also said that while garbage-burning cannot be controlled completely, engagement programmes with local RWAs helped greatly reduce their occurrences. “Since this is largely a middle-class residential colony, engaging residents helped our cause. There are still some problem areas, mainly some of the slum clusters in sectors 12, 7 and 5, where waste is burnt in the open when it gets cold, but we are trying to find alternatives for them,” the official added. Apart from the local sources, DPCC officials said the area has also benefitted from the completion of two major construction projects. The Delhi Metro in 2018 wrapped up work on its Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar), which stretches through the Ring Road crossing RK Puram sectors 12, 13 and Moti Bagh. On the other side of the locality, the long-pending construction of the new Rao Tula Ram (RTR) flyover was also completed in 2019. These projects have also eased traffic jams, in turn bringing down vehicular emission levels, the officials said. Residents here, however, said a lot can be done here to further bring pollution under control. Sumedha Suri, a resident of Sector 8, said road dust and vehicular pollution are issues that agencies continue to ignore. “After 9-10pm, when the winds become calm, you can see the haze because of the dust flying around. Municipal agencies had promised mechanised sweeping, but none of us have ever seen the machines,” Suri said. The data backs Suri’s fears up. CPCB records show that while there was a marked improvement in PM2.5 levels, there was a negligible drop in the levels of PM10, which is primarily dust. The air in the area is also hampered by the presence of Ring Road and Outer Ring Road — two arterial roads that see high vehicular volume. Bhure Lal, chairperson of the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), said these hot spots were marked to target action in these places. “The idea is to redress the issue that each of these 13 hot spots is facing. That is what we intend to do by focusing on these areas. Monitoring agencies are continuing to keep a close watch on sources of pollutions in each of these areas to find the best enforcement measures here,” Lal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/how-rk-puram-improved-its-air-quality/story-fBWInd7274OuRz8lfuezuN.html
26-10-2020||Delhi||Man being quizzed in car theft case dies after falling off 1st floor of police station||A 52-year-old man who was called in for questioning regarding a case of vehicle theft died after being seriously injured while in police custody at the Lodhi Colony station on Saturday. While the police suspect the man died after falling from the first floor of the station while trying to flee, a police officer was suspended and a judicial inquiry ordered. Police said the man, Dharambir Singh, was called to the station because his auto-rickshaw had been used by two men who had stolen a car in Lodhi Colony on Thursday. A police spokesperson said officers rushed the man to the hospital after finding him unconscious in the station’s courtyard. He, however, died during treatment, the police said.The two alleged thieves were arrested on Saturday.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said a car theft was reported at Lodhi Colony police station on October 22 (Thursday), and that CCTV footage showed two men arriving in an autorickshaw and fleeing with the car.“Our team then traced the auto-rickshaw owner and found that his father, Dharambir, had rented out the vehicle to one Satish, a resident of Fatehpur Beri. After interrogating Dharambir on Friday, we managed to nab Satish on Saturday, who was one of the suspects spotted in the CCTV footage. On Satish’s information, we also arrested his accomplice Ghewar Ram Chowdhary, who also lives in Fatehpur Beri and is involved in at least 32 previous criminal cases,” the DCP said. Police said Dharambir had been summoned to by an assistant sub-inspector, who was probing the case.“On Saturday, when Dharambir was being questioned on the first floor of Lodhi Colony police station, ASI Vijay went to the restroom around 2:45pm. When he returned, he did not find Dharambir in the room. When he looked out of a window, he saw Dharambir on the floor in the central courtyard of the police station. He was rushed to the AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he died during treatment,” the DCP said. Thakur said Dharambir’s family members were informed, and his body sent for a post-mortem examination. Police said they suspect Dharambir fell off the first floor while attempting to flee the station, fearing he would be arrested.“The matter was reported to the chief metropolitan magistrate for needful action. Disciplinary action has been initiated and ASI Vijay and has been suspended. A judicial enquiry is underway,” Thakur added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-being-quizzed-in-car-theft-case-dies-after-falling-off-1st-floor-of-delhi-police-station/story-5WAb94ae09wRCa5VZfJWXK.html
