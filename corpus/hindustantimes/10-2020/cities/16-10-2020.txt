Nearly three months after the results of Class 10 were declared in the state, the admission to colleges for FYJC students is still not complete. On September 9, in line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the Maratha quota in jobs and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. With this, the second merit list for admissions which was scheduled to be out on September 10 was not released. More than a month on, admissions are yet to restart, leaving over 2.42 lakh students in the lurch in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone. In the online petition, parents have urged state officials to restart the admission process soon. “SSC exams concluded in March, and it has been nearly seven months now that our children are at home without learning anything. We are worried about their academic future, and hence urge the department to not delay the process any further,” said a parent while replying to the petition. Several agitated parents even said that the education department should scrap the entire year for FYJC students. “What is the point of opening the college when even 30% syllabus cannot be completed in such a short duration now? Why should our children suffer in the whole process?” asked an angry parent on Twitter. An official from the state education department said they are yet to receive instructions from the state government on restarting admission process. “The decision will be taken at a higher level, and we are not sure as to when the process will begin,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-500-parents-across-maharashtra-urge-cm-uddhav-thackeray-to-restart-fyjc-admissions/story-GQJCDrRxM1ewlGn9iUbWCN.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||31-50 years more prone to Covid cases as people report back to work, says Thane civic body||With the rise in the number of people reporting back to work since Mission Begin Again in June, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has detected an increase in the number of Covid cases in the age-group of 31 to 50 years. This comprises mostly the working population. As per the data compiled by TMC, this is also the age group with the most number of active cases. The maximum number of those recovered and discharged quickly fall in this age group.The mortality rate on the other hand is still high among the senior citizens due to more comorbidities.Thane city has witnessed more than 42,255 numbers of cases till now. Among these, 21.1 per cent are of 31-40 years of age and 19.1 per cent are in the 41-50 years of age. While those within 51 to 60 years of age and above 60 years are at 17 per cent positivity rate each, close on heels at 16.3 per cent positivity are those among 21 to 30 years of age.Geographically, the positivity rate in areas like Majiwada-Manpada and Naupada Kopri is among the highest. Similarly, most of the active cases are found in Majiwada-Manpada closely followed by Vartak Nagar. These are areas with increased working population under the 31 to 50 years of age bracket.Dr Raju Murudkar, medical health officer, TMC, said, “Those within 31 to 40 years of age are most mobile. With the unlock in place, most of them also step out for work and come easily in contact with others, increasing their chances of infection. They are also those who step out for essentials, hence the positivity rate among them is higher. Although their infection rate is high, their recovery is also much higher as they respond well to medications and treatment. Their lungs are fit and in a position to recover easily.”TMC informed that 55 per cent mortality rate exists within Thane city among those above 60 years of age. “Senior citizens are prone to infection easily. Hence, they are advised to stay at home and restrict their outdoor activities. Due to comorbidities, their immunity level goes down. As the virus affects the lungs, with age, their lungs are not capable become vulnerable,” said Dr Murudkar.He added that the recovery time among senior citizens is also more compared to youngsters. Dr Santosh Kadam, president, Indian Medical Association, Thane Chapter, said, “Awareness is more among youngsters. They wear masks and sanitise regularly, however for senior citizens this is a huge change in their routine making it difficult for them to wear masks properly and follow regular sanitisation. Hence, they are prone to infection.“Most youngsters, when tested positive, have mild disease and hardly a few have developed the need for hospitalisation. In some cases, those above 50 years have slow recovery depending on the individual’s fitness and immunity level. However, senior citizens have co-morbidities and most need hospitalisation.” The least affected are those below 20 years of age. Hardly, 2 per cent to 4 per cent deaths have taken place in this age group since March. Most patients below 20 years of age who have been positive have recovered well and discharged within TMC.“Children have higher immunity power making them easier to cope with. We have a few cases, mostly those whose entire family have tested positive or those in close proximity to a positive parent. Their strong lungs respond faster and recovery is also easier,” said Murudkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/31-50-years-more-prone-to-covid-cases-as-people-report-back-to-work-says-thane-civic-body/story-G05Pa2FTdVcN6weQoRiIWL.html

Although the positivity rate is an average of 17 per cent, only 1.5 lakh of the city’s 18 lakh population has been tested till now.A fluctuation in the daily number of cases has been noticed between 200 and 500 cases since the last month. This is one of the worst affected corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan region after Mumbai.At least 50,948 positive cases have been reported till now in the twin cities of Kalyan and Dombivli.Confirming the increase in recovery rate, Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “We are focusing on providing proper treatment and isolation to those infected, only after this are they discharged. On some days, we have discharged more than 400 patients who have been cured completely. This is helping a lot in improving the recovery rate. We are also roping in additional staff and increasing the number of testing gradually, our efforts to set up testing camps in clusters with an increased number of cases seems to help curtail the spread of the virus.”The civic body hopes that the door-to-door survey under the ‘My Family My Responsibility’ campaign will help identify those with symptoms. The KDMC currently has 22 testing centres across the city. On an average, around 2,400 patients get tested daily across the city. The death rate is currently at 1.95 per cent.“The market areas are crowded and people step out at night as well for leisure, some restrictions to such activities need to be made. With so many facilities available, the civic body should also make institutional quarantine compulsory so that patients can be monitored,” said Shyamjit Sarkar, 54, resident of Dombivli.With the help of a strict crackdown, KDMC is trying to create awareness about wearing masks. “Till now, we have fined more than 3,500 people, collected a total of around ₹7 lakh as fine since the rule was implemented,” said a senior official from KDMC. Those found without masks in public places are being fined ₹500 each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/recovery-rate-in-kalyan-dombivli-rises-from-85-to-90-in-last-2-weeks/story-KYs4ayK2tvrYzZsHKXqJpJ.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||SSR case media trial: Have NBA to keep eye on electronic media, Centre tells Bombay HC||The Union government through the ministry of information and broadcasting assured the Bombay high court (HC) that there was a mechanism in place in the form of News Broadcasters Association (NBA) which regulates the electronic media. The statement was made in response to the issues raised in various public interest litigations (PILs) filed against the media trial in Sushant Singh Rajput death case. The ministry also submitted that it was in the process of formulating a better mechanism to address the grievances. NBA, on its part, informed the court that it had taken action against many channels and had also banned channels for infringing the programme code. However, when asked if any action was taken against channels for running media trials, NBA replied in the negative. The court has posted further hearing on Monday. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a bunch of PILs filed by various individuals and NGOs including former senior police officials, was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh that various Supreme Court and HC judgements have stressed on the need for self-regulation by the media. Referring to a judgement of the Kerala HC, Singh said the courts have time and again refrained from framing guidelines for restricting the media on the grounds that it was in the domain of the parliament and the state legislature. Singh also referred to other judgements wherein courts have refused to frame guidelines and said that media should act responsibly. Singh further submitted that NBA was founded to act as a self-regulating authority for the electronic media as well as serve as a redressal mechanism for complaints. Singh added that NBA exercised control on members, and if the channels did not heed, the complaint was forwarded to the ministry. In such cases, he said, an inter-ministerial committee took action against channels, including ones that are not members of NBA. In light of these submissions, Singh said there was no need for additional mechanism, and added that in light of the grievances raised in the PILs, it was considering ways to regulate non-members and to bring effective mechanisms against them. When the court questioned whether wither the ministry or NBA had dealt with complaints pertaining to media trials, Singh replied in the negative and said action had been initiated against errant channels pertaining to advertisement or objectionable content. The court then observed that in the current scenario the electronic media, while exercising its right to freedom of speech, was violating the rights of others by tarnishing the image of the subjects. “Legitimate restraint is a must, else there will be absolute mayhem,” observed the bench. The court reiterated that it only wanted to stress on the fact that there was no mechanism to control electronic media like there was for the print media. Singh responded, “We expected media to show restraint, but they did not; so we are taking measures to come up with some mechanism.” While making submissions on behalf of NBA, senior counsel Arvind Datar informed the court that the self-regulating body was taking cognisance of complaints as well as was initiating suo motu action against errant members. He also submitted data showing that the NBA was taking action on 30 instances of member channels infringing programme code every year. After hearing the submissions, the court said that it would hear the channels on Monday and directed them not to repeat arguments and posted hearing for Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ssr-case-media-trial-have-nba-to-keep-eye-on-electronic-media-centre-tells-bombay-hc/story-66Ji1HT42DrOc8oZtshJZJ.html

It also does not have an ambulance service. The building housing the hospital is also dilapidated and is in urgent need of repairs.Built in 1962, the sub-district hospital is used by residents of Ambernath and nearby tribal villages of Badlapur, Karjat and Kasara.Hospital sources claim the government has sanctioned seven doctors to the hospital. Of these, five are either sent on deputation to other hospitals or are unwell. “The only two doctors working are Dr Shashikant Dode, medical superintendent of the hospital, and Sachin Deskmukh, medical officer. For the last few years, the hospital has been on ventilator with lack of staff. After continuous follow up with the government, we were assigned staff. However, most of them are again sent on deputation. It is difficult to manage the hospital with such meagre staff,” said a person on the hospital staff requesting anonymity.The hospital has daily footfalls of more than 200 to 300 people visiting the OPD for treatment. Prior to lockdown, at least five to ten deliveries were done.“We have seven nurses in two shifts. Among the seven, two of them are on leave, one is suffering from cancer and the other tested positive for Covid-19. The operation theatre, OPD, casualty, maternity, male and female isolation ward and post-mortem rooms do not have manpower. Moreover, the hospital building is dilapidated, and the authorities have ignored our plea for repairs,” the hospital staff said.The condition of the hospital has also affected the locals who have to run to different hospitals in Thane.Dr Dode refused to speak on the issues and said that he and his team were trying their best to treat every single patient visiting the hospital.Kailash Pawar, deputy director, Thane District Collector Health Department, said, “We have a team of doctors at the hospital who are working properly. Doctors were posted at the hospital, but a few of them are on deputation at Covid centres, which was the priority in the last few months.”Commenting on the condition of the building, Pawar added, “We have sent a proposal to the state government for a new building at the same place. Also, we have asked them to extend the hospital to a 100-bed facility after rebuilding the existing structure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-2-doctors-5-staff-members-for-50-bed-chaya-sub-district-hospital-in-ambernath/story-G0zqnnociCBgjbHkSynHgP.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai residential associations come together in fight against pollution from Taloja MIDC||Various residential associations of Kharghar, Kamothe, Kalamboli and Taloja have joined hands to fight the air pollution menace together. The areas have been suffering for years, especially at night, due to pollution from Taloja MIDC, the residents claimed.The agitation was started by various social organisations two years ago. However, since the pollution has not been curbed, the associations decided to fight it out together. The industries in Taloja have led to both air and water pollution over the years, claimed the residents.Leena Garad, president of Kharghar Forum, said. “We intend to bring together the organisations and citizens who have previously worked against pollution in the Kharghar, Kamothe, Kalamboli and Taloja areas. Together, we would set up Anti-Pollution Struggle Committee and build organisational structure for the next movement. In the next meeting, we also intend to make a list of companies that contribute to pollution, if possible, by scientifically studying what exactly causes the pollution,” Garad said.Kasam Mulani, president of Taloja Pachanand Residential Social Organisation, said, “There are 937 industries in Taloja MIDC and the pollution from them is suffocating the residents in the surrounding areas. There have been incidents of fishes in Kasadi River dying because of the chemicals discharged into it. There have also been incidents of cattle dying due to the inhalation of polluted air. We have been writing to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) since 2015, but have not seen any major difference in the situation. The property prices in the area are also going down because of the issue.”However, MPCB has said the smell that has been creating havoc for the residents is not just the industrial effluent or emissions but also that of the raw material.Kishor Kerlikar, MIDC sub-regional officer, said, “We are continuously addressing the complaints and are also visiting the locations to find any kind of illegal dumping or emission. We are also planning to identify four locations in the MIDC area from where continuous monitoring can be done. A few days back, during a midnight visit, we found two production units emitting strong odour as they used state fish as raw materials. The units were told to use de-odourisation system that they did not have, and hence we issued closure direction.”MIDC was established in 1970 and the area developed without any buffer area. Kerlikar added, “Ideally, there should have been a patch of dense trees as a buffer zone before the residential complexes start. This was not made and that is the main problem why residents are facing strong odour from the MIDC area. Of the 937 industries, not all are chemical industries, and 229 of them generate industrial effluents.”Kerlikar added that in a week, MIDC would be finalising four places to install ambient air quality monitoring system to keep a track of pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-residential-associations-come-together-in-fight-against-pollution-from-taloja-midc/story-cH1zuoRX11om3utJWvsngO.html

NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede confirmed the arrest and said, “Madhok is a peddler and distributor of cocaine and hashish. His name was mentioned in various statements of drug peddlers recorded in the SSR case. He is directly involved in drug peddling and distribution.” NCB officials said Madhok along with Dharma Productions’ former executive producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad and Ankush Arenja was also involved in distributing drugs. Both Prasad and Arenja were earlier arrested in the SSR case, said NCB officers. Madhok has direct links with a Nigerian national from whom he procured cocaine for himself and to distribute to his friends. “We have been questioning Madhok to find out if his friends are also involved in distributing drugs. NCB is looking for a few of his few friends as well,” said a NCB officer. During interrogation, Madhok also revealed that he was in touch with Sam alias Rahil Vishram who used to supply hashish to him. NCB officers checked Madhok’s financial transactions and found that he had made many transactions for drugs, said an NCB officer. The agency has so far arrested 21 people including actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, domestic help Dipesh Sawant, and drug peddlers Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar and others. Chakraborty was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 7 while her brother is still in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-ncb-arrests-peddler-in-drugs-case/story-MlKipjZmAEHjpa8QHo0EsM.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Fewer cases of gastroenteritis and hepatitis in Mumbai due to Covid-19 lockdown||For the first time in seven years, the number of gastroenteritis cases recorded in the city in September is less than 40. Absence of street vendors during the lockdown has resulted in a drastic reduction in reported cases of monsoon ailments associated with the stomach and liver, like gastroenteritis and hepatitis.Every year during the monsoon, hospitals in the city witnessed a spike in the number of patients coming in with stomach flu or gastroenteritis and hepatitis. With roadside food stalls prohibited during the lockdown and fewer Mumbaiites venturing out of their homes for fear of contracting Covid-19, there has been a sharp drop in cases of these ailments. Data shared by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) showed there were only 31 gastroenteritis cases in September, compared to 368 cases in September 2019. Similarly, there were three cases of hepatitis in September, compared to 70 reported in September 2019. Gastroenteritis and hepatitis A or E are caused by contaminated water or food. Symptoms take three to six weeks to show. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital, said, “Every year, during monsoon we get the highest number of patients with gastroenteritis and hepatitis. This year, we had expected fewer patients due to the lockdown. But this year, the flow of patients has gone down by almost 80%. Roadside food stalls are the primary source of infection. Due to the pandemic, those have been closed down, which has helped to control the cases.”Doctors said hepatitis A and E can also spread due to improper hygiene, especially if uncooked food — like fruits and vegetables — are washed with contaminated water. With everyone taking precautions to curb the spread of Covid-19, the risk of contaminated water has also diminished. “Since the pandemic, people have been drinking boiled water and washing their hands regularly. This has helped curb the cases of monsoon related infections,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician, Bombay Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fewer-cases-of-gastroenteritis-and-hepatitis-in-mumbai-due-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-Hkrb0FhxY23OWYXfnAuHAO.html

Instead, they are destroying their goods during the action,” said Hasan Mulani, a social worker and trustee of Yes We Can.Abdul Kabir, a member of the group, said: “Legal action of fining them is proper instead of taking their belongings and destroying them since they cannot afford to bear the loss of their products.”Ashok Burpulle, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “We carry out action against hawkers on a daily basis. If they are standing and blocking the road with stalls, resulting in traffic congestion in the city, action will be taken against them as per the due process of law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbra-ngo-asks-thane-civic-body-not-to-take-action-against-small-time-hawkers-vendors/story-MlKytsFdnw9Ic19Zuzg6ZM.html

Last year, more than 67,000 students were admitted in the July session, while 920 students took admissions in the January session. IDOL had lost its recognition from the UGC – the apex higher education institute – in 2018, as MU did not have an accreditation from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) since 2012. However, last year in August, the UGC granted provisional recognition to IDOL to continue its courses only for academic year 2019-20. The recognition was granted on the condition that the university will complete its application for a NAAC accreditation and subsequently get a NAAC score of 3.6 or above on a scale of 4. While the university had applied for a NAAC accreditation last year and submitted its institutional information for quality assessment, the process was stalled because of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown. Keeping the Covid-19 pandemic in view, the UGC on September 4 issued a gazette notification, making changes in the University Grants Commission (Open and Distance Learning) Regulations, 2017, and University Grants Commission (Online Courses or Programmes) Regulations, 2018. Along the lines with these changes, the UGC decided to grant recognition to IDOL, stated the notice uploaded on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-s-distance-education-institute-gets-ugc-nod-to-conduct-admissions-for-academic-year-2020-21/story-GMTucuxBNGh7bJ12r14vzM.html

16-10-2020||Mumbai||Terrace gardening keeps Thane residents occupied during Covid-19 pandemic||Ranjan Yadav, 47, a chef by profession, starts his day by visiting the terrace in his society, where more than 200 potted plants are growing.Yadav spends more than an hour to water the plants and checks the yield for the day. His neighbours also join in watering the plants. These include a variety of vegetables and seasonal fruits. The terrace garden started by the residents has been a boon to the residents during the lockdown.The garden is on two buildings – Lily Co-operative Society within Vijay Garden Complex at Kavesar. The society decided to develop a terrace garden in 2017 and the results are showing now.“With everything shut down for six months, this was the best way for us to spend hours, experimenting and learning more about farming and gardening. We made the most of the lockdown and understood about the vegetables that can be grown across seasons and also tried growing fresh herbs and bell peppers, which were a success,” said Yadav.As the yield from the terrace garden is distributed to all society members, it’s helpful for at least one meal in every household during the lockdown.“There are a few of us who take a lot of interest in gardening and farming process. We share the yield with our neighbours as well. This was a collective initiative and we are using only certain parts of the terrace for the same. During the lockdown, we get to consume healthy organic vegetables,” said Thankiah Nadar, 50, another resident.When the society underwent renovation in 2017, they had many paint buckets that were lying unused. They decided to use them as planters in their terrace to set up a garden and cultivate organic fruits and vegetables. The initiative started with 20 paint buckets. It has now crossed 200 pots and is yielding good results.“From fresh herbs to turmeric and tulsi, we have tried growing different plants. There were a few failed attempts that helped us understand better. The terrace has two different spots of natural light, one area that gets the early morning sun rays and the other spot with the evening mild sun rays. We will be planting strawberries for the upcoming season,” said Reny Varghese, 44, another resident and an avid gardener.These vegetables are not sold commercially but distributed among the society members. “There are some vegetables like egg plants and ladies finger that yield year long. Some fruits are seasonal. We are learning all of these through our experiments,’’ added Nadar.“This organic farming is a key element to my profession as a chef, the results of our amateur experiments are amazing, and we even have herbs like fresh basil. This can be easily started in one’s home or society terrace. It is great to keep one occupied. Moreover, we did not have to worry about the difficulty in going to the market to get daily groceries during the lockdown,” added Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/terrace-gardening-keeps-thane-residents-occupied-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-KyJGteQvm0whsqhdEnXGdI.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||NEET results: Four students from Maharashtra make it to top 50||The results for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions to undergraduate medical and dental courses were released by the National Testing Agency (NTA) late on Friday. This year, four students from Maharashtra made it to the top-50 rank. Eighteen-year-old Ashish Zantye from Malwan, Sindhudurg district, with an all-India rank 19 is the state’s topper, after securing 710 marks out of the total score of 720. While he attended his junior college on weekdays, Zantye travelled to Goa during weekends to prepare for his entrance exam with a local coaching institute. “Many students in Malwan prepare for the all-India entrance exams by traveling to Goa over the weekends. My focus was on performing well in the Class 12 boards as well as in NEET. I hope to bag a seat either in AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences), Delhi, or KEM Hospital (King Edward Memorial) in Mumbai for my MBBS degree,” said Zantye, whose mother is a gynaecologist and father a physician. “I’ll either pursue higher education in radiology or in a non-clinical field, including research,” added Zantye. The others three students who made it to the top 50 are Tejomoy Vadiya (43rd rank), Parth Kadam (45th rank) and Abhay Chillarge (46th rank). This year, NTA had received the highest registrations ever, with 15.97 lakh candidates registering for the exam. Of these, 13.66 lakh students appeared for the exam and 7.71 lakh have now qualified for admissions. Like the past few years, Maharashtra accounted for the highest number of registered candidates for the national medical entrance test with 2.27 lakh students registering for the test. Out of the 1.95 lakh students who appeared for the exam this year, only 79,974 qualified for admissions to undergraduate medical and dental seats, which is the lowest among all the states in India. The qualifying criteria for aspirants in the open category stood at 50 percentile this year also. The eligibility for reserved categories including Other Backward Classes (OBC), Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) stands at 40 percentile and above. The cut-offs to qualify for the exam increased marginally from 119 in 2018 to 134 this year. NTA had released the final answer key for the entrance exam in the afternoon but did not accept a single challenge raised by students this year too. “Many students had challenged two questions specifically from the Biology section and had approached the examination authority with proof. The NTA should scrap the process of challenges because students end up wasting Rs1,000 for every question that they challenge, and in the end are left dejected,” said Akruti Patel, parent of one of the medical aspirants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/neet-results-four-students-from-maharashtra-make-it-to-top-50/story-mCsPjsKzsNTVkxwoXlMPbM.html
16-10-2020||City||Auction of Dawood Ibrahim’s 7 properties on November 10||Fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s seven land parcels in his ancestral village in Ratnagiri district in Konkan will be auctioned by the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (Safema) authorities on November 10. Two flats of Dawood’s aide Iqbal Mirchi will also be auctioned on the same day, Safema officials told HT. Competent authority Harigovind Singh will supervise the auction. Under Safema, the finance ministry had planned to auction all 13 properties of Dawood in the first quarter this year. However, as the Covid pandemic and the lockdown forced them to defer the plan. A Safema officer said all properties can be inspected by prospective bidders on November 2. The application for each property along with the earnest money deposit should reach Safema office before 4pm on November 6. “All three modes of sale – e-auction, public auction and sealed tenders – would be used,” he said. Section 68F of Safema empowers the authority to attach properties of family members and relatives of the fugitive. “As the lockdown has adversely affected people across all sections financially, we are not sure what kind of response we would get,” said another official. In April 2019, Safema officals auctioned a flat admeasuring 600sqft at Gordon Hall Apartments in Nagpada, belonging to Dawood’s sister Haseena Parkar, for ₹1.80 crore. Parker died in 2014 and later her brother Iqbal Kaskar had come to stay there. In 2018, Safema auctioned Dawood’s property, Amina Mansion, on Pakmodia Street. The reserved price of the property was ₹79.43 lakh, and it was won by the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) for ₹3.51 crore. In November 2017, the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) had made the highest bid for the three sealed properties of the fugitive don. The Rounaq Afroz restaurant, also known as Delhi Zaika, was sold for ₹4.53 crore. Six flats in Damarwala building were sold for ₹3.53 crore, while Shabnam Guest House fetched a price of ₹3.52 crore. To be auctioned at Mumbake village taluka, Khed Survey number 150 (20 gunthas); reserved price: ₹1.52lakh Survey number 151 (27 gunthas); reserved price: ₹2.05lakh Survey number 152 (29.30 gunthas); reserved price: ₹2.23lakh Survey number 153 (24.90 gunthas); reserved price: ₹1.89lakh Survey number 155 (18 gunthas); reserved price: ₹1.38lakh Survey number 181 (27 gunthas) [Land having two-storey bungalow – house number 178 and 172]; reserved price: ₹5.35lakh Survey number 81 (30 gunthas) [Land and structure for petrol pump and other buildings] at Lote, Khed; reserved price: ₹61.48lakh Two flats, 501/502, in Milton Apartments on Juhu Tara Road in Santacruz (West), belonging to Iqbal Mirchi, would also be sold||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/auction-of-dawood-ibrahim-s-7-properties-on-november-10/story-BbwD8MU3v9HMnEhSy31ajJ.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 tally rises to 1,576,062; death toll is 40,512||Maharashtra on Friday reported 11,447 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s tally to 1,576,062. The state also reported 306 fatalities, pushing up the toll to 40,512. Active cases in Maharashtra stood at 189,715. Mumbai, meanwhile, witnessed 1,823 new infections, which took the city’s case tally to 238,544. Thirty seven fatalities took Mumbai’s death toll to 9,638. The city’s has 22,884 active cases as of Friday. Of the 306 fatalities reported across the state on Friday, 111 were from the past 48 hours, 70 from the previous week and 125 from the period before that, according to the state health department data. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) remained unchanged from Thursday at 2.63%.While Maharashtra has witnessed a steady decline in fresh Covid-19 cases over the past fortnight, the state is also witnessing a gradual slide in fatalities too. A comparison of death figures from the first fortnight of September and the same period in October revealed a 22% drop in fatalities. In the first 15 days of September, the state recorded 5,826 deaths, which dropped to 4,534 in October. State health department officials attributed the declining fatalities to better clinical management, timely referral to hospitals and the state government’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ programme.“The situation is stabilising in terms of fresh cases. But this curve could reverse in the next three weeks with the festive season coming up. Besides, we have seen decline in deaths too. This is owing to months of effort in standardising treatment protocol, clinical management. With patients referred to hospitals on time, it helps doctors save lives. The ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign, too, has helped in creating awareness, identifying probable cases, which were then timely referred to hospitals,” said a senior health department official.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of the state technical committee on communicable diseases and former state health commissioner, said, efforts of the past few months are fructifying now, but not to the extent of what was desired. “The trend we are seeing is definitely a positive sign. People are now coming forward to get tested and seek medical intervention. Referrals to hospitals are getting quicker, but the percentage of people dying in the first 48 hours [of admission] is still on the higher side. However, it is coming down,” he said.According to Salunkhe, the change in clinical management protocol, which is developed by the task force, is giving opportunities to physicians to follow a standardised process. “For instance, Remdesivir was given late, but now we have said that it has to be given at the right time – not too early, not too late. Similarly, in case of steroids. Doctors are getting confident about treating more patients. The situation in Pune is also getting better and overall we are seeing a downward trend. However, we want it [CFR] to reduce further, and come under 1%,” he said.The CFR in the state remained at 2.64% for 11 days (between October 3 and October 13), and it has been at 2.63% since October 14. “The reason for CFR remaining constant is that if the denominator [confirmed cases] is getting reduced, naturally the rate will remain higher,” Salunkhe said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra is set to cross eight million Covid-19 tests on Saturday, as the state has so far tested 79,89,693 samples. The state’s overall positivity rate stands at 19.73%. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 75,042 samples. Currently, 2,333,522 people are in home quarantine and 23,409 people are in institutional quarantine facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-19-tally-rises-to-1-576-062-death-toll-is-40-512/story-MxswNE9yJKpe8TGYqVFUMO.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks IIT-B to consider admitting student who did not get selection intimation||The Bombay high court on Friday expressed surprise that an institute like the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) could make a mistake due to technological lapses and directed it to consider granting admission to a student to a post-graduate diploma course in the Industrial Design Centre at IIT-B for the current academic year. After the court was informed that the institute had failed to inform the student from the reserved category about his selection for admission to the course as the mail sent to him ended up in the spam folder and did not reach him before the close of the admission process, the court held that though the student was at fault by not checking the IIT-B website to ascertain whether he had been shortlisted, the institute had also faulted in not ensuring that the intimation mail had reached him. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the petition filed by 23-year-old Prathmesh Pedamkar, was informed by advocate Ashraf Shaikh that his client had cleared all the admission processes of IIT-B till July 22 and had been awaiting the intimation from the institute with regards to selection. However, as he did not receive any intimation till August 21 he wrote to the institute where he was informed that he had been selected for admission, however as had not responded by the deadline of August 6 another student had been given the seat. Shaikh submitted that on inquiry his client learnt that the institute had sent an intimation mail on August 2 however the same had gone into the spam folder. Shaikh added that 18 other students like his client had not received the mail. Shaikh submitted that as his client had failed to take admission by the stipulated deadline for no fault of his, the institute should be directed to grant him admission. However, the advocate for the institute informed the court that though the intimation mail had not reached 19 students, 14 of them had checked the website and on finding their names on the list had come to the institute and secured their admission. The advocate further added that though there was a lapse on the part of the institute, the student did not exercise due diligence to check the website and hence he could not seek any relief. He further submitted that lectures for the course had started on August 10 and as the student was a reserved category student and the seats were limited to 17 no exception could be made out for him. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that it was surprised that an institute such as IIT-B could have such technological lapses. The court then directed the institute to consider admitting the student to the course this year or next year. However, when the institute refused, the bench asked Shaikh to bring past judgements wherein courts had directed authorities to admit students or hire persons on posts either in the same year or the next year without having to go through the selection process and posted the matter for hearing on Monday, October 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-iit-b-to-consider-admitting-student-who-did-not-get-selection-intimation/story-2m2ltuSIRjPKI2zZ1MbPEK.html
16-10-2020||City||Palghar lynching case: Ex-Palghar SP transferred to Maharashtra Police Academy in Nashik||Five months after Gaurav Singh, former superintendent of police (SP), Palghar, was sent on compulsory leave by state home minister Anil Deshmukh following the Palghar lynching case, he has now been posted as a superintendent of the Maharashtra Police Academy, Nashik, by the state home ministry. This was announced in an order dated October 14 by the state home department that included postings of 23 IAS and IPS officers.Singh was asked to proceed on compulsory leave on May 8 after the state crime investigation department (CID) took over the probe from the Kasa police.Two sadhus and their driver were lynched by a huge mob outside Gadhchinchale village, 110 kilometres from Palghar in Maharashtra on April 16. They were attacked on the suspicion of being child-lifters.The Kasa police, under whose jurisdiction the crime had taken place, had come under strong criticism for mishandling of the lynching. Singh had then suspended two officers who were part of the investigation. However, as pressure mounted on the state to take action against the police personnel, Singh was sent on compulsory leave. An online petition was undertaken to get back Singh to Palghar but was replaced by Dattatray Shinde the new SP of Palghar. The state later dismissed the service of the then Kasa police in-charge assistant inspector Anandrao Kale, slapped compulsory retirement on two policemen and 15 constables were penalised for dereliction of duty in the Palghar lynching case.The state government in a reply to the Supreme Court to a petition seeking handing over the case to a central agency, had last Wednesday, mentioned that no dereliction of duty was found from Singh’s side and thus was given a clean chit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-case-ex-palghar-sp-transferred-to-maharashtra-police-academy-in-nashik/story-wJruXTa1PswYYsAWyO5ePK.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body ward committee elections: BJP leaders cry foul play over Sena candidate’s victory||A heated argument broke out between the leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena along with that of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials during the ward committee elections after Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Friday announced Sena’s Deepmala Badhe as the elected chairperson for S and T ward covering areas like Mulund, Bhandup, Kanjurmarg and Vikhroli in the eastern suburbs. The ward committee has 20 corporators as members.The BJP alleged that Pednekar wrongly declared one vote of the BJP corporator invalid, allowing Sena candidate to win the elections. Sena had nominated Badhe as their candidate for the chairmanship, while BJP nominated Jagruti Patil as its candidate.Out of the total 20 voters who are corporators, Sena had eight, BJP had 10 and both Congress and NCP had one corporator each. During the election, NCP and Congress both voted for Sena that resulted in Sena’s candidate acquiring 10 votes.However, BJP said their 10 corporators also voted for BJP’s candidate, but their one vote was declared invalid by the mayor.Prakash Gangadhare, BJP corporator from Mulund said, “We will challenge this in the court, considering, technically, both Sena and BJP were to get 10 votes each. Further, after the draw, we were expecting the lottery system of picking up chits to decide the winner, but our one vote was declared invalid.”In a statement issued, BJP said, “Our corporators raised objections and insisted on showing the ballot papers. Despite raising objections, the mayor did not answer them and ran straight home after wrapping up the ballot box. Ballot papers disappeared from the hall.”Pednekar said, “Everyone knew that they have to sign inside the box against a particular candidate. In this case, the signature of one voter had gone outside the box, hence one vote was declared invalid. There is no question of foul play.”Municipal secretary Sangeeta Sharma whose department conducts the elections was not available for comment.However, a BMC official on conditions of anonymity said, “We have counted one vote of BJP corporator Rajani Keni from Mulund as invalid. The reason for this was because her signature went out of the designated box meant for signing against a particular candidate. We have categorically explained that signatures have to be inside the box.”Keni said, “I don’t feel my signature had gone out of the box. They have not communicated us anything on why my vote was declared invalid. If my signature had gone out of the box, they could have shown the ballot paper and announced the same in the house. We will challenge this in court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-ward-committee-elections-bjp-leaders-cry-foul-play-over-sena-candidate-s-victory/story-G2uHZ29uTAzMin8dQwEl3K.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt wants Mumbai local trains opened for women from Saturday; Railways says can’t happen immediately||In a first step to open Mumbai’s local trains for all commuters, the Maharashtra government on Friday asked the Railways to allow women to travel on the suburban network from Saturday, between 11am and 3pm and 7pm till day’s services stop. The Western and Central Railways, which operate the local trains, however, informed the government that allowing women commuters immediately won’t be possible unless an assessment is done. Mumbai’s local trains, used by around 8 million people daily pre-Covid-19, were suspended on March 23 after the state went into a lockdown. Some services, however, resumed on June 15, with the state allowing only essential services workers, differently-abled people and cancer patients to use the trains. The Central Railway currently operates 481 daily services, while the Western Railway runs 700 as against their regular 1,774 and 1,367 services, respectively.Friday’s move by the state is seen as a step towards encouraging private offices to adopt staggered working hours for their staff to avoid crowding in trains. The plan, a government official said, was to allow women during non-peak hours as the peak-hour trains for essential workers are already crowded even with social distancing being followed. In a letter to general managers of Central and Western Railways, Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department of the state, reques-ted allowing all women commuters on local trains during a stipulated time. However, within hours, the lack of coordination between authorities came to the fore, with both zonal railways writing back, expressing their inability to allow women commuters in trains with immediate effect and asking the state to assess the quantum of passengers likely to increase. “You are requested to assess the quantum of passengers likely to increase due to the above stated stream of traffic,” stated the letter from Western Railway. “In this connection, it is suggested that a joint meeting between railway officials and state government be organised to work out modalities. The proposal sent by you has been referred to the Railway Board for approval. Further course of action and date of permission for women passengers to travel will be decided accordingly.”Multiple railway officials, who did not wish to be named, said not knowing the number of passengers that will commute by the local trains after the permission is granted can lead to crowding inside compartments. “Evaluating the increase in number of passengers is important or it could lead to crowding. We have asked the state government to discuss this with us,” said one of the officials.State government officials, on condition of anonymity, said the move was a step towards opening up activities in graded manner. “It is the first step towards unlocking train services for all. We are taking stock of how much crowd can the trains handle keeping in mind social distancing. This is also an attempt to encourage the private sector to go in for staggered work hours. In the next phase, we may allow men to travel at odd hours, to see if it works. Senior citizens and families could be allowed at non-peak hours,” said an official, adding that allowing women to travel before 11am, during peak hours, was not possible.“Trains meant for emergency service workers are already crowded, defeating the whole idea of social distancing amid the pandemic. Railway authorities have reported to us that around 40% commuters travelling in trains meant for essential services are people who are not meant to be there and some of them have fake identity cards and QR codes. Allowing all women commuters during peak hours will lead to more crowding,” the official said. State chief secretary Sanjay Kumar had held a meeting with railway and police officials earlier this week to deliberate upon the stagger work hours plan for public and private sector companies. Although authorities unanimously agreed to the idea, they could not find a way to implement it. “Monitoring and enforcement of the staggered timing could be a big challenge for authorities. During the next rounds of meeting, we will deliberate upon the sectors and areas to focus upon for the implementation of the concept,” said another government official. Meanwhile railway officials said a crucial decision such as allowing all women commuters will not be taken without seeking guidance of the Railway minister Piyush Goyal. Incidentally, Goyal on Friday tweeted that he would be undergoing a medical procedure. “I shall be undergoing a procedure to remove a kidney stone. Will be back soon,” Goyal had tweeted on Friday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-wants-mumbai-local-trains-opened-for-women-from-saturday-railways-says-can-t-happen-immediately/story-OshALmquxqmZv7SNshhYiK.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon withdrawal for Mumbai, Maharashtra may be delayed by at least one more week: IMD||The southwest monsoon withdrawal from Mumbai and Maharashtra is likely to be delayed by at least another week, declared the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday, terming it “one of the most delayed withdrawals ever” for the city and state. This year’s monsoon season for Mumbai has already stretched to 124 days – from June 14 to October 16 –beyond the normal duration of 120 – from June 11 to October 8.“Weather conditions are becoming favourable for the formation of a low pressure weather system over Bay of Bengal again around October 19. This would lead to the extension of the monsoon withdrawal over Mumbai, Maharashtra and rest of central India by at least another week,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD. “There is no chance of withdrawal at the moment. It will take at least seven more days for withdrawal from Mumbai and another nine days from Maharashtra.” Meanwhile, thundershowers witnessed in the city over the past two days not only delayed monsoon retrieval but also led to much cleaner air. The city witnessed a clear blue sky interspersed with white clouds throughout Friday. According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality index (AQI) on Friday was 42 (good) during the day and 46 (good) in the evening. AQI from all 10 locations saw levels either in the ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ categories. Malad was the only location that recorded a spike in nitrogen dioxide levels, with an AQI of 218 (poor) on Friday. An AQI of 44 (good) has been predicted for Saturday.“Thundershowers have washed away the pollutants from the city’s air and movement of the low pressure system and rain clouds over the Arabian Sea along the Maharashtra coast owing to easterly winds led to the bright blue sky and sunny weather during the day,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Friday evening, however, saw cloud cover and light isolated rain in some parts of the island city and suburbs.

16-10-2020||Noida||First day, old shows and cold response: Deserted look at Noida cinema halls||Almost all cinema halls and multiplexes in Gautam Budh Nagar, which reopened after over seven months’ lockdown, wore deserted looks on Friday. Among the Hindi movies screened were those that were already released, such as Malang, Tanhaji, Thappad and Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan.But only 50 tickets were sold at all prominent multiplexes in Noida and Greater Noida. English movies like My Spy and 1917 also were sparsely watched with not more than two and 26 seats booked, respectively. Several other movies had no viewers. Earlier, the district administration had given permission to run the movies to seven multiplexes and three cinema halls.Several managers said that while the response was not entirely unexpected, they plan to continue roll movies released before the lockdown till December at least. Shamim Anwar of GIP Mall said that the cinema hall operators don’t have any alternative. “We will have to continue with the old movies till December as the next releases are slated for then. To ensure proper sanitization, we have laid anti-microbial film on all surfaces for the protection of viewers and staff,” he said. Angad Makan of Logix Mall said that due to frequent sanitisation and chessboard seating, the cost of shows has increased for them. “Despite this, we have reduced the price of our tickets. Earlier, we used to screen five shows every day, but now it has been reduced to three shows as the sanitization of entire auditorium and food court areas have been made mandatory. We have also increased the interval time to 30 minutes, to ensure social distancing among the viewers,” he said. Most of the visitors who watched movies in the theatres said that they had come to create a personal record of sorts -- to be among the first patrons after the lockdown. Sanjana Singh, a BA student of Delhi University, came to watch Hrithik Roshan-starrer War in GIP Mall. “I was more interested in feeling the vibe of a cinema hall after seven months. I didn’t have any interest in the movie, but wanted to be the part of the first lot of cinema goers in the post-Covid period,” she said. Deepika Sinha, a medical college student, came to wathc a movie at the Inox multiplex in sector Beta in Greater Noida. “I came to celebrate my friend’s birthday. The mall was the best place for get together and watching movie together in a chessboard sitting arrangement was fun. The auditorium had only five viewers and all of them were us,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/first-day-old-shows-and-cold-response-deserted-look-at-noida-cinema-halls/story-w1nFDcesPABdF5Gb3z8SPM.html
16-10-2020||Noida||Yeida invites proposals for Noida Film City from developers||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) on Friday said it has started the process of inviting proposals from prospective developers who can work on the Film City project, proposed in Sector 21 along the Yamuna Expressway.The process was done upon directions from the Uttar Pradesh government. Earlier, the state government had planned to develop the Film City via UP Film Bandhu, a state agency that handles projects related to films.“However, now the government wants the Yeida to hire a consultant or developer who can prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for this project and help in developing this mega project. Therefore, we have issued a request for proposal so that interested consultants or developers can submit their proposals. Once these are submitted, we will select a consultant,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.State additional chief secretary Navneet Sehgal, on October 14, had wrote Singh saying: “Because the Film City project is to be put on fast-track it is requested that to set up the Film City, a consultant or developer should be roped in by the Yamuna authority itself.”The project was announced by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on September 18 this year. Subsequently, the Yeida on September 20 had sent a proposal stating that it has 780 acres earmarked for industrial purposes and 220 acres for commercial usage in Sector 21, which would be suitable to set up a film city. The land is located only six kilometre from the Jewar airport and 12 km from the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.“Once a consultant or developer is roped in, a DPR will be prepared, after which we will take the project to the next stage,” said Singh.The authority has been exploring three models – public-private-partnership, to be developed by the authority, or by a single developer.The authority has discussed these three models to decide the future course of action.“After the preparation of the DPR, the authority will decide the model most suitable to develop the Film City, following directions from the state government,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yeida-invites-proposals-for-noida-film-city-from-developers/story-YdzIa4tgLiP87Nmsr1w2YI.html
16-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Kaushambi RWAs move Supreme Court for pollution-free surroundings||Ghaziabad: The Kaushambi apartments’ residents’ welfare association (Karwa) has filed a petition at the Supreme Court with contention to plug different sources of pollution affecting the township. While admitting the plea, the apex court on October 15 directed for issue of notice to respondents which include different Uttar Pradesh agencies and also some departments from Delhi.The township is located next to East Delhi’s Anand Vihar border under the jurisdiction of Ghaziabad district. It has about 22 high-rise societies with an estimated population of 20,000. The office bearers of Karwa said they have filed three petitions with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) since 2015 to make Kaushambi’s surroundings pollution-free.“In these petitions, the tribunal gave various orders from time to time but the agencies have been lax in implementation. This is why we had to move the Supreme Court. Our township is affected by different sources of pollution and we have requested the court to provide remedy,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa. Ashapushp Vihar Awas Vkas Samiti Ltd, Kaushambi, is a co-petitioner in the case. Mittal added that the initial petition with NGT was filed in September 2015 while the second petition was filed in August 2016 while a contempt application was filed in May 2019. In their petition, Karwa has stated that nearby areas in east Delhi and localities in Ghaziabad including Kaushambi, Vaishali, Indirapuram and Vasundhara, etc are suffering from air, noise and waste pollution due to garbage dumps at Ghazipur and Kaushambi, besides traffic congestion at the Anand Vihar ISBT, a UP Roadways depot in Kaushambi, and drains in Sahibabad, among other sources.They have contended before the apex court to direct agencies to prepare a detailed, workable and effective environmental protection plan to contain pollution in the township and surrounding areas with monitoring mechanisms of the implementation of a plan, and implementation thereof in a period of one year. They have also contended for directions to prohibit diesel buses in the township as well as the use of pressure horns, besides proper parking for buses, autos, etc., and removal of encroachment by street vendors. The list of 15 respondents also includes divisional commissioner (Meerut), the Ghaziabad district magistrate, UP pollution control board, the Ghaziabad municipal corporation, and UP state road transport corporation (UPSRTC), among others. When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey declined immediate comments on the issue, stating that the matter was sub-judice. MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner and Utsav Sharma, the regional officer of the UPPCB, said that they will respond appropriately before the apex court once the notices are received.The officials of the UPSRTC, however, said that they have banned the use of pressure horns in their buses and if any such horns are used, they are used by private buses.“Out of about 530 buses operating from Ghaziabad, we have about 130 which have been converted to CNG while the rest are in different phases of conversion. However, they are using BS VI standard fuel. We have specially come up with a policy that buses which are more than 10-years-old are either transferred from here or sold in auctions,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC. “We have about 100 contractual buses in Ghaziabad and they have a contract of about 10 years. We have now made it a policy that any buses taken on contract will mandatorily use CNG fuel. So, buses whose contract gets over are required to rejoin the contract only if they come with CNG equipment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-kaushambi-rwas-move-supreme-court-for-pollution-free-surroundings/story-VDr3JxRzkX5Lb7rodCdR2J.html
16-10-2020||Noida||In interim order, high court restrains UP’s compounding scheme||The Allahabad high court has stayed the Uttar Pradesh government’s “self-assessment compounding scheme - 2020”, till further orders. The scheme allowed for the regularisation of certain “illegal” construction on residential and commercial plots against a payment.The court’s interim order dated October 7 has directed state officials to file personal affidavits justifying the scheme. The next hearing is scheduled for October 20. “As substantial damage to the aim and objectives of planned development is likely to occur if the compounding scheme, 2020 is given effect to, therefore, the state government as also all the development authorities within the state of Uttar Pradesh are restrained from compounding any illegal constructions pursuant to the compounding scheme – 2020, notified by the state government on July 15, 2020,” the interim order read. The directions came after petitioner Mohd. Meherban Ansari from Saharanpur contended that a sealing order was passed against his premises and he wished to benefit from the scheme. It is also said that several “impermissible developments (construction)” under the building by-laws have been made compoundable under the scheme. The officials of the Ghaziabad development authority said that they have also received a communication to the effect from the state officials and have stopped taking any further applications under the scheme. “We were expecting about 1500 applications under the scheme and so far, we have received only 250. For now, the directions of the high court will be complied with. The state government will take up the issue before the court during next hearing,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner. Applications under the scheme were invited for a period of six months up to January 21, 2021 and the disposal of applications was to be done till April 21, 2021. At present 10% extra construction of the sanctioned floor area ratio (FAR) is compoundable under normal circumstances for group housing (plots 2000 square metres and above). Now, it has been relaxed and doubled to 20% under the scheme, said officials. Under the new scheme, the plots below 2000 sqm are divided into two categories – plots below 300 sqm and others having 300 sqm or above but less than 2000 sqm. The scheme provided for regularisation of more of front, rear and side setback areas. The officials said that the rates of compounding were also reduced by almost half under the new scheme. The court observed that the authorities are expected to stop illegal construction and not encourage such illegal construction upon payment of hefty amount. “This would clearly discourage the honest citizens who ensure compliance of the laws by obtaining prior permission as per the Act of 1973 (UP Urban Planning & Development Act), in as much as they are subjected to stricter norms provided in the building by-laws, while those who violate the law are allowed to raise much large constructions, which is not even permissible in the building by-laws,” the order, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-interim-order-high-court-restrains-up-s-compounding-scheme/story-BthD2mEedULQrx1awzu6kK.html
16-10-2020||Noida||Air quality improves marginally as wind speed picks up in in Ghaziabad, Noida||Ghaziabad: An improvement in wind speed helped to better the air quality in Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida to “poor” on Friday from “very poor” a day earlier.The air quality index (AQI), as per the central pollution control board, for the day stood at 266, 274 and 247 for Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida, respectively. “The AQI levels have come down due to increase in wind speed to about 10kmph as against 6-7kmph during past couple of days. This has led to faster dispersal of pollutants. On the other hand, the wind direction which is presently north-westerly is also likely to change to north-easterly with winds coming in from Uttarakhand and Meerut side from October 17-18,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of Indian Meteorological Department’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. “This will also reduce the impact of any pollution coming in from Punjab and Haryana with respect to stubble burning which is generally brought by north-westerly winds. Further, there is no indication of any rainfall activity in coming days.” An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.” The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) also said in a forecast on Friday that the marginal improvement in surface wind speed has led to improved ventilation and AQI. “Low surface winds are expected today (October 16) and AQI likely to stay in higher-end poor to the lower end of very poor for tomorrow. Marginal improvement in surface winds is expected by 17th October and poor AQI is forecasted. Air quality is forecasted to further improve to lower end of poor category by 18th October,” its statement read. As per CPCB’s records, all the four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad, one in Greater Noida and all four in Noida stood under ‘poor’ category. One monitoring station of Knowledge Park V in Greater Noida however recorded AQI at 301 under ‘very poor’ category at 4pm as per CPCB records. The officials of the UP-pollution control board (UPPCB) said that they are continuing with regular monitoring as well as enforcement drives in order to check rising pollution levels. “Our drive has been more intensive in areas of Loni which has presence of illegal factories and resulting in high levels of air pollution at local level. On Friday, we demolished 42 such factories at Amit Vihar in Loni which were primarily indulged in using furnace and resulting air pollution,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. He added that three teams of UPPCB have been formed to keep a tab on running of DG-sets as well as other violations. “The teams are ensuring that operation of DG-sets is restricted as per the directions given by the Environment (Pollution and Control) Authority besides the teams are also ensuring that other violations like burning of garbage, industrial emissions etc are also brought to notice and curbed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-improves-marginally-as-wind-speed-picks-up-in-in-ghaziabad-noida/story-6SrJ3AP9BivfP60ZJ2dsRM.html

However, local residents including Aarey tribals opposed and protested against this work on Thursday and Friday. We were then showed a copy of the work order, flagged the same to the local police and the state environment minister,” said a member of the Aarey Conservation Group who visited the spot on Friday. “In the bargain, however, small to medium 20 trees were lost. Thackeray clarified that no boundary wall construction was needed since the area (328.9ha) was already declared a forest and included the 40.46ha plot. “We have given a stop-work order because the zoo does not exist anymore,” Thackeray said, adding, “This was an old tender order from March this year, which the contractor has apparently been executing without any knowledge of the state’s recent declaration of the area as reserved forest. I have asked for a report on it.”Local residents, however, said they were perturbed by the construction.“There are random incidents of construction and machinery moving within Aarey from time to time or land acquisition for proposed projects even after the state government has established its stand that the area is majorly a forest. Since there are different state department-owned lands, there is confusion on who is carrying out the work but unfortunately, we residents are always at the receiving end,” said a resident of Khambachapada requesting anonymity.A senior PWD official said, “We are yet to receive a written order from the state but the work has been stopped on site.”Environmentalist Zoru Bhathena said, “Though excavator machines were razing the natural surroundings in that area, a prompt response by local residents followed by the environment minister’s immediate action citing that this was an old contract only shows that Aarey is blessed that it has a government that listens and acts immediately on such matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/environment-minister-stops-work-on-wall-construction-around-scrapped-zoo-project-at-aarey-around-20-trees-felled-say-activists/story-8zvT7wjHjNnYDf5xEUdEJO.html

Of these, nearly 80% have submitted their undertakings.” On October 15, the HSPCB issued a letter to all units falling within the jurisdiction of HSPCB’s south region, asking them to provide an undertaking.As per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) guidelines, if the pollution index score of an industry that measures the pollution load is above 60 then the unit falls under the red category. In orange category, the pollution index score is between 41 to 50. For the green category it has to be between 21 to 40. In an order letter issued by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) for the implementation Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to prevent air pollution from slipping to very poor to severe category, industries particularly in the red and orange categories were directed to provide an undertaking to the pollution control board on using authorised fuel. Also, they have been asked not to operate without adequate pollution-control measures. According to Singh, at least 30 departments in the district have been asked to designate nodal officers from their respective departments for Grap implementation. On Friday, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) imposed a fine of ₹63,000 for violating Grap norms. Out of this, ₹13,000 has been imposed on burning garbage and ₹50,000 for burning biomass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industries-having-high-pollution-load-submit-affidavits-to-hspcb/story-cJsKYs23cKBnJ15IiojBYM.html
16-10-2020||Gurugram||20 residential societies in Gurugram submit undertakings for exemption from ban on diesel gensets||The Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL) on Friday reached out to the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) with the detailed affidavits of at least 20 residential societies that have sought exemption from the ban on diesel gensets.On Thursday, Epca chairman Bhure Lal had directed the state power department to submit a comprehensive affidavit on the power situation of all the residential societies that are still dependent on diesel gensets. Trilok Chand Gupta, additional chief secretary, power , who is also the chairman HVPNL, said, “At least 23 colonisers have sought exemption in Gurugram. Out of these, three are fully dependent upon diesel gensets, while the remaining 20 are partially dependent. On Friday, affidavits given by 20 colonisers have been submitted to the Epca.” “It is likely that these societies in the old and new sectors of Gurugram will get exemption as they have said that due to Covid-19 pandemic, they could not put in place the required electricity infrastructure for regular power connection,” said Gupta.As reported by Hindustan Times on Thursday, this is the fourth consecutive year when Gurugram can get exemption from the purview of the Graded Response Action Plan’s (Grap) clauses pertaining to the use of diesel generators between October 15 to March 15.According to him, the exemption, however, can be for a limited time period as Epca has asked the power department to lay down a strict schedule for these colonies partially or fully dependent on diesel gensets. “If developers fulfil certain criteria for regular connection within a time frame, then power will be supplied to them at the earliest,” said Gupta.According to him, the state is not reeling under power deficit, therefore, new connections can be easily given. “The state at present has surplus power of 4,000 megawatt (MW). Nearly 8,000 MW is being transmitted by the HVPNL,” said Gupta. Vinita Singh, chief engineer, Smart Grid project, who also has the additional charge of chief engineer, Delhi circle, attended the meeting called by the power utility to discuss the situation in the aftermath of the directions issued by Epca, which has put a ban on the use of diesel gensets from October 15. She said that the 20 developers have submitted an undertaking that they will complete the necessary electricity infrastructure within a year. “The developers have given different timelines in which they will submit bank guarantees, manage to get land for power substations, and also set them up. We have adequate power and connections will be given as soon they comply with norms,” said Singh. The undertaking has also been submitted to the state pollution control department, which shall be compiled and submitted to Epca, she said. When asked why the developers were not able to complete the required infrastructure, Singh said that there were issues related to availability of land in the new sectors. “In some cases, four or five developers have to arrange for the land but it is either not available or is too far away, thereby making it unfeasible for Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd (DHBVN) to lay powerlines. The developers have been asked to furnish bank guarantees and find a solution to these problems within a year,” said Singh. DHBVN officials also hinted that corrective action must be taken within a year as otherwise it will be difficult to manage the power situation in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/20-residential-societies-in-gurugram-submit-undertakings-for-exemption-from-ban-on-diesel-gensets/story-mcrK6w3SEPBUNIvOs4LmqM.html
16-10-2020||Gurugram||30,000 rooftop rainwater harvesting systems capable of recharging 1.8 million litres installed||Around 30,000 rooftop rainwater harvesting systems have been installed across the city, which, in their optimum capacity, can help recharge around 1.8 million litres of groundwater. This was revealed during a joint session of the drainage committees of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday.The committees were formed after severe waterlogging was reported in August this year, which flooded seven underpasses, low-lying houses, and most roads across the city.On Friday, a joint meeting of the officials involved in both committees was held and chaired by Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG, at the civic body’s Sector 34 office.At the meeting, retired chief engineer of Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), KK Bhugra, who is chairing the GMDA’s drainage committee, said that the drainage system in Gurugram has been developed by different departments, due to which there is a difference in height. He stressed this needed to be fixed on an immediate basis.Along with this, he said that the departments concerned should start cleaning and repairing the drainage in time so that the work is completed before the next monsoon season. “According to a survey, about 30,000 rooftop rainwater harvesting systems are installed in Gurugram. If they work correctly, we can pour 1.8 million litres of water into the ground. Steps have to be taken for this. If someone is not maintaining or operating them properly, action should be taken against them. The mandate of effective stormwater drainage plan is in the act of GMDA. It should be prepared and published and claims and objections should also be sought from residents on it,” said Bhugra. Bhugda added that there used to be five big dams in Gurugram but today due to urbanisation they are almost defunct. As an alternative, he suggested building small dams. In addition, he also insisted on making recharge valves as far as possible.During the meeting, MCG officials disclosed that they had received 51 complaints and 25 suggestions from residents and RWAs regarding localised drainage issues and added that the important ones should be highlighted in the GMDA’s committee report. Kaur said that the MCG’s executive engineers have already initiated action on the 51 suggestions and added that the two public bodies need to jointly prepare a better drainage plan to help resolve waterlogging issues in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/30-000-rooftop-rainwater-harvesting-systems-capable-of-recharging-1-8-million-litres-installed/story-gP45PDHJdXipSS9t7VmbyL.html

The track record of the Congress in maintaining law and order situation in known to all.”(With input from Anand Nigam in Ujjain)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/sit-begins-probe-in-ujjain-illicit-hooch-tragedy-that-claimed-over-10-lives/story-Arahov9CH5C0PRcHKaJlGN.html
16-10-2020||Gurugram||Affordable developers inn Gurugram asked to raise demands based on basis of construction||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Friday asked developers of affordable housing projects in Gurugram to demand money from buyers only on the basis of the status of projects. Some of them were also asked to submit construction linked payment plan. The directions were issued during a review meeting of such projects in the city. The city has 80 affordable housing projects in various stages of construction that were launched under the new affordable housing policy. As per the department, at least 20 were delayed and the several others have not met their construction targets despite taking money from the buyers. Now, a number of buyers were complaining, prompting the department to act.The meeting was attended by the representatives of several developers and was chaired by senior town planner Ravi Sihag and district town planner RS Bhath.During the meeting, officials also made it clear that in case work on the projects is not started or expedited and undue money taken from buyers then they would recommend registration of FIR against them. In the meeting, RS Bhath asked developers to increase the number of workers on site and ensure that complaints of buyers for delays are addressed. “The plea that Covid-19 delayed work can’t be admitted forever. The developers will have to take money as per norms and build accordingly,” he said. Officials said those who have taken money for the project and yet have not met their construction targets would be asked to refund.In the matter related to OSB Developers that has two projects in sectors 69 and 109, Sihag directed the developer to submit a construction linked plan and expedite the pace of construction. “The developer should also not raise any demand from the buyers as they have already taken almost half the money of the project, while work on the ground has been minimal. If the pace of work is not increased, then the department will initiate penal action for violating norms,” he said. The representatives of OSB Developers agreed to submit the plan and accelerate pace of construction.A similar direction was given to developers of another project in sector 37 that had similar issues.Officials also directed the developer of Astare Green Court project in sector 90 to ensure that project is completed by December. The developers assured the department that they would accelerate work. Sihag also said that they have asked the developers to submit status report every 15 days so that department can keep track of projects.

Officials concerned have been given directions to ensure compliance of listed guidelines,” said Khatri. Yugdutt Sharma, temple officer of Sheetla Mata Mandir, said Covid-19 tests of all those stationed inside the temple have already been carried out as a safety measure, and to ensure strict compliance of safety guidelines, a heavy presence of Gurugram police, temple staff, and MCG officials will be prevalent. “Usually, we have 0.5 TO 0.6 million visitors during the Navratri Mela. This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, we are anticipating around 0.3 to 0.4 million visitors. To adhere to safety measures, around 60 home guards of Gurugram Police, 200 police officials including 50 women constables, and around 50 officials of the MCG have been deployed both inside and outside the temple complex. The MCG staff will be responsible for issuing on-the-spot fines for mask violations and sanitising the temple premises while Gurugram Police officials and around 200 of our own staff members will be managing the security and adoption of other safety guidelines,” said Sharma. MCG officials said that along with the health department, all officials and workers deployed at the temple, including the head priest, will be tested thrice for Covid-19 during the eight-day festival, once before the starting of the festival, once at the middle of the festival, and once after it ends on October 25, as a precautionary measure.“We have made schedules for sanitising and disinfecting of all religious places across the city and deputed sanitation workers accordingly. Each religious place will be sanitised at least twice daily, during this festival period. Further, we are coordinating with the health department for carrying out tests for Covid-19,” said a senior MCG official, deployed in its health wing.DK Bhardwaj, DCP (traffic), Gurugram Police, said that adequate deployment has been made at the temple to ensure all safety measures relating to traffic management. “We have, however, not enforced any route blockages or diversions around the roads approaching Sheetla Mata Mandir or any other religious place, at present, as we are anticipating that due to Covid-19 outbreak, the rush would be far lower than usual. Regardless, if the volume of devotees and vehicles on any stretch is high, we have deployed the necessary number of traffic marshals along stretches such as the Sheetla Mata Road to manage the situation. If need arises, we will make a traffic plan and give prior information to residents of any alterations regarding routes,” said Bhardwaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/heavy-police-presence-safety-measures-in-place-for-navratri-mela-in-gurugram/story-GuaHXjvhqlHxTAC7gBn97N.html
16-10-2020||Delhi||Covid: Daily RT-PCR tests touch record 15,000-mark, cases above 3,000 in Delhi||The number of RT-PCR tests conducted in a day in Delhi crossed the 15,000 mark for the first time on Friday since the city began testing for the viral Covid-19 that first surfaced in March this year and has since infected 324,459 people. At least 5946 people have succumbed to the virus so far On Friday, at least 15,660 tests using the more accurate molecular RT-PCR method was reported in the daily health bulletin released by the state government. The number of RT-PCR tests have been on the rise for nine days, with the last three days notching record numbers. The number of RT-PCR tests on an average have accounted for 23.6% of the total tests during the last seven days, data shows. This is an increase over the average 19.8% recorded during the week before, and 19.03% in the week before that. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe RT-PCR tests amplify the RNA of the Sars-CoV-2 virus to detect infection. It is very sensitive and less likely to give false negatives as compared to the alternate rapid antigen tests. The rapid antigen tests are cheap, easy to deploy in clinics and dispensaries, and can give the results within 15 minutes. However, the antigen tests are only 50 to 60% sensitive and can throw a lot of false negative results for people, who might actually have the infection. Experts lauded the Delhi government’s efforts to ramp up RT-PCR tests while adding that there was still a lot left to be done. “Any increase in the number of tests, especially RT-PCR tests, is a welcome move. And, the Delhi government is actually doing better than most state governments when it comes to the number of tests. However, there is more that needs to be done. Currently, the government does about 17 tests to get a positive result; on national level this number is anywhere between 11 and 15. In some countries it is as high as 100 to 200 tests for each positive case,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at ICMR. He also added that the government needs to verify a higher proportion of the tests done using RT-PCR. “Currently, a very small percentage of those undergoing rapid antigen tests get a second confirmatory RT PCR tests. This proportion needs to be increased. Anyone who is symptomatic but tests negative should be tested using RT-PCR,” he said.

After a gap of over ten days, Delhi has been recording over 3,000 new cases a day for the last four days as the number of RT-PCR tests is increased by the government. “If more RT-PCR tests are done, you are likely to pick up more cases because the test is more sensitive. This is the reason it is suggested that the less sensitive rapid antigen tests be used in containment zones for screening cases but the RT PCR tests be used everywhere elsewhere,” said Dr Rajinder K Dhamija, professor of medicine and head of department of neurology at Lady Hardinge Medical College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/daily-rt-pcr-tests-touch-record-15-000-mark-infections-above-3-000-in-delhi/story-yMO7RLWsp18wLHcbRIW7oO.html
16-10-2020||Delhi||Registration fee waived for electric vehicles||The Delhi government has notified the waiver of registration fee for electric vehicles (EVs), just days after it had done away with road tax for such vehicles. These initiatives are aimed at encouraging more people to switch over to environment friendly EVs under the government’s new EV Policy. The registration fee waiver was notified on Thursday, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. Sharing a copy of the notification on Twitter, Gahlot said, “Congrats again, Delhi! Next in the list of breakthrough incentives promised by CM Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi government exempts Registration fee on Battery Operated Vehicles. Delhi leads again, the EV way! (sic)” At present, road tax ranges from 4% to 10% of the cost of the vehicle, while registration fee was up to ₹3,000. In addition to these waivers, under the EV Policy, a subsidy of ₹10,000 per kWh (of battery power) is to be given to the first 1,000 electric four-wheelers, with the subsidy capped at ₹1,50,000 per vehicle. A subsidy of ₹5,000 per kWh of battery capacity, with a cap of ₹30,000 per vehicle, is also to be given on the purchase of electric two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, rickshaws and freight vehicles. To push people to shift to EVs, the policy also has a “scrapping incentive” for those who make the switch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/registration-fee-waived-for-electric-vehicles/story-QFdmo7GLyGkLGR6x2OPjLM.html

16-10-2020||Mumbai||‘Monsoon withdrawal from Maharashtra likely to be delayed by another week’: IMD||The weather bureau on Friday said southwest monsoon withdrawal from Maharashtra is likely to be delayed by at least another week.Since the monsoon onset was declared on June 14, the season has already spanned 124 days (till October 16) - much beyond the normal duration of the entire season - and 120 days for Mumbai (from June 11 to October 8).This is expected to be one of the most delayed withdrawals for the city and state in history, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. “Weather conditions are becoming favourable for the formation of a low-pressure weather system over the Bay of Bengal again around October 19. This would lead to the extension of the monsoon withdrawal over Mumbai, Maharashtra and rest of central India by at least another week. There is no chance of withdrawal at the moment. It will take at least seven more days for withdrawal from Mumbai and another nine days from Maharashtra,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Also read: ‘Give him water,’ Jawans applaud as terrorist in J&K surrendersMeanwhile, thundershowers witnessed over the past two days have not only delayed monsoon retrieval but led to much cleaner air over the city as compared to moderate air quality levels earlier this week and this month. The city witnessed a clear blue sky interspersed with white clouds through the day.According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the city’s air quality index (AQI) on Friday was 42 (good) during the day that increased to 46 (good) by the evening. The AQI from all 10 locations saw levels either in the ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ categories. However, Malad was the only location that recorded a spike in nitrogen dioxide levels which was in the poor category (218) on Friday. An AQI of 44 (good) has been predicted for Saturday.“Thundershowers have washed away the pollutants from the city’s air and the movement of the low-pressure system and rain clouds, over the Arabian Sea along the Maharashtra coast due to easterly winds, led to the bright blue sky and sunny weather during the day on Friday,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Friday evening, however, saw cloud cover and light isolated rain across different parts of the city and suburbs. Traces of rain were recorded in the suburbs and south Mumbai between 8.30 and 5.30 pm. The IMD has removed all rain warnings for the next five days and issued a forecast for light to moderate rain till October 21.The concentration of PM2.5 (breathable particulate matter solid and liquid particles 2.5 microns in size or smaller) was 26 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) on Friday in Mumbai - much below the daily safe standard prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board of 60 μg/m³.

16-10-2020||Election:||‘Self-defeating strategy’: Protest mounts over Congress’ selection of candidates in Bihar||Anger and frustration over the choice of seats and award of tickets by the Congress have spilt over in Bihar ahead of the assembly elections. Many senior leaders have questioned the process of seat negotiation with the allies and selection of candidates, alleging that the party was on a self-defeating course by encouraging nepotism and relying on interpersonal relationship among other factors to decide candidates.“The party had the chance to ride high on the anti-incumbency wave and restore its traditional support base among upper castes, minorities and the scheduled castes, but favourable outcome appears to be a distant dream particularly in the current scenario,” said a senior Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) leader.Soon after the Congress announced the candidates for second and the third phase of polling, due on November 3 and 7, former BPCC chief Chandan Bagchi said that the party’s strategy appeared to be self-defeating. “The selection of candidates for the rest two phases was worse than the first. Leaders have been allotted constituencies where they are not familiar with. None of the senior leaders of the state was consulted regarding the selection of candidates,” said Bagchi.Also read: ‘I’m Modi’s Hanuman, will tear open my chest and show if needed’ - Chirag PaswanTo buttress Bagchi’s contention, another BPCC leader said that the party had erred in surrendering sitting and potentially winnable seats to allies. “Seats like Bachhwara, Manjhi, Govindpur, Bhore, among others, which elected Congress leaders in the last elections, have been handed over to the Left parties and the RJD. Additionally, the Congress drew blank in districts like Bhojpur and Jehanabad despite the availability of strong candidates and winning potential,” said the leader, requesting anonymity.Selection of candidates has compounded the problem for party workers. Leaders like Pravin Kushwaha, Gunjan Patel (state youth Congress president), Sanjeev Kumar, Nagendra Paswan Vikal, et al, have been named as candidates for the constituencies where they hardly worked for election purposes. Kushwaha has been allotted Patna City instead of Sultanganj, Patel has been accommodated at Nalanda against his demand for Digha (Patna), Sanjeev is contesting from Vaishali against his crave for Paroo (in Muzaffarpur) and Vikal is contesting from Rosera (Samastipur) even as he worked hard in Patna.Another former BPCC chief Anil Kumar Sharma also expressed his reservation over the selection process saying that the central election committee of the AICC would have done better in selecting candidates had the proposers, the AICC in-charge and the screening committee members applied wisdom, proper understanding of social equations and political situation of respective constituencies.“The party had not confronted such a situation when the selection of almost all candidates is under a cloud for some reason or the other,” said another senior party leader Kishore Kumar Jha. “Candidates with criminal antecedents and turncoats have been preferred over committed workers owing to weak leadership in the state and inefficiency of the AICC team. Nepotism and interpersonal relationship built on extraneous considerations ruled the roost in selection of candidates,” said Jha, questioning the rationale behind fielding Luv Sinha, son of Shatrughan Sinha; Subhashini Raj (daughter of Sharad Yadav) and Mithilesh Chaudhary (brother-in-law of Kirti Azad), among others.Also read: Prithvi-2 missile, capable of carrying nukes, blasts off from Odisha in user trialMeanwhile, a section of party leaders staged vociferous protests against the party’s decision to field Luv Sinha and Pravin Kushwaha from Bankipur and Patna city constituencies and torched their effigies on the day they filed their nomination papers.Earlier on Thursday, the Congress and the RJD held a joint meeting to release the list of candidates for the second and the final rounds of the elections. The RJD had declared the list of 102 candidates and the Congress announced 49 candidates against the seats they were allotted under the Grand Alliance.The RJD had announced nominees for 42 constituencies out of 144 seats it is contesting. The Congress had declared 21 nominees out of 70 seats it is contesting for the first phase of polling on 71 seats out of the total 243.

SHOPKEEPERS, VENDORS TO BE PENALISED FOR LITTERINGThe MC had initiated night sweeping in the city last year as well, but the drive did not yield positive results due to a lack of coordination between the civic body and shopkeepers. The corporation used to clean the market at night while the shopkeepers used to dump waste on roads again in the morning. The drive was also conducted in Ghumar Mandi in February this year but was put to a halt due to the pandemic. Councillor Ashu said that the MC officials have been told to issue hefty challans to those shopkeepers who do not cooperate. Further, the shopkeepers and vendors should be directed to keep dustbins in their shops or near their vends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-to-commence-night-sweeping-in-main-markets/story-k9ibDpibj43tQzaVOU8pVM.html
16-10-2020||City||Farm laws:Anurag Thakur accuses Congress of misguiding, instigating farmers||Minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur, while addressing a virtual press conference held at BJP district headquarters near the clock tower on Friday, accused the Congress party of ‘misguiding’ the farmers over the new farm laws just to ‘woo them’ before 2022 state legislative elections. Thakur challenged chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to an open debate on which party had worked for the betterment of farmers. However, the minister evaded questions related to why no union minister attended the meeting with farmer organisations held on October 14 in New Delhi and why the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had quit the NDA over the laws if they are not anti-farmer, as alleged by the farmer associations. Taking a dig at former president of Indian National Congress Rahul Gandhi, Thakur said that he was doing politics by sitting in tractors in Punjab but was not present in the Lok Sabha when the bills were presented.He stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi led Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) government was working to double the income of the farmers by allowing them to sell their crops to anyone outside the mandis, but Congress wants to restrict them to mandis only for its benefit. Thakur said that Bharatiya Janata Party had renamed the ministry of agriculture to ministry for agriculture and farmers’ welfare and the budget had been increased from Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 1.34 lakh crore. This shows the concern of the Modi government towards the farming sector, he added.Further, the minister said that the farmers were being instigated by the Congress in the state and clarified that the land of farmers would not be grabbed by the corporate houses and the minimum support price (MSP) for the crops wouldn’t be done away with. When questioned about farmers’ concern about no mention of MSP in the laws, Thakur replied that it was an administrative process and would not be abolished. The minister said that the number of crops purchased by the central agencies and thminimum support price had increased in the past and different schemes had been initiated by the Bharatiya Janata Party including, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, for the benefit of the farmers. He stated that around Rs 95,000 crores was allocated for farmers during the pandemic by the BJP government.

They were from various disciplines including science, arts, commerce, computer science, informant technology, engineering and management. More than 59% of the participants were males and 41% females.“Heavy social media use affects the sleep of one in every three students as they stay awake during the night,” said Dr Dhyan Singh, assistant professor of journalism and mass communication at Government College, Dharamshala.The study was conducted using an online Likert scale survey to know about students’ social media use and its impact, he said.Singh said a majority of the participants agreed that social media use has affected their life depressingly. “About 32% of students admitted that it was the main reason for their sleep disorders,” the professor said adding that one-third of students also agree of spending little time with family as they remain busy on social networking sites.More than 27% of participants admitted that have become addicted to social media sites.But most concerning is the fact that 10% of them feel depressed and about 2.5% say that they get suicidal thoughts.Being on social media sites for a long time also takes a toll emotionally, said Singh.“A quarter of the participants said that it triggers negative thinking and they start comparing their lives with others and sometimes it hurts their self-esteem,” Singh added.Apart from this, Singh said, a considerable number of participants said that they were experiencing body dysmorphic disorders. Other 9% admitted that heavy use of social media has altered their eating habits, the professor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-social-media-use-causing-sleep-disorders-among-college-students-in-hp-study/story-shSrhwuAdsnQ18TXylm2tK.html

16-10-2020||Bhopal||Photos of Deepika, Dia Mirza figure on MGNREGA job cards in Madhya Pradesh, inquiry ordered||Pictures of Bollywood actors Deepika Padukone and Dia Mirza have been found in use on scores of job cards of MGNREGA workers in Madhya Pradesh’s Khargone district, 328 kilometres south of Bhopal. Government authorities ordered a probe after the matter came to light this week. Photographs of the two female actors appear on at least a dozen job cards related to village Piparkheda Naka under Ziranya tehsil of the district. The village is situated about 70 kilometres away from Khargone district headquarters. Interestingly, many of the cards have names of male beneficiaries.The names and addresses of the beneficiaries are real on about a dozen of job cards but the photographs are of the two actors instead of the actual beneficiaries. RTI activist Sandeep Madahar, who revealed the issue, said it is not a clerical or a technical error but a well-planned scam to siphon off lakhs of public money. Also read: PM Modi to address 12 rallies in Bihar, Nitish Kumar to join himDemanding a high-level inquiry to check the authenticity of the job cards from the district, Madahar said, “I was looking into the list of beneficiaries on the MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) website when I spotted the celebrities’ photographs. On scrutiny, I could see the design behind the scam.”“When a MGNREGA card is renewed every five years, the serial number remains the same. However, when I visited the village, I found that the people were hardly aware of renewal of their cards and that the serial numbers on the new cards didn’t match with that of their old cards. None of them had even applied for the renewal. Many of them have good landholding,” he stated.Madahar added, “What is surprising is that in many cases, the job cards are kept by the village sarpanch, secretary and gram rozgar sahayak. Even the transactions with banks or kiosks situated in rural areas for making payment to beneficiaries are done by them only on behalf of the beneficiaries. Both the practices are in violations of the rules and many beneficiaries are hardly aware of what is going on behind their back.”Also read: Delhi next on NCB radar to launch Mumbai-style crackdown on drugsTwenty-two-year old Monu Shivshankar said, “I didn’t go for any work under MGNREGA. I am surprised to see Deepika Padukone’s photo on my job card. I don’t even have this job card with me.”A tribal villager Padam Rupsingh, whose job card bears the photo of actor Dia Mirza, spoke in similar vein. He said he was not provided any job by the village sarpanch or others. Chief executive officer (CEO), zila panchayat, Khargone Gaurav Benal, said, “I have received complaints regarding the use of Bollywood actors’ photos on job cards. I have instituted an inquiry to see if these cards are real and in what circumstances the photographs were used on the cards. Action will be taken against the guilty if the inquiry committee reports irregularities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/photos-of-deepika-dia-mirza-figure-on-mgnrega-job-cards-in-madhya-pradesh-inquiry-ordered/story-GO2rkanypQQLU1SC5oHXdN.html

16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Shaurya Chakra awardee and Left leader Balwinder Singh shot dead in Punjab’s Tarn Taran||Tarn Taran Two motorcycle-borne men shot dead Left leader Balwinder Singh, 55, at Bhikhiwind, 25km from Tarn Taran, on Friday morning. Balwinder Singh was a Shaurya Chakra awardee for fighting against terrorism in Punjab in the ’90s. Balwinder, a Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPI) district committee member who was on the hit list of terrorist outfits, was at home when the two men fired six bullets at him around 7am and fled, police said. Balwinder’s family runs Evergreen Senior Secondary School in Bhikhiwind, once a terror hot-spot, and his residence is on its premises. “As per routine, my husband got down from the first floor to open the outer gate. We realised that there had been firing only after 5-7 minutes and found him in a pool of blood in the office situated near the gate,” said Jagdish Kaur, his wife. The assailants knocked on the door first. On opening it, one of the assailants fired indiscriminately at Balwinder, said Dhruman H Nimbale, Tarn Taran SSP, who rushed to the crime scene. Balwinder’s wife, Jagdish, is also a district committee member of the RMPI that Mangat Ram Pasla leads SECURITY WITHDRAWN DESPITE APPEALS RMPI leader Chaman Lal Darajke said Balwinder’s security was taken back last month. He said they had requested senior police officials to restore security, but to no avail. “He was against the terrorism and had been attacked 44 times,” Darajke said. As per his wife, who stood by him to fight against terrorism, over 40 FIRs have been registered in attacks on their family. The previous one was in December 2018 when unknown persons fired at their house.Sources said a gunman had been deployed for the security of the family, but he was not with Balwinder at the time of attack. Kaur also blamed the police, claiming, “The police withdrew security even as we were on the hit-list of terrorists.”FOUR SHAURYA CHAKRAS AWARDED TO FAMILY Tarn Taran was among the worst-hit districts during militancy. Balwinder and his family members—wife, older brother Ranjit Singh and brother’s wife Balraj Kaur were awarded for their bravery by the President in 1993. “His is the only family in the country that has been awarded four Shaurya Chakras for showing unique courage and valour when his wife and he were activists of the Communist Party of India. Documentaries have also been made on his family,” said Drajke. Balwinder is survived by wife, two sons, Gagandeep Singh and Arshdeep Singh, and a daughter. They have expressed suspicion that Balwinder’s killing is a terror attack. “We don’t have any kind of personal enmity. This is a clear-cut attack by terrorists. I have fought against terrorism. Now, when he has been martyred, I will give a tougher fight to get the justice,” said Kaur.Asked on the terror attack angle, the SSP said, “We are investigating the matter and cannot say anything about it.” The RMPI’s state leadership has condemned the murder of the party leader and sought justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shaurya-chakra-awardee-and-left-leader-balwinder-singh-shot-dead-in-punjab-s-tarn-taran/story-nOAPiYHqpWhyqQEbGTZ3wI.html
16-10-2020||Pune||Punekars blame civic body for flash floods 2.0||Wednesday night was a grim reminder of the nightmare which the Sabale family, residing at Satara road, faced during the September 2019 flash floods. A year ago, Kaushik Sabale and his family saw their homes destroyed after heavy rains in the city caused flash floods. On Wednesday, due to continuous heavy rains, several parts of the Pune city were affected by waterlogging as canals overflowed and water entered into houses and shops. Citizens have alleged that the same situation arises after every bout of heavy rainfall due to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)‘s mismanagement. “At around 9pm, water level started rising in the nearby nullah and having learnt our lessons from last year’s tragedy, we immediately shifted elderly people and children to the first floor in the house. Then, the water flow was so strong that it broke our house wall and water entered into our house. It brought all the garbage and mud inside and also damaged our vehicles. Two months ago, PMC officials along with the commissioner had come here to survey our area. At that time they assured us that they will build a retaining wall near the nullah, but it nothing happened on ground. Yesterday’s damage is only because of the mismanagement of the PMC officials,” said Kaushik Sabale, a resident of Arnyeshwar area on Satara Road. Most of the lanes in Sahakarnagar and Satara road area, which are near the nullah, were affected by the flash floods. However, as citizens were alert, most of them immediately shifted their family members, parked their vehicles at safer places and tried to control the damage. Treasure Park society was one of the most affected housing societies during last year’s flash floods. Hundreds of two-wheelers and cars were damaged as water entered into the housing society’s parking lot. However, this year residents of this society shifted their vehicles soon after heavy rains started on Wednesday night. Rohidas Kewale, a shop owner in Sahakarnagar, who started his business last week, said, “I had started my business last week and had spent around Rs 25,000 to buy small furniture and goods for the shop. Now everything inside the shop has been damaged. We want compensation from the PMC for our losses as this flood has happened due to their mismanagement as they failed to build the retaining wall to contain the overflowing nullah.” A similar situation was witnessed at Sinhgad road which faced massive waterlogging on Wednesday night. The water level had risen above the road median and at one spot near Santosh Hall chowk, the road median was broken by the people. Water entered into several shops located on Sinhgad road and some of the prominent hospitals like Madhukar Hospital and Patil Hospital. Prashant Sheth, owner of Siddhi Medical at the Patil hospital, said, “After 10pm, water started rising above the footpath level and suddenly in minutes it rose higher. We didn’t get enough time to move our goods inside the shop, 30 per cent of medicine goods has been damaged and we had to throw it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/punekars-blame-civic-body-for-flash-floods-2-0/story-I9TctCJJMdTpjpJ5x0AZ6M.html

16-10-2020||Mumbai||Bollywood drugs case: Sandip Ssingh accuses Congress leader Sachin Sawant of levelling false charges||Filmmaker Sandip Ssingh on Friday accused Congress leader Sachin Sawant of making baseless and false charges against him after the latter questioned the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) ongoing probe into the Bollywood drugs case and reiterated a demand for an investigation into the former’s alleged links with the drug racket. Sawant’s comments came a day after the Bengaluru police searched actor Vivek Oberoi’s house in Mumbai in a drug case. In a series of tweets on Friday, Sawant suggested the central investigating agencies were deliberately shielding Oberoi and Ssingh, who have produced a biopic on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Also Read: Congress claims Vivek Oberoi-Sandip Ssingh angle to drugs case, demands NCB probeIn a statement issued on behalf of Ssingh, his PR manager, Deepak Sahu, said if Sawant is looking for “more publicity by making allegations without any proof, he will have to pay for it”. Sahu added Ssingh is compelling legal action against Sawant. The statement said the Central Bureau of Investigation summoned Ssingh and his statement has been recorded. It added Ssingh is even ready for an NCB inquiry. Sawant said he had asked NCB to investigate “the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] Drug connection” in Bollywood. “In my questions to NCB I had specifically mentioned the name of Aditya Alva found in Sandalwood drug racket who is brother in law of Vivek Oberoi who is partner of Sandeep Ssingh. But NCB didn’t pay heed,” he tweeted. He alleged Gujarat BJP’s government may have favoured the two. “But now Bengaluru police hv raided house of Vivek Oberoi who is not only co-producer of Narendra Modi Biopic but also played role of Modi ji. Several Qns still unanswered as to why only this company was chosen for signing an MOU by Guj govt.” Sawant questioned why complaints against Ssingh were being overlooked. “Not only us, BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy had tweeted demanding Ssingh’s probe and why he frequently visits Dubai. NCB has been summoning Bollywood actors, but the demand for the probe of Ssingh is overlooked,” Sawant said. But now Bengaluru police hv raided house of Vivek Oberoi who is not only co-producer of Narendra Modi Biopic but also played role of Modi ji. Several Qns still unanswered as to why only this company was chosen for signing an MOU by Guj govthttps://t.co/uVqV2J8gkoBJP rubbished Sawant’s claims and dared him to produce evidence. “He is free to produce the evidence, if any, to the investigating agency or to the courts. BJP never shields any wrongdoer and the search at Oberoi’s house is an example of the same. PM Narendra Modi’s integrity or sincerity cannot be contested. The allegations by Congress leaders are malicious and born out of frustrations,” said BJP spokesperson Madhu Chavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bollywood-drugs-case-sandip-ssingh-accuses-congress-leader-sachin-sawant-of-levelling-false-charges/story-W4rL3RzHhXyO0J86ru1U2N.html

Vibhor Anand’s arrest followed Shiv Sena legal cell head Dharmendra Mishra’s written complaint to the Mumbai police’s cyber unit. The 31-year-old was brought to Mumbai on Thursday. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Akbar Pathan said, “We have arrested the accused from Delhi and produced him before a metropolitan magistrate court (on Friday). The court has remanded him to police custody till October 19. We will investigate the case thoroughly.” Dharmendra Mishra said, “In August, I came across 15 Twitter handles, including that of Anand, that were constantly abusing the CM and the Cabinet minister. The accused kept making false allegations by posting offensive and abusive comments on social media. The allegations made by them are that the chief minister and Cabinet minister were involved in actor Sushant Singh Rajput and Disha Salian’s death.” Also read: Delhi next on NCB radar to launch Mumbai-style crackdown on drugs“The accused have been creating the story for the purpose of bringing public disorder and disturbance of law, and to promote the feeling of enmity and hatred against the current government. They even used abusive words against Mumbai police,” added Mishra. According to Mishra, the accused also alleged that Disha was gang-raped before being killed. “He was also holding Aaditya Thackeray, (actor) Sooraj Pancholi, (Rhea Chakraborty’s brother) Showik Chakraborty and (actor) Arbaaz Khan responsible for Disha Salian’s death,” said Mishra.

On Thursday police, contacted him that they wanted to serve him a notice. He asked them to go to his office where they arrested him,” said Anand. “Whatever content he has posted on his Twitter handle is widely available on social media sites.

16-10-2020||Pune||Rise in crime cases needs strict monitoring: Pune rural SP Abhinav Deshmukh||Abhinav Deshmukh, a 2009-batch IPS (Indian Police Service) officer was the superintendent of police, Kolhapur before taking over as SP Pune rural in September this year and has served in Satara and Gadchiroli in the past.The policemen are at the forefront of the fight against Covi-19. He speaks to HT about the various challenges in Pune rural area amid the Covid-19 pandemic.There is a severe shortage of staff in the Pune rural police department. What is the current strength?There are only 2,900 positions; actual working strength is 2,600 as there are 300 vacancies. We have additional strength including home guards; around 790 at present. We have a severe shortage of manpower, that’s true. Many proposals have been sent to the government in this regard. One district sub-head quarter will be created in Baramati. A strength of 300 will be added there. There are new police stations that have been proposed. Overall, 600 new posts will be created. New post creation had stopped due to the current Covid-19 pandemic. We are hopeful that shortly we will get the manpower.What is the situation of Covid-19 infection and fatality among Pune rural police?We have 250 patients now and as many as 230 have covered from the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection and 18 are active cases. We also lost six of our policemen who were infected with the virus. In the past few days, the new cases are quite a few - hardly one or two. In the way of post-Covid19 care, those who have recovered, people who are overweight, cholesterol problem are following routines that include meditation, yoga and physiotherapy. There is a tendency of cardiac arrest due to an increasing tendency of embolism. We are consulting with cardiologists also. Our men are provided with like ecosprin, Vitamin C and zinc tablets and other safety gears.There are various stretches of highways in the Pune rural police jurisdiction. Any long-term efforts to reduce fatalities?There is a state-wide policy issue. The Supreme Court is monitoring fatalities in road accidents. Now a target has been set that every state and district has to reduce the mortality by ten per cent. Last year we achieved the target but we should be more focused on reducing mortality than accidents. As the number of vehicles is increasing, there will definitely be more accidents. But the mortality in these accidents is what we should be working to reduce. Four basic methods are subscribed for this: engineering, enforcement, education, and awareness. Based on Kerala’s Jan Maitri programme adopted by the central government and deployed in Maharashtra, five schools are identified where school-level education regarding traffic-rules and awareness is provided.There are several tourist spots in the jurisdiction, but the mask violation numbers are low in these areas.Basically, most of the tourist spots are closed. Most of the approach roads to scenic spots were also closed. The tourists are not coming now. Only local people or those having second homes are coming to places like Lonvala. Last week an order was issued by the tourism department that some of the tourist activities have to be restarted. Because of the order, we are also planning to change our strategy, especially in these parts. We do not want to harass tourists as local traders depend on them. We have to maintain a balance. We have held meetings with hotel owners and restaurant owners as the hotels have opened up. We thought it is better to campaign and create awareness. We have the power to fine.There was a proposal for use of 50% fine for police welfare. What are your observations?It is just a proposal and not finalised yet. Any fine collected goes into to certain heads of government where they need to be deposited. Police fine goes directly to the government exchequer. Government has to issue an order. It is a policy decision and modalities have to be finalised.What are your observations in the first 20 days since you took over?It is a huge district. It has a lot of problems due to industrialisation and urbanisation. Due to fast-growing urbanisation in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, there is a rise in crime cases especially in outskirts of metropolis area. Our crime pattern is mainly Loni Kalbhor, Lonikand, Haveli and MIDC. We have to focus on narcotics and firearms. Especially in areas bordering Ahmednagar, major crime is related to sand mafia; Daund, Indapur, and Bhigwan. There is a definite increase in the trend of body offences post-lockdown. The magnitude of the crime is very high. There are a lot of problems related to urbanisation but the infrastructure is that of a rural district.

The district and sessions court in Rudrapur issued the NBW against the 16 people on Thursday while hearing a case in which they are accused of blocking a highway during an agitation at Jaspur in 2012.The court also ordered the district police authorities to form a special team to arrest the accused and produce them before it on October 23. Also read: Uttarakhand BJP councillor shot dead in front of his house in KumaonRajesh Bhatt, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Kashipur, said, “We have received a copy of the order issued by the court. We will follow the order and form a special team to arrest the accused and produce them before the court within the stipulated time.” The case in which the court issued the order pertains to June 2012, when the police had booked 24 people for blocking the highway. The accused included the then Gadarpur member of the Uttarakhand legislative assembly (MLA) and the current sitting Cabinet minister Arvind Pandey, Kashipur MLA Harbhajan Singh Cheema, Rudrapur MLA Rajkumar Thukral, the sitting Jaspur MLA Aadesh Chauhan, ex-Member of Parliament (MP) Balraj Pasi. Kashipur MLA Cheema said, “We didn’t block the road in 2012, but a group was staging a dharna demanding the arrest of an accused, who had eloped with a girl belonging to another religion.” “We had gone there only to support the agitators and returned after a short while. I don’t know why the police booked us in this case,” he said. However, Rudrapur MLA Thukral said that he would follow the court’s order. “Though the state government had withdrawn the case, the court did not relent. This led to the issuance of the NBW. I respect the court’s order.” Minister Pandey was not available for his comment.Pandey and the three MLAs were accused of blocking the road in the agitation to pressure the police to arrest the man, who had allegedly eloped with a woman belonging to another religion. The agitation had allegedly led to a law and order problem. Initially, seven of the accused were arrested, but later were released on bail. The 17 others, including the minister and three MLAs, were never arrested. However, one of the accused had died a few months ago.Earlier, the court had issued an NBW in September 2019 as well. The district police authorities had put up notices regarding the attachment of properties of the accused, including minister Pandey and the three legislators. The lawmakers had moved the court in Rudrapur against the order and also filed a review petition. However, the court dismissed the petition and issued a fresh NBW against the 16 accused on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/non-bailable-warrant-against-uttarakhand-cabinet-minister-and-3-mlas-for-blocking-road/story-y2xI2paaTND0Qg3E24DJEK.html

16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Indu Raj Narwal of Congress, Joginder Singh Malik of INLD take on BJP’s Yogeshwar Dutt in Haryana’s Baroda byelection||The Congress on Friday fielded former Sonepat zila parishad member Indu Raj Narwal for the November 3 Baroda assembly bylection, while the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) announced the candidature of Joginder Singh Malik. They are pitted against the BJP’s Yogeshwar Dutt, the Olympian wrestler. Friday is the last day for filing nominations for the Baroda assembly seat that had fallen vacant in April following the death of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda. Though Congress legislature party leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was pushing for the ticket for Kapoor Singh Narwal, a turncoat who till recently was in the BJP, state unit chief Kumari Selja is learnt to have opposed the nomination of an outsider. Indu Raj Narwal is also seen as a Hooda loyalist. BJP, INLD BET ON OLD HORSES The BJP fielded Olympian grappler Yogeshwar Dutt late on Thursday. The wrestler-turned-politician, who hails from Bhainswal Kalan in Sonepat district, had joined the BJP in 2019 ahead of the state assembly elections. He had lost the October 2019 assembly election to Sri Krishan Hooda by about 4,800 votes. Dutt, who won the bronze medal in the 2012 Olympic Games and gold medal in the 2014 Commonwealth Games, was awarded the Padma Shri in 2013. The BJP, which is contesting the bypoll with the backing of its ally Jannayak Janta Party, has exuded confidence that it will wrest the seat from the Congress. The INLD candidate, Joginder Singh Malik, had also contested the 2019 assembly elections from Baroda on the party ticket but had got just 3,145 votes. TURNCOAT TURNS INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE Kapoor Narwal, who was seeking the Congress ticket, announced he would join the fray as an Independent. He will file his nomination papers in the presence of Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu. “The people of Baroda will elect their MLA, not the parties. I’m contesting to highlight their plight, particularly that of farmers, labourers, and women,” he said at a meeting at his native village of Kathura. Narwal had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 and 2009 assembly elections on the INLD ticket and lost to Congress’s Sri Krishan Hooda.

16-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC restrains builder from further construction at illegal industrial estate near Bhiwandi||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday restrained developer, M/s. Bhoomi World, who is accused of constructing an industrial estate on public property at Pimplas village near Bhiwandi without obtaining necessary permissions, from carrying out any further construction work at the site.A two-member HC bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) jointly filed by two local residents -- Sudhakar Chaudhari and Satish Mene -- seeking demolition of the industrial estate developed by Bhoomi World over about 80 acres of public land, without any permission from the competent authority.Also Read: Supreme Court dismisses plea seeking imposition of President’s rule in MaharashtraIn the PIL filed through advocate Amit Gharte, the petitioners have alleged that most of these land belong to the Maharashtra government and other public bodies such as the local village panchayat, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)The petitioners alleged that the developer had brazenly carried out the construction work measuring 17.26 lakh square (sq) metres (m).Advocate Gharte pointed out on Thursday that the construction was liable to be demolished, as it was carried out without requisite permissions and necessary approvals.Senior advocate Prasad Dhakephalkar, who represented the developer, responded to the PIL and said they have deposited an amount of over Rs 1.5 crore with the office of the district collector for getting the land use converted into non-agriculture purposes.He stated that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) had, in principle, agreed to the construction work because about 1,000 industrial units, occupying area of about 300 sq m each, are operating out of the premises and about 35,000 workers are employed in these units.Dhakephalkar answered in the negative about a specific query from the court, as to whether the construction was done in accordance with a sanctioned building plan and whether an occupation certificate was issued by the competent authority for carrying out the construction work.The senior advocate said the lapse had occurred during the transitory stage because there was no MMRDA office at Thane, although a special planning authority for the area was appointed at a later date.However, the judges were annoyed with the excuse. “This has become a routine now,” said the bench. “Builders indulge in illegal construction work, take all steps to prolong the due process of law and eventually seek regularisation. We cannot allow this to go on,” it added.The bench said it had a limited question before it: whether the construction was made in accordance with the law. “We will have to follow the order of the Supreme Court (SC), as it had laid down in MIND Builders case regarding illegal construction,” the judges said.The bench has directed the MMRDA to file an affidavit within two weeks and posted the PIL for further hearing following its submission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-restrains-builder-from-further-construction-at-illegal-industrial-estate-near-bhiwandi/story-ykkeI0yb0pVPRtuMUMtnpM.html

16-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra health officials apprehensive about surge in cases after Navratri||Maharashtra government officials have expressed concerns over the likely surge in Covid-19 cases during the Navratri festival that is scheduled to start on Saturday.“As the state has started unlocking [easing of restrictions imposed to check the pandemic], we are seeing an increase in the cases. The Navratri festival will only aggravate matters as we fear that people in their festive mood will become casual and the end result will be an increase in cases. Dussehra will see more people coming out,” said a health department official on condition of anonymity. “Since hotels and restaurants have opened, this gives people more opportunity to socialise.”Ameet Mandot, a doctor, said the Navratri festival will result in more intermingling and increased social interactions which are undesirable in the current circumstances. “The problem is some do not wear masks and even if they do, they remove them at regular intervals. There is a big section of people who do not know how to wear a mask and are casual about the whole thing.”Navratri is one of the major festivals celebrated in Mumbai. Pandals are set up and Garba dances are also organised. The festivities have been curtailed due to the pandemic even as people are expected to make purchases during this festival as usual and visit their relatives and friends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-health-officials-apprehensive-about-surge-in-cases-after-navratri/story-GgTNm48PFbmo7DRiDBNNqI.html
16-10-2020||Education||Kejriwal writes to Centre seeking amendment in DU Act; says ready to start new colleges||Delhi has asked the Centre to do away with certain provisions in the Delhi University Act as they act as a hindrance in starting new colleges in the Capital, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday.He said he has written to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal in this regard, adding that his government is ready to start new colleges and universities if the legal provisions are eased.In its 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had promised that it would start new colleges and universities in the Capital and offer reservation to students who are Delhi residents. “Students are facing a tough time getting enrolled in colleges because of high cut-off marks. With cut-offs touching 100%, what will happen to students who secure 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%? The problem is that the number of seats in colleges and universities in Delhi has failed to keep pace with the increase in the number of applicants,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing on Friday.He added, “Every year, Delhi has around 250,000 students graduating school, but around 125,000 of them manage to get admission in Delhi-based colleges. What will happen to the remaining 125,000? Currently, Delhi University has 91 affiliated colleges, Indraprastha University has 127, there are nine universities under the state government and then there is Jawaharlal Nehru University. We need to start more colleges and universities in Delhi. The Delhi government is ready. But there is a legal issue we confronted.”“There is the Delhi University Act which was enacted by the British. The Section 5(2) of the Act says that any new college in Delhi has to be affiliated to the Delhi University. In Delhi University, no new college was affiliated in the last 30 years. In 1998, an amendment was introduced in the Act and IP University was accommodated for professional courses. But that has reached a saturation point too,” said Kejriwal.“It is important to change the law. Today, I have written to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, urging him to remove Section 5(ii) of the Delhi University Act so that new colleges can be started in Delhi. It will benefit students. Students are immensely stressed because of the high cut-off that has reached 100%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/kejriwal-writes-to-hrd-minister-seeking-amendment-in-du-act-says-ready-to-start-new-colleges/story-ySdrWcUwpj6778fQZ0FkyH.html
16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Residue to riches: Stubble no trouble for Punjab’s change agents||Every year, environmentally-sound disposal of paddy residue turns into a point of discord. As the issues boils over, there are always people who offer workable, green solutions. HT brings you some of these change-agents, who have built-up profitable businesses, where everybody saw trouble. Green concern at heart of big planA visit to Amloh, an industrial town in Fatehgarh Sahib, will showcase a simple, unique solution. Industrialist Han Raj Garg, 38, an MBA, thought of using paddy straw as fuel in his factory in 2014, and the idea has clicked. Farmers earned more (some even earned in lakhs by making bales of straw for Garg) and Amloh has the lowest number of farm fire incidents in Punjab today. “My concern for environment and farmers led me to monetise straw,” said Garg, whose units manufacture edible oils under the name, Shree Ganesh Edibles Pvt Limited. Garg added there was no-cost effective in-situ (without transport) stubble management formula as yet. Farmers will shun the illegal practice of burning, if they get money for handling straw. “In 2014, I started with 25,000-tonne of paddy straw. For the past three years, I am purchasing 72,000 tonne of stubble and paid Rs 11 crore to farmers.” “In 2019, the Supreme Court ordered Rs 100 per quintal as compensation for farmers for handling straw. I have been doing it since 2014,” he says, adding that nearly 1,000 farmers directly or indirectly (mostly marginal) collect straw from other farmers’ fields. “I know a farmer who collected paddy straw from 3,000 acre in 2019 and made a profit of Rs 30 lakh,” Garg added. “For six years, I am not selling straw from my own fields, but collecting from neighouring fields. Who will burn paddy straw when you will Rs 100 per quintal for it?,” said Harinder Singh, a farmer. Garg added that the major issue in using paddy straw as fuel was its silica content, which led to a snag in industrial boilers. “With research, plus experience, we have been running our factory on rice straw for seven years. For the past two years, we have been supplying 0.5 MW power to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited,” he said. “Our process is environment-friendly in two ways. We don’t use fossil fuels in factory and are also resolving the unregulated burning of agricultural waste, that causes air pollution,” he said. “If the government supports me, I can invest more and will purchase stubble from the 1.08 lakh acre under paddy in Fatehgarh Sahib district. Government officials, however, are not receptive and not allowing me to run a 15MW co-gen plant for factory on rice straw, even as a proposal has been submitted,” he says. —VISHAL RAMBANI  Progressive farmer Sukbir Singh Dhaliwal, 46, is scripting a success story with his venture that converts crop waste into products that can be used as fuel in industries. Dhaliwal and some of his friends began the start-up, Farm2Energy, in 2016 to convert paddy stubble into bio-coal. Bio-coal is a carbon-neutral fuel that can replace ordinary coal in industrial processes. Last year, he and fellow entrepreneurs Kamaljeet Singh, Sandeep Singh Shergill and Preet Singh Chandoke lifted stubble residue from 20,000 acre. Over the past four years, they have also set up a pellet-making factory in Khanna. “Not only paddy residue, our unit processes paddy straw, corn stover, sugarcane trash and wheat straw and supplies it to biofuel, bio-power and bio-based industries. We also help farmers in managing biomass,” said Dhaliwal. “The industry has huge potential, as the world is progressing towards cleaner energy solutions,” he claimed. “The automobile industry is concentrating on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), and stubble can be used to make it. Due to the lack of any government initiative, such ventures are not coming up. We are sitting on a gold-mine of opportunities. We are burning it away and polluting the environment. Farmers cannot be blamed as they have limited resources,” added Dhaliwal. This year, the chances of him getting the raw material are bleak. Many farmers who had converted to crop residue management have yet again cleared their fields by burning. The majority of the farmers are either protesting on railway tracks or selling the crop in mandis, triggering labour shortage. “We are facing problems in collecting residue as farmers are angry,” added Dhaliwal. —MOHIT KHANNA ‘Lucrative, eco-friendly way to earn money’ When Hardeep Singh, 48, a farmer of Sathiala village in Baba Bakala subdivision, decided to sell his stubble to a sugar mill as opposed to setting it alight, little did he know that it would soon become a lucrative business opportunity, harvesting a handsome dividend of ₹5 lakh per season. The entrepreneur, who owns 10 acre of agricultural land, says, “In 2016, I used a baler machine to manage my stubble for the first time and sold the residue to a sugar mill. Before that I used to burn crop residue, the same as other farmers. The mill paid me a decent sum and I saw a business opportunity. I started managing stubble for other farmers in my village and selling it to cardboard-making firms and sugar mills in the state.” Hardeep says, “Private firms pay us ₹130 per quintal of stubble and we are able to extract around 24 quintal from one acre. We manage the stubble in the form of squares, weighing 20kg a piece.” “Earlier, I had one baler machine attached to a single tractor, now I have two. With two balers and four tractors, I have been managing stubble over 1,000 acre,” Hardeep says. A baler is used to compress stubble into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. Hardeep charges ₹1,000 per acre from the farmers for management and transportation of crop residue. He employs 45 labourers for management and transportation of stubble and has six tractor-trailers for transportation. “Sometimes, we help poor farmers free of charge,” says Hardeep, adding that the business is both lucrative and environment-friendly. Daljit Singh, a farmer of Gurdaspur district, says farmers spend around ₹2,500 per acre on stubble Hardeep has applied for subsidy for purchasing more balers, but he has, so far, not been granted the same by the agriculture department. – ANIL SHARMA ‘Business expansion can curb stubble burning’  For farmer Gurshiwender Singh, 38, management of paddy waste turned out to be a golden opportunity for enhancing his income. Last year, he earned ₹31 lakh in around 50 days by selling stubble to a biomass generation plant. Gurshiwender, of Mehma Sawai village, around 35km from district headquarters, says he sells organic waste to a private biomass generation plant at Sedha Singh Wala village and made a profit of ₹7 lakh in 2019. “After Sukhbir Agro Energy Limited set up a biomass energy generation plant in Bathinda in 2017, I invested in one baler, which cost ₹15 lakh and availed a 40% subsidy. Now, I have two bailers and six tractors and collect paddy straw from Mehma Sawai and three other adjoining villages. The biomass plant management pays ₹130 per quintal. Last year, I had supplied 24,000 quintal of dried crop waste,” says Gurshiwender. He supervises stubble management over 8 acre. “The technology is inexpensive and farmers have to pay a nominal price for safe disposal of crop residue. The government should promote multiple biomass plants in each district to eradicate stubble burning,” he says. Gurshiwender’s family owns six acre and he cultivates rice over another 10 acre of leased land, employing 100 people. He adds, “Unfortunately, a section of paddy growers continue to burn stubble. I charge ₹500 per acre, the same amount that a farmer pays to a straw-reaper operator and for setting crop residue on fire. The agrarian community is aware that burning stubble damages the microorganisms present in the upper layers of the soil.”  —Vishal Joshi Farmer-turned-entrepreneur for five years For Nakodar farmer, Kewal Singh, the leap from a farmer to an entrepreneur was driven by a concern for environment and to do something for the worsening pollution. Kewal set up a 6MW capacity bio-mass-based power plant Green Planet Energy Pvt Ltd production unit at Bir village in 2015. The model was simple, he purchased stubble from fellow farmers, used it to generate electricity and sell it to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). He soon got 15 baler machines that visit farmers’ fields to get the straw in order. “All my machines have been at work for 24 hours of day for the past month. The plant has the capacity of 75,000 tonne of paddy straw,” said Kewal, adding he earns handsome profit each season. “On an average, a machine generates 3 tonne paddy straw and I pay Rs 1,350 per tonne to a farmer,” Kewal added. Joga Singh from Tut Kalan village in Jalandhar said he had been selling 4-5 tonne of paddy straw to the electricity generation plant and getting Rs 135 per quintal for straw bales. Another farmer, Sukhdev Singh from Talhan village, said he along with five other farmers, purchased baler machines last year after the state government provided them subsidy. “We have been selling the stubble to the unit and earning enough profit, while this process has also led to increased fertility in the soil,” said Sukhdev. District agriculture officer Naresh Gulati said a machine with a baler lines up the scattered straw/stubble for bales to be easily made. — JATINDER MAHAL||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residue-to-riches-stubble-no-trouble-for-punjab-s-change-agents/story-0R8zK3P9DkUiVAgw3s4m0I.html

Saxena is an accused turned approver in the AgustaWestland case.Justice Navin Chawla clarified that any observation made in this order shall also not prejudice the respondents from proceeding further with the proceedings under Section 10 of the Section 10A of The Passports Act, 1967, in accordance with the law, as the same are not the subject matter of the present petition.Saxena had challenged the order dated 25.01.2019 issued by the respondent authority, suspending his passport. He had also challenged the order dated 01.05.2019 extending the period of suspension of his passport till the proceedings relating to variation, impounding or revocation of the passport under Section 10 A of the Act is concluded. As a consequent relief, the petitioner prayed for the return of his passport.Saxena’s counsels’, advocates RK Handoo and Rajat Machanda, submitted that the impugned orders are liable to be set aside as they do not give any reason for the exercise of powers under Section 10A of the act nor follow the procedure of granting a hearing to the petitioner. Counsels further submitted that the order of suspension of the petitioner’s passport cannot be indefinite as has been sought to be done in the present case.Whereas counsels for Central government and Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) advocates Ajay Digpaul and DP Singh asserted that the action to suspend the passport of the petitioner was taken, keeping in view the urgent need for the deportation of the petitioner from the UAE with whom India has an extradition agreement and as it was apprehended that the petitioner may flee to a country from where it would have been difficult for him to be extradited ultimately hampering the investigations. The period of suspension of the passport was extended by the order dated 01.05.2019 due to continuing investigations and the need for the petitioner to be present for interrogation.The CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) are investigating the Agusta Westland case. Dubai-based businessman Rajiv Saxena was extradited to India on January 31 last year in connection with the Rs 3,600-crore alleged scam relating to the purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters from AgustaWestland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/agustawestland-case-delhi-hc-directs-authorities-to-return-passport-of-rajiv-saxena/story-qwmHWYKJkFzFNJDAENPY6H.html

16-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra environment group member moves SC, says 656 forest officers assaulted over 10 years||Citing an alarming increase in the frequency and ferocity of assaults on forest officers particularly in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, a Maharashtra-based environment group has moved the Supreme Court for solutions.Kishor Rithe has filed an interim application through his NGO Nature Conservation Society, Amravati, against the Centre, chief secretaries of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, district collectors of areas, where the assaults have been reported, and the directors-general of police of the three states. It requests the court to direct the Centre to ensure the protection of officers and staff of the forest departments, provide social security, ex-gratia payments, and medical treatment costs of the injured personnel. The application has also sought speedy investigations into the attacks.The court has admitted the application.According to data collected from territorial forest areas (11 circles), wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and tiger reserves in Maharashtra (except Dhule and Kolhapur), 656 forest officers have been injured in assaults between 2010 and 2020. As many as 47.5% of the assaults were reported between 2017 and 2020. Twenty-four forest officers have been killed in Maharashtra over 10 years. Rithe is collecting similar data for Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.“The involvement of a large number of people, mostly encroachers and those belonging to timber mafia armed with deadly weapons, has led to serious injuries to the forest personnel on duty, many of whom have been hospitalised and are in critical condition,” the application said. It added these attacks have had a chilling impact and made it increasingly difficult to protect forests.Rithe said a majority of the attacks on the forest department officials are mainly carried out while removing encroachments. “So, saving forest lands has been most difficult in India,” he said. “The problem is widespread in other states also with a more serious situation in MP [Madhya Pradesh].”Nitin Kakodkar, Maharashtra’s principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said the assaults have been reported for a long time now but there has been a surge in the recent months. “It definitely needs some redressal. Let us see what the SC [Supreme Court] has to say about this.”On September 2, the Indian Forest Services Officers Association made a representation to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar seeking better protection and social security for over 50,000 personnel working in remote areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-wildlife-board-member-moves-sc-says-656-forest-officers-assaulted-over-10-years/story-iK9VX6K8CsCQfSAavSWc8M.html
16-10-2020||Lucknow||GSDP’s declining growth may challenge goal of making Uttar Pradesh a trillion-dollar economy||Uttar Pradesh (UP) government’s revised estimates of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) growth rate have reinforced a slowdown in the state’s economy in the last financial year (2019-20).The data poses a serious challenge for the state government in its bid to boost the state’s GSDP in the next five years, as it aims to reach a trillion dollar mark. No estimates have been released for the first quarter of the current financial year (2020-21) to date, which would have helped ascertain the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on the state’s economy. The declining growth rate does not augur well for UP’s economy.The Yogi Adityanath-led government has received eight bids for appointment of a consultant to chalk out a roadmap to boost the GSDP. Also Read: How the Covid-19 pandemic has hit GDP growthIt has invited technical bids for presentation. A call on this matter is likely to be taken in the next few weeks. As per the revised GSDP estimates for 2019-20 released on September 29, UP’s growth rate has come down from 6.6% in 2018-19 to 4.4% (on constant prices) in the last financial year. On current prices, the decline is from 12.1% to 8.8%. Advanced GSDP estimates for 2019-20 released in February had also indicated a decline in growth from 5.4% to 4.4%. In absolute terms, the state’s GSDP has gone up from Rs 16.09 lakh crore in 2018-19 to Rs 17.51 lakh crore in 2019-20 (on current prices). However, advance estimates had pegged the size of GSDP at Rs 17.94 lakh crore in 2019-20, which showed a decline in actual terms. “The data showed that 2019-20 was not a good year for the state’s economic growth. This slowdown in the state’s economy has serious implications. First, the goal to boost UP’s GSDP to a trillion dollar economy appears more distant than ever before. The bid to double farmers’ income by 2022 will be tough to achieve following a low growth of 3.2% in agriculture and allied sectors. The manufacturing sector has also registered a decline of 3.5%. The slowdown has been compounded by an adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy. This poses serious challenges to the state government in its bid to revive the economy and boost growth,” said Yashvir Tyagi, a former professor of economics, Lucknow University (LU). The GSDP estimates for 2020-21 will be keenly watched in the coming weeks because of the impact of Covid-19 on the state’s economy.“The state government should have declared the data for the first quarter by now,” Tyagi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/gsdp-s-declining-growth-may-challenge-goal-of-making-uttar-pradesh-a-trillion-dollar-economy/story-30Fe6bfuFHecEnbNU8ts5K.html
16-10-2020||Lucknow||UP Congress leader jailed for ‘provoking’ woman to set herself ablaze, she is dead||Uttar Pradesh Congress leader Alok Prasad, son of former Rajasthan governor Sukhdev Prasad, was sent to judicial custody for allegedly hatching a criminal conspiracy and instigating a 35-year-old woman to attempt self-immolation near Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow on Tuesday morning, senior police officials said.The woman from Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh suffered nearly 90% burn injuries in the attempt and was admitted to Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee hospital where she succumbed to her injuries late on Wednesday night.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Central, Somen Barma said the former governor’s son was arrested from his Gomti Nagar residence on Wednesday night and sent to judicial custody after being produced before a court on Thursday afternoon.Alok Prasad is the chairperson of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe cell of the UP Congress and is the second Congressman to be booked for similar incidents in the past three months.The DCP said the initial FIR against Alok Prasad was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 306/511 for provoking the woman who was trying to commit self-immolation; this was later altered to Section 306 for abetment to suicide, as well as Section 120-B for criminal conspiracy.A senior police official privy to the investigation said Alok Prasad was in touch with the woman for the past few days and had provoked the woman to commit self-immolation to draw the state government’s attention to her case. He added that even Prasad’s call records proved that he was in touch with the woman.Also Read: UP Dalit teen’s body found with limbs tied, kin allege rape The official said that the woman has been protesting against one Asif Raza claiming he had abandoned her after marriage and left for Dubai.They said she was first married to one Akhilesh Kumar and got into a relationship with Asif after separation from her husband a few years ago. She is believed to have lived with Asif for a few months and even changed her name.

While the 50-year-old woman had succumbed to her injuries at the civil hospital five days after the incident, her daughter had survived.Congress leader Anup Patel and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) politician Qadeer Khan, as well as two relatives of the woman, were then booked under IPC Sections 306 for abetment to suicide and 120-B for criminal conspiracy on July 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-congress-leader-jailed-for-provoking-woman-to-set-herself-ablaze-she-is-dead/story-6sKa16RsZc9NZvhPTyJbHM.html
16-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s IGI airport recovers 48% of domestic flight operations||Since flight operations resumed in the country on May 25, after two months of complete lockdown, the Delhi airport has recovered 48% of its domestic flight operations during the pre-Covid times. The airport has recovered operations on 83% of the total domestic routes it operates flights to, said Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), that runs the airport.After the two-month ban on flight operations was lifted, domestic flights were allowed on all sectors while international flights are operating only to select destinations within the air bubble arrangement under Vande Bharat Mission.The airport operator said that until last month, the airport had commenced operations on 83.33% of its domestic routes. “Till February, IGIA operated flights to 71 domestic sectors across country. As on September 23, flights to 60 of these routes have already been commenced,” it said.Also read: Aviation sector experts peg hopes on festive seasonThe airport operator said that 11 routes that are yet to resume flights are Agra, Shimla, Jodhpur, Shirdi, Bhatinda, Gwalior, Khajuraho, Nanded, Durgapur, Adampur and Dimapur.An official from the Delhi Air Traffic Control, who wished not to be named, said on an average, Delhi airport operated a total of 1,350 flights a day before the lockdown. Out of these, approximately 900 were domestic flights, the officer said.“At present, because international flights are yet to resume in a full-fledged manner, the total air traffic movement is of 700 on an average, per day. Out of these, approximately 450 -500 are domestic flights,” the officer said. The total air traffic movement also includes chartered flights, Air Force flight operations, air ambulances and cargo flights.An official from an airline, who requested anonymity, said the air traffic is low because people are still restricting their travel to only emergency situations. “These 11 sectors do not witness heavy air connectivity even during the normal times and hence, mostly because passenger demand is low on these sectors, there has been no flight,” the official said.The traffic is, however, expected to grow in the coming days. Since the lockdown was lifted, only Terminal 3 was made operational as the number of flights was low. October 1 onwards, DIAL also made Terminal 2 operational, shifting all operations of GoAir and some of IndiGo there, from T3. Terminal 1, that is undergoing expansion, however, will continue to remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-airport-recovers-48-of-domestic-flight-operations/story-Y7mucecyYQkn2jSIjy6AzO.html
16-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Non-Covid ICUs at 75% occupancy, Covid-19 ICUs at 53%||Over 75% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds for non-Covid-19 patients in Delhi beds are occupied. There are 1,522 ICU beds—with and without ventilators—for the treatment of patients with illnesses other than Covid-19, shows the government’s ‘Delhi Corona’ app, much lesser than the ones earmarked for the disease. There are 3,171 ICU beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Delhi currently. With the city recording fewer cases over the last two weeks in the city, the occupancy of the Covid-19 ICU beds has reduced to just over 50%. Currently, there are over 15,800 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, and over 10,700 of them are vacant. The number of Covid-19 hospitalisations has reduced to just over 5,000 as compared to over 7,000 at its peak during the September surge. Also Read: Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine did not cut hospital stay or mortality in Covid-19 patients: WHOThe government has provided data on non-Covid-19 ICU beds in the app after the high court had asked it about the availability of ICU beds for non Covid-19 patients while listening to a petition on the reservation of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients at 33 big hospitals in the city. In September, when the number of cases started going up, the ICUs of many of the big private hospitals like Max, Apollo, Fortis, and Gangaram started filling up. The Delhi government then ordered 33 of the big hospitals to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. This was challenged in the high court as this would have prevented the hospitals from carrying out other surgeries. The order was stayed by the court stating that it was “arbitrary”, “unreasonable”, and in violation of the fundamental rights of an individual. An expert committee has now suggested that Delhi will see a massive surge in cases in the winter months with 15,000 cases every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-non-covid-icus-at-75-occupancy-covid-19-icus-at-53/story-4nEQdMoGL5YJHb7p8z5cJK.html

16-10-2020||Delhi||Unwilling to appear before Delhi assembly panel: Facebook to top court||Facebook India told the Supreme Court on Thursday that it is unwilling to participate in the proceedings before the Delhi legislative assembly’s peace and harmony committee, which is probing the Delhi riots of February 2020 and the role of the social media giant in failing to curb hate speech in connection with the riots. Senior counsel Harish Salve, representing Facebook, told a bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul that the proceedings before the Committee are outside the scope of jurisdiction of the Delhi assembly and that Facebook is regulated by central law — the Information Technology Act (IT Act).“I am not willing to go before them. Allegations are being made that Facebook has created disharmony in Delhi. Facebook does not write anything. It provides a platform. We are regulated by a central law – the IT Act,” Salve said.The central government also threw its weight behind Facebook stating that Delhi assembly’s action in holding such an inquiry is without jurisdiction.“Public order and police are not under Delhi assembly and their action is without jurisdiction,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the central government, submitted.The court was hearing a plea by Facebook India and its vice-president and managing director, Ajit Mohan challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the Committee that sought Mohan’s presence before the panel as part of its inquiry into the Delhi riots.The Delhi government has maintained that Mohan was summoned as a witness to ascertain the social media platform’s views on the question of whether it had contributed in any way to the building up of a situation in Delhi that ended in communal riots in February 2020.The Committee wanted to elicit suggestions on how social media platforms could be used to strengthen the unity among the citizens of Delhi in the future and Mohan and others were summoned in this regard as witnesses and not as accused and no coercive action was intended against them, an affidavit filed before the top court by the Delhi Legislative Assembly on October 6 said.“It is the inherent right of the Legislature to examine matters of public importance and for that purpose to require the presence of persons who are performing a duty of public importance or who has expertise in the matter, before the Committee,” the affidavit stated.Consequently, Mohan cannot claim right to remain silent or to be let alone in response to the summons to depose before a lawful Committee of an empowered legislature, and the right to remain silent is not a fundamental right except when the person is an accused under Article 20 of the Constitution, it added.The bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul on Thursday adjourned the matter for December 2 so as to enable parties to file necessary pleadings before the court. The interim protection granted by the apex court to Facebook officials on September 23 from appearing before the Committee will continue till the next date of hearing, the court said.The bench which also comprised justice Dinesh Maheshwari remarked that the issue to be considered is whether the Delhi legislative assembly has the power to deal with the subject matter in question.The Committee is investigating Facebook’s alleged complicity in the Delhi riots after it received several complaints from the public pursuant to an article was published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14.The WSJ report titled ‘Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics’ had alluded to the role allegedly played by top Facebook officials, particularly its public policy head Ankhi Das, by citing business imperatives to refrain from applying hate-speech rules to at least 4 individuals and groups linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though such groups and individuals had been internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence.Mohan was first summoned by the Committee for its meeting of September 15 in connection with the complaints alleging deliberate omissions and inaction by the social media company in removing hateful content and posts. The Committee had earlier said that in its meeting of August 31, it had prima facie found Facebook India was allegedly complicit in aggravating the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left at least 53 people dead and over 400 injured.Facebook officials had failed to appear for the September 15 meeting after which a second notice was issued on September 18 asking Mohan to appear before it on September 23. Facebook India and Mohan approached the top court on September 22 challenging the notices.It was contended that the summons violates the right of the petitioner to remain silent and right to privacy which are fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution. “By targeting Facebook – a platform that allows users to express themselves – the summons create a chilling effect on the free speech rights of users of the Facebook service,” the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unwilling-to-appear-before-delhi-assembly-panel-facebook-to-top-court/story-SmxiJmhley7iiSnI8MXimN.html

According to a party statement, the wrestler-turned-politician will contest the November 3 bypoll from Baroda seat in Sonipat. The last date to file nomination for the bypoll is Friday.  The bye-election was necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA Shri Krishan Hooda in April. In the 2019 assembly polls, Dutt had lost to Hooda from the seat. Till about midnight, the Congress was yet to announce its candidate for the seat. Earlier in the morning, some sports personalities including BJP leader Babita Phogat, Sakshi Malik, Geeta Phogat and Dutt had met Chief Minister M L Khattar in Delhi.Dutt who was among three sportspersons to have been fielded by the BJP for the 2019 assembly elections had polled 30.73% votes in his debut loss. Woman grappler, Babita Phogat and drag flicker, Sandeep Singh were the other two sportspersons fielded by the BJP for the assembly polls with only Singh winning the election.  The sportspersons batted for Dutt’s candidature for the Baroda seat, which the saffron party has never won. Khattar earlier said that the party’s state unit had discussed 25 names, but shortlisted four and sent it to the party high command. The party on Thursday evening announced Dutt’s name for the seat. The wrestler-turned-politician, who hails from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonipat district, had joined the BJP in 2019 ahead of the state assembly polls. Dutt, who won the bronze medal in the 2012 Olympic Games, also won a gold medal in the 2014 Commonwealth Games and was awarded the Padma Shri in 2013. Ahead of the next month’s bypolls, Dutt has been actively campaigning in the constituency. The leaders of the BJP, which is contesting the bypoll with the backing of its ally Jannayak Janta Party, have exuded confidence that they will wrest the seat from the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/olympic-medallist-yogeshwar-dutt-named-as-bjp-s-pick-for-baroda-bypolls-in-haryana/story-sDXDuY4fWjdC9bDz0rGzyH.html
16-10-2020||Lucknow||Chinmayanand case: Police file perjury charges against woman||The law student who accused former union minister Chinmayanand of sexual harassment will face perjury charges, officials said on Thursday. Appearing before a special MP-MLA court on Tuesday, the woman had denied that she had levelled any allegations against Chinmayanand, prompting the police to move the court to try the woman on charges of perjury under section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.The law student is already facing a State vs Chinmayanand case. Special judge Pawan Kumar Rai fixed November 11 for hearing in the case pertaining to perjury. “A case has been filed against the law student under Section 340 of the CrPC for lying in court. This is a miscellaneous case in addition to the ongoing State Vs Chinmayanand case,” said advocate Abhay Tripathi, representing the state government. “The law student will have to appear before the court on November 11 while Swami Chinmayanand will have to appear in court on November 19,” said Tripathi. “In all her FIRs, even the one lodged in New Delhi, the law student had levelled allegations of sexual harassment against the former minister. Now, she has disowned these allegations. This is a clear case of perjury,” he said. The sexual harassment case came to light in August last year when the woman went missing from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Later, she released videos alleging rape and sexual harassment by the former union minister. The former minister is the president of the managing committee of Swami Shukdevanand post-graduate college, Shahjahanpur, where the woman studied law. The state government formed a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate the matter. The SIT had lodged an FIR against the former minister under Section 376-C of the IPC. It also implicated the law student for extortion.Chinmayanand and the law student were arrested and sent to jail in September last year.In February this year, the Allahabad high court granted bail to Chinmayanand. The woman also secured bail and is currently out of jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/chinmayanand-case-police-file-perjury-charges-against-woman/story-TW7kGrFJB3KZRfCQN0YRDP.html

Refusing to restrain the release of the movie at this stage, the court said, “Who will go and watch a movie in the theatre during the pandemic. Those who wanted to see the movie have already watched it on the OTT platform.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-refuses-to-bar-gunjan-saxena-says-art-shouldn-t-be-viewed-as-bias/story-FHLE7A0RUlM4KI7FeUeD1L.html

He was also the father of her child, Sufiyan. But as she was preparing to give birth to their second baby, they separated again.That was shortly before the coronavirus-triggered lockdown and Samina, 21, was then living on a pavement in central Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti. Fortunately, she had the foresight to save ₹4,000 for her pregnancy-related emergency. “I had given ₹551 to a dai (traditional birth attendant) two months in advance and she helped me with the delivery, along with my neighbours on the patri (pavement).”Ikram was born three months ago, she says. By then Samina was back from a school in Sarai Kale Khan neighbourhood “where we patri wale were put during the lockdown.” Samina talks of the meals that she and everyone there would be served daily, twice.These days, Samina has taken full responsibilities of a single parent. In the evening she is often seen sitting on the pavement across the street from Zuberi Hotel, in the basti. While baby Ikram remains perched on her lap, little Sufiyan sits cross-legged on the ground beside her, nibbling into a jalebi or a samosa a passerby hands over to them. Sometimes both kids are asleep, their faces sheltered under the mother’s dupatta. The basti lanes are no longer as crowded as in the BC (before corona) era, when hundreds of pilgrims would daily walk up to the famous Sufi shrine that gives its name to the historic village. Even so, Samina manages to earn enough to afford the monthly rent of ₹3,000 for a room she has taken up in the area. “In the day I always sit on the patri on Lodhi Road side... this way we manage to get food that people distribute to beggars.”Samina admits she is able to take care of only the most urgent daily needs of her sons. “I will have to raise them all by myself,” she answers matter-of-factly to a query. She says that her father passed away a long time ago and she isn’t in touch with her mother, who lives in Bihar. Unlike most other beggars in the basti, Samina doesn’t call out to passersby. She accepts whatever money or food any of them gives her. “God gives us life and it has to be lived,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-a-single-parent/story-LUQ07qmpoLsz0EgND2WzEI.html
16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Data on Delhi-NCR pollution vindicates Punjab govt’s stance: Amarinder||Welcoming the latest data on the link between Delhi’s pollution and stubble burning as vindication of his government’s stand on the issue, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday asked Arvind Kejriwal to stop lying in order to divert attention from his own failure to protect the national capital’s environment. Hours after Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said that stubble burning contributes to only 4% of PM 2.5 pollution in NCR, with the rest caused by local factors, he slammed his Delhi counterpart for refusing to accept the results of comprehensive studies on the issue. “In fact, it is Kejriwal who is in denial,” Amarinder said, reacting to the Delhi CM’s remark about “being in denial not helping”. He said if Kejriwal was serious about addressing Delhi’s crisis, he should stop being in denial immediately and get down to the task of finding solutions in right earnest. The CM said Kejriwal had been spreading misinformation on the issue with the sole agenda of keeping Delhiites in the dark about the actual situation. He said the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), in a research paper, has found that Delhi’s pollution is localised and not attributable to the farm fires in Punjab or the NCR. The Punjab CM said it was obvious that Kejriwal, who had been blaming Punjab’s farm fires for the poor AQI levels in Delhi for the past several years, was taking refuge in brazen falsehoods to divert public attention from the AAP government’s total failure in controlling the environmental situation in Delhi. Amarinder said while his government was doing its best to reduce stubble burning problem, the farmers unfortunately were facing a massive problem in managing paddy straw in the absence of fiscal aid for the purpose. He reiterated his demand for ₹100 per quintal as financial support from the Centre to eliminate the stubble burning problem in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/data-on-delhi-ncr-pollution-vindicates-punjab-govt-s-stance-amarinder/story-KIWj3CBATqgS06kJ5JHRSJ.html
16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Captain blames Centre for Punjab’s power crisis||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday blamed the Centre for failing to resolve the power crisis resulting from farmers’ agitation due to the ‘arrogant and callous’ attitude towards the farm leaders at the Delhi meeting, while urging the farmers to ease their ‘rail roko’ agitation to allow the transportation of critical essentials. He said while three of his cabinet colleagues were in discussion with the farmer unions to persuade them to lift the rail blockade, which had led to serious coal shortage in the state, it was the duty of the Union government to engage with them. Pointing out that two power units at Lehra Mohabat and a unit of GVK in Tarn Taran had already shut down, Amarinder, while responding to a question from a Bathinda resident during his Facebook Live session, said the state was staring at a massive power shortage. He said Punjab was also facing critical shortage of urea and needed to urgently move foodgrain from godowns as well. “There is a suggestion that the state should purchase power from the central grid, but where is the money?” he said. The CM said his government will do everything to save the farmers and their future. The government is consulting topmost lawyers to find a way to fight the black farm laws, he said, while refusing to comment on the contours of the Bill proposed to be presented in the special assembly session as the process of consultation was still on. He also termed the Centre’s withdrawal from the SC Post-Matric Scholarship scheme as a “retrograde step”. In response to a question from a Batala resident, who said he wanted to visit Kartarpur, Amarinder said they had already written to the Centre that Punjab had no objections. Now, the decision rests with the Centre, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/captain-blames-centre-for-punjab-s-power-crisis/story-uOwnDxuUz28OaJjuyy3pFL.html
16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Attack on Punjab BJP chief’s car: Akali Dal warns DGP of gherao if fake cases registered against farmers||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday warned Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta of ‘gherao’ if a false case is registered against any farmer in connection with the attack on BJP state president Ashwani Sharma. Addressing a press conference here, SAD leaders Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljit Singh Cheema said the party would stand with farmers who were holding a peaceful agitation against the farm laws. The two leaders said it was shocking that both chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Gupta had come out with identical statements, stating that 25 farmer organisations were linked with the attack on Sharma two days after a case was registered against unidentified persons in the matter. “This is nothing more than a nefarious attempt to derail the farmer agitation, which we will not allow in any circumstance,” they said. “Even the Congress MP from Ludhiana, Ravneet Singh Bittu, has confessed that Congressmen were behind the attack. Why isn’t the state government taking any action against Bittu instead of targeting innocent farmers?” they asked. The SAD also condemned the Congress government for ‘rubbing salt into the wounds of Dalit students’ by announcing a budgetary provision of ₹600 crore for the SC scholarship scheme for 2021-22 after not releasing ₹2,440 crore pending for the last three years. Terming it an insult of the community, former chief parliamentary secretary Pawan Kumar Tinu challenged the CM to tell if his government had released a single rupee from the allocation of ₹2,440 crore. He said the SAD would launch a ‘morcha’ to demand justice for the SC community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/attack-on-punjab-bjp-chief-s-car-akali-dal-warns-dgp-of-gherao-if-fake-cases-registered-against-farmers/story-i42UOTrJsBUveqXN17UfuN.html
16-10-2020||Chandigarh||OPD, schools in Punjab to open from Monday||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered resumption of normal OPD services and elective surgeries, with extensive precautions in place, but warned against any complacency given the projections of a possible second wave of Covid-19.The chief minister (CM) also allowed reopening of government schools from Monday after due sanitisation and disinfection procedures, and with clear SOPs mandating parents’ consent as well as ceiling on the number of students and hours of operation. He conveyed these decisions during a virtual meeting to review the Covid situation.However, the state government has decided not to open multiplexes, cinema halls and entertainment parks in the state. “@capt_amarinder led Punjab government decides not to open Multiplexes, Cinema Halls and Entertainment Parks in the state yet. However, Ramlilas to be allowed with strict Covid protocols,” CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted.The state authorities had earlier permitted cinema halls and multiplexes to reopen from Thursday. Expressing concern over the warnings by health and medical experts of the grave possibility of a second wave hitting the state during the winter months, Amarinder directed his officers to take all steps to ensure that things remain under control during the festive times ahead. The CM also asked the departments to ensure that the medical staff is kept motivated and all vacancies are filled up immediately.DGP Dinkar Gupta said in the meeting that Punjab Police were gearing up to manage the festival season and all efforts would be made to ensure strict adherence to Covid norms at places such as markets and ramlilas. He said the police were also currently focused on handling the increasing number of farmer protests, as well as picketing by the BJP and the RSS.Warning of 2nd wave during festival seasonDr KK Talwar, head of Punjab government’s expert advisory committee on health, termed the decline in positivity rate to 2.60 a good sign, but warned of a second wave hitting the state during the festival season. “With just about 500-odd cases daily at present, the projections for the next few days are positive. However, the spate of upcoming festivals and the fatigue in the health system could see the next wave hitting soon,” he added.Dr Rajesh Kumar, a member of the Covid expert group, said even if the situation remained under control throughout November, the onset of the winter season could trigger a spurt in infections.Dr Talwar said teams of experts were being formed to conduct a mortality audit of every hospital to identify gaps, since the fatality rate in the state continued to be high (at 3.1%). This is despite the fact that the recovery rate has gone up from 82% on October 1 to 90.3% as of October 13.Oxygen generation plants to come up at 13 hospitalsHealth secretary Hussan Lal said to ensure adequate availability of oxygen supply in the coming weeks and months, tendering for 1st phase for augmenting the supply was in process. The Government of India had fixed the rates of medical oxygen, including that of transportation of cylinders, though liquid oxygen transportation rates were yet to be fixed, he added.In the first phase, oxygen generation plants will be set up at district hospitals in Jalandhar, Ludhiana and at medical colleges at Patiala, Amritsar, and Faridkot, which will be followed by district hospitals in Mansa, Sangrur, Bathinda and MKH, Patiala in the second phase and district hospitals of Rupnagar, Ferozepur, Gurdaspur and Amritsar in the third phase. Aggressively counter false Covid propaganda: CM to sarpanchesChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has written to all sarpanches in the state, urging them to aggressively counter the false propaganda being spread about Covid by certain malicious people.Amarinder, in his communication, has asked the sarpanches to work among the people to ensure that they are not misled by the misinformation and blatant lies, and strengthen the government’s hands in fighting the pandemic, especially in the upcoming festival season.He said though various measures taken by his government had led to improvement in the Covid situation, the state could not afford to be complacent. “We cannot afford to let our guard down, especially considering the fact that the paddy harvesting is on, and also the government procurement,” he said.Reminding the sarpanches of their moral duty, the CM asked them to maintain strict vigil on the health situation and encourage anyone showing Covid symptoms to undergo testing.He further asked them to ensure that the patients infected with Covid, as well as their contacts, are identified and kept in isolation, for which elaborate arrangements should be made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/opd-schools-in-punjab-to-open-from-monday/story-zyH9d9HXYbfBCrrQWSchjL.html
16-10-2020||City||Congress creating false narrative about farm laws: Smriti Irani||Textiles minister Smriti Irani on Thursday justified the absence of any Union minister at the meeting called by the agriculture department with farmer union leaders in Delhi on October 14 by saying that the invitation had specifically mentioned that a team led by agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal will hold discussions with the farm leaders. “It is wrong to conclude that elected representatives stayed away from Wednesday meeting as the deliberation was held as per the programme,” she said during a virtual interaction with journalists. Irani, who was addressing the videoconference from Delhi, avoided answering if the Centre would agree to the demand of a minister’s presence for a dialogue with protesting farmer unions. “New farm rules were tabled in the Parliament and duly passed by both Houses. Nonetheless, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and defence minister Rajnath Singh were constantly in touch with officials and experts in the agriculture department during yesterday’s meeting,” she said.The minister said the delegation had submitted a charter of demands to the Union government, but some of these points were not related to agriculture reforms or new laws.“One of the key points was a demand to release certain activists from jails,” she added.Irani said the Punjab government was supporting anti-social elements engaged in holding protests outside BJP leaders’ houses and attacking them. She neither commented on the Shiromani Akali Dal’s claim that the new rules were against farmers’ interests nor made any observation on the unions who have blocked railway route in Punjab.“Akalis may have their own internal political issues, but the Centre on various occasions had clearly talked about farm reforms for the benefit of the farming community. Modi government is committed to enhancing farmers’ income. The Congress is creating a false narrative that the new farm bills are anti-farmers,” she said.Arhtiyas concerned over loss of work In another session with the Union minister, arhtiyas expressed their fear of being left out of the foodgrain procurement business. Delegates said there were about 27,000 commission agents in Punjab, who have a team of accountants and other workers associated with them in mandi business and new rules may upset their work.Dhiraj Kumar, an office-bearer of the Punjab Arhtiyas Association, asked her to restart the purchase of cotton by the Cotton Corporation of India through them. The corporation comes under the ministry of textiles.Irani said the Centre was sensitive to various stakeholders of the farm sector and there were no plans to dilute Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) or minimum support price (MSP).Meanwhile, a group of at least 15 AAP activists held a protest outside the venue of the videoconference and raised slogans against the BJP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-creating-false-narrative-about-farm-laws-smriti-irani/story-78wa46G9PPgxQV7npzHIbO.html
16-10-2020||City||PRTC approaches state government for ₹90 crore bailout package amid mounting losses||Struggling to get back on the track, the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) has sought ₹90 crore bailout package from the Punjab government to compensate for the losses it incurred during and after the coronavirus-induced lockdown period. The corporation had incurred losses to the tune of₹51 crore in the first 60 days of the complete lockdown, with daily loss pegged at₹85 lakh. But even after resuming its operations after relaxations in restrictions on May 18, the PRTC is finding it hard to meet its committed expenditure due to low occupancy. Presently, the corporation is running 55% of its fleet of 1,125 buses and it recently resumed its inter-state bus services. PRTC managing director Jaskiran Singh said, “We have written to the state government to provide financial aid on monthly basis till December to cope up with the pandemic losses. The daily income at present is₹70 lakh against₹1.40 crore before the lockdown in March,” he said. Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, the convener of the PRTC trade unions, said since the losses are increasing with every passing month, the government must step in. “Besides expenditure on running buses, the PRTC needs at least₹19 crore a month to pay salaries and pensions to its employees. But with present income, the corporation is struggling to meet its committed expenditure,” he said. PRTC chairman KK Sharma said they are hopeful of increasing daily revenue with the start of inter-state bus service. “We are trying to convey to people that they can board our buses without any fear of contracting infections as they are being sanitised on daily basis,” Sharma said. Govt already owes corporation₹200 crore The state government already owes the PRTC more than₹200 crore against the free and concessional facilities the corporation is providing, mainly to police personnel and students. Nirmal Dhaliwal said the government has stalled the claims related to free and departmental concessional travelling for three years. “Also,₹2 crore are due against the ‘Mukh Mantri Tirath Darshan Yatra’ scheme. Moreover, the corporation has not been compensated for bringing back Punjab residents from Hazur Sahib, students from Rajasthan and ferrying migrant labourers to railway stations and elsewhere,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prtc-approaches-state-government-for-90-crore-bailout-package-amid-mounting-losses/story-uSwyTJV72zSGZn6V6eL3aN.html
16-10-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal launches ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign to discourage idling at traffic signals||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Thursday launched a new anti-pollution campaign under which motorists will be encouraged to switch off vehicles while waiting for the lights to turn green at traffic signals.“It has been seen that we often do not switch off our vehicle engines while waiting at traffic signals. That is called idling. The ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign will aim to bring a behavioural change in that regard. It will help reduce air pollution,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing.He added, “Around 10 million vehicles are registered in Delhi. Even if one million of them actively follow the campaign, experts suggest that it can reduce PM10 emissions by 1.5 tonnes a year and PM2.5 emissions by 0.4 tonnes a year.”“Idling (waiting at a traffic signal with engine on) consumes more fuel than a normal drive. On average, a car is left idling for around 15 to 20 minutes a day, and that ends up exhausting at least 200ml of fuel. Experts have suggested that one can save ₹7,000 a year by avoiding idling,” the chief minister said.Also Read: AQI reaches ‘very poor’ on the first day of Grap winter plan in DelhiWhile appealing to all motorists to join the drive, Kejriwal said, “Covid-19 has led to distress among people, let’s ensure that pollution doesn’t make things worse for us.”“Crop stubble burning in neighbouring states leads to pollution in Delhi. That has been the case for years now. We cannot do much about other states, but we are taking all possible measures to control local sources of pollution by implementing an anti-dust strategy, a tree transplantation policy, an electric vehicle policy and decomposing crop stubble using new technology. This campaign will be another step towards reducing pollution,” he said.How the campaign will be implemented is being chalked out, environment minister Gopal Rai said later in the day. “This campaign has the potential to bring down vehicular pollution by 15-20%. We will start working on the road map of the campaign from Friday, after a meeting with all senior officials,” he said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, said, “For this campaign to work in terms of behavioural change, it is very important to make sure traffic signals have timers and that the timers are functional. Several survey estimates have shown that reduced idling can lead to energy saving and less toxic exposure to particulate matters, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxide.”Mukti Advani, principal scientist at the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said, “Switching off engines will reduce fuel consumption as the wait at any traffic signal may go beyond 20 seconds. In 2018, the CRRI had conducted an awareness campaign on idling along with Petroleum Conservation and Research Association and surveyed 100 intersections in the city for a period of six months.”“It is recommended that such awareness campaigns be conducted on a regular basis. An adequate number of countdown timers should be positioned correctly for better results,” said Advani, citing the survey findings. “However, Delhi needs to find alternative ways to decongest its roads; primarily, by reducing the number of private vehicles and by providing better public transport. Road capacity has to be improved by removing encroachments such as parked vehicles, and vehicles that break down on the road, etc,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-launches-red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign-to-discourage-idling-at-traffic-signals/story-ctaOZKTFaxc8kkIv26eV6L.html

Principals of several government schools stated that they had made all preparations, such as sanitising the premises and taking parents’ consent, but decided against reopening the school after the minister released the video. Sanjeev Thapar, principal, Government Model Senior Secondary Smart School, Punjab Agricultural University, said, “We made all necessary arrangements to welcome the students today but after the minister’s video, we decided to wait for the orders from the state education department. We also informed the students not to report to school today. We will inform them of the reopening date as soon as the education department conveys it to us.”Government Senior Secondary School, Ayali Khurd, principal Kanwaljot Kaur, said, “We have sanitised the school and were fully prepared to reopen the school today. To plan the time table and seating plan, I have already conducted a meeting with the teachers and have received written consent from few parents who are willing to send their children to school. Once we receive the orders from the state education department, we will the students on when to come.”Later in the evening around 4pm, school education secretary Krishan Kumar issued a letter and directed government schools to reopen from October 19 for Classes 9 to 12.In the letter, the school education department has also issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure safety of the students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-5-0-govt-schools-in-ludhiana-remain-closed-amid-confusion/story-47ANbLHBkMAk0bv3ySsskI.html
16-10-2020||City||Low-key Durga Puja celebrations this year; sale of idols dips in Thane||Pandal hopping, community lunches and glitzy cultural soiree will be missing this Durga Puja festival as it will be a low-key affair on the backdrop of this year’s pandemic. Idol makers who visit the city from Kolkata every year claim that this time the sale of idols is 40 per cent less while the demand is more for small idols.Durga Puja is a huge affair in Thane with most Bengali communities setting up huge pandals across the city. Idol makers, folk artistes and priests come down from Kolkata every year during the season to provide the feel of Durga Puja celebrations akin to West Bengal.Idol maker Shubhojit Das has been coming from Kolkata every year since the last 14 years to make idols for Durga Puja. “Every year, we arrive four months in advance with our skilled workers. This year, I came with fewer workers a month ago. There are many pandals who are not celebrating this year. We have only received 60 per cent orders for idols. These are for smaller ones at 4 ft or less.”Some of the Durga Puja pandals have used their funds for Covid relief activities and cancelled celebrations this year. Navodaya Sangh near Kashinath Ghanekar is one such pandal.“We used funds in many ways, from providing financial support to social organisations that provide Covid relief activities to helping those within our vicinity in need of any assistance during the lockdown. Moreover, we will be making payment as we do every year to our priest and folk artistes who arrive from Kolkata to perform the rituals,” said Shushobhan Chowdhary, President, Navodaya Sangh. Meanwhile, some other pandals will have minimal celebrations, “It will be a low-key affair. Instead of a pandal, it will be in a hall with restricted entry of devotees, as per government rules. We have decided to go online completely – from printing online invitation cards to telecasting the puja and all other rituals for the four days. This year, our theme will be ‘Salute to Covid Warriors. On all the four days, we shall host in-house cultural programmes online,” said Abhijit Chatterjee, member, New Bengal Club, which has been celebrating at Manpada, near Neelkanth Woods, for the last 19 years.Similarly, Bangiya Parishad, opposite Highland Gardens in Dhokali, have kept a very low budget. B Majumdar of the organising committee, said, “We have not made any huge plans and would only conduct it in a small hall with basic provisions. It will be for the sake of it as we wish to continue with the ritual this year as well. We will follow all social distancing rules and ensure fewer people are present. We will have limited prasad for 10 to 15 devotees who will be attending the puja. These will be small packets, thus following the no contact policy.”This year, members of these pandals are themselves making all the arrangements for decorations and rituals. A minimum of 10 people from the organising committee will be present including the priest within the pandals. No outsiders or devotees will be allowed and there will not be any stalls or exhibitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/low-key-durga-puja-celebrations-this-year-sale-of-idols-dips-in-thane/story-e8XNF2iMsGPGiTm277wKEL.html

It has surpassed the target specified by the state government and claims to have performed the best in the state among all civic bodies with respect to target and population ratio.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) deployed 670 squads, each with 2-3 persons, for the survey.Abhijit Bangar, municipal commissioner, said, “The state government had given NMMC a target of 3,16,449 families to be surveyed. We have surpassed that target by surveying 3,35,469 families till date. The targeted population figure was 14,24,020, of which 10,53,896 residents have been covered through door-to-door campaign. As per the data on the government dashboard, we are leading in achieving maximum target in MMR region and also in state.”The survey staff went door to door and checked the body temperature and oxygen level of the residents and collated their health information related to fever, cough, cold, blood pressure, diabetes, heart ailments and other co-morbidities. These were recorded in an App of the government.Bangar said: “A massive awareness campaign has also been undertaken. All the family members are being made aware of the precautions they need to take against Covid including wearing of masks, washing hands regularly, using sanitizer, not hiding any disease, going to fever clinics to get tested, taking medicines regularly for co-morbidities and also encouraging those who have recovered from Covid to donate plasma to help others.”The civic body will start the second phase on Thursday by revisiting all the households and again testing their body temperature and oxygen saturation level and getting details of their health.Stated Bangar, “The three-point programme of our Mission Break The Chain – Trace, Test and Treat – is facilitated through the survey. It is helping us identify and register persons with co-morbidities and also Covid symptoms. This helps in immediate treatment. It also helps us in contact tracing and treatment that will help reduce fatalities.”Subhamoy Ghosh, 45, secretary of Prajapati Park Housing Society in Koparkhairane, said, “It was great to see the staff taking all requisite precautions with one of them in PPE kit to test the residents of our society. They went to every flat and collected the details and were very courteous as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-drive-navi-mumbai-exceeds-target-to-survey-families-tops-state-chart/story-26K80VYnT9iXGTazJEF72H.html

16-10-2020||City||Residents of Vashi demand a new burial ground in Navi Mumbai||With the Kopri burial ground in Sector 26, Vashi reaching its maximum capacity, the demand for a new burial ground in Navi Mumbai for the Muslim community has intensified.With space available for just one more body to be buried, the Kopri burial ground will soon bear a board which saying it has exhausted its capacity. The trust that manages the ground has informed the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) that no more burial will be possible, especially those of Covid patients at this ground and demanded an alternate ground.The Kopri burial ground is divided into two parts – a 1,000 sq m land that is kept only for non-Covid deaths and the 500 sq m land for Covid deaths.Aniqullah Khan, trustee of Noorul Islam Trust that manages the burial ground, said, “After the first week of October, there was no space left for burials on the land meant for Covid burials. The 500 sqm land that has been kept exclusively for the burial of Covid patients, has buried 46 bodies.”On an average, the burial ground in Kopri used to receive around seven bodies monthly before the pandemic. Since the pandemic struck, Covid bodies alone have been 46 from April.“The other part of the burial ground that is for non-Covid patients is also filling up and we are afraid we will have to shut that too. We have been demanding a new patch of land from NMMC. Where would we ask the people to go?” Khan said.Kopri burial ground is home for the deceased from Turbhe, Vashi and some parts of Sanpada as well.Navi Mumbai has five burial grounds – in Airoli, Koparkhairane, Kopri, Nerul and Belapur – all nearing capacity.“At the beginning of the pandemic, we had demanded a new space for Muslim community to bury Covid patients alone. Since it has not been granted, each burial ground made provisions to dedicate a small patch from the existing ones to bury the Covid patients,” Saleem Shaikh, Chairman of Muslim Ekta Foundation said.NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “We have written to MIDC to provide us any land in their area that could be used as a burial ground. We are awaiting a response from them.”Koparkhairane, which has around 2,600 sqm burial ground of which 500 sqm is dedicated for Covid deaths, has buried 12 Covid dead bodies, said Abbas Mullah from Anjuman Khairul Islam trust of Navi Mumbai. The 2,000 sqm Airoli burial ground has received 10 Covid bodies.“We receive bodies from Rabale, Rabale MIDC and Ghansoli areas,” Kaleem Khan, a member of Airoli Masjeed-e-Aqsa Trust, said. Hidayat ul Islam trust of Nerul managing Nerul graveyard is also afraid of nearing a closure soon.“Around 40 Covid death cases have come here. The non-Covid deaths have also increased. Around 25 of them arrive every month. We can have more 20 Covid death cases after which we are afraid we too might have to close the Covid burial. For the non-Covid deaths, we have to dig only around 4 ft deep pit but for Covid deaths, the pit has to be around 10 ft deep and eight ft wide. Moreover, we still have no clarity on when can the land with Covid patients buried be dug again. Normally, we dig the land again after two-and-a-half years. But in Covid death, some say it’s done after five years, some others say it’s after 10. We do not have any official communication,” Quresh Ahmed, president of the Nerul trust said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-of-vashi-demand-a-new-burial-ground-in-navi-mumbai/story-EL9PyDfYTV6ZIgbKvHXHcM.html

Jogdand drafted the letter to the civic commissioner last week. Jogdand said, “More than 80 per cent of the buildings in Bhiwandi are illegal. The officials and the developers are together in this, leading to the mushrooming of illegal construction in Bhiwandi. I have demanded that the High Court order to take action against these buildings be strictly followed instead of merely setting up a committee to pin responsibility for the collapse.”Jogdand, in 2013, drafted a PIL in the high court following which the court had given orders to take action against the illegal buildings.Rais Shaikh, Member of Legislative Assembly, Samajwadi Party from Bhiwandi who has been continuously following up with the CM and state minister, said, “There is no proper structural audit of the buildings in the city. Almost 80 per cent of the buildings are illegal. How many will the corporation take action against? I have requested the CM and cabinet ministers to implement cluster development in Bhiwandi like in Thane.”Pankaj Ashiya, municipal commissioner of BNCMC, said they have found two officers and the owner of the building guilty for the collapse. Ashiya said, “We will take action against them. One is the town planning department and other is assistant municipal commissioner of BNCMC posted during the time.” Bhiwandi has 25 buildings in C1 category, which is extremely dangerous category. Of these, eight have been demolished. There are 82 structures in the C2 category (dangerous buildings), of which 77 has been vacated while 222 structures come under C2B and C3 categories, which mean they can be repaired while residents occupy the structures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/activist-writes-to-bhiwandi-nizampur-civic-body-wants-action-against-officials-for-building-collapses/story-rmJkdQHweptGNZzQp7pKtK.html
16-10-2020||City||457 structures in Navi Mumbai identified as dangerous to live in||Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has sought structural audit reports of more than 30-year-old buildings in the city by December 31. The civic body has conducted a survey and declared 457 structures as dangerous.NMMC has conducted the survey for 2020-21 to identify dangerous buildings in the city. Following the survey, all the 457 buildings have been issued notices to vacate.Abhijit Bangar, NMMC chief, said, “We have informed the residents that it is mandatory to conduct a structural audit of buildings more than 30 years old by civil or structural engineers registered with NMMC.The structural audit report submitted to NMMC should have details of repairs carried out in the building based on the recommendation of the appointed structural auditor and a certification that the building in question is safe for use.”Bangar added that failure to submit the report by the society or owners will result in a fine of ₹25,000 or the annual property tax amount, whichever is higher.NMMC has listed the details of its registered structural engineers on its website www.nmmc.gov.in The structural audit report is to be submitted by December 31 to the assistant municipal commissioner of the respective wards, ward officers and assistant director (town planning). Bangar said, “Residing in dilapidated and dangerous buildings or houses can cost lives and also lead to financial losses. We appeal to the residents to immediately vacate such structures. Any loss of life or property under such circumstances will be the sole responsibility of the concerned persons.”Responding to the civic order, Ganesh Salvi, 56, a resident of the dilapidated JN type building in Vashi, said, “It is easy for the civic body to declare the buildings dangerous and ask us to vacate them. Where do we go? The government cannot shed responsibility by simply issuing a warning on the state of the buildings. It should make alternate arrangements as most of us cannot afford a new house.”Inbraj Pandian, 45, a social worker, said, “There is no transit camp facility in the city despite demands for several years. It is wrong for the administration to ask people to vacate their houses under such circumstances.”An NMMC official, on condition of anonymity, added, “Efforts have long been on to have transit camp facility in the city but has been stuck due to lack of land availability. We are trying to get land from CIDCO for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/457-structures-in-navi-mumbai-identified-as-dangerous-to-live-in/story-5BVRVLfCe5on8GdnWzRTEJ.html

16-10-2020||City||67% women in Thane slum use public toilets: Survey||More than 67 per cent women surveyed in Thane slums do not have access to toilets inside their houses. This was discovered during a year-long survey conducted by a Thane based organisation, MUSE, to understand the menstrual hygiene practices of women in marginalised communities of Thane. The organisation has prepared a few recommendations that will be submitted to the Thane Municipal Corporation.Nishant Bangera, founder, Muse Foundation, said, “We surveyed women in Thane slums through the year 2019 to study the menstrual hygiene practices followed by the adolescent girls, young and middle-aged women.Around 1,004 women were surveyed from across 15 slum colonies including Azad Nagar, Banjara Basti, Manorama Nagar, Rambaug (Upvan), Shastri Nagar, Shanti Nagar and Nagsen Nagar in Thane. We had 35 volunteers going door to door conducting interviews,” Bangera said.According to the survey, around 12 per cent of the women did not have access to sufficient water. The community toilets were found to be unclean and inadequate to address menstrual needs of the womenfolk. Not changing the menstrual hygiene product for more than 12 hours could cause rashes, infections and, in the worst case scenario, even toxic shock syndrome.“There were 67 per cent of women who accessed these community toilets, making them prone to unsanitary conditions. Similarly, around 56 per cent of the students who went to school had to come back home to change their menstrual hygiene products as they had unclean toilets. Around 18 per cent women who work did not have any provision to change their hygiene products at their workplace. Keeping all of these in mind, we have prepared a list of recommendations that will help provide a hygienic environment to women in Thane city,” said Nehali Jain, project lead, MUSE.Lalitha T, a member of MUSE, said, “It is recommended that public toilets are set up as per national standards and maintained with the help of security personnel. They should also have provision for menstrual hygiene products and basic facilities like water and trash bins. Moreover, this waste must be disposed of using biomedical waste norms; the civic body should conduct health camps and provide affordable medical assistance. Promotion of sustainable menstrual hygiene products like cloth pads, menstrual cups should be done at the local levels.“Moreover, awareness to educate the community about menstrual health and normalise periods is a must. Community members need to be encouraged to accept grievances from the locals and convey to the administration.” MUSE has set up a meeting with TMMC and shall present these recommendations to the local administration at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/67-women-in-thane-slum-use-public-toilets-survey/story-7GDTdQavdnkq0DI3fiRTZL.html

Students of Classes 9-12 may be asked to attend school from November 2.The district education officer (DEO) on Thursday wrote to all government and private schools saying the institutions may reopen from November 2 onwards in a graded manner.

A final call will be taken before November 2.”Officials said students will need parents’ consent to attend school, and attendance will not be compulsory. With only a few students in schools, social distancing measures will be enforced. Online classes will continue and remain the preferred mode of teaching. However, government schools will continue to call Class 9 to 12 students for academic consultation till October 31.Private schools unwilling to openPrivate schools principals say they are unwilling to reopen just yet. Independent School Association president HS Mamik said, “We haven’t been asked about reopening schools from November 2, but schools will have to listen to the parents. Until over 50% of the parents are unwilling send their wards to school, the schools should not open.”He added that the combined pressure of teaching classes in school and also taking online classes will be too much for the teachers and the department must pick either online studies or classrooms for the arrangement to work.Parents, too, are also not in favour of reopening schools so soon. Chandigarh Parent Association president Nitin Goyal said, “Just 10 days ago parents had voted against sending their children to school. Why is the department so insistent on reopening the schools after that?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-schools-may-reopen-for-classes-9-12-students-form-november-2/story-59zPcReHEA89aYD0N6RH5H.html

This comes after a nod from the state government, as part of the fifth phase of the unlocking process that kicked in today.On Thursday, over a dozen buses departed the city for Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and other states. However, bus services to Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi have not yet been started due to restrictions in these states. Punjab roadways general manager Inderjit Singh Chawla said, “Delhi and J&K have not yet opened the borders for buses and we hope that those routes would also be opened in the coming days.” However, PRTC bus operators, on the condition of anonymity, said that they have started picking and dropping passengers from the outskirts of Delhi. Gaganjit Singh, a passenger bound for Delhi, said, “I deal in automobile accessories and have to visit Delhi frequently. The government should have allowed inter-state buses to ply a little early but this is still a relief for us. Though it’s risky to travel in buses, it costs more to travel in private vehicles and taxi.” Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Inter State Bus Terminal supervisor Kuljit Singh said the footfall has increased but it is not as much as what was witnessed in the pre-lockdown period. “Around 250 buses run from this bus stand on a daily basis and passengers are urged to follow all guidelines issued by the government.” Social distancing goes for a tossMeanwhile, with an increase in the footfall, social distancing norms went for a toss at the bus stand on Thursday.

16-10-2020||City||With smaller budgets, fewer staff, takeaway joints mushroom across Mumbai||The Covid-19 lockdown has given a boost to the parcel system, giving rise to several small takeaway food joints across the city. These joints need significantly lesser capital, fewer staff as well as smaller spaces compared to establishing regular hotels. In addition to it, apart from their own delivery executives, these small takeaway joints are also registered with online food-ordering apps such as Zomato and Swiggy, paving way to their growth. “Despite the fact that hotels have been reopened, citizens are reluctant to visit them owing to the fear of the Covid-19 pandemic and hence these small joints are a big draw. Such joints will survive even after the pandemic is over as people today find it convenient to order food,” said Anuj Kejriwal, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Anarock Retail, a consultancy firm. Spread on a 100-square-feet outlet, Chai Nashta is an example of the thriving takeaway joints across the city. Located at Pydhonie, Chai Nashta was opened by 17-year old college student Ayyub Sayed. “My father lost his job during the pandemic and we are facing hard times. We had a small area available and it’s my passion to prepare various food items. So I decided to start this new venture. We have no hotels in the vicinity and hence I am trying my luck,” said Sayed, adding that he is supplying foods such as pizzas, samosas, French fries, nachos, burgers as well as different types of teas. At Powai, Raghav Pai, who always harboured plans to start his food venture, got a chance to establish it when the city was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in the closing down of many establishments. He started Saffron Kitchen at a 400-square-feet area. “As the rents had reduced, we grabbed the opportunity and rented the place. We also got utensils and other items at cheaper rates, as traders wanted to dispose of their items,” said Pai, adding that his entire business was set up on a capital of Rs8 lakh – a sum that is impossible to start a hotel or a restaurant, as they are very costly propositions. When the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed, hoteliers were allowed to operate on the condition that they would only undertake take-away parcels. Many hoteliers could not sustain their businesses as they were paying high rents for the hotel premises and employed large number of staffers. According to the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), small outlets are cost-effective and can be set up in one-fifth of the budget of setting up a hotel. “Any decent restaurant needs an area of around 1,000-square-feet and hence needs an investment of over Rs1 crore but a small take-away joint needs hardly a 200-square-feet area and one can set it up within Rs20 lakh,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, former president, HRAWI. Celebrity chef Sandip Patil, who works in famous Marathi serial Aga Bai Sasubai, is starting his venture Chef’s Kitchen on a 240-square-feet at Lalbaug. “We will be having 240 items on our menu and it can easily be managed in this small place by smart planning,” said Patil, adding that the cuisine would vary from Indian, Continental and Punjabi at his outlet. According to Patil, one of the advantages of running small outlets is that they hardly need seven employees as compared to hotels where at least 15 are needed. Hotel and restaurant consultant Savio D’sa says while the take-away joints are part of innovation, he said those who run such joints must be cautious. “Just jumping in the bandwagon without any planning makes no business sense. They should ensure quality, offer various options as well as give timely deliveries,” said D’sa, adding, “It would be interesting to see how this food business evolves when people start frequenting the hotels in the post Covid-19 scenario.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-smaller-budgets-fewer-staff-takeaway-joints-mushroom-across-mumbai/story-Gy6u7G63cgw5VsD4zwpXgP.html

Ten AC train services operated on Thursday between Churchgate and Virar railway stations, on which 310 passengers travelled. Of these, 300 were season ticket pass holders, while the remaining 10 had journey tickets. The railway authorities, along with the railway protection force (RPF) and government railway police (GRP) personnel conducted thermal screenings of passengers outside the stations. “AC local train services have resumed and all the passengers travelling are being screened.

Passenger associations’ have raised concerns with the resumption of AC trains, citing the increased risk in the spread of Covid-19 owing to the lack of proper ventilation. “The decision to resume AC trains is concerning, as there is no social distancing inside compartments. The train does not have adequate ventilation facilities and if any asymptomatic person travels on one compartment, it could pose a risk of the virus spreading to other passengers onboard, too,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.

The earlier deadline to do so was October 15.“With the Covid-19 crisis and the resultant lockdown, students are likely to have difficulties in procuring the certificates from their previous academic institutes. In light of this, an extension will be given for applications. Similarly, educational institutes have been asked to ensure that all such students get their certificates in time,” stated the circular.Students who switch education boards after Class 10 or Class 12 have to get an eligibility certificate from their institute (school or college). Similarly, students who enrol in colleges outside of the state and the country have to seek eligibility certificates from the board to be able to join the new institute.The board has digitised the application process for eligibility certificates. “This year, since results came in late, students had very little time to procure their eligibility certificates. We ensured that all such requests were processed from our end early. The board has handled hundreds of such queries over the last few days,” said an official from the Mumbai divisional board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-board-extends-deadline-to-apply-for-eligibility-certificates-to-december-15/story-SQW6bClxO8F6Vl4MDz0o2J.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||2 fake social media accounts of I-T joint commissioner used to con her friends out of money; Mumbai Police issue warning to internet users||Gamdevi police have registered a first information report based on the complaint of a joint commissioner of the income tax (I-T) department, after an unknown person created two fake social media accounts in her name to con her friends into sending money. The accused allegedly told people on the complainant’s friends list to help with medical expenses of an acquaintance.Targetting Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers and other senior government officials is a new modus operandi that cyber fraudsters have adopted to cheat people, said state cyber police.The complainant, Smita Verma, is a resident of Income Tax Colony, Peddar Road. In her police complaint she stated that on October 12, she received a call from her friend Shailendra Pandey informing her that he received a message on a social media website from an account featuring her name and photo.“Pandey told the complainant that he also received a photo of a physically-ill woman. The message stated that the daughter of one of Verma’s friend has met an accident and urgently needed ₹15,000 for her treatment and requested Pandey to deposit the same to a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) ID,” said an officer from Gamdevi police station.The complainant told Pandey that she had not sent any such message.After Pandey sent her screenshots of the fake accounts, Verma approached the police and lodged a complaint (of which HT has a copy).Gamdevi police registered a case against an unidentified person under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) and 511 (attempting to commit offences) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 66C (identity theft) and 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) of the Information Technology Act. Investigators will soon be writing to the service provider, seeking the IP address details from which the fake profiles were created, said another police officer.When contacted, Verma declined to comment on the matter.Such cases have been on the rise in the past few weeks, with IPS, IAS, IRS officers from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar and Kerala being the main targets. “We have been receiving similar complaints, including two from senior IPS officers. Fraudsters target them as they are respectable figures in society and victims would believe any ‘story’ linked to their names,” said Balsingh Rajput, superintendent of state cyber police.“In such cases, people should first contact the person from whose account he/she received a message requesting financial help, and confirm if the message is genuine. Internet users should never send money to anyone based on interactions on social media without making a preliminary enquiry. If they identify it as a fraud, they should post a public message on their social media account alerting their friends and relatives about the same,” Rajput said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-fake-social-media-accounts-of-i-t-joint-commissioner-used-to-con-her-friends-out-of-money-mumbai-police-issue-warning-to-internet-users/story-wBbqew3ZfCHGsuruif2bxL.html

16-10-2020||Mumbai||TB patients begin slow return to Mumbai hospital||Footfall of patients at the city’s civic-run Sewri Tuberculosis (TB) Hospital, the country’s largest such facility, is slowly returning to pre-Covid levels, thanks to the easing of curbs imposed since March. In Mumbai, till Wednesday, 18 of the 135 active TB patients co-infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, have died. Every year, around 45,000 people are diagnosed with TB in Mumbai. Due to the restrictions imposed during the national lockdown and fear of getting exposed to the novel coronavirus, TB patients couldn’t visit the hospital for diagnosis. As per data provided by the hospital, before Covid-19, the hospital used to receive more than 1,400 patients in their OPD every month. Since April, however, there was a drastic decline in the number of patients. In February, 1,405 patients visited the hospital’s OPD for consultation. The following month, when the first Covid-19 case was reported in Mumbai, the number dropped to 1,235. In April, it further dipped to 996. With the gradual spread of the virus, the numbers dived to 749, 708, 879 and 688 in May, June, July and August. Last month, with the relaxation in lockdown, the number of patients’ visits rose to 979 for the first time since May. Doctors have cautioned that the next few months will be crucial to gauge the adverse effect of delay in diagnosis and treatment of suspected TB patients owing to the lockdown. “We have started getting more patients with the opening up of public transport. Also, as Covid-19 cases have come under control in the city, the fear of transmission has decreased,” said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent of the hospital. “However, we are yet to start getting patients from far-off areas.” For instance, a 39-year-old Borivli resident was diagnosed with multiple-drug resistant TB in November 2019. She also lost her job due to her illness, following which she sought treatment at Sewri TB Hospital. “Soon, the lockdown was declared and I had to stop going to the hospital as I couldn’t afford to travel in rented vehicles. My relatives pooled in money to help with my follow-ups at a private clinic. Last week, for the first time since April, I visited the hospital in a public bus, as I was feeling breathless,” she said. Admissions at the hospital have also increased by 51% –196 patients in April, which rose to 296 in September. Along with public hospitals, private hospitals have also started to witness a spike in the number of TB patients. “During the initial month of the pandemic, we received less than 2,000 cases. But last month, we recorded 2,785 patients. From July onwards, the number has started to rise,” said Dr Pranita Tipre, deputy health officer, TB, BMC. At Sewri hospital Since the outbreak of Covid-19, 128 TB patients co-infected with the coronavirus have undergone treatment at the hospital. Of these, half were recovered or latent (when the bacteria remain dormant in the body) TB patients. At the hospital, 14 patients have succumbed to the infection. This takes the mortality rate at the hospital to 11%, which is much higher than the city’s death rate (2.2%). According to officials at the hospital, most deaths were a result of delayed diagnosis and treatment. As both Covid-19 and TB affect the lungs, it often leads to misdiagnosis. “Of the 14 deaths, eight were reported during the initial days of the pandemic. All patients who died were either brought or transferred to the hospital when they were extremely critical. This week, one co-infected patient died due to acute pneumonia. He was also referred from a private hospital,” said Dr Anande. Next few months crucial Due to their compromised lung condition, TB patients are most vulnerable to Covid-19 infection. When the outbreak was reported in the city’s slums, health experts feared the spread among TB patients. Seven months on, even though Sars-CoV-2 has infected less than 1% TB patients in Mumbai, doctors said there are chances that TB cases might spike due to irregularities in the treatment of TB patients. “Globally, Covid-19 has had an enormous impact on the number of people seeking and receiving healthcare for TB. India is now dealing with a large-scale syndemic (cluster of epidemics) of TB and Covid-19. Both respiratory infections need attention. Delayed TB diagnosis and treatment might substantially increase TB mortality in the future,” said Madhukar Pai, director, McGill International TB Centre, Canada, in an email interview to HT. When TB patients don’t take their medicines regularly, they can develop multiple-drug resistant TB, where the chances of mortality are higher. Also, if a person gets delayed in diagnosis, it cannot only lead to his death, but also infect others. “We don’t know to what extent the pandemic has delayed the treatment of patients. It will take at least five-seven months for the symptoms of drug resistance to show. Also, we have to check if family members of delayed patients also contract the infection,” said Dr Yasin Dholakia, secretary, Maharashtra State Anti-Tuberculosis Association. In September, the National TB Elimination Programme announced a Rapid Response Plan to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on TB epidemic. “In the immediate term, I hope the Indian government will fully fund and rapidly implement this rapid response plan,” said Pai. TB co-infected patients cured with vitamin and antioxidants At a time, when doctors across the city are treating Covid-19 patients with promising drugs, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, the Sewri TB Hospital cured 104 patients with vitamins and antioxidants. “For years, we have been dealing with TB, which is also an air-borne infection. So, we know the technique of how to treat a patient with lung infections. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been treating patients with vitamin C dosage. Later, we added antioxidants, an effective therapeutic solution for treatment of hyper inflammation that occurs due to Sars-CoV-2 virus,” said Dr Anande. “It also protects patients from cytokine storms (when the body’s immune system attacks its own cells),” he said. Centre directs RT-PCR test on newly diagnosed TB patients In September, the Union health ministry ordered state governments to mandatorily test all newly diagnosed TB patients for Covid-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Health activists said the state is yet to implement the directive. In Maharashtra, almost 20,000 new patients get diagnosed with TB every month. “This (test) would have been able to identify active and latent TB patients who are more susceptible to Covid-19 infection. But even after a month, it is still on paper,” said Dr Abhijit More, a health activist. “Field workers are not even aware of the new rule.” As per the new rule, all suspected Covid-19 patients with symptoms have to undergo chest X-ray. RS Adhikari, acting joint director (TB) in the state, said, “We will be holding meetings with the district TB officers about the circular and take a call on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tb-patients-begin-slow-return-to-city-hospital/story-6aFIFC1i1YvILoWdhNJUxI.html

However, it has been brought to my notice that this particular contractor has subcontracted 100% of the work. My demand is not only to blacklist such contractors but to also penalise them with a heavy fine,” the Shiv Sena leader told HT.The contractor in question was hired by BMC for a ₹234-crore civic contract, which is a part of its ambitious Mumbai Sewage Disposal Project-II (MSDP). While municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal was unavailable for comment despite multiple attempts, P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (MSDP), said, “I have not seen the complaint. We will look into it.”Subcontracting usually leads to compromises in quality of civic works, say some elected representatives. Samajwadi Party (SP) member of legislative Assembly (MLA) Rais Shaikh said, “Big contractors use their qualifications to get expensive civic projects, and then subcontract the work to others. This system of subcontracting is rampant in BMC. Majority of the road repair works are subcontracted, where the original contractor takes some percentage of the total payment and gets the work done by multiple subcontractors. A stricter on-site vigil is the solution to stop this system.”Under MSDP II, the civic body has planned seven water treatment plants at Malad, Worli, Dharavi, Versova, Ghatkopar, Bandra and Bhandup, with a capacity of generating 1,700 million litres per day (MLD) of tertiary water, which will add 50% extra water supply to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/blacklist-firm-for-subcontracting-100-work-for-mumbai-sewage-disposal-project-ii-yashwant-jadhav-to-bmc-chief/story-K4CvQcKZsqRid5OTIF7YsM.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||SIT to probe irregularities in Maharashtra’s Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan scheme: State home minister Anil Deshmukh||A day after the state cabinet announced plans to conduct a probe into alleged irregularities regarding water conservation scheme Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan (JSA), state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said that the probe will be carried out by a special investigation team (SIT). He said that appropriate action will be taken against the guilty after the report.The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday decided to probe the former Devendra Fadnavis government’s flagship project on which ₹9,634 crore was spent in the past five years. “#CAG report has raised many questions on the quality, cost & results of the Jalyukt Shivar scheme launched by Ex-CM @Dev_Fadnavis Ji. Hence we have decided to hand it over to #SIT for the investigation of irregularities in this scheme & then take further actions accordingly,” Deshmukh tweeted.The home minister said that besides strictures by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), there were complaints of largescale corruption in the scheme.According to Mantralaya officials, the SIT will comprise officials from the water resources, water conservation and police departments. “A committee of senior officials from these departments will have to probe technical flaws, variation in the tendering process and criminal offences related to corruption. First information reports (FIR) have been registered in a few districts against the irregularities in the works allotted at the local level. Police officers will look into the criminal aspect of the irregularities,” said an official from the water resources department.Deshmukh told his cabinet colleagues on Wednesday that the home department will depute the finest officers to conduct the probe. The JSA project involved deepening and widening of streams, construction of cement and earthen stop dams, work on nullahs and digging of farm ponds.Girish Mahajan, former water resources minister, said that the scheme was implemented transparently. “More than 6 lakh works were undertaken under JSA and the powers to allot these contracts were given at the district council and district collectorate level. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has been citing the CAG report while alleging corruption in the scheme, but the report has not mentioned any corruption,” he said.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashish Shelar said that JSA was not a scheme but a public movement. “Conducting a probe into it is like investigating farmers, workers and common people directly involved in it. We are not against the probe, but it should not be politically motivated. The MVA government will fall flat on its face after the probe report,” he said.The CAG report tabled in the state legislature on September 8 slammed the Fadnavis government for its failure to implement JSA envisaged to make villages in Maharashtra drought-free. Besides the deficiencies in planning and lack of provision of adequate funds for maintenance of works, JSA failed to achieve water neutrality in drought-prone villages and increase the ground-water level as intended, the report stated. IT added that even after spending ₹9,634 crore, the Abhiyan had little impact in drought-prone districts, which ended up deploying more tankers than in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sit-to-probe-irregularities-in-maharashtra-s-jalyukt-shivar-abhiyan-scheme-state-home-minister-anil-deshmukh/story-AZ3AQIDMGjXEAMZf1ZZg2N.html
16-10-2020||City||At 2,448, Borivli has most number of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai||While the city’s active Covid-19 cases have come down in the last one month, the western suburb of Borivli has stayed on top of the list of active cases since September 13, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data. Borivli, which has 2,448 active cases, is followed by Malad, Kandivli and Andheri. Civic officials said active cases are higher in high-rises or non-slum areas. “At least 80% of the cases are coming from high-rises. In slums, it seems, residents may have developed antibodies due to which we are not witnessing cases anymore.” The BMC’s sero-surveillance conducted in two phases had revealed that the ratio of antibodies in those residing in slums has increased significantly, whereas the ratio of antibodies has increased marginally in non-slum areas. Bhagyashree Kapse, assistant municipal commissioner of R-Central ward, which covers Borivli, said, “We have over 15,000 cases in Borivli and more than 13,000 cases are from non-slums. The reason for high cases is that many citizens who opt for home isolation do not isolate themselves properly in their houses and end up mingling with other members from their house.” Kapse said, “Another reason is unlocking. Of the total cases, more than 80% cases have been reported post unlock. This is because Borivli has a high number of business class population that has now started going out.”Ten administrative wards in the city covering Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Andheri, Mulund, Ghatkopar, Chowpatty, Ghatkopar and Malabar Hill have more than 10,000 cases. Wards covering areas of Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim, Vikhroli, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Malad, Andheri and Borivli have more than 400 deaths. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said the situation in the city has improved in the last one month despite a daily case load of 2,000 to 2,500 cases. Chahal on Monday said, “Exactly a month ago on September 11, BMC had 26,632 active cases, whereas on October 11, the number of active cases was 22,369. The average death rate over one month is 2.1%, resulting in decrease in overall death rate from 4.9% (as of September 11) to 4.14% (as of October 11).” Chahal added, “The number of vacant Covid beds which was 4,165 on September 11 (including 85 ICU beds) has increased to 4,922 on October 11 (including 257 ICU beds).” On Thursday, the city reported 2,119 cases taking the tally to 236,721; 46 deaths took the toll to 9,601 Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “There are chances that in the coming days too we will see more cases from non-slum areas owing to the antibodies, as seen in the sero survey.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-2-448-borivli-has-most-number-of-active-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai/story-8vL4wtFSmgAy5npVHcGNkL.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||47-year-old held with heroin worth ₹2.40 crore in Mumbai||The anti-narcotics cell (ANC) arrested a 47-year-old drug supplier from Dharavi on Wednesday and seized heroin worth ₹2.40 crore from him. The accused, Manzar Din Mohammad Shaikh, was previously arrested in 2018 with 90 gram heroin, and he became more active and started supplying contraband to peddlers across Mumbai after he was released on bail, said ANC officers. “Shaikh was in direct touch with a drug distributor in Rajasthan. A police team soon will visit to arrest him [the distributor],” said an ANC officer.Based on a tip-off, ANC officers laid a trap near Kunchi-Korve Nagar in Dharavi on Wednesday evening and apprehended Shaikh. During search, police found 1.2 kilogram heroin from his possession. Following the seizure, a case was registered against Shaikh under sections of the Narcotic Drugs Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. “Shaikh is a resident of Indira Nagar in Dharavi and was previously arrested by ANC for a similar offence. But as the quantity was less, he got bail within three months and started supplying drugs again,” said police inspector Shashank Shelke of Ghatkopar ANC unit. In a crackdown on drugs peddlers and suppliers since the last couple of days, the city police and crime branch have arrested around two dozens of drug peddlers from the city, said deputy commissioner of police Datta Nalawade, who holds the charge of ANC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/47-year-old-held-with-heroin-worth-2-40-crore-in-mumbai/story-1bXbvcRwBafYGIQaj38IzI.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai college charging illegal fees, allege students||Management studies students of NL Dalmia Institute of management Studies and Research in Mira Road have approached the state Fee Regulatory Authority (FRA) alleging that the college was charging fees over and above the fee approved by the regulatory body. Based on the complaint received from students, FRA, which regulates the fees for all professional courses offered by colleges in Maharashtra, has sought a response from the college. In a meeting held on Tuesday, FRA granted the institute time till Friday to respond, according to the minutes of the meeting recorded on the official website of FRA. Seema Saini, chief executive officer and administrative head of NL Dalmia Institute of Management Studies and Research, said no official communication had been received from FRA. “I have received a telephone call from FRA wherein I informed FRA that we will need time to respond. However, we will wait for official word from FRA before commenting,” Saini said. In their complaint, several first- and second-year students pursuing Masters in Management Studies have alleged that the college was asking students to pay around ₹2.3 lakh over and above the approved fees under the guise of ‘other charges’. FRA had approved an annual fee of ₹1.87 lakh for the academic year 2019-20 and for the academic year 2020-21, the fee is ₹1.9 lakh. Students alleged that the institute, which has around 121 students in each batch, has been charging ₹4.15 lakh as fees. “While the approved fee is collected as ‘tuition fee’, the rest is collected as ‘other charges’. This is illegal,” said a student on the condition of anonymity.Students, especially those from economically weaker sections, said they were having trouble availing study loans. “We are getting loan only on the tuition amount. Effectively, we end up getting very little relief as we have to pay the rest on our own,” said another student.Another student said the college was targeting students who questioned the additional fees. “We have been told indirectly that they will be causing problems in our placements,” said the student. On October 7, FRA had informed colleges that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, it planned to withdraw the 10% hike in tuition fees granted to them every year. However, on Wednesday FRA clarified that this is an appeal to colleges. “This (proposal to withdraw the hike) should be treated as an appeal rather than an order to come forward to mitigate sufferings of stakeholders,” said FRA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-college-charging-illegal-fees-allege-students/story-xVHqeOJTB0Celqd0yxV4xO.html

16-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress holds virtual rally to oppose new farm laws||As part of its ongoing protest against the recently-passed farm laws, Maharashtra Congress organised virtual ‘Save the Farmers Rally’ on Thursday evening. The party said around 50 lakh farmers participated in the rally from 10,000 villages in more than 25 districts where the arrangement of virtual platforms has been made. Calling the new laws ‘anti-farmer’, the Congress has been demanding that they be scrapped.The virtual rally saw eminent party leaders addressing six divisional areas using a virtual platform. Congress’s Maharashtra in-charge HK Patil, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, public works department minister and former chief minister (CM) Ashok Chavan, MP Rajiv Satav participated from Sangamner in Ahmednagar, while former CM Prithviraj Chavan addressed the rally from Kolhapur. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh participated from Aurangabad, women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur from Amravati and energy minister Nitin Raut, dairy development minister Sunil Kedar participated from Nagpur.Patil said the Congress would compel the Narendra Modi government to withdraw the farm laws which, he claimed, would uproot the agriculture sector — the backbone of economy. He alleged that the laws were enacted to benefit a handful of industrialists who helped the Modi government in ‘dealing’ to win over MPs from opposition parties. “Modi has been against the interest of the farmers since he was the chief minister of Gujarat. The farm laws are being implemented despite the fact that they failed in Bihar after their enactment in 2006. It is an attempt of the Modi government to sell the agriculture sector like state-owned entities were sold to the industrialists,” he said.Thorat appealed to the farmers to join hands to oppose the laws and warned them of long-lasting effects if the laws are implemented. He also announced that the protest would continue till the laws were scrapped. Ashok Chavan said, “Our government will not implement the laws which are aimed to benefit a handful of industrialists. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to bring the landlord system back in the country through these laws.”Maharashtra Congress has been protesting against the laws since the past three weeks after they were passed in both the houses of parliament. After an online drive #SpeakUpForFarmers across various social media platforms on September 26, congress leaders met Maharashtra Govenor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on September 28 and demanded that the laws be scrapped. Then, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on October 2, the party held protest rallies in almost all the districts in the state. It has also began a signature campaign aimed at collecting 1 crore signatures from farmers within October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-holds-virtual-rally-to-oppose-new-farm-laws/story-T2pxtd81RpS8S8Q8yX3l6I.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Jet Airways case: Mumbai sessions court rejects ED’s plea for intervention||A sessions court on Thursday rejected the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) application to intervene in the case of cheating and criminal breach of trust registered against Jet Airways. This is the second time the agency’s plea to intervene has been rejected by the courts. On September 19, the magistrate court had denied ED the permission to intervene after the agency opposed a report filed by Mata Ramabai Ambedkar (MRA) Marg police to close the case of cheating against Jet Airways, its promoters Naresh and Anita Goyal. ED approached the sessions court on October 8, challenging the order on the grounds that the agency is probing money laundering allegations against the airlines and Goyals based on the case filed by MRA Marg police. On Thursday, the sessions court upheld the observation that ED had no locus to intervene in the case and only a complainant can intervene. After rejection of the plea, ED sought a stay on the order in order to approach the high court. The court also refused to grant a stay.MRA Marg police was probing a complaint filed by Rajendran Neruparambil, chief financial officer (CFO) of Akbar Travels of India Pvt Ltd (ATIPL), against Jet Airways and the Goyals. Neruparambil had alleged that during 2018-19, Jet Airways owed ATIPL payment of ₹46.05 crore. He further alleged Goyals had engaged ATIPL in business despite being aware of the financial crisis faced by Jet Airways, which shut down operations in April 2019 and has an accumulated debt of nearly ₹8,500 crore. After conducting a probe, MRA Marg police filed a closure report in March, having found no evidence of the complainant being cheated; and sought closure on the ground that this was a civil case. ATIPL has filed a petition against the closure. ED also filed petitions against the closure report, saying the police had left out crucial facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jet-airways-case-mumbai-sessions-court-rejects-ed-s-plea-for-intervention/story-prQYCa8o1rfQyCmvi6KpZN.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Reopening movie theatres in Maharashtra: CM Uddhav Thackeray says release of SOP soon||The state government will soon decide on opening cinema halls after finalising the standard operating procedure (SOP) for them, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray told single-screen theatre and multiplex owners in a meeting on Thursday, even as officials seemed wary of a surge in Covid-19 cases owing to the upcoming festive season and relaxation of curbs.Maharashtra on Thursday reported 10,226 Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 1,564,615, and 337 deaths, pushing the toll to 41,196.According to the draft SOP prepared by the cultural department, multiplexes can be started with 50% occupancy, occupying alternate seats, and with other Covid-19 precautions. The CM acknowledged that the entertainment industry will help move the wheels of the state economy faster and added that the government does not get any joy by keep theatres shut. Meanwhile, Mumbai’s restaurants, bars, eateries and food courts can now remain open till 11.30pm and other business establishments can stay open till 9.30pm, according to an order that was issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) late on Thursday. Also, restaurants, bars, malls, food courts and businesses will be allowed to open at 7am, instead of 9.30am. Nitin Datar, president, Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India, who was present in the meeting held via video-conferencing, told HT the exhibition sector will see huge losses if theatres are not opened during the festival season.“Since all other businesses including malls and Metros, etc, are now opened, we asked the CM to allow theatres also to start with all necessary precautions. He was very concerned about the safety and health of the people, and rightly so. He gave examples that wherever cinemas were reopened in western countries, there was again a lockdown… We explained that Navratri, Dussehra, Diwali and later Christmas are a big season for the exhibition sector. If cinemas do not open, then there will be a huge loss,” Datar said.Thackeray in the meeting pointed out that people sitting in an air-conditioned cinema hall for over two hours can be susceptible to the virus. A statement from CMO said, “There is a study that Covid-19 transmission can increase during winter, so we have to go cautiously. We are gradually opening up various things in Maharashtra and our target is that there should not be a need to reimpose lockdown. It is important to take precautions so that people sitting in a cinema hall for two hours in a closed air-conditioned room do not catch the infection.”Maharashtra’s Thursday caseload of 10,226 Covid-19 cases is line with its average of 12,011 daily cases in the past 15 days,. New infections included 2,119 cases from Mumbai, pushing the city’s case tally to 236,721.The state’s 337 new fatalities reported on Thursday, 153 were from last two days, 46 from last week and remaining 138 from the period before it, according to the state health department. State’s case fatality rate is 3.63%.Though the state has maintained the average of daily infections at 12,011 in last 15 days, the state authorities expect a spike in next couple of weeks in the wake of unlocking measures coinciding with the festivals.“Our caseload as well as positivity rate is decreasing despite the drop in the number of daily tests. The decline in the cases has been witnessed across the state. This means Maharashtra has reached a plateau and the downward trend of cases may begin soon. But, at the same time, there is apprehension of a possible spike in cases in next few weeks. We have opened up more activities, including restaurants, bars, and are operating more trains. Navratri is beginning from Saturday, which could see more number of people coming out of their houses. As a result of this, cases may go up by end of the month,” the officer said.Dr Shashank Joshi, one of the members of the state-appointed task force for the clinical management of Covid-19 patients, said that there could be a spike in next couple of weeks. “Across India and in Maharashtra there is clear-cut decline in cases. But the unlocking coinciding with winter setting in, the unseasonal climatic changes, rise in pollution, could result in spike in cases. The Covid-appropriate behaviour of citizens and not letting down the guard will help us in maintaining the downward trend. Next six weeks are very crucial,” he said.Dr Joshi said that late reporting to the health centres by symptomatic people is leading to high CFR. Meanwhile, Thackeray, during his meeting with theatre owners, also said that attempts to malign and finish off the Hindi film industry in Mumbai or to shift it from the state capital will not be tolerated. Thackeray’s statement on film industry came in the backdrop of the probe into the Sushant Singh Rajput’s case and media coverage that was seen as a deliberate attempt to target Bollywood. Thackeray said that Mumbai was not only the country’s financial capital, but also its cultural capital. “Bollywood enjoys a following across the globe. The film industry generates huge employment, while actors get popular because of the movies. However, in the past few days, attempts have been made to malign the image of the film industry by certain quarters, which is painful. Moves to finish off Bollywood or shift it elsewhere will never be tolerated,” a statement from the CMO quoted Thackeray as saying at a meeting with multiplex and theatre owners.(with inputs from Eeshanpriya MS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reopening-movie-theatres-in-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-says-release-of-sop-soon/story-5HQXaHNzEGaUh65t6Wl9gJ.html
16-10-2020||City||8 more farmers fined for stubble burning in Mohali||The district administration has challaned eight more farmers and imposed a fine to the tune of Rs 20,000 for burning crop residue.Officials of the district administration and Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) on Thursday caught the farmers red-handed while burning stubble in Banur, Bakarpur village in Kharar, Manauli Surat, Sonauli and Khaspur in Dera Bassi, Sohara and Patran in Kharar, Khaspur in Banur. Stubble burning is completely banned in the state. This year, 10 cases of stubble burning have been reported in the district.A senior official of the district administration said that eight farmers were found burning stubble despite the ban and all owned less than two acres of land. “We have issued a challan of Rs 2,500 each. Directions have been issued to the revenue department to make red entries in the land records of six offenders and an FIR has been registered against one farmer under Section 39 of the Air Act, 1981. Under this act, if charges are proved, they can be jailed for six months and fined up to Rs 10,000 or both,” he said.Red entry means the farmer will not be eligible for any government facility or loan from any bank or institution. If stubble is burned on less than 2 acres, a challan of Rs 2,500 will be issued, a challan of Rs 5,000 will be issued for 2 to 5 acres and for above 5 acres, a challan of Rs 15,000 will be issued.The official said that Punjab Remote Sensing Centre’s data showed 45 sites of stubble burning in the district. “But we spotted farm fires at only eight sites,” he added.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “We have formed Rapid Response Teams and appointed village-level nodal officers who would monitor the area under their jurisdiction and report stubble burning if any.” He said that they have been trained to use the ATR mobile app through which they will share on-the-spot action taken. Response time is fixed and it is mandatory for every officer to update action taken in the stipulated period.The area under paddy cultivation in the district is around 25,800 hectares which is expected to result in 1.29 lakh quintals of crop residue. Last year, Mohali was third in the state among the districts which recorded the least stubble burning incidents. In 2019, 82 people were penalised to the tune of Rs 2.55 lakh and seven FIRs were registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-more-farmers-fined-for-stubble-burning-in-mohali/story-fSqk3Eav7DczAqv9nid1DO.html
16-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra governor showed how someone in his post shouldn’t behave: Saamana||Saamana, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, on Thursday launched an attack on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over his letter to the state chief minister and party chief Uddhav Thackeray and alleged that it was an example of how a person occupying the gubernatorial post should not behave.The editorial pointed out that the CM responded to the letter in his signature “Thackeray style”.“Bhagat Singh Koshyari has shown how a person occupying the post of a Governor should not behave. Koshyari may have been a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) pracharak or a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)leader, but now he is the governor of a progressive state such as Maharashtra. He seems to have forgotten the post he occupies for his convenience. The BJP leaders of Maharashtra indulge in a slander campaign against the state government every morning. It is understandable. But why is the governor a part of the campaign?” the editorial alleged.There has been a bitter exchange of letters between Koshyari and Thackeray. The governor had demanded that places of worship be reopened, despite the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and also asked Thackeray if he had suddenly “turned secular”.In a strong rebuttal, the CM questioned the governor whether he did not believe in secularism, a key tenet of the Constitution. Thackeray also slammed Koshyari for his statement that his brand of Hindutva did not need any certificate from the latter.“The Governor’s letter to the CM reeks of foolishness. The CM has hit out against it only once and that was enough... This resonance of the tolling bells (referring to BJP’ Ghantanaad agitation to reopen the places of worship) must have reached Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah’s ears. They must recall the governor to save the prestige of the Raj Bhavan,” it said.The party mouthpiece lauded the CM’s response to the Governor’s letter.“The CM caught the loincloth (dhoti) of the Governor and shook the Raj Bhavan. Using this language will be unconstitutional. But it is true that the CM responded in his signature Thackeray style,” it added.The editorial slammed Koshyari, who is also holding the additional charge of Goa , and asked why he had not written a letter to Goa CM Pramod Sawant demanding reopening of places of worship.It alleged that famous temples in Goa such as Mangeshi, Mahalaxmi, Mahalsa are still shut. “Why has governor Koshyari not asked Goa CM Sawant to reopen the places of worship? Such questions are only asked in Maharashtra because the state doesn’t have a BJP CM,” the editorial further alleged.Meanwhile, Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that Koshyari merely forwarded representations that he got from various quarters on reopening places of worship. He said, “We have seen what Sena’s new ally Congress had done in the past when their governors used to dismiss governments without any considerations. We have seen Romesh Bhandari and Buta Singh dismissed government in Delhi and Bihar. Here the governor has merely written a letter and so much politics is being played over it.”Upadhye also defended the Governor’s “secular” remark and said, “The term secularism was not there since the beginning, it was added to the constitution much later. Besides that, the governor asked a question what people have in mind whether they (Sena) has abandoned Hindutva.” He added that Hindutva is not a religion but a way of life, according to the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-governor-showed-how-someone-in-his-post-shouldn-t-behave-saamana/story-hjQ9cAB2IE4ZfdTzbX42gI.html

The FIR was registered by the Sector-39 police against Samdarsh Kumar alias Joseph who works for Prem Singh Bisht, a property dealer and complainant in a CBI case alleging corruption in Chandigarh police in 2017. Bisht and Joseph had approached the court seeking that the probe be transferred to the CBI. The FIR was registered under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act against Kumar at the Sector 39 police station on June 19.Joseph and Bisht in their petition before the high court had alleged that some Chandigarh police officials had pressurised them to withdraw an application before a trial court seeking summoning of Jaswinder Kaur, who had been nabbed by the CBI in another graft case this year. The duo had alleged that Chandigarh police had implicated Joseph to force him to withdraw Kaur’s summoning application in a 2017 bribery case.The court observed that from the reports of the director general of police it was clear that the matter had been probed after taking into consideration and examination of the material submitted by the duo but the probe panel had found the allegations ‘unfounded’. The highest ranking official of the Chandigarh police had sworn on oath that there was no conspiracy and that the examination of the material relied upon by the petitioners and additional material collected showed that the accused had been lawfully accused of being in possession of narcotic substances, the court observed dismissing the plea. However, the court also directed the police to preserve the enquiry report material based on which the police officials named by Bisht and Kumar had been given a clean chit by the top brass of the police. Joseph’s bail plea was also dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-dismisses-plea-for-cbi-probe-in-alleged-false-drug-case/story-jK1wjX11iM6RHkUTtE0E3N.html

These levels dropped suddenly at 12 noon from 427 to 283 and then further to 152 at 1pm.  However, the PM levels started rising again post sundown. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that from Wednesday night to early Thursday morning, the winds over Delhi were calm, but it picked up around 9am. The impact of this improvement in wind speed was seen on the air quality by noon. “While Delhi received wind speed ranging from 6-8kmph through most of the day, this wind was northwesterly, coming from the states of Punjab and Haryana. This means that the impact of stubble burning activities here was more on Thursday. This caused the air quality to slip into the very poor zone,” Srivastava said.Wind speed picked up again in the evening, bringing down the AQI to 297 at 8pm, according to the data posed on CPCB’s Sameer app. The enforcement agencies in Delhi said on the first day of the implementation of the winter segment of Grap started with patrolling teams monitoring all kinds of polluting activities. Officials said that the focus of Wednesday’s inspection was to control open burning of garbage and other waste and the implementation of the ban on diesel generator sets. Also Read: ‘Partial’ Centre acting as ‘mouthpiece’ for polluting states, says Delhi minister Gopal RaiThe Delhi Pollution Control Commitee (DPCC) has asked all agencies to submit fortnightly action taken reports. Data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the air quality monitoring centre of Union ministry of earth sciences, also showed that the major reason behind Delhi’s foul air on Thursday was crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana. Data showed that on Wednesday, 740 such fire counts were recorded from the neighbouring states. As per the Safar forecast, there will be no significant respite in the pollution levels in the coming days. “The conditions are likely to be similar in the coming three to four days. The only breather is that the wind direction is expected to change from north-westerly to south-easterly and easterly from tomorrow (Friday), which will somewhat reduce the pollutant load because of stubble burning,” Srivastava said. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said stubble is causing huge pollution across north India. “Let’s accept that stubble burning causes huge pollution every year in north India during this time. And let’s all get together to find a solution sincerely. Blame game and politics hasn’t helped anyone. People are suffering. I’m extremely worried that pollution will play havoc coupled with Covid-19.”Environment experts said the only solution to controlling pollution in Delhi which spikes to hazardous levels every winter in the national capital is a “coordinated” effort. “Winter action plan is an emergency plan, this is basically a result of all the work that is done to control pollution levels throughout the year. The way forward to control the pollution levels in Delhi has to be with all the agencies coming together with a common purpose. This winter, the biggest challenge that Delhi is likely to face is to control waste dumping and burning and vehicular pollution. Considering the limitations of public transport modes under the Covid-19 scenario, the government needs to find ways to control private trips,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aqi-reaches-very-poor-on-the-first-day-of-grap-winter-plan-in-delhi/story-aSb32ggEHAFnJusleVtuFK.html

Cash amounting to Rs 5.5 crore was seized during searches. The department raided 38 premises linked to the lawyer in Haryana, Delhi and the national capital region on Wednesday, I-T officials said.In a statement, the Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT) said cash amounting to Rs 5.5 crore was seized during searches carried out against the advocate practising in the field of commercial arbitration and alternate dispute resolution.The Board did not identify the advocate.Ten bank lockers have been put under restraint, it said.“He was suspected to be receiving substantial amounts in cash from his clients to settle their disputes. Incriminating documents of unaccounted cash transactions and investments made by the assessee over several years have been found,” the department said. The CBDT that frames policy for the tax department, alleged that the lawyer in one case “had received Rs 117 crore from a client in cash, whereas he had shown only Rs 21 crore in his records, which was received through cheque”.In another case, he received more than Rs 100 crore in cash from an infrastructure and engineering company for its arbitration proceedings with a public sector company, the CBDT claimed.“The unaccounted cash received has been invested by the assessee in purchase of residential and commercial properties and in taking over of trusts engaged in running of schools. Evidences recovered indicate investment of more than Rs 100 crore in cash in several properties in posh areas in the last two years,” it said.The assessee and his associates have also purchased several schools and properties, for which more than Rs 100 crore was “paid in cash”, it said.He has also taken accommodation entries (hawala funds) worth several crores, it said.The Board said the search teams have also recovered “substantial digital data reflecting unaccounted transactions of the assessee and his associates who are financiers and builders”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/i-t-dept-raids-chandigarh-lawyer-who-allegedly-took-rs-217-cr-cash-from-client/story-ZhV55I1va7FNCmmnJLAjRM.html

He stated that an undertaking can be filed before the said court, which will be free to impose conditions on the persons who wish to return.He informed the court that deputy commissioner Joy Tirkey of Delhi Police’s crime branch will be the nodal officer for the remaining petitioners, who can file representations before him to obtain documents for their return travel.The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, said, “The eight named persons are free to make a formal application before the Revisional Court and give an appropriate undertaking to that Court, including for their return and to remain present in Court, if and when necessary.”The bench asked the remaining foreign nationals to approach the nodal officer, who will decide on their representation within a week. This will be subject to fulfilment of necessary formalities and conditions as imposed by the court concerned, the bench said.The eight nationals belong to Thailand, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyztan, Kazakhstan and Niger. These eight individuals were discharged in a criminal case lodged at Crime Branch police station in South East Delhi district. On August 6, the apex court had directed that all trials against these foreign nationals in the Capital be consolidated at the Saket district courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/senior-delhi-cop-to-help-foreign-attendees-of-tablighi-event-return-home/story-0lIQyD8oBL0c3egZefvJDP.html
16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Miscreants set 5 vehicles ablaze in different parts of Chandigarh||Five vehicles were set on fire by unidentified miscreants in different parts of the city in the wee hours of Thursday.The police received information at around 4 am that a motorcycle and an Activa parked near a school in Sector 56, had caught fire. In his complaint, Ashwani Kumar, a resident of Sector 56 said that on Thursday morning, on hearing noises he stepped out of his house and found that his motorcycle that was parked nearby caught fire and suffered damage. The fire had also damaged an Activa that was parked next to the bike. He said that his neighbours Amit and Arun are behind the incident. A fire tender was called but by the time they could reach, the motorcycle was completely burnt. A similar incident was reported at about 4.20 am from Indira Colony in Manimajra where three vehicles were set on fire by miscreants. Mohd Kasif in his complaint to the police alleged that three persons set three vehicles— Tata Nano, Tata Ace and Tata Safari on fire. Two fire tenders rushed to the spot to douse the fire. While one vehicle was completely burnt, two were partially damaged. The police have started investigating the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/miscreants-set-5-vehicles-ablaze-in-different-parts-of-chandigarh/story-NtUWobPd8mjpxSOQaNOuvO.html
16-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram may escape Epca’s diesel generator ban yet again||In an indication that Haryana’s NCR districts may be exempted from the ban on diesel generator sets, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca) on Thursday sought a “detailed and comprehensive affidavit” from the state government on power supply to societies still reliant on diesel gensets.While the ban has not been rescinded, Epca chairman, Bhure Lal, wrote to the Trilok Gupta, additional chief secretary (power), seeking a detailed road map to resolve the situation.If granted, this would be the fourth consecutive year that Gurugram, Faridabad and other NCR districts have been exempted from the purview of the Graded Response Action Plan’s (Grap) clause against the use of diesel generator (DG) sets throughout winter, from October 15 to March 15. In the letter, a copy of which is with HT, Lal said, “Last year an affidavit was given... confirming that all colonies will be connected to power grids before the onset of winter 2020... it was not done. In this circumstance it will be very difficult for EPCA to grant further extension.” Epca has, however, asked Haryana to submit a comprehensive plan for resolution of the situation, which would “lay down strict schedules for the colonies which are partially or fully dependent on DG.” Epca further stated that the schedules for these colonies must be staggered to ensure compliance of the action plan, during critical winter months. “The affidavits must be signed by the government, representatives of the colonies and builders. Only then will EPCA be in a position to consider any relaxation,” Lal’s letter states.A spokesperson for Epca clarified that the ongoing ban on diesel generators has in no way been lifted or relaxed yet. “Until the state government has submitted its affidavit, the ban must be enforced as ordered,” the official said. Trilok Gupta, additional chief secretary (power), could not be contacted despite multiple attempts on Thursday. Earlier this week, the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) had submitted a status report to the Epca, stating that around 26 projects in Gurugram, which either don’t have regular connections or had a lesser-than-required load, would be majorly affected by the genset ban. Officials said that there are around 60 more projects that would be partially impacted by the ban as they depend on standby power from generators, but the impact would be minimal.KC Agarwal, chief engineer, DHBVN, Gurugram, said that power availability is adequate and field teams have been deployed to correct faults. “We are working to ensure uninterrupted power supply to all licensed colonies. However, in many instances, we are unable to provide permanent connections because the required infrastructure has bot been installed by private developers,” he said. A superintending engineer with the DHBVN in Gururgam, requesting anonymity, explained, “The problem is not with availability, but with infrastructure. If you see the condition of sub-stations and power lines, even in developed colonies, they are not adequate to handle the required load, which is why power outages keep happening.” Niranjan Raje, a Gurugram resident and former member of the Epca, said that a blanket ban on diesel gensets is unfeasible without a major overhaul of the city’s power infrastructure. “While some progress has been made through the Smart Grid scheme, several colonies still don’t have a choice but to use DG sets. Even so, while the power department does the needful, pollution control devices to reduce emissions from DG sets can be used by operators. Or, DG sets in colonies where there is no power supply can also be switched to natural gas instead of diesel. There are options if authorities want to consider them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-may-be-exempt-from-diesel-genset-ban/story-sHH0r2TX5PcK7HTzThcVLK.html
16-10-2020||Delhi||Gopal Rai asks CPCB, Epca to shut down 11 thermal power plants around Delhi||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said he has written to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) to shut down 11 polluting coal-fired thermal power plants operating within 300 kilometres of Delhi within a week -- a day after power minister Satyendar Jain wrote to the Union power minister over the same issue. Addressing a press conference, Rai said the Delhi government has been making all efforts to improve air quality but pollution coming from neighbouring states into Delhi is beyond its control. “Within a radius of 300 metres, on all four sides of Delhi, there are 11 thermal power plants, which are still functioning, and the Central government plans to give them an extension. Out of the 12, only one power plant is technologically equipped to lower pollution levels. The other 11 continue to release harmful gases,” Rai said. Also Read| Delhi Pollution: Gensets banned, Grap rules kick inAccording to Rai, on May 8, CPCB had said that after submitting Rs 18 lakh per month as fine, the states can continue operating the thermal power plants. “But we ask, how can these power plants be allowed to function after surpassing the deadline for two months?” In his letter to CPCB chairperson Shiv Das Meena, Rai wrote, “These (thermal power plants) are acknowledged to be major contributors of PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers), PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers), sulphur dioxides, and nitrogen oxides in various studies, including the IIT Kanpur’s report.” He added, “This failure to install pollution control measures in compliance with the deadlines are evident from the directions issued by the CPCB u/s 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 to certain power plants in the neighbouring states on May 8, demanding an environmental compensation of R18 lakh per month.”  Rai said the option of allowing these thermal units to continue polluting activities after paying a fine does not address the actual issue of pollution from the plants. The environment minister also reached out to the Supreme Court-appointed Epca, urging the body to issue directions under section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act to halt operations in these power plants. “The citizens of Delhi cannot continue to be penalised for the inaction of various agencies,” his letter read. Satyendar Jain had also written to Union power minister RK Singh over the same 11 thermal power plants on Wednesday, saying these units were one of the biggest contributors to Delhi’s pollution . He said despite orders from the Supreme Court, these stations have not been shut yet.Also Read: AQI reaches ‘very poor’ on the first day of Grap winter plan in DelhiListing out the work done by the Delhi government to control pollution in the city, Rai said, “Delhi is the only state where petrol diesel and kerosene-run generators have been ordered to shut down. All hot spots have been ordered to have 24X7 patrolling.”Rai also accused the central government of meting out “partial” treatment towards Delhi. He said the BJP was acting as a “mouthpiece” for other states where polluting activities such as stubble burning were ongoing, and diesel generator sets and polluting thermal power plants were continuing to operate without any checks. During an inspection of construction sites earlier in the day, the minister directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to impose a fine of Rs 20 lakh on the public works department (PWD) for non-compliance of guidelines during the construction site of a drain along the main road in Burari.Rai said while the government was working to keep a check on sources such as construction sites and waste burning, vehicular pollution can be controlled by a mass movement, where every citizen of Delhi can contribute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rai-asks-cpcb-epca-to-shut-down-11-thermal-power-plants-around-delhi/story-uAH0eSjJEJb5jCPZHZ53gP.html
16-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt aims to get 1 million construction workers registered under welfare board||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, chairing his first meeting of the labour department after taking charge of the portfolio, on Thursday said the state government would aim to get one million construction workers in the city registered and verified under the welfare board.“Every single construction worker in Delhi will be registered in the welfare board, and the government will work towards serving the city-builders of Delhi. The minister has exhorted the officials to remove unnecessary bottlenecks for registration and verification of construction workers,” read a press statement issued by Sisodia’s office.Sisodia took over the portfolio from Gopal Rai on Wednesday.Sisodia said, “We aim to get one million construction workers registered and verified in the coming months.”Government records said that currently 55,000 workers are registered under the state-run welfare board, and 66,000 applicants are pending verification. In August, Rai had launched a month-long drive to push enrolment of construction workers in the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board.Construction workers — including plumbers and electricians employed in the construction sector, painters, those specialising in laying tiles, security guards at sites and those working on drainage systems, among others — aged between 18 and 60 years are eligible for registration under the scheme. To avail the programme, they need an official photo identity card, a bank account number, residential proof in Delhi and proof that they have worked in the construction sector for at least 90 days over the 12 months prior to registration, said an official in charge of the registration process.On May 21, the Delhi high court had directed the Board, which comes under the Delhi government’s labour department, to take steps to renew the membership of all workers, so that the associated benefits help them cushion the loss of earnings during the lockdown. The court had observed that over 500,000 construction workers in Delhi, who fell off the safety net under the watch of the city’s welfare board, cannot be deprived of benefits just because they were unable to renew their annual registration formality.Every state has one such welfare board which runs an array of welfare schemes for them, funded by the cess collected from projects under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, 1996. In Delhi, the board started disbursing ₹5,000 per month during the lockdown — imposed to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease and led to mass job loss in the sector — to the accounts of enrolled workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-aims-to-get-1-million-construction-workers-registered-under-welfare-board/story-QhjyKJ6lMoAGmPd1yYma1O.html
16-10-2020||City||700,000 seized liquor bottles, 29,000 kg drugs lying at Delhi police stations||A recent stocktaking operation by Delhi Police of confiscated items lying at locker rooms of police stations across the Capital showed up a staggering consignment of liquor bottles and drugs they had seized in different cases over a period of time. According to a document seen by HT, there are at least 700,000 liquor bottles and around 29,000 kilograms of different varieties of drugs at the lockers of around 168 police stations. The market value of the drugs, going by their selling price in the international markets, could be well over thousands of crores. The drive to take stock of the items was undertaken last month after all police stations were told to return eligible case properties lying for years to its rightful owners after permission from the courts. All case properties -- it could be a crime weapon; an item reported stolen but retrieved by police, or seized stuff such as liquor and drugs -- are kept in the locker rooms (called the malkhana) of police stations. The record of each item -- be a pouch of marijuana or a small bottle of liquor -- is maintained and monitored by security guards round-the-clock. According to a mid-level Delhi police officer, during the exercise, police noticed that every station had a large seizure of alcohol bottles and drugs. “The total number of bottles was counted at 734,887. There were exactly 29068.16 kilogrammes of drugs. From expensive Indian Manufactured Foreign Liquor to local stuff, the liquor bottles were of different types,” the officer said, adding they will check the status of the cases and destroy the bottles in accordance with the law. Police stations under the southwest police district, spreading from Vasant Vihar in the south to Kapashera in the west, had the largest number of bottles at 110,067. The New Delhi police district, which includes high-security areas such as Chanakyapuri, Connaught Place, Tughlaq Road and Mandir Marg, had the least at 6,135. Police are allowed to destroy evidence only after the court’s permission. Liquor bottles have to destroyed in the presence of state excise officials. “Everything is documented. We are accountable for even a small bottle until it is destroyed,” the officer said. The reason for such a large collection of liquor bottles, police said, is because of their focus on curbing alcohol smuggling and preventing drinking in public. Drinking in a public space (barring bars or those with a liquor licence) is an offence. This year, police registered 3,800 cases under the Excise Act and arrested around 9,400 persons. DRUGS The bulk of the drugs were smuggled from abroad and were caught by different units and police stations. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, one kilo of heroin is worth around Rs40 lakh at the point of sale (where the contraband in raw form is produced and processed). The consignment passes through six or seven channels to reach India. Dealers bear 30%-40% illicit value addition over the actual rate at each channel. So, when the contraband reaches India, it costs between Rs2 and Rs3 crore per kilo, depending on its quality, according to a senior crime branch officer, who did not wish to be named. The records show the police stations have over 29,000 kgs of drugs, of which the most common is marijuana and heroin. There are around 15,086 kgs of marijuana and 2,042 kgs of heroin. A bulk of these two items are stored at the special cell police station. Other drugs are cocaine (around 4 kg), hashish (around 1,000 kg). There are also packets of ephedrine, methaqualone and opium among others. “We have informed the courts about the cases in which the drugs could be disposed of. According to the law, it has to be done in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau, whose officers are present when the drugs are burnt in the open. The whole operation is recorded and kept as a record,” said a second police officer. CASE PROPERTY RETURNED While the liquor and drugs are destroyed, many case properties were returned to complainants as part of a drive launched two months ago. A report prepared by the crime branch shows that in the last two months, police returned 472 cell phones, 4356 vehicles, 148 autorickshaws and around 5kgs of gold. These items belonged to 6,478 complainants whose cases were solved. LN Rao, who retired as a deputy commissioner of Delhi Police in 2015 said,” It is good the senior officers are taking stock of items in the malkhana and clearing them. Many a time, they remain for decades. The malkhanas are full of such items. Drugs and liquor bottles are common.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/700-000-seized-liquor-bottles-29-000-kg-drugs-lying-at-delhi-police-stations/story-cL90nuxxYYdBNCr4EJTrfP.html

16-10-2020||City||Mobile service disruption, power outage affect WFH residents in Pune||Pune: Heavy rains disrupted power supply and breakdown of mobile networks in most parts of city on Wednesday, causing major inconvenience to residents especially those working from home due to the Covid pandemic. The 96 mm rainfall on Wednesday led to disruption in mobile phone network of certain operators, including Vodafone Idea Limited, affecting operations across the city. According to a Vodafone Idea Limited spokesperson, flooding in some parts of city after heavy rains affected some of the company’s sites. However, many residents complained that Vodafone Idea network was not restored even till Thursday night.By 9 pm, Vodafone Idea released a statement claiming services have been restored“Heavy rain in Pune resulted in flooding of some areas including one of our key sites in the city. This caused partial disruption in services for some customers, earlier today. Our technical team has worked non-stop, deployed interim solutions and restored Voice & Data services. We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused to our customers,” said Vodafone Idea Limited spokesperson.While power supply was restored in some parts of the city by Thursday morning, those living in areas like Kothrud and NIBM road had to wait till afternoon. Many residents of Kothrud and Karvenagar road areas said that they could not operate their laptops and computers in the absence of battery backup because of power outage. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) public relation officer office has appealed to citizens to stay alert in the wake of heavy downpour and urged them to take care of their electronic equipment.According to the power utility, 350 electricity supply feeders were disrupted due to rains and 95% have been repaired and electricity supply restored in various areas. “I could not login in the morning as there was no power since last night. The battery of my laptop and mobile phone also conked off, affecting my work. Hence, I was left with no option, but to take a day off,’ said Abhay Salunkhe, a resident of Kothrud. Another resident of Kothrud and IT professional Tejas Warudkar said, “The power supply was intermittent till morning. Poor mobile network and disrupted Wi-Fi adversely affected my work.” Sahakarnagar resident Sarika Joshi said that she chose to go to office as there was no power supply at her home and mobile network was down. “I had to go to office for the first time in seven months after lockdown was imposed because of this situation,” said Joshi. Tree felling incidents were reported from Baner, Pashan, Aundh and other parts of the city, causing power outage. The worst affected were Sahakarnagar, Katraj, Dhankavdi and Maharashinagar.

16-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Paediatricians’ group release guidelines on school reopening and remote learning||The Indian Academy of Paediatrics has listed out measures that need to be adopted by schools, governments and parents to ensure learning during and after Covid-19 pandemic.The suggestions that are part of the 25-page guidelines on school reopening, remote learning and curriculum in and after Covid-19 pandemic include revisiting of the syllabus from the previous academic year, training youth from local communities to become facilitators and creating self-learning modules. The association plans to distribute and disseminate the guidelines nationwide to all stakeholders. The task force assigned with this job plans to review these guidelines after a period of six months. One of the key suggestions made in the document is to leave the decision of reopening schools with local administration. “Looking at the diverse socio-cultural conditions and varying Covid-19 epidemiology across India, decisions about the opening of schools should be taken by the local authorities at the district level and not at the national or state level,” states the guidelines. Similarly, the association has recommended the minimum criteria for the reopening of schools. “Case positivity rate should be less than five (that is, less than 5% of the total Covid-19 tests performed in the district per day turn out to be positive) for the preceding two weeks. The number of new cases in the district per lakh population per day should be less than 20 in the past two weeks.” The association has also listed out the measures to be taken now, to ensure that online learning becomes an effective mode of learning for all students. Trimming the syllabus by 50%, revising concepts that have been taught already and encouraging activity-based participatory learning are some of the suggestions made in the guidelines. The Maharashtra government recently announced that schools in the state will physically reopen only post-Diwali break in November. Rajesh Pandya from the Teachers’ Democratic Forum said, “Teachers and students are both exhausted with online learning over the last few months. We hope that the government understands this and works out a plan to reduce the additional stress on students and teachers. Replicating the same academic calendar as it is in physical schools is not the way out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-paediatricians-group-release-guidelines-on-school-reopening-and-remote-learning/story-LrFBtS3GADRLyFfhBi7rJP.html
