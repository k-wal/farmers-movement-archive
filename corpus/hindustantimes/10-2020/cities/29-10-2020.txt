Reporting a record number of new cases for the third day in a row, Delhi’s tally of Covid-19 cases now stands at 375,753, which includes 338,378 recoveries and 6,423 deaths. On Wednesday the city had added 5,673 new cases of the viral infection, after reporting 4,853 new cases a day earlier on Tuesday.On average, Delhi has now reported 4,491 cases every day in the past week, which means the trajectory has now surpassed the previous peak of 4,174, which was reported for the week ending September 17, at the height of the second surge.The positivity rate, which went past 9% on Wednesday for the first time since early September, increased further to 9.55% on Thursday. Delhi had seen the first surge in cases in June — the week ending June 26 — when 3,446 cases were reported in a day at its peak..Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at ICMR said the government now needs to stay focused on keeping up with the testing numbers and spread mass awareness on wearing masks and wearing them the right way. “Delhi’s current situation is a culmination of many things — temperatures have come down making the environment more conducive for the virus, the festive season because of which there is probably the highest interaction between people that the city has ever seen since the advent of the virus in March .And then there is air pollution, because of which many are already suffering from flu-like symptoms. So, people should be advised to stay at home as far as possible,” he said. Earlier this week, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had said in a press briefing that Delhi is inching towards its third peak. On Thursday, state health minister Satyendar Jain too said it “appears that Delhi is heading towards a third wave”, but said there would be clarity on this only by next week.“The trend of Covid cases is on a decline across the country. However, it has remained a matter of worry in three states and Union territories. Delhi is inching towards its third peak, while an unprecedented rise is being witnessed in Kerala and West Bengal,” Dr Paul had said on Tuesday.On Thursday, the government conducted 60,124 tests of which 17,029 were through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), considered the most reliable Covid-19 testing method so far. It was on Sunday when Delhi had for the first time conducted over 17,000 RT-PCR tests.Testing in the city was scaled up from September onward but most diagnoses were conducted using the rapid antigen method, which gives results in 15 minutes, but is more likely to throw up false negatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-cases-touch-a-new-high-of-5-739-in-delhi-again/story-lEqJ9cesApQArVAXOOewYK.html
29-10-2020||Chandigarh||High court seeks details of pending honour killing cases in Haryana||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed director general of police (DGP), Haryana, to apprise the court of number of honour killing cases registered in the state in which investigation or trial is pending. The DGP has also been asked to spell out the steps taken for securing fast track investigation and fast track trial of such cases as well as steps taken for protection of the survivor-wife or the husband and other important witnesses in such cases.The DGP has been asked to file an affidavit on pendency of honour killing cases by November 10.The order was passed by high court bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi in an alleged honour killing case registered in June 2018 in Fatehabad. The bench was hearing bail plea of one of the accused during which it came to light that initially the case of abduction of Sunita Rani and Dharambir was lodged and the latter was subsequently murdered by the persons who had abducted him.Sunita in her statement before the judicial magistrate had named the accused persons twice. Custody of Sunita who would have been aggrieved by the murder continued with her father/other family members and no efforts appear to have been made for her protection despite the fact that she was an important witness against the accused or most of whom were her relatives, the bench observed.As per the record, 15 accused were involved in the case and only 12 have been arrested so far. The court noted that it is also not clear whether the three persons have been declared proclaimed offenders. Also, there is no mention of the role of father, brother (if any), and other family members be in the murder, the bench observed, adding that the chargesheet was initially filed against six accused in September 2018 and supplementary chargesheet against four accused in February 2019 while the third chargesheet against two persons in May 2019. Out of 12 accused chargesheeted by the police, 10 have been granted bail and only one prosecution witness out of 44 have been examined till date, it recorded.The court said cases involving honour killing require fast track investigation by Special Investigation Teams having members with requisite expertise without any undue delay in investigation and unwarranted sympathy with the offenders. The prosecution also needs to take steps to protect life of husband and wife and other important witnesses in completion of the chain of circumstantial evidence and nab the accused. The trial should also be fast tracked in such cases, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-seeks-details-of-pending-honour-killing-cases-in-haryana/story-nOiYzbnMn75UD9ezfec3fL.html

29-10-2020||City||Ludhiana police starts drive to make city beggar-free by Nov 11||Days after two children, forced to beg on streets, were rescued from the clutches of a kidnapper, Ludhiana police has vowed to bring an end to the begging menace in the city by November 11.Appealing to residents to support the drive, police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal has asked them to refrain from giving alms or food to the beggars. A Whatsapp number (9115601159) has also been released, where residents can alert the police about the location of the beggars.The task, however, is bound to be a challenging one as the cash-strapped city residents are known to be generous with their donations, a trait that the beggars have learnt to exploit.“Many beggars travel to Ludhiana during winter months as residents here are in the habit of donating blankets during cold nights. As per one estimate, every beggar collects 20-30 blankets in these two to three months and then sells it,” said the commissioner. Most beggars are active at the traffic light points, Shri Durga Mata Mandir near Jagraon Bridge, Nav Durga Mandir in Sarabha Sarabha Nagar and Krishna Mandir in Model Town extension, as they know residents visiting religious places are often keen to distribute food.Agrawal said the police will be working in close coordination with the civil administration, municipal corporation, health department, child welfare department and social security department for the success of the drive. He said that the widespread begging menace leaves a bad impression of the city.Giving details about the plan, the top cop said, “We have chalked out a special plan to deter the problem. Beggars who are found residing in the city for less than a year will be sent back to their native places. Beggars with disabilities will be shifted to shelter homes. Child beggars will be sent to child shelter homes. Others who are fit will be asked to earn their living by working somewhere.”He further said that the police have intensified verification drives for beggars. He has given instructions to the station house officers concerned to complete the verification of beggars in the next 15 days.The police had initiated a drive in February this year and identified 1,170 beggars at 19 busy locations of the city. In one month, the number of beggars had dropped to 435. But the Covid-induced lockdown had thrown the drive off-track.Reacting to the development, Aman Sandhu of the social wing of FICCI FLO said, “The plan to rehabilitate beggars taken is a welcome step. This will not only provide relief to residents, but to those involved in begging too, as they can now hopefully lead a life of dignity and respect. It will also hopefully bring down the kidnapping cases.”Ludhiana mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said, “All departments are united and working for the welfare of the city and its residents. Begging has become a menace in the city, which leaves a bad impression on visitors. The locals should stop giving food and money to beggars, as it encourages them. We will rope in some NGOs and industrialists to rehabilitate the beggars.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-police-starts-drive-to-make-city-beggar-free-by-nov-11/story-Z72hxJdnv1PLUVe0Rfm36K.html
29-10-2020||Mumbai||Redevelopment of Mumbai’s Dharavi delayed further||In what spells further delay for Dharavi revamp, the Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to scrap the tender process for the project once again, following a decision taken by a committee of secretaries (CoS) headed by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar. In February 2019, the tender to revamp the 601-acre area was bagged by the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based SecLink Technology Corporation (STC), and funded by the UAE royal family. However, problem surfaced in March, when the erstwhile state government led by Devendra Fadnavis acquired a 45-acre railway land for ₹800 crore for the project. In January 2020, a committee of secretaries sought legal advice from the advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni on calling for fresh tenders considering acquisition of the 45-acre railway land for the project as it could bring extra benefit for the preferred bidder. AG in his response told the CoS that fresh tenders needed to be called for, as the costs of the railway land and rehabilitation was added later and not incorporated in the original tender document, which was accepted and the committee of secretaries decided to scrap the tenders on August 27, the officials said.“The state cabinet has decided to accept the decision made by the committee of secretaries to scrap the tenders on August 27. It has also allowed the Dharavi Redevelopment Authority to call fresh tenders for the ₹28,000-crore ambitious project,” said a senior official from the state housing department. The Dharavi revamp project commenced on February 4, 2004, but has been marred with controversies, with one of the key issues being the eligibility for the redeveloped flats, as it was found that a majority of present residents did not qualify for new houses. The constant flip-flops by the government have also driven away many builders. Meanwhile, the state has also issued fresh guidelines related to redevelopment of old and dilapidated cessed buildings of Mumbai city. It has asked the state housing department to issue fresh guidelines over registration and eligibility of developers for cessed buildings. Considering the interest of tenants, the state has made it mandatory for the owner or developer to open an escrow account and pay one year’s rent in advance to the tenants till the project is completed. It has directed to constitute a committee to monitor redevelopment of the building. It will comprise an architect to be appointed by taking no-objection certificate from tenants. It has also made it mandatory for developers to complete the redevelopment project within three to five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/redevelopment-of-mumbai-s-dharavi-delayed-further/story-5fKoAaUnlJQ9YM4BNEP1PN.html
29-10-2020||Mumbai||Building collapses in Kopar near Mumbai, residents escape unhurt||Eighteen families living in 42-year-old ground-plus-two storey Maina Vittu Niwas building in Kopar, Dombivli, around 50km from Mumbai, had a narrow escape as they managed to escape minutes before a portion of the structure collapsed around 4am on Thursday. The building had 15 flats, with 75 residents. The residents alerted each other and vacated the building as soon as they saw cracks. Sushmita Nagaral, 26, who lived in the building with her parents and younger sister, said, “Every family was asleep when the building started collapsing. Initially, it developed cracks and there was a loud thud due to which residents woke up and rushed out. As soon as we left the building, a major portion of the building collapsed. Children and senior citizens lived in that portion.” One fire tender of the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) reached the spot around 4.30am and helped the residents remove their belongings from the remaining portion of the building. “The residents had already moved out. Our team helped them find their belongings,” said Jeevan Borade, fire officer. “As the remaining portion developed cracks, we could not pick up much of the belongings. The residents have now gone to their relatives’ place,” said Nagaral. KDMC officials claimed the owner and residents were served a notice in June. “We have started demolishing the remaining portion now. The building was unsafe and we had asked them to vacate it,” said Bharat Pawar, ward officer, KDMC. “We will take action against structures which are extremely dangerous with a strict approach now.” There are 187 extremely dangerous buildings and 284 dangerous buildings in KDMC jurisdiction. The extremely dangerous buildings are more than 30 years old. On September 21, 38 people died and 25 were injured in Jilani building collapse in Bhiwandi’s Damankar naka. After the tragedy, KDMC demolished 13 dangerous structures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/building-collapses-in-kopar-near-mumbai-residents-escape-unhurt/story-1zp4Ndbvlp0G7a8FnHnSoK.html

29-10-2020||Gurugram||No arrest yet in alleged rape at private hospital||A day after a rape case was registered against a staff member of Fortis Hospital in Gurugram’s Sector 44 for allegedly raping a 21-year-old woman undergoing tuberculosis treatment, the police are yet to make any arrests. The police, on Thursday, said that two of the hospital staff members are under the scanner. A case was registered on the basis of a complaint by the woman’s father, who alleged that his daughter was raped while she was in a semi-conscious state on ventilator in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that they have collected CCTV footage of two floors, of which footage of one floor was monitored by the police team on Thursday. However, they could not find anything substantial that could support the complaint. “We have questioned more than 20 staff members who were present in the ward during the period when the alleged rape happened and have taken the location details of the suspect to check whether he spent time alone in the ICU. We hope to solve the case at the earliest,” he said. The police said the family is suspecting that the incident took place between October 21 (when she was admitted) and October 27 (when she fully regained consciousness). The patient had informed her father about the alleged incident through a handwritten note on Tuesday. The police said she is still in treatment at the hospital. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), said the woman was admitted to the ICU on the ground floor for a day and was later shifted to the ICU on the first floor. “We are yet to monitor footage of the first floor and that will give us a clear idea about the movement of the suspect. The woman had told her father that she had heard the name, Vikas, following which she alleged rape charges against him, but we are yet to verify the facts to arrest the suspect. He is under police scanner,” she said. The police said the patient gained consciousness on Tuesday and informed her father about the incident through a handwritten note. The family then approached the police and a case was registered on Tuesday. A board of doctors from the Civil Hospital conducted a medical investigation on Wednesday. Kundu said the woman is still on ventilator and is not fit to give a statement. “She was recovering but has developed fever, due to which she has not been removed from the ventilator on Thursday. A police team has been deployed in the room and protection has been provided to her. The entire area is under the scanner,” she said. The management of the hospital said in a statement: “Fortis has been fully cooperating with the investigating authorities. The entire CCTV footage and all other relevant information were shared with the police. We understand that police is questioning two persons, who are the outsourced non-medical staff. As per established protocol, they were hired after requisite verification. We have a zero tolerance policy against such situations and are committed to ensure that justice prevails(sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-arrest-yet-in-alleged-rape-at-private-hospital/story-R4TeX3tZtMRCtP7toU2EkJ.html

29-10-2020||Mumbai||Why should we not frame guidelines on media coverage, Bombay HC asks Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday questioned the Central government as to why it should not frame guidelines on media coverage of sensitive issues and ongoing investigations after the counsel for former police officers drew the attention of the court to the fact that the Central government had not taken suo motu action under the Cable TV Regulation Act against the media trial in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case which was going on for over two months. The court has asked the Central government several questions and asked it to respond within a week. The division bench of chief justice (CJ) Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing several public interest litigations (PILs) against the media trial being carried out by various media channels in the SSR death case, was informed by senior counsel Aspi Chinoy who appeared for eight former senior police officers that there had been a blatant violation of rights of various persons by the media while reporting on the case. Chinoy said the channels, while reporting on the case, had resorted to pre-judging, as a result of which it was affecting the administration of justice, which in turn violates the right to fair trial and presumption of innocence guaranteed under article 21 of the Constitution. He submitted that it was apparent that the media had over-stepped the statutory framework of the act by transmitting material which amounted to contempt of court, and further added that though there was an obligation on the state to stop such transmissions, it had failed to take action. He added that even the Centre and self-regulating authorities such as the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) had failed to take suo motu action against the media trial. He added that the electronic media monitoring committee had also failed in this regard. In light of this, Chinoy said the robust system, as claimed by the said authorities, was of no use and hence the court should frame guidelines and submitted judgements of the Supreme Court which showed that when there is an absence of proper laws on a particular subject, the court can issue guidelines. After hearing the submissions, the CJ sought clarifications from the Centre and posed some questions. The court held that while collection of evidence by the investigation agency was aimed at opining whether an accused needs to be arrested, excessive reporting can put the accused on guard. The accused may also resort to destruction of evidence or fleeing. CJ Datta then said that excessive media reporting could also tarnish the image of a person who is actually innocent, and if the witnesses are exposed by the media, he could be threatened or bought over. The CJ then sought to know that if judges should not be influenced by what media says what about the police officers? Would he not be influenced or lose track (of investigation) altogether. The bench further sought to know whether the media maligning police officers, who did not investigate the way suggested by the media, was right and whether this was welcome in a society governed by law? The court also sought to know what was meant by investigative journalism and which law said that whatever evidence was collected by investigation agencies should be kept before the public. It also sought to know is there was any obligation on part of the investigating officer to disclose evidence. “Media says it is aiding the investigation. Most welcome. But go to the police under sections 37/38 of the Criminal Procedure Code and give information to them,” the court said. The CJ further added, “While we would like the media to not cross boundaries, even we should stick within boundaries as the real issue is when a police report is yet to be filed whether media coverage would tend to interfere with the administration of justice.” The court has directed additional solicitor general Anil Singh to respond to the queries within a week and posted further hearing for Friday, November 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-should-we-not-frame-guidelines-on-media-coverage-bombay-hc-asks-centre/story-2LRPYy8FFE7xXUNAnCt7XO.html

29-10-2020||Mumbai||Submit report on videos posted by Kangana Ranaut, her sister: Court to Mumbai Police||The metropolitan magistrate’s court, Andheri on Thursday asked the Mumbai Police to submit a report on the allegations of defamation made by a city-based lawyer against actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel over a video posted on social media allegedly calling members of the minority community ‘terrorists’. Advocate Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh had filed a private complaint in July with the metropolitan magistrate’s court against the two sisters. The court, in its order, noted that, “On April 15 around 4.37pm, accused no. 1 Rangoli Chandel posted a defamatory and objectionable statement against Jamati on her Twitter account. Thereafter her Twitter account is suspended by Twitter. Accused Kangana Ranaut has supported the statement. On April 18, accused no. 2 Ranaut posted a short video on various social media platforms and called the sect of Muslims (Jamati) terrorists.” “The allegations are based on the comments of the accused on social media platforms. Evidence against the accused appears to be of electronic in nature. Therefore, inquiry at the hands of police is necessary for proceeding against proposed accused,” reads the order, directing the police to inquire and submit a report by November 5. Deshmukh had last week approached the Andheri court again with a second complaint against Ranaut for allegedly “causing disharmony among two religious groups through her tweets”. He has urged the court to direct the police to book the actor under charges of sedition for her various posts on Twitter. The lawyer said that Ranaut’s recent tweet referred to Mumbai as “Pakistan occupied Kashmir” and described the state home minister as a member of the “Taliban”, which, Deshmukh claimed, defamed the country. “The actor has no respect for varied communities of India, law of the land, authorised government bodies,” read the recent complaint filed by Deshmukh. Earlier, acting on the complaint of casting director Munawarali aka Sahil Sayyed, the Bandra metropolitan magistrate had on October 16 directed Bandra police to initiate criminal action against Ranaut and Chandel. Sayyed had, in his complaint, alleged that Ranaut’s actions “created a bad image of Bollywood in the minds of people and even created a communal divide and rift between people of two communities”. He added that Ranaut has been “maliciously bringing religion in all her tweets”. The casting director further alleged that Chandel, who also works as manager of the actor, has tweeted highly objectionable messages, intended to create a communal rift. The case against the two sisters has already been registered with Bandra police on the basis of the order of the magistrate’s court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/submit-report-on-videos-posted-by-kangana-ranaut-her-sister-court-to-mumbai-police/story-suHoIwngGpFXWiNPby3oUM.html
29-10-2020||Mumbai||Maratha quota chaos: Maharashtra seeks legal opinion on FYJC admissions||In a fix over the stalled first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions after the stay on the Maratha reservation, the Maharashtra government has sought legal opinion and is expected to begin the process in the next couple of days. The process of college admissions has been stalled after the Supreme Court on September 9 stayed the reservation given to Marathas in education and jobs.In a discussion over the halted college admissions during a state cabinet meeting on Thursday, almost all the ministers expressed the need to resume the process immediately. Public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, proposed to complete the first round of admissions by allowing the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota as it was completed before the SC stay. He said since the Apex court has not clarified on the first round of admission which was completed before the order, the government can go ahead with it. He also said that if the court disapproves, the students can later be accommodated in the open quota.The law and judiciary department, however, objected to the proposal and said it may go against the court ruling. The department has suggested opting for another alternative to safeguard the interest of Maratha students. “The state government may ask the students from the Maratha community to take admission under open category with the state paying 50% of the course fee, which would have been waived off in case of the reservation. The community may also be assured about an increase in the number of seats if their students failed to secure admissions under the open category. The quota is useful only for junior college admissions and medical courses as seats to other streams like engineering remain unfilled anyways. In junior colleges, the state can increase seats by 12% to 15 % to accommodate Maratha students while MBBS students from the community can be reimbursed for their fees so that they get the quota benefit. The previous government has done so,” said a minister requesting anonymity.Marathas were given reservations of 12% and 13% in employment and education respectively under the SEBC Act, 2018. A three-judge Supreme Court bench, on September 9, transferred the case to a constitution bench, putting interim stay on the reservation. On Tuesday, the three-judge bench adjourned the hearing for four weeks when the issue of vacation of the stay was presented before it. This has further delayed the admission process in colleges. There is pressure from the parents across categories to begin the admissions process, and from the Marathas to safeguards their quota in the admissions.Skilled development minister Nawab Malik, in the meeting, even offered to keep 25% seats vacant in ITI (Industrial Training Institute) admissions until the court decides on the stay. In the cabinet meeting, he reportedly said that admissions to 85,000 seats in ITIs were getting delayed.Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said, “The issue was discussed in the cabinet at length and everyone was of the opinion that the process should resume at the earliest. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will speak to the advocate general for legal opinion and to find a way out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-chaos-maharashtra-seeks-legal-opinion-on-fyjc-admissions/story-mzxra9IVq0b6WBXUGE4LGN.html
29-10-2020||City||Posing as guests, 2 decamp with bag of valuables from wedding function||Posing as guests, two burglars entered a marriage hall at Hyatt Regency hotel on Ferozepur road on Wednesday and fled with a bag containing jewellery and cash worth Rs 14 lakh.The two were captured on closed-circuit television cameras installed inside the hotel. Complainants, Lovely Goyal and Manu Gupta, who are the groom’s mothers, said that their mother was holding a bag containing cash and jewellery. Minutes after the ceremonies came to an end, she realised that the bag was missing. But by then, the accused had already left the hotel. Manu Gupta alleged that the family kept asking the hotel authorities to provide them access to the CCTV footage so that they could hunt down the culprits in time but the latter did not cooperate. “The police are investigating from many angles, but they should also look at the involvement of hotel insiders,” the family said.One of the culprits, who was wearing a black trouser and white shirt, hid his face when he was approaching the CCTV camera, which suggested that he was aware of the camera locations. Sarabha Nagar station house officer, sub-inspector Madhu Bala, said that the negligence on the part of the family is evident. “In the CCTV clips, both men can be seen roaming freely and observing the movement of family members for at least half an hour. Still, no one seemed to notice them,” said the SHO, adding that the family had kept the bag containing cash and jewelry on the sofa, due to which the accused could lay their hands on it easily.

29-10-2020||Mumbai||New medical college in Maharashtra’s Nandurbar to make way for additional 100 MBBS seats||Even as admissions for medical and dental college seats are yet to begin in the state, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has approved a new government medical college (GMC) in Maharashtra. With an intake capacity of 100 Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) seats, the Government Medical College in Nandurbar will begin admitting students from the 2020-21 academic year. “The permission came through this month. The total MBBS seats in the state now stand at 4,280 for the 2020-21 academic year. There has been no addition to dental (BDS) seats as yet and they stand at 2,640,” said Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). Earlier this year, HT had reported how growing demand for MBBS seats prompted the creation of new GMCs. Earlier this year, the state government had proposed to convert 11 district hospitals into GMCs, of which Nandurbar is the first to get permission to start admissions this year. Other GMCs have been proposed in Satara, Parbhani, Buldhana, Sindhudurg, Nashik, Amravati, Osmanabad, Palghar, Alibag and Mumbai. “We’ve chosen district hospitals that are already in good shape and can ease into teaching with least possible trouble,” said a senior official from the state education department. Admissions to MBBS and BDS seats in the state are currently on hold based on directions of the Bombay high court. The decision on a petition filed by a student against the state’s decision to abolish the 70:30 regional quota rule is still pending, therefore, admissions in the state will not begin before November 10. However, the admissions process for seats under the all India quota (AIQ) is currently underway. Earlier this year, NMC had also approved Symbiosis Medical College for Women in Pune, the state’s first undergraduate medical college exclusively for women. This Institute will have an intake capacity of 150 MBBS seats. Similarly, Sindhudurg Shikshan Prasarak Mandal (SSPM) Medical College & Lifetime Hospital in Padve, Sindhudurg, has been approved 150 MBBs seats as well for the 2020-21 academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/new-medical-college-in-maharashtra-s-nandurbar-to-make-way-for-additional-100-mbbs-seats/story-KZTXIELCYnfInrTkDxSplL.html

29-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders inquiry into MSRDC chief engineer’s meddling in multi-crore road work tender||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Wednesday ordered an inquiry into the conduct of AB Gaikwad, chief engineer of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), for meddling in awarding a multi-crore road work tender of Yawatmal district. The division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote has directed that the enquiry should be conducted by an officer, not below the rank of secretary in national highways division of the ministry of transport, and submit a report to the court in a month.Irked to note that Gaikwad’s interference had resulted in disqualifying an otherwise eligible lowest bidder - RK Chavan Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., and awarding the work to an ineligible bidder, M/s. GIPL-BCCPL (JV), HC cancelled the entire tender process for improvement of State Highway 317, from Chargaon in Yawatmal district to Chandrapur district border with the value of the tender fixed at ₹47.56 crore.The notice inviting tender was published on June 29, 2019. In all three bids were received in response to the notice. On July 20, 2019, the tender evaluation committee declared that one of the bidders was technically disqualified, leaving only RK Chavan and the JV in the fray.On August 1, 2019, the price bids were opened and after it became clear that RK Chavan was the lowest bidder, one Sumit Bajoria, a representative of GIPL-BCCPL (JV) created a scene and took away tender evaluation sheet and attendance register, because of which entire tender process was stalled. Another JV partner returned the documents to MSRDC the next day after repeated requests by the officials concerned.The judges were annoyed to note that instead of initiating criminal action against Bajoria, the officials extended undue favours to the JV, with Gaikwad himself taking a major step of cancelling an experience certificate issued to RK Chavan by the executive engineer of MSRDC in respect of a road work completed by the contractor. On the basis of Gaikwad’s letter, RK Chavan was then held ineligible, paving the way for the erring JV to grab the contract.RK Chavan them moved HC challenging the high-handed action of MSRDC officials.HC expresses utter displeasure over the entire episode. “The entire situation leading to the present petition is clearly indicative of the absolutely callous and casual attitude ofthe respondents and specifically the TEC (five-member tender evaluation committee), constituted for the subject tender,” said the bench.Apart from finding that the TEC, had not at all applied its mind to the qualifying criteria, HC also found that there was no record maintained even worth the name, which could throw some light on the proceedings. “The entire conspectus of facts smacks not only of malafide but also of favouritism, indulgence, interference, which compels us to hold that entire tender process is vitiated,” said the bench while scrapping the tender process.The judges were also annoyed with the manner in which the record of the tender was maintained.“A perusal of the record reveals a shocking situation,” said HC. “Entire original record is a collection of loose papers comprising of various letters, evaluation sheets, communications etc. which isneither arrayed date-wise nor is paginated,” said the bench. “The record is merely a hotchpotch of papers with no coherence and logical sequencing at all, either date-wise or for that matter in any manner whatsoever. Nothing can be ascertained from the original record.”The court noted that the entire record did not disclose as to when the TEC met, how the evaluation was done, what was considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-inquiry-into-msrdc-chief-engineer-s-meddling-in-multi-crore-road-work-tender/story-QQrmwaR6MB13AoEbOyqiJO.html
29-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC engineers seek cancellation of road quality tests||: Amid hue and cry being raised by residents over construction of inferior quality roads in the city, sub-divisional officers (SDO) and junior engineers (JE) of the municipal corporation’s bridges and roads (B&R) department approached cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu on Thursday seeking cancellation of orders for inspection of road projects completed in the past. Under the banner of Municipal Corporation Engineers Association, Ludhiana, the officials met Ashu and Sandhu at the MC’s Zone D office and demanded that the MC should not conduct inspection of the road works which have been completed a few years back as the roads lose strength after a few years and the sample will automatically fail the test. Ashu however declined the demand of the staffers and asked the mayor and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal to look into the matter. One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said that the staffers had met the minister and mayor to save their skin as there are a number of anomalies in the road construction projects taken up in the past. Recently, an RTI activist had filed a complaint with authorities seeking inquiry into the construction of 13 roads at different parts of the city. Following this, additional commissioner Rishipal Singh had sought files regarding the projects from the officials concerned. But, the files have not been submitted by officials despite three reminders. Ashu said, “The inspection and sampling of roads will not stop as we will not compromise with the quality of work. The MC is paying the contractors, then why are they not constructing the roads as per the norms. The MC officials should improve their efficiency, otherwise action will also be taken against them as it is their responsibility to monitor the work. MC commissioner and mayor will look into the genuine demands of the engineers.”Recently, seven out of eight road samples of RMC roads, collected from Balbir enclave in the Haibowal area failed the quality test. Earlier, seven samples collected from Amantran Colony, Guru Vihar, Chander Nagar, Bal Singh Nagar Road, Ashok Nagar, Daba Road and a road near GNE College (towards Dugri) had failed the test. Also, the samples collected from a stretch near RK Road, Circular Road near Daresi Ground and Baba Mukand Singh Nagar had also failed the test. Inquiry marked over MB books:After a complaint was submitted by an RTI activist regarding officials who have failed to submit over 600 measurement books (MB) in the MC records, municipal commissioner Sabharwal has marked an inquiry into the matter. The MC officials have to mention the details of construction projects in the MB books on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-engineers-seek-cancellation-of-road-inspections/story-LCvUaTYkn7YHDpUtvlh75H.html

The court has asked SRA and the developer wanting to evict the home occupiers to thereafter approach the court on December 21 for further orders. Meanwhile, in view of prevailing Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra, the bench continued all interim orders passed by various courts across the state which include orders for eviction, dispossession and demolition already passed by the courts and said that the same would remain in abeyance till December 22. The full bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justices A A Sayyed, S S Shinde and K K Tated while hearing the suo moto petition for extending interim stays on all eviction, demolition and dispossession order due to the pandemic was informed by Yash Developers through an interim application that it was seeking the court’s indulgence by relaxing its interim order. The developer through their advocate informed the court that it was involved in the redevelopment project at Borivali which had around 585 slum dwellers. While almost all the occupiers had vacated their homes, 33 refused to do so. The developer informed the bench that they had approached the SRA which had conducted a hearing of all 33 occupants and was about to pass orders. However, due to the interim stay order passed by the HC it refrained from passing orders of eviction and demolition against the occupants. The advocate submitted that he was seeking a limited relief of allowing SRA to pass the order as he was wanted to go ahead with the project. The advocate submitted that the developer had already paid a sum of Rs 11 crore towards rent to the occupants who had vacated their homes and if the 33 occupants were not to vacate their hoes he would suffer financial losses. Advocate Jagdish Reddy for SRA submitted that the authority had completed the hearing and was not passing orders due to the interim stay by HC. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed Reddy to ask the authority to pass orders but restrained the developer from implementing it. The court further said that in light of the prevailing pandemic situation the occupants should not be dispossessed as it was continuing the interim protection for across the state till December 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sra-project-in-mumbai-bombay-hc-grants-interim-stay-on-eviction-and-demolition-to-continue-till-december-22/story-0wAnpwDf8F2IbY7amqkBvO.html

29-10-2020||City||Testing labourers for Covid major challenge for Panchkula health dept||Panchkula: Tracking and convincing labourers, who have returned in thousands to Panchkula district this October, to give samples for Covid-19 testing is proving to be a major headache for the health department, which is “hardly getting any support from other departments”.On October 27, the Covid sampling team spent over three hours in a brick kiln at Charnia village in Panchkula but could convince only 56 out of nearly 400 labourers working there to get tested. This, despite the fact that Panchkula’s Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajiv Narwal himself visited hut to hut requesting people to give their swab samples.Some went into hiding, some got rude, others agreed but did not come and all had but one reply: “our tests have been done in our hometown of Uttar Pradesh”. One labourer even asked if he would be paid to give the sample.Naveen Sharma, assistant labour commissioner, Panchkula, said: “During the pandemic, around 24,000 labourers were provided transportation back to their hometowns. Now, 32,000 have returned, most of them working in brick kilns, poultry farms, construction and industry.”Dr Narwal said: “These are high-risk populations, so we have to track them as soon as possible. We have finally witnessed a decline in Covid-19 cases, and now if we miss this population, it may lead to a surge.”Since October 1, samples of 2,241 labourers working in the industrial sector have been taken and 54 have been found positive.From Tuesday onwards, three brick kilns are being covered daily. “There are 53 brick kilns in Panchkula district, out of which 25 are in the area of Raipur Rani, Kot, Barwala and 28 in the belt of Kalka, Pinjore and Nanakpur,” said Dr Narwal.“There must be around 100-150 labourers per kiln, and each has a family of four or five. So expect at least 400 persons per brick kiln,” he added.Shri Radhe Krishan brick kiln in Chharnia village was the first stop. “I am standing here for the last half an hour, but nobody has come,” said Dr Bharat Bhan, who was sweating in his PPE kit. After a while, ASHA worker Tej Kaur brought two women, one of them was nine months pregnant. “We have got our tests done, so we don’t want another test,” said Farzana, who later gave samples reluctantly.Kaur said that people had a fear that they will be picked up from their houses if they tested positive.At last, Dr Narwal went along with the ASHA worker and the munshi of the kiln to convince people sitting inside their tiny brick homes. Still, only a few of them agreed to give samples. Luckily, no one tested positive.When asked if it was always challenging to convince labourers, Dr Narwal said: “They are easier to convince than the educated class. A team once went to a society of IAS officers and no one came down for sampling. At last, we had to approach the DC who gave directions to lodge FIRs against those who don’t cooperate.”Dr Jasjeet Kaur, Panchkula civil surgeon, said: “Taking samples has become the most difficult task these days, as people do not cooperate at all.”There are 22 centres across the district where testing is done, but hardly 10-12 persons or at times none visit these centres, said Dr Narwal.In the absence of voluntary testing, health teams have strengthened active testing and five teams of three members each visit spots and take samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/testing-labourers-for-covid-major-challenge-for-panchkula-health-dept/story-QeGcKOgy9WFigHR7ie0RBO.html
29-10-2020||Gurugram||Haryana slashes costs of Covid-19 tests||The Haryana health department has further reduced the cost of Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests from ₹1,200 to ₹900, confirmed the senior state official on Thursday. The testing cost of rapid antigen test has also been brought down from ₹650 to ₹500. With this new development, costs of Covid-19 tests have been slashed twice. In the first week of October, the cost was brought down to ₹1,200 from ₹1,600. Private labs at that time had said that ₹1,200 fails to cover the total cost of the test and cuts their margin considerably. On Thursday, in an order issued by the state health department, private labs were directed not to charge amount higher than the new defined cost. This time, however, private labs said that with the reduced cost, the testing volume has to be increased to cover up the incurring costs. According to them and district health officials, as Covid-19 cases continue to show an upward trajectory with at least 398 infection confirmed on Thursday, testing can be expected to increase due to affordability. When asked about the impact of the reduced charges on testing, Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, state health department, said that decision has been taken only after consultation with the private labs. “The rates of the RT-PCR kits are declining. Our officials are keeping watch on the cost and immediately taking action when appropriate. Even the cost of consumables is included in the testing slab,” said Arora. The costs of other tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the body, such as antibody test (₹250), TrueNat (₹2,000) and CBNAAT (₹2,400) continue to remain the same.On Friday, at least 2,895 RT-PCR and 282 antigen tests were conducted. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “It is likely that testing might increase due to affordability. But there are multiple aspects to testing with the changing situation. Due to festival season people won’t turn up in large numbers. We will have to wait to observe the testing trend.” Santosh Kumar, microbiologist, MolQ laboratory, said, that it would be a challenge to conduct tests at the new price. “The market will be competitive now, therefore the testing volume will have to be increased to cover up the cost.” SPIKE IN INFECTIONOn Thursday, the number of active cases reached an all-time high of 3,303, while the total count reached 29,102. The Covid-19 toll stood at 207 with one new death. Currently, cases are increasing at more than 12% weekly positivity rate in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-slashes-costs-of-covid-19-tests/story-RGoLMcRocbrcHi52XTzjYM.html
29-10-2020||Gurugram||Classes for senior students in government schools to be regularised from November 2||The state education department on Wednesday issued an official notification along with guidelines that need to be followed by schools for conducting regular physical classroom sessions for students of classes 9 to 12. While schools had initiated regular sessions from October 15, no official notification had been issued. As a result, schools were continuing with the schedules that they had individually adopted for guidance sessions. The guidelines shared by the directorate of secondary education on Wednesday will come into effect from November 2. As per the guidelines, online/distance learning will continue to be the preferred mode of teaching and shall be encouraged. Students who wish to attend online classes rather than physically attend school will be permitted to do so. Further, students will be able to attend schools only with parental consent. District education officer Indu Boken said that the second phase of school reopening will start from November 2 in a graded manner in line with the circular issued by ministry of home affairs (MHA) on September 30. “The first phase of reopening saw schools resuming classes partially for academic guidance sessions. The second phase of reopening will start from November 2. Schools will hold classes for three hours. Students visiting the school would be required to carry consent letters from parents. Attendance, however, will not be enforced,” said Boken. She said that directions had been issued to all the school heads regarding the various preventive measures and protocols that need to be adopted. Apart from the generic preventive measures, such as physical distancing and masking, schools have been asked to display posters and notices in various areas to spread awareness on safety protocols. Further, schools have been asked to stagger entry and exit, and also issue separate weekly ‘in-school’ and ‘at-home’ learning schedules. Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that so far, academic guidance sessions were taking place in small shifts but classes would be regularised from November 2. “We have been holding academic guidance sessions in two shifts in small batches. From November 2, a complete three-hour class will take place. We are expecting the student strength to go up,” said Raghav. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that with regular classes expected to take place from November 2, it will become easier to understand and addresses students’ queries and provide feedback. “While we have been holding online quizzes, it becomes difficult to conduct comprehensive tests remotely. In the absence of a testing mechanism and face-to-face communication, teachers are not able to fully understand if the lessons are being understood by students via online classes. Once classes become regular, teachers will be able to provide detailed feedback to individual students,” said Sharma. Most private schools plan to continue with online classes. Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14, said that the school had no plans of calling students. “Online classes are continuing in our school. We recently conducted a survey seeking feedback of parents of students in classes 11 and 12. Most of them were not in favour of in-person classes,” said Erry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/classes-for-senior-students-in-government-schools-to-be-regularised-from-november-2/story-lwKGHr2AKmNrZ3qIzbwU1K.html
29-10-2020||Gurugram||Green crackers available on outskirts, to cost more||Residents will have to shell out 30-40% more to procure the specialised green crackers this year. Despite the higher availability of green crackers compared to last year, the crackers cost more as raw materials used to manufacture the less polluting variation are costlier.However, the variety of crackers is still no match to the conventional crackers, as manufacturers faced difficulties in production due to Covid-19 pandemic, say traders based in Gadoli and Qadipur villages, which are the main hub of cracker trade on the outskirts of the city.City residents might also have to reach out to wholesalers on the outskirts to buy green crackers, as the district administration is yet to grant permission for setting up temporary stalls within the city. The police on Thursday said that only green crackers would be allowed to be sold and action would be taken against violators.In 2018, the Supreme Court had banned the sale and use of conventional firecrackers in the National Capital Region while deciding a writ petition filed in 2015 against high pollution caused by firecrackers on Diwali. Later in 2019, the apex court had allowed the sale and use of green crackers, which caused less air pollution, and that too in a limited window.Traders in the city, however, said the lack of variety and the Covid-19 pandemic has hit their sales by at least 70% this year. “The business is usually high during the Dussehra season, but this year sales were not high. We had expected some recovery but nothing has happened as people either don’t want to spend or they don’t have money,” said Anil Nagpal, a supplier based in Qadipur.The traders in Qadipur and Gadoli say that crackers of different types, sizes and colours were available but due to change in chemical composition and reduction in strength, the potency of these products was lesser than traditional crackers. “The crackers available now have a different chemical composition and the chemicals which used to pollute the air have been replaced with laboratory approved chemicals,” said Nagpal.The result of these changes, says traders, is that the price of green crackers is 30% to 40% higher and as large-scale production of green crackers began only in June 2020, the manufacturers have not been able to supply the complete variety. “Rockets and colourful fireworks which used to sell heavily for their dazzling sight and sound are not available. The manufacturing was also affected due to Covid-19. These crackers also create less sound so the buyers are less happy, but we sell only green crackers as these cause less pollution,” Pawan Kumar Jhamb, a trader based in Qadipur.A trader based in Gadoli, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the district administration should allow retail shopkeepers to set up temporary stalls so that sales can pick up across the city. “In the absence of these retailers, buyers will have to come to Qadipur and Gadholi to buy crackers. Sale of crackers should be allowed in different parts of the city,” he said.Jhamb also said that only seven to eight retailers on the outskirts of the city would be able to sell crackers in the current circumstances if permission is not granted to retailers.Subash Boken, public relations officer, Gurugram police, said that only sale of green crackers would be allowed in the city. “Action would be taken against those violating the norms,” he said. Officials of the district administration did not respond to requests for comment on allowing retail sale in city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/green-crackers-available-on-outskirts-to-cost-more/story-xcFs4hzRaY18ohg8oF2BcO.html
29-10-2020||Gurugram||After exemptions, ban on diesel gensets to be enforced stringently||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) clarified that action can be taken against housing projects or commercial complexes other than those exempted by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), with regard to the use of diesel generator (DG) sets till November 30.It will be applicable for cases where DG sets are used as a primary source of electricity despite having a regular power supply.Epca on Wednesday exempted 19 residential and commercial complexes in Gurugram and Faridabad from the ban on diesel generator sets, till November 30. The Supreme Court-appointed Epca also granted permission to Information Technology (IT) and process industries to use diesel gensets as a secondary source of power.“Even though exemptions are being given this year too, it has helped in bringing maximum housing projects under regular electricity supply connection,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board ( HSPCB). According to him, in the long run, the process has helped in streamlining measures required for controlling the emission of pollutants through excessive use of DG sets.According to him, there were 209 complexes in 2019 which were dependent upon DG sets as the primary source of power. “This year the number has come down to 19. Given the short time frame till November 30 even these 19 residential and commercial complexes will no longer be dependent upon DG sets,” he said.Officials clarified that no action will be taken against residential societies if they are dependent upon DG sets for an hour or two due to power cuts. “Providing continuous power supply without any disruption in Gurugram and Faridabad has been the target of the state to reduce pollutant emission through DG sets. If power is available then use of DG set will be limited. Due to unavoidable circumstances if there is a power cut and housing societies run DG sets then no action will be taken against them,” Narayanan said.Till November 30, as per the letter issued by Bhure Lal, chairman, Epca, 14 residential complexes along with five other commercial complexes, including a mall in Gurugram, which are fully dependent on diesel gensets due to non-compliance of electrical inadequacies, have been granted an exemption.“Epca has also exempted process industries and IT companies that run on servers and cannot afford a power break,” said Narayanan.“These industries will have to maintain a logbook on the use of diesel gensets, which will be scrutinised fortnightly or monthly by the power department. Action will be taken if they fail to reproduce proper documents at the time of verification,” said Narayanan.According to Narayanan, only those residential societies, commercial complexes or under-construction housing projects which are dependent upon DG sets as the primary source of power are exempted.“The regional offices of pollution board in Gurugram and Faridabad have been directed to take action in those cases where they find that despite having electricity connection, any builder or industry is largely dependent upon the diesel genset to draw power supply. These can be large construction sites with irregular electricity connections and dependency on DG sets,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-exemptions-ban-on-diesel-gensets-to-be-enforced-stringently/story-rr2Y4Vzid65Cm8NJZuGahP.html
29-10-2020||Gurugram||Dust pollution continues to worsen city air||The regional office of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has issued show cause notice to developers of three construction sites for failing to prevent dust emission since the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) kicked off on October 15. Officials said that no construction, however, has been stopped at any of these sites even though dust pollution continues to remain a major source of the air pollution.For the last week, the air quality index (AQI) of Gurugram has been in the ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ category of the CPCB classification. A high concentration of pollutants kept Gurugram’s AQI at 384 on Thursday, a deterioration from Wednesday’s AQI of 313. The concentration of ultrafine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 409 micrograms per cubic metre, as per the monitor at Vikas Sadan.The pollution board on October 28 served a show cause notice for closure to a group housing project in Sector 85, stating that appropriate dust control measures were not being taken at the site, following an inspection by the team.Shakti Singh, regional officer (south Gurugram), HSPCB, who is also the nodal officer for Grap implementation in the city, said that the activity at the site was in violation of the directions issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), under Section 5 of Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, to regulate dust emission from construction and demolition (C&D) activities.Singh said that other two notices were served to developers in new sectors of the city. However, he did not reveal their details. “They have been given a week to submit a compliance report on the construction activity. They have to tell why the activity should not be stopped under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Also, as to why action should not be taken against them under various provisions of environmental laws for non-compliance of Acts, notification and rules,” said Singh.In Gurugram, notices have been served to three construction sites in the last 15 days, according to Singh. “The Grap guidelines clearly state that large construction projects will provide an undertaking to the pollution board that they will adhere to the norms. Therefore, we have given the developers time to submit their compliance report. If they fail to do so, then only construction activity is stopped and a penalty is being imposed,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dust-pollution-continues-to-worsen-city-air/story-Tl1ERO5CjjOvJb3sel9HpI.html

The suspect is yet to be arrested, said police.The police said they had registered a case against the suspect under sections 376 (2) (N) (raping a woman repeatedly), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 354 D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code at the Women West police station.The suspect is a resident of Sector 12A, the police said.The woman, in her complaint, alleged that she met the suspect in 2015 when she had allegedly complained against a deputy mayor and had to visit the police station and district court for the same. The man offered to help her and also supported her financially.Pankhuri Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, said that as per the woman’s complaint, the suspect had clicked private pictures and recorded video clips of her on multiple occasions, and threatened to circulate it. “We are conducting investigation, the suspect is on the run. Victim’s medical examination has been conducted and her statement has been recorded in the court before the magistrate. Victim has told us that she was several times raped in farmhouse in Delhi, in Bahadurgarh and in a car at different occasions,” she said.Suman Dahiya, the woman’s counsel, said that her client has been mentally harassed since March this year. “She has filed a complaint now, as her children are studying in college and this could have hampered their studies as they had their exams,” she said, adding that they have enough technical evidence against the suspect.The woman said she will protest outside the commissioner’s office if the suspect is not arrested by Friday.The police said the suspect was convicted for murder and was sentenced for life imprisonment on August 29, 1977. He has served 20 years in prison and thus, is a life convict. He had filed several complaints against former sports minister Sukhbir Kataria, regarding fake voter scam, who was acquitted in 2019. He had also slapped a woman lawyer in the court premises and was behind bars for a week in 2016, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rti-activist-booked-for-raping-woman-promising-to-marry-her/story-XVUaSC7qVKGs7OUJuXgYkJ.html
29-10-2020||Gurugram||HSVP sells 100 properties worth ₹165 crore in a mega auction||The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Tuesday sold 100 properties worth a total of ₹165 crore during a mega auction, in which both commercial and residential properties in Gurugram, Rewari and Dharuhera were sold at premium rates said officials on Thursday. Authority officials said that though they had expected to raise more money, it seemed that the slowdown caused by Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on the auction and that things might improve in the next few months. As per the details shared by HSVP officials, the department managed to sell properties worth ₹135 crore in sectors 1 to 57 in two estates of Gurugram. “The response to the auction was good and several sites were sold at premium. In the last auction too we had managed to generate over ₹100 crore and majority of auctions were very competitive,” said Vivek Kalia, estate officer, Gurugram. HSVP officials said that over 200 properties were put on the block and they had managed to sell 102 properties. Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, said that 28 residential properties were sold for ₹59.79 crore and majority of those were in the city. “Fifty-five commercial properties were sold for around ₹68 crore. Nineteen sites for schools, nursing homes and clinics were sold for ₹46.28 crore. The positive development for us is that many sites in Rewari and Dharuhera were sold for double the reserve price,” said Yadav, adding that the buyers have faith in HSVP as a real estate developer. The only hitch, officials said, was couple of mega properties in Sector 29, whose price was reserved around ₹300 crore each, did not find favour with buyers. The mega auction of commercial and residential plots by Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran(HSVP) was originally scheduled for October 23 but due to technical glitches it was postponed to October 27. The authority hopes to offset some of its massive debt burden with the money collected from auction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-sells-100-properties-worth-165-crore-in-a-mega-auction/story-1eVK3x22spDFoZj3yv9yaM.html

The members rued that the educational institutes are earning crores from fees, but are paying negligible amounts to the MC. For instance, Arya College has been paying Re 1 per annum as a lease amount for 5 acres and KVM School is paying ₹250 per annum for 5 acres.An office-bearer of Shri Hindu Takht, Varun Mehta said that the land which has been given to the institutes is worth crores but still the civic body has failed to increase the amount, even when the authorities are aware of the matter.Mehta said that the MC should fix new rates and recover the same from the management of institutes concerned for the last 20 years. If the management fails to submit the amount, then the civic body should cancel the lease agreement and auction the land which is worth crores and use the amount to take up development projects. “If the MC and local bodies department fail to impose new lease rates as per the market rates or cancel the lease agreement in case managements do not clear the dues, then we will move Punjab and Haryana high court,” said Mehta. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that he is aware of the matter and a committee has already been formed for taking a final decision on the same. “There are few more institutes to whom land has been given on rent at negligible rates and the committee will look into all the aspects before finalising the new rates,” he said. The next meeting of the committee is expected to take place during the next week. The matter was also raised in the meeting of the MC general house held last year but the MC has still failed to finalise the rates. The files regarding the old lease agreements have also gone missing from the MC office.Arya College principal Savita Uppal and Kundan Vidya Mandir School’s principal Navita Puri were not available for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/outfit-seeks-revision-of-lease-agreement-with-two-institutes-in-ludhiana/story-swijDAGpeZVjqW4lnC2RFM.html

Four religious buildings were also constructed by encroaching upon the nullah in the past. In the initial survey, the contractor involved in the project found over 1,600 encroachments along the 14km-long stretch of the nullah moving through the city. The survey report was then sent to the revenue department for re-confirming the same. Now, the civic body has received the final report from the contractor, wherein it has been stated that there are over 960 encroachments alongside the nullah.Earlier, the special task force constituted to clean the nullah had directed the MC to conduct a survey for removing encroachments and beautification of the nullah. The demarcation process commenced on July 8 so the nullah’s width can be increased.Apart from MC, irrigation and revenue departments are also involved in the process. The nullah is the main drain of the city. Due to encroachments, its width has decreased over the years and it overflows almost every monsoon.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that the civic body was given the responsibility to conduct the survey and now the report will be forwarded to the drainage department as it is their responsibility to clear the encroachments. MC will, however, extend support when required. MC working on beautification of nullahMunicipal town planner (MTP) Monica Anand said that the civic body is also working for the beautification of Buddha Nullah by establishing micro forests and conducting landscaping on the banks of the nullah. Recently, MC commissioner, Pardeep Sabharwal also conducted a meeting with different branches of the civic body and directed the officials to identify sites for establishing micro forests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/survey-finds-960-encroachments-along-ludhiana-s-buddha-nullah/story-Gp2gqWJpkL43yGXqaphDDN.html

Kashmir media continues to get targeted, demonised, vilified and raided by both the state and non-state actors for a long time now,” KEG said in a statement adding that the valley’s media had proven record of being a professional institution that maintained textbook objectivity while maintaining its core journalistic values.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/terror-funding-case-fresh-nia-raids-at-9-ngos-trusts-in-kashmir-delhi/story-EuTtEF76worS5p6cD77oAJ.html

Things were different then, but for the past few years we were not being heard which is why we took this step,” he said.Bajwa also demanded that the statehood should be restored to J&K, besides being critical of BJP’s hasty decision of abrogating Articles 370 and 35-A.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/won-t-stand-disrespect-of-national-flag-says-former-pdp-mp-bajwa/story-8Mu4fzFj2dIlsXupghwB5M.html

29-10-2020||Delhi||Action more important than creating new teams: Gopal Rai on new anti-pollution law||Strict action on the ground was more important than creating new teams and committees, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Thursday after the Centre introduced a new law through an ordinance that put in place a powerful oversight body to curb air pollution.Under the ordinance released by the Union ministry of law and justice on Thursday, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has been dissolved and replaced by a commission comprising over 20 members.The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas will have the power to lay down parameters of air quality, discharge of environmental pollutants, inspect premises violating the law, ordering closure of non-abiding industries/plants among others.Reacting to the development, Rai said, “Strict action on the ground is more important than creating new teams and committees... Earlier, the Supreme Court gave these powers to EPCA. The Central Pollution Control Board, too, has the same powers.” “Recently, we saw that an exemption were given to a few colonies in Noida from the ban on electricity generators. It doesn’t matter how many committees you form until there is action on the ground,” he said.The minister also said 228 complaints were received from people across Delhi on the Green Delhi application within a few hours of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launching it.Citizens can click pictures or make a video of pollution causing activities, such as burning of garbage, industrial pollution and dust, and upload them on the mobile application. It will identify the location and the complaint will be automatically forwarded to the department concerned for time-bound redressal, Rai said.The ‘green war room’ set up at the Delhi Secretariat will monitor the status of complaints. A team of 70 ‘green’ marshals will assist in their redressal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/action-more-important-than-creating-new-teams-gopal-rai-on-new-anti-pollution-law/story-ypjitGDsgDzaqFuGsOsqEO.html

29-10-2020||City||Will quit politics if MSP system dismantled: Haryana CM||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday accused the Congress of “misleading” farmers by telling them the Centre’s new farm laws will lead to dismantling of the MSP system and said he would quit politics if that were to happen.Addressing a series of public gatherings in different villages, he also touched upon several steps taken by his government for farmers’ welfare. Khattar was accompanied by wrestler-turned-politician and BJP candidate from Baroda Yogeshwar Dutt, Haryana Minister and Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala, JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala and a number of state BJP leaders.“MSP is guaranteed in mandis. I announce that if MSP will end, I will quit politics,” he said.He said,“The mandi system and MSP will continue. These laws give a greater choice to farmers to sell their produce anywhere. Every time the MSP will be released with a hike. After the demise of Sri Krishan Hooda Ji, we have transferred ₹165 crore in the accounts of sarpanches to carry out developmental works in their respective villages. We are committed to setup a university at Butana village, IMT and a rice mill in the constituency.” Taking a jibe at leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son Deepender Singh, Khattar said the duo is campaigning for Congress candidate Induraj Narwal in Baroda. “No other Congress leader is ready to go there,” he claimed. “Earlier, they used to say Yogeshwar Dutt’s security deposit will be forfeited. But now they have realised that the ground situation is something else and the tide is turning against them,” he said.“Both of them are contesting this election for their survival and have pitted a dummy candidate (Narwal) instead,” he added.He said, “We will provide 75% reservation to local youths in private sector jobs in Haryana. We have given damaged crop compensation of ₹12,000 per acre while the Congress government has failed to do so.”Meanwhile, jails and power minister Ranjit Chautala said his family had won the Baroda seat from 1977 to 2005. “Dushyant and I have 14 portfolios and urge you to not worry about anything. If you elect Dutt from here, we will fulfill all the poll promises,” he added.CM should visit mandis to check if crops are purchased at MSP: HoodaReacting sharply over Khattar’s commitments, leader of opposition Bhupinder Hooda said the CM should visit the mandis to check if the crops are being purchased at the MSP or not.“Farmers are forced to sell their produce below MSP. The government has implemented three new agricultural laws only to ensure that the farmers sell their crops to private agencies. They are selling their paddy at a loss of ₹500 to ₹1,000 per quintal. People at the helm of power only know how to speak. They will neither give MSP to the farmer nor leave politics,” Hooda said, adding that the intention of the present government is completely ‘anti-farmer’.“The government has been deliberately dismantling farmer welfare policies and systems like mandis, MSPs, bonuses, subsidies, compensations which were started during our regime,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-quit-politics-if-farmers-fail-to-get-msp-haryana-cm/story-DKNCV8cpknM0ZfeWOyUdMK.html

These figures were provided by the Delhi government’s state surveillance unit as a response to a right to information (RTI) application filed by this reporter. The reply also stated that the 2,487 employees who were infected included doctors and bureaucrats.There are over 2.5 lakh employees and around 150 departments and agencies in the Delhi government. In its RTI response, the government, however, mentioned that it did not maintain category wise data of Covid-19 positive employees because of which it is unknown how many of them were IAS officers, DANICs officers, doctors or DASS cadre officers. Among those who died of Covid-19 include 50-year old Hari Prasad, who was working as the assistant director in Delhi government’s education department when he contracted the infection. “He was totally healthy and had no co-morbidities. But, just 3-4 days after he tested positive, we learnt that he died of Covid-19. It was shocking. Another officer, Rameshwar Singh, working in the government’s pay and account office also died of Covid-19 recently,” said Umesh Batra, general secretary of the Delhi Government Employees’ Welfare Association (DGEWA). “But unfortunately, the city administration is not considering these cases for its compensation of Rs 1 crore. Their rule states that a person will get the ex-gratia amount only if one dies while on Covid-19 duty,” he said.Following the deaths of these Delhi government officers, the association has also written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office to consider even those who are not directly on Covid-19 duty and have succumbed to the virus for some form of compensation. “In recent times, many officers/officials who are not directly attached with Covid duty have died due to contracting coronavirus while performing their duties in different departments/offices of Delhi government. In view of this, we would like to request you to extend Covid compensation to such officers as well,” read the letter sent by the association on September 23.A senior Delhi government official said more than 1,000 officers have been deployed on duty by the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA). They have been deployed at quarantine centres, hospitals, containment zones, law and order matters, logistic support to various organisations, airport duties, assistance to manufacturers of essential commodities, shelter homes and so on.A senior official in the chief minister’s office said on May 2, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev had appointed a state nodal welfare officer to provide all necessary help, including medical treatment and welfare, to Covid-19 positive officers of the Delhi government, its autonomous bodies, corporations and local bodies (municipal corporations).“This was done after a lot of doctors, nurses of Delhi government hospitals, and civil defence volunteers had tested positive for Covid-19. Nikhil Kumar, the CEO of Delhi Jal Board was appointed as the nodal officer, under whom two dedicated hospitals and one exclusive testing centre for Delhi government officers who test positive for Covid-19 or are suspects and their families were identified,” said the officer. “A staff welfare cell and a dedicated 24x7 helpline number under this cell were also opened for regular interaction with infected officers as well as their family members. The district magistrates provide details of officers found Covid-19 positive in their districts on a daily basis to the state nodal welfare officer,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-487-employees-of-delhi-govt-have-tested-covid-ve-since-march-show-records/story-YVBJgiVJX4SelvFl2QcPWK.html
29-10-2020||Pune||Congress slams Centre for stopping cooking gas subsidies||Congress spokesperson Gopal Tiwari has lashed out at the Centre raising questions on why cooking gas subsidy was stopped from April this year. Tiwari said, “The Central government must either sell gas cylinders at lower rates or restart subsidies in the bank account under the direct benefit transfer scheme.” As per the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, all consumers need to buy the 14.2 kg cylinder at the market price. Later, the government transfers the subsidy directly into the bank account of eligible consumers. The subsidy is the difference in the market and subsidized price of cooking gas. Tiwari wrote a letter to the union minister for petroleum and natural gas and raised questions on the subsidy. Tiwari stated in his letter that the government must clarify officially why they are not issuing the subsidy from when lockdown began and citizens are facing financial crises. He said the government must either resume the subsidy immediately or sell gas at low prices. A source in an oil company said on the condition of anonymity that it is true that the subsidy is not getting transferred but the reason behind it is the low prices of cooking gas in national and international markets. As the prices of crude oil and other subsidized products have fallen, the oil companies have lowered the cylinder prices.

Rawat moved the top court following the high court ruling on Tuesday.Ramesh Bhatt, Rawat’s media advisor, the top court’s order was expected as the chief minister was heard in the matter nor was any notice issued to him. “We welcome the decision of the Supreme Court. We believe ultimately truth will prevail; it will win.”Also Read: SC stays CBI probe against Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh RawatBJP spokesman Devendra Bhasin welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision. “The HC [high court] order was a surprising development as it was done without hearing the chief minister in the matter. We believe that truth will ultimately prevail. Lies have no legs.”He said the opposition Congress wanted to make this an issue only to be disappointed. “They should apologise to the chief minister for the kind of statements Congress leaders have been making since Tuesday. The kinds of statements they have made show how frustrated Congress is.”Congress leader Lalchand Sharma said the top court has just stayed the order and not cleared him of the allegations. “Given the fact that such serious allegations have been levelled against him, the chief minister should have resigned on moral grounds till the investigation was completed. If he has nothing to hide, why does not he want the CBI to investigate the allegations?

The civic body’s primary education department administrator Meenakshi Raut gave the drop out numbers after Congress leader Aba Bagul demanded the numbers be released by the school board. Raut said, “The PMC is running 250 primary schools in the city. The primary school is up to 7th standard. A total of 9,548 students passed out of the 7th standard in the year 2019-20. After passing, 4,441 students took admission in PMC run middle schools; a total of 3,395 students took admission at various private schools and a total of 2,419 students did not come to take a transfer certificate which means they did not take an admission anywhere.” According to Bagul, Pune is considered as the Oxford of the east. If this is the situation of primary education in the city and around 2,500 students are dropping school after 7th standard then it is shocking. “Mostly students from lower-income groups join the PMC school. If these students dropped out from school, it is very clear that either they would start work somewhere to help their parents or turn towards crime activity,” Bagul added. Bagul appealed to the municipal commissioner to start night school in the e-learning school located at Sahakarnagar for these drop-out students. Bagul said, “I am going to start night school in the Rajiv Gandhi e-learning school for drop out students. I am appealing the municipal commissioner to give any skill education to these students as it would help them to get better employment opportunities after completing education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2-419-students-drop-out-of-pmc-school-post-7th-standard-reveals-pmc-data/story-mKURNk7Sjj5DiPNKN5uGYL.html

He has been remanded to police custody till October 31.The Shivajinagar police had earlier arrested three persons- Kapil Vilas Phalke (34); Deepak Shivaji Vandekar (28) and Rohit Dattatreya Shende (32) on charges of murder.The deceased lawyer had gone missing from Shivajinagar court since October 1 and was murdered by Phalke and Vandekar and his body was burnt and dumped at Tamhini ghat on the same day, according to the police. The third accused advocate Rohit had masterminded the killing of advocate More, the police had stated the details in their FIR and submissions before the court.More who dealt with land dispute related cases was a complainant in an anti-corruption case in 2018 wherein a bribe of Rs 1.17 crore changed hands.

His brother Prashant More later lodged an FIR in the case. The role of Phalke and Vandekar came into light after they were seen in the CCTV footage while getting into the car with advocate More.To evade arrest and mislead the policemen investigating the case, one of the suspects threw the mobile phone in a truck so that his location would be revealed as far away from their actual location where he committed the murder with the other accomplice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-bar-association-secretary-arrested-in-advocate-s-murder-case/story-WU1jGrzyZSfilZfE3tacNN.html
29-10-2020||Pune||NGT issues order to move garbage processing plant out of Baner||The National Green Tribunal (NGT), principal bench, has issued an order to move a garbage processing plant out of Baner, citing non-compliance of various environmental norms, including absence of a no-objection certificate from the Airport Authority of India. The plant, run by Noble Exchange Environment Solution, Pune, on a hillock, violated environmental norms by building it in the vicinity of 12 residential societies, a temple, and HEMRL work site, among others. The order was issued by a four member principal bench including chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar, judicial member Justice Sheo Kumar Singh, and expert members Nagin Nanda and Satyawan Singh Garbyal, on Tuesday, and made available on Wednesday. The decision was issued via a video conference hearing of an application filed by the Sus Road Baner Vikas Manch, led by president Vinay Deshpande and secretary Harish Patil. “There is violation of statutory sitting guidelines on the subject (of inhabitants in the vicinity). Nearest residential apartment has been found to be within 66 metres from the boundary of the plant. Housing societies are within 107 metres from the outer boundary of the plant and 15 apartments are within 200 metres of it. Thus, the plant is within the prohibited distance. There is no place for development of a green belt. According to the CPCB guidelines referred to in the report, a distance of 500 metres from the boundary of the inhabitation has to be maintained, but in a suitable case it can be 200 metres. There has to be a 10-metres green belt around the facility. Thus, the plant is in violation of the right to a clean environment of the inhabitants and is against statutory norms,” reads the order.The residents have been fighting the issue in court for the past several years. “There are many health issues. At least 22 health certificates related to breathing problems were submitted to the court. The lockdown was doubly difficult for us. Medha Kulkarni had also raised this issue in the state assembly when a woman living here had delivered prematurely. She had breathing issues,” said Deshpande. “This plant was set up in violation of all environmental norms. There was tremendous odour in the vicinity and the residents were facing health hazards. The authorities were not acting upon the complaints and hence, we petitioned the NGT. The corporation did not maintain the mandatory buffer zone of 500 metres and kept granting building permissions blindly,” said advocate Saurabh Kulkarni, who is representing the residents. After commencing in 2015, for two years, between 2017 and 2019, the plant had remained non-operational due to finance-related reasons. However, the plant started functioning again in the first quarter of 2019, after which, residents filed the application. The present application was filed on March 2, 2019. NGT had constituted a joint committee of Central pollution control board (CPCB) and Maharashtra pollution control board (MPCB) to probe the matter. The committee submitted its report on October 10, 2019. “The plant does not possess consent to operate and is operating after obtaining authorisation from MPCB. The plant started its operation from December 17, 2015 and continued till July 16, 2017 during which 5-10 MT/day of waste was processed till June 2016, and thereafter, about 100 MT/day till July 16, 2017. Thereafter, the plant was not in operation till March 18, 2019. It was informed that non-operation was due to sale related issues of gas generated by the company,” read the report.Effectively, the tribunal has informed the respondents in the case to move the location of the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ngt-issues-order-to-move-garbage-processing-plant-out-of-baner/story-Koi7caU56eU4cyF8nJ3WNO.html

29-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi health minister attributes spike in Covid-19 cases to festive season, change in contact tracing strategy||A day after Delhi recorded the highest ever single-day spike in infections with 5,673 Covid-19 cases, health minister Satyendar Jain attributed it to the festive season and a change in the administration’s contact tracing strategy.Talking to reporters on Thursday, Jain assured that Delhi is well-prepared for another surge in Covid-19 cases in the winter months. An expert committee headed by NITI Ayog member VK Paul has said the number of cases in Delhi could go up to 15,000 a day during the winter months. Jain said the number is unlikely to touch the 15,000-mark.“We have changed our strategy by strengthening our contact tracing system now. We are seeing a surge in daily Covid-19 cases not only because more people are coming out owing to the festivities, but also because of this change in strategy.”Also Read: Covid-19: Delhi records highest ever spike in casesExplaining the latest strategy, Jain said until last week, the government used to test contacts of Covid-19 positive persons only if they showed symptoms. “But it was realised that contact tracing per Covid-19 case was not being done properly. Hence, now directions have been issued to test every person who came in close contact with the Covid-19 positive case even if they are not showing symptoms. In fact, we are also trying to get many of them tested for a second time after four days or a week. This is why the positivity rate is also increasing. So, now we are trying to test 5-6 contacts per Covid case to break the cycle of infection.”In its response to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by this reporter, the Delhi government’s state surveillance unit said that between March, when the first Covid-19 case was detected in the city, and September, 30, 555,662 contacts of Covid-19 cases were tracked. Till September 30, Delhi had a cumulative of 282,752 Covid-19 cases, as per the health bulletin of October 1.This means on average only around 2 people per Covid-19 case in Delhi were traced till September 30. Community surveillance or contact tracing is one of the mainstays of the government’s strategy to fight Covid-19 transmission in the country.The Delhi government’s response to the RTI application dated October 14 also said that of the 555,662 contacts of Covid-19 cases that were traced till September 30, as many as 33,882 contacts ultimately had tested positive.The health minister appealed to the people to take full caution in the coming festival days which include following social distancing norms and wearing masks.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayOn hospital arrangements made by the government for a surge in cases, Jain said the city administration is “well-prepared” for the coming days and added that as of date more than 10,000 beds are vacant in the city hospitals for Covid patients.On Wednesday, 5,673 new cases of the viral infection were reported. The positivity rate – the proportion of samples that returned positive among those tested – also was over 9%. This happened for the first time since the first week of September when Delhi was conducting only about 20,000 tests a day.The number of cases in the city started increasing again in October as the government scaled up the more reliable RT-PCR tests. On Wednesday, over 17,000 RT-PCR tests were conducted in the city for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-health-minister-attributes-spike-in-covid-19-cases-to-festive-season-change-in-contact-tracing-strategy/story-1b3tZbc7KVhqkGMdc6Nm5I.html

29-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders enquiry into MSRDC chief engineer’s meddling in multi-crore road work tender||A Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday ordered an enquiry into the conduct of AB Gaikwad, chief engineer of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), of meddling in awarding a multi-crore road work tender in the state’s Yavatmal district. The HC division bench, comprising Justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote, has directed that the enquiry should be conducted by an officer not below the rank of secretary in National Highways (NH) division of the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) and submit a report to the it within a month.The court was irked to note that Gaikwad’s interference had resulted in disqualifying an eligible lowest bidder, RK Chavan Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., and awarding the work to an ineligible entity, M/s. GIPL-BCCPL (JV).The court cancelled the tender process, which was floated for an improvement of State Highway 317 -- stretching from Chargaon in Yavatmal district to the border of neighbouring Chandrapur district – and the bidding exercise’s value was fixed at Rs 47.56 crore.A notice, inviting bids for the project, was published on June 29, 2019. Also Read: Bombay HC directs BMC to pay salaries to blind employees absent during Covid-19 pandemicAltogether, three bids were received in response to the notice. On July 20, 2019, the tender evaluation committee (TEC) declared that one of the bidders was technically disqualified, leaving RK Chavan Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd and M/s. GIPL-BCCPL (JV) in the fray.On August 1, 2019, the price bids were opened and after it became clear that RK Chavan Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd was the lowest bidder, Sumit Bajoria, a representative of GIPL-BCCPL (JV), created a ruckus and took away the tender evaluation sheet and attendance register, following which the tender process had to be stalled. Another GIPL-BCCPL (JV) partner returned the documents to the MSRDC authorities the following day.The judges were annoyed to note that instead of initiating criminal action against Bajoria, the officials extended undue favours to GIPL-BCCPL (JV).Gaikwad himself allegedly cancelled an experience certificate, which was issued to RK Chavan Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd by an executive engineer of MSRDC. On the basis of Gaikwad’s letter, RK Chavan Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd’s bid was held ineligible, paving the way for the alleged errant GIPL-BCCPL (JV) to bag the contract. RK Chavan Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd authorities moved HC, challenging the high-handed action of MSRDC officials.HC expressed utter displeasure over the episode. “The situation leading to the present petition, is clearly indicative of the callous and casual attitude of the respondents and specifically the five-member TEC constituted for the process,” said the bench.The court found that the TEC did not apply its mind about the eligibility norms. It also found that no record was maintained that could throw some light on the tender process. “The process smacks not only of malafide intention, but also of favouritism, indulgence, interference, which compels us to hold that tender exercise is vitiated,” said the bench.The judges were also annoyed with the manner in which the record of the tender was maintained.“A perusal of the record reveals a shocking situation,” said HC. “The original record is a collection of loose papers consisting of various letters, evaluation sheets, communications etc. which is neither arranged date-wise, nor is paginated,” it said. “The record is a hotchpotch of papers with no coherence and logical sequencing at all, either date-wise or for that matter in any manner whatsoever. Nothing can be ascertained from the original record,” it added.The court also noted that the record did not disclose as to when the TEC met, how evaluation was conducted and what was considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-enquiry-into-msrdc-chief-engineer-s-meddling-in-multi-crore-road-work-tender/story-7GjjKFX620TRDjbc0iXlKN.html

The SP candidates, Bansilal Jatav (60) and Bhanu Pratap Singh Gurjar (39), have switched to the BJP and the Congress, respectively.The SP had fielded Jatav from Ambah, which is reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SC), in MP’s Morena district and Gurjar from Mehgaon constituency in Bhind district. Also Read: EC notice to BJP candidate for calling political rival ‘insane’Morena and Bhind districts are a part of the Chambal region in MP.Jatav joined the BJP during an election rally in the constituency in presence of Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday. Gurjar followed suit and joined the Congress in Mehgaon. Jatav, a three-time member of the MP legislative assembly (MLA), had quit the BJP after the party did not nominate him for the upcoming bypolls and joined the SP. The SP’s MP unit is peeved at the “indiscipline and betrayal” of their candidates in the run-up to the crucial bypolls.“Jatav joined the BJP on Wednesday. A BJP leader went to his house on Tuesday night and persuaded him to return to the party. Gurjar also joined the Congress. Our party is yet to take a decision about their act of indiscipline and betrayal,” said Yash Bharatiya, spokesperson for the SP’s MP unit. “An audio clip has gone viral on social media, where a Congress leader can be heard trying to lure our Gwalior candidate, Roshan Baig. He is urging Baig to voluntarily withdraw from the contest. Both BJP and Congress leaders are pulling out all stops to intimidate and lure our candidates to withdraw from the upcoming bypolls. However, the voters will give a befitting reply to both the parties on the polling day,” he added.The SP is contesting in 14 of the 28 seats, where bypolls will be held in MP on November 3. The party is largely contesting in the Gwalior-Chambal region. At present, SP has a lone lawmaker in the 230-member MP assembly.Jatav and Gurjar were unavailable for their comments, despite repeated attempts by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-samajwadi-party-candidates-join-rival-parties-mid-campaign/story-HsXZ8jV8TRls46uE4KczAJ.html
29-10-2020||Chandigarh||39 in Himachal’s Spiti valley test positive for Covid-19||Thirty-nine residents of the remote Rangrik village in Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh have tested positive for Covid-19, health officials said on Thursday. Though the villagers had been in self-isolation ever since the Covid-19 outbreak in March and had banned tourism in the area to keep outsiders at bay, the surfacing of coronavirus cases over the past few days led to the district administration declaring Rangrik village a containment zone. As a precautionary step to contain the spread of coronavirus, the district authorities have sealed the village and barred in and out movement, except in an emergency. HEALTH DEPT TEAM IN VILLAGE FOR CONTACT TRACING A state health department team is carrying out testing of the primary contacts mainly in Kaza, the headquarters of Spiti, 320 km from the state capital of Shimla, on Thursday. “Most of the people in Spiti are aware about the disease despite no internet connectivity in large areas. They are taking precautions on maintaining social distance while working in fields too,” assistant public relations officer Ajay Banyal told IANS over phone. Kaza was the first in the state to sanitise the entire block. Rangrik is 6km from Kaza across the Spiti river and connected by a small bridge. With a population of about 900 people, it is a relatively green patch in an otherwise barren landscape. Located at an altitude of 12,400 feet, it is the largest village in Spiti valley in terms of area and population. The entire Spiti valley is populated mainly by tribals. The climatic conditions of the district are harsh as much of the land forms part of a cold desert where the mercury drops below minus 20 degrees Celsius during winter. Himachal Pradesh reported 332 new Covid-19 cases since Wednesday afternoon. While two patients died, 205 were cured of the infection during the period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/39-in-himachal-s-spiti-valley-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-XuYdXS0goebdyJ3FCtsHhP.html

Bhupendra Tomar, Karni Sena’s divisional secretary, claimed hundreds of people from 60 villages with a sizeable Rajput population attended the panchayat. He added they sought adequate compensation for the woman’s family and a fast track court to try the accused.Additional police superintendent Sarvesh Mishra said 200 to 300 people participated in the panchayat that lasted three hours. He added the panchayat organisers later handed over a memorandum to acting sub-divisional magistrate Pankaj Saxena and that a heavy police force was deployed around the venue of the gathering that ended peacefully.Also Read: Hathras gangrape case: CBI continues probe in villageTomar said Bajrang Dal’s state president Gaurav Raghav and many other leaders addressed the panchayat and expressed anger over the incident. Tomar linked the murder to alleged forced conversion because the same accused had allegedly kidnapped the woman in 2018 and the matter was settled through a compromise. He said the accused belong to a strong political family and that is why the issue had died down then and police were negligent in providing security to the woman.He said they will launch a movement if justice was denied to the woman’s family, which is originally from Raghunathpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-panchayat-demands-capital-punishment-for-killer-of-haryana-woman/story-ZDkapqo4CDBmiqQe3WVtVJ.html

Speaking to the media, Thackeray said “The governor asked me to talk to [NCP Chief Sharad] Pawar. I will definitely talk or call Pawar and even meet chief minister [Uddhav Thackeray] if needed.” “The MNS has been agitating about this issue. The power companies say that MERC [Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission] should allow them to lower the bills while MERC says that power companies can do so on their own. In such a case, the state government needs to intervene but is not doing anything. They cannot even take a simple decision,” he alleged.Also Read: Bombay HC directs BMC to pay salaries to blind employees absent during Covid-19 pandemicHe questioned how people would pay the unusually high bills. “The person who was paying Rs 5,000 is being charged Rs 25,000. How can people who suffered a lockdown afford to pay such inflated bills?” he added. He said since the governor was the head of the state, he had given the first memorandum to him.Thackeray came down heavily on the state government, accusing it of dragging its feet on taking a decision. “Restaurants have been allowed to reopen but the temples have not. The trains are still not operational and we are seeing such a rush on the roads. It’s time they take decisions and not drag matters,” he added.The inflated bills given by the power companies have caused large resentment among the people. Raj Thackeray had also written to his cousin and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in July, asking him to resolve the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-raj-thackeray-petitions-governor-koshyari-over-inflated-electricity-bills/story-Tmv8qfeBToTN5TPQAOOkzI.html

They added that Ahmad spoke to his uncle and allegedly asked him to arrange a countrymade pistol , following which the latter’s friend, Azru, provided him with a weapon. Inmates lodged in Bhondsi jail can contact family members , said officials. Police said that statements of the eyewitnesses were yet to be recorded on Wednesday but would be done this week. OP Singh, Faridabad’s police commissioner, said: “The special investigation team has identified four eyewitnesses and has collected technical and other evidences against the accused which are enough to hold him guilty in the court. The SIT is questioning the accused and his friend for more details in the case.”A police official familiar with the investigation said on condition of anonymity that Touseef Ahmad told police that he suspected that the victim was in a relationship with another student ; that he had tried to talk to her about it but she wasn’t taking his calls and blocked him on WhatsApp; and that he got angry and planned to murder her.

Ahmad’s paternal uncle said that the family was unaware of his nephew’s plan. “The incident is unfortunate and we were not aware that my nephew was going to murder a woman. We all were not even aware that he was carrying a weapon with him.” The victim’s family members alleged that Ahmad’s family was well aware that he was going to murder their daughter and arranged a weapon for him. “He often used to threaten my daughter and was harassing her for the last two years. She told us that she was scared of him and he could harm but we never imagined that he could kill my daughter,” said Moolchand Tomar, father of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ballabhgarh-murder-shooter-got-gun-from-kin-s-friend/story-wj6fJyKYI2lfDtI5eqqf4H.html
29-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Aloo for the soul||There they are, lying in heaps—these shallow-fried potatoes in the shape of fingers. It’s only 8 in the morning but Muhammed Ali Khan’s footpath cart, in Old Delhi’s Cotton Market, already smells of the mildly spicy aloo bhaji.“My customers are mostly mazdoor (labourers),” he says. “They start working early in the morning, and rather than bread-butter they like to have bhaari khana (heavy meal) for breakfast.”After a pause, he explains, “I know very well what a labourer likes to eat, because I was one too.” Mr Khan is from Kishanganj, in Bihar. He arrived in Delhi 30 years ago, and earned a living as a beldar (construction worker) until he started this unnamed food stall, some 20 years ago.Apart from the aloo bhaji, the cart has fried fish, a pan filled with steamed rice, and rotis. Parathas are made on order. A quick tasting spree reveals all the dishes to be nice enough, but the aloo bhaji definitely stands out—crispy and squishy at the same time. Mr Khan speaks again. “Most of the labourers who come to my stall are from Bihar, and people in Bihar like to eat aloo bhaji.”The lane on which the stall stands looks like a boarding house for labourers. One can see their footpath-homes everywhere, with mattresses spread on the sides of the lane and clothes hanging on the walls around. A few labourers have already started their working day, carrying mounds of bricks on their reris (carts). Others are still in the process of getting ready—washing their clothes under a common tap, or taking a quick bath under it.“We too live right here,” says Mr Khan. By “we”, he means he and his two cooks, currently plopped down on the pavement, peeling vegetables. The wall behind them has a couple of pithu bags hanging on them. “These have our clothes,” says Mr Khan.You ought to try the stall’s tasty signature dish. Visit the place in the morning, or any time of the day or night. The stall opens from 5am to 1am, and the aloo bhaji is made afresh many times during the serving hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-aloo-for-the-soul/story-cOD6tjN09HyOp0Hw1KnbyI.html
29-10-2020||City||Pakistan gurdwara body to celebrate first anniversary of Kartarpur Corridor opening||The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) has announced to celebrate the first anniversary of the inauguration of the Kartarpur Corridor that connects Dera Baba Nanak town on the Indian side with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak, in the neighbouring country.Some “important decisions” were in a joint meeting of the PSGPC and the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) in Lahore on Tuesday taken to celebrate the anniversary on November 9. Talking to HT over phone, PSGPC president Satwant Singh said, “The first anniversary will be celebrated at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. Earlier, we were planning to invite Sikh devotees from India to attend the celebrations, but it was not possible as the corridor has not been opened from the Indian side in view of the coronavirus pandemic.”The Pakistan government had reopened the corridor on its side in the first week of October. Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry issued a notification for reopening of the corridor, which allows Indian pilgrims visa-free access to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib.Travel through the corridor was suspended in March following the Covid-19 outbreak. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages the affairs of gurdwaras in Punjab and other states of the country, has demanded re-opening of the corridor from the Indian side, especially on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.TO SEEK 3,000 VISAS FOR INDIAN PILGRIMS ON GURU’S BIRTH ANNIVDuring the meeting, the PSGPC and ETPB also decided to ask the Pakistan government to issue 3,000 visas to Indian pilgrims for attending the functions being organised at Nankana Sahib, the birth place of the first Sikh guru, on the occasion of his 551th birth anniversary.“Every year, 3,000 people come from India to commemorate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. Though the pandemic has changed the situation this year, we expect that the Indian pilgrims will come. We have asked the pilgrims to come with negative Covid-19 test reports. Keeping the pandemic in mind, we are giving only five-day visas to the Indian pilgrims from November 27 to December 1. They will be able to stay at Nankana Sahib only,” said the PSGPC president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pakistan-gurdwara-body-to-celebrate-first-anniversary-of-kartarpur-corridor-opening/story-VLucGN1TxmCueip2GCuLNJ.html
29-10-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal orchardists suffer ₹1,500 crore loss||Himachal’s ₹4,500-crore apple economy has suffered a loss of at least ₹1,500 crore this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and damage to apple crop which took place due to heavy rainfall and hailstorms earlier this year. This year Himachal Pradesh produced around 2.75 crore apple boxes while in 2019, the state produced 3.5 crore apple boxes.Horticulture department joint director JP Sharma said that this year apple production was low as compared to last year due to different factors as earlier this year heavy rainfall, hailstorms and diseases such as scab had damaged the apple crop. Mahinder Thakur, an orchardist from Kotgarh, said that last year he had produced around 2,000 apple boxes but this year he could only grow around 800 apple boxes. This happened as earlier in April, heavy hailstorm in the area battered the apple crop in the flowering stage.This year quality of apples were also not up to the mark as most of the apples were kept in C grade category as they lacked desirable colour and size. Therefore, orchardists could not get good a price for the produce. Despite the pandemic, orchardists received better rates at the beginning of the apple season, which decreased as the apple season picked pace. Imported apples also marred the Himachal’s apple’s chances.Apples are mostly grown in Shimla, Kullu, Kinnaur and Mandi districts of the state. This year due to coronavirus pandemic orchardists faced many challenges like lack of labourers, restrictions during the lockdown and negative effect of the pandemic on the economy of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-orchardists-suffer-1-500-crore-loss/story-Fvk275PNC2YrYEAkIDQTVL.html
29-10-2020||Chandigarh||Six cases of cheating reported in Chandigarh||Six residents of the city fell prey to fraudsters in separate cases, police said on Wednesday. In the first case, an FIR was registered against one Rakesh Kumar Garg of Haryana’s Kurukshetra for allegedly stealing the car of Santosh Kumar of Colony Number 4. Garg had reportedly sold the same car to Kumar through an online market place, OLX. Kumar said he had in 2017 come in contact of Garg who had listed a Chevrolet Tavera on OLX for sale and the deal was struck at ₹4.8 lakh. “As the vehicle was bought on loan, it was agreed upon that I would repay the loan and even paid ₹80,000 cash along with blank cheques as security with an assurance that the vehicle would be transferred in my name after clearing the loan. But Garg misused the cheques to withdraw ₹6.27 lakh and later stole the vehicle,” he added. He had lodged a police complaint but after they failed to act, he moved court on whose direction, the FIR was registered under sections 406, 420, 379 and 506 of IPC. In another case of cheating, three persons, including two women, lost ₹1.12 lakh in a fake job scam. In her complaint, Ankita of Sector 40 said on September 25, she had got a call from a woman who identified herself as Disha and asked her to fill an online form. “After filing the form, fee of ₹10 was to be paid. As I filled bank details, ₹5,000 was deducted from my account,” she told the police. Another complaint was lodged by Anshu Sharma, who also lost ₹20,100 in a similar manner. Likewise, Sarabjit of Palsora complained that on October 31, 2019, he had lost ₹85,856 to fraudsters who offered to get him a job. Selling headphones online proves costly for Sector-37 residentAnkur Mujral, a resident of Sector 37, told the police said that in June, he had listed a headphone online for selling. He received a call from a man posing as buyer after which he sent a Paytm scan code. As soon as the QR code was used, an amount of ₹1,900 was debited from his account instead. Another resident of the same sector, Ankit Bansal, alleged that he lost ₹60,000 to an unidentified person while buying a sofa online. He said that he had purchased a sofa through OLX and even made payment. But despite that, neither the sofa set delivered nor was the payment refunded, he claimed. Two tricity residents fall prey to snatchersTwo incidents of snatching were reported from different parts of the city, Chandigarh Police said on Wednesday. In the first case, complainant Satwinder Singh of Dhakoli said he lost his gold chain to a snatcher. He told the police that he had gone to the motor market in Sector 45 on Tuesday when a youth walked up to him and snatched his gold chain before fleeing on a motorcycle parked at a distance with his accomplice waiting. A case under sections 379A and 356 of the IPC has been registered at the Sector-34 police station. The second complaint was lodged by Ajay Kumar of Hallomajra. He said a snatcher on a Honda Activa took away his mobile phone from Phase 2 of Chandigarh Industrial Area on Tuesday.

29-10-2020||City||Himachal’s buyback policy for plastic yields positive result||A year since its launch, the Himachal Pradesh government’s buyback policy for non-recyclable single-use plastic has yielded positive results and helped the civic authorities in making Dharamshala town cleaner. So far, the Dharamshala municipal corporation has collected 20 tonnes of single-use plastic through its collections centres besides rag-pickers. It buys the plastic waste from residents for ₹75 a kg. “We have six collection centres where people deposit the plastic waste and are paid instantly,” says Dharamshala mayor Devinder Singh Jaggi. The collection centres at Norbulingka, Bhagsunag, Sheela Chowk and Charana Khad were set up in December last year. “A cement company in Solan takes this trash from the MC and uses it as fuel in its factory. Of the 20 tonnes of waste, the company has taken away 13 tonnes so far,” says Jaggi. The MC does not charge anything from the company and the cost incurred is cleared by the urban development department, he says. Helps cut down pollution Earlier, people would throw single-use plastic into rivers, resulting in water pollution. “The scheme has helped in the civic body’s endeavour to make Dharamshala cleaner,” he says. Urging people to help the authorities in eradicating the plastic problem, Jaggi appealed to residents of the town to participate in the movement. The Himachal Pradesh government had approved the policy to buy back non-recyclable plastic waste in September last year. The scheme was officially launched on October 1, ahead of the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. Himachal Pradesh is one of the few states to have banned plastic bags, thermocol cutlery and plastic water bottles of less than 1-litre capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-s-buyback-policy-for-plastic-yields-positive-result/story-5FuYvuUPIFMRrDexohrt2O.html
29-10-2020||City||4.6-acre housing project site in Sector 77 fetched for ₹100 crore||Even though the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) earned ₹417 crore by selling almost half of its properties out of total 113 in the 15-day auction that concluded on Tuesday, another site of 4.6 acres meant for a housing project in Sector 77 was sold for a whopping ₹100 crore in a bid said to be the highest ever. The reserve price of the site was ₹68 crore. The auction for this site went for nearly 14 hours as Delhi-based Homeland Builders bought the property after outbidding another developer from the national capital. The site – sold for nearly ₹20 crore per acre – has been bought by the same company that built luxury flats in Sector 70 and is also coming up with Homeland Unity Mall in Sector 67. The site is located on the 200-metre wide Airport Road in Sector 77 and is close to the district administrative complex in Sector 76. Homeland Builders CEO Umang Jindal said, “There was a tough fight for the site, which went at a price about 100% times higher. Since it is a prime location, we will be constructing the tallest towers of tricity there. We are hopeful to start the construction work by next month. We are planning to build at least 276 flats at the site that also falls in the vicinity of the famous Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana.” The amount, though earned from just one bid, is also the highest revenue the developing authority has generated during an auction from a group housing society. Mohali, particularly its peripheral areas of Zirakpur, Kharar, and New Chandigarh (Mullanpur), has been the tricity’s development hub in the recent past. Since last year, with GMADA-led IT City and Aerocity projects, Airport Road too is coming up as a prominent realty destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-6-acre-housing-project-site-in-sector-77-fetched-for-100-crore/story-G6E5zhiNoKw6eL9YspJaMP.html

The alliance, which is led by Mirwaiz Farooq, said the Centre’s imperial approach was bound to fail. In a statement, Hurriyat leaders - professor Abdul Ghani Bhat, Bilal Ghani Lone and Masroor Abbas Ansari - said the government of India had been issuing incessant anti-people orders at frequent intervals to intimidate and psychologically torture the people of J&K.“APHC reiterates its principled stand of engagement and dialogue among stakeholders for resolution of the Kashmir dispute,” the statement said, the Union was attempting to undermine all attempts of pursuing a peaceful resolution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue.“A policy of permanent demographic change is aggressively being pushed to snatch our land, destroy our identity and turn us into a minority in our own land. One after the other laws are being invented and amended by New Delhi and forcibly thrust upon the people of J&K,” the statement said. The Centre first brought in the arbitrary ‘domicile law’ that gave residency rights to non-permanent residents, then amendments in The J&K Civil Services (Decentralisation and Recruitment) Act allowed allocation of jobs and education seats to outsiders, then laws allowing exploitation of our natural resources were passed, and now our land laws have been brazenly repealed to allow anyone from across India to own land in Jammu and Kashmir, thsy said. “A law also allows the government to declare any local area as a ‘strategic area on the Army’s behest, which is alarming,” they said.The statement has asked people to hold peaceful shutdown on Saturday to register their resentment against the laws and also demanded their immediate withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anti-people-orders-hurriyat-conference-calls-for-protests-on-october-31/story-P6pBg7XCU4pk5JvMYV05qM.html

The court held that the action of the BMC of not paying salaries to specially-abled employees for not attending work due to the pandemic was discriminatory and illegal. The BMC is to pay the employees the arrears in two parts – one before Diwali, and the second instalment after 45 days of paying the first instalment. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while passing its judgement in the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the National Association for the Blind (NAB) on behalf of around 250 blind employees of the civic corporation, held that the BMC was responsible for its employees and was bound to pay them salaries though they did not attend duty. While arguing for NAB, advocate Uday Warunjikar had submitted that the Central and state government had issued a notice on March 27 and April 21, respectively, directing all government and local body authorities to exempt persons with disabilities from essential service duty during the pandemic. Warunjikar also submitted the April 28 memorandum issued by the ministry of social justice and empowerment which directed all PSUs to exempt persons with disabilities from essential services during the pandemic, and to treat their absence as special leave without loss of pay. Warunjikar further cited the example of a blind employee of the BMC who did not receive any salary in July and said that he was just one of 250 others who were marked absent by the civic authority and refused salary. Warunjikar had sought the courts interference by declaring the BMC’s act of non-payment of salaries to blind employees as arbitrary and also issue directions to the BMC to implement the provisions of the Persons with Disability Act, 2016. He asked that the civic body treat the absence from duty as simpliciter leave, wherein there is no financial loss to the employees. While pronouncing the judgement, the court held that the BMC’s act of not paying salary to blind employees was illegal and directed it to pay the salaries in two instalments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-directs-bmc-to-pay-salaries-to-blind-employees-absent-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-CgwxFGjxxAXExyy0PBsvpI.html
29-10-2020||City||Baroda bypoll: Three generations of Devi Lal’s family canvassing for BJP candidate||Three generations of former deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal’s family is canvassing for BJP candidate Yogeshwar Dutt in the Baroda bypoll, slated for November 3. Dutt is pitted against Indu Raj Narwal of the Congress, Raj Kumar Saini of the Loktantra Suraksha Party and Joginder Singh Malik of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD).Despite political differences, Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) patriarch Ajay Singh Chautala, his son Digvijay Singh Chautala, cousin Aditya Chautala, who is the BJP’s Sirsa district chief and their uncle Ranjit Singh Chautala, who is the power and jails minister in the BJP-JJP coalition government, are targeting guns at the Congress during the election campaign.It is for the first time that Aditya, Ajay Chautala and Ranjit Singh Chautala are canvassing for a common candidate against the nominee of the INLD, which is headed by former Haryana chief minister OP Chautala and his son Abhay Singh Chautala. Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala will join his father Ajay, uncle Aditya and grand uncle Ranjit Chautala to canvass against his old party’s nominee Joginder Singh Malik on October 30 and 31.Abhay, OP Chautala put efforts to retrieve party’s statureINLD supremo OP Chautala and his son Abhay Singh Chautala have been making efforts to retrieve their party’s stature, which saw its worst performance in the 2019 assembly polls. Abhay was the sole winner from the INLD.OP Chautala said after the Baroda bypoll, the BJP-JJP government will fall on its own and the traitors (Dushyant Chautala and his mother Naina Chautala) will have no option rather than merging their party into the BJP.“The Baroda seat was dominated by our party from 1977 to 2005 and this time the voters have made up their mind to elect our nominee Malik. I urge you to strengthen my hands and I promise to give a farmer friendly environment in the state,” he added.Anant Ram, retired professor of political science at the government college in Bhiwani, said the BJP is bringing Chautala clan to campaign for their candidate to woo Jat voters, which constitute 52% in the Baroda constituency and most are dependent on agriculture.“However, OP Chautala and his son Abhay are also focusing on the same vote bank to retrieve their party’s stature. It is evident that Aditya, Ranjit and Ajay Chautala’s families have huge political differences but surprisingly they will have to support Yogeshwar Dutt as the BJP is running the government with the help of independents and JJP,” he added. Differences in Chautala clanThe differences between OP Chautala and his brother Ranjit Singh erupted in 1989 when Devi Lal preferred the former as his political heir by choosing him as the chief minister. However, following a family feud, OP Chautala ousted Ajay and his both sons—Digvijay and Dushyant—from the INLD. Later, both Digvijay and Dushyant formed the JJP. The differences came to fore between Aditya and his cousin Abhay Singh, when the former defeated Abhay’s wife in the Zila parishad elections in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baroda-bypoll-three-generations-of-devi-lal-s-family-canvassing-for-bjp-candidate/story-SwSgNwanOhHwL5VfmkxcVI.html

The caller can be heard intimidating the police officer, asking him on why did he threaten “his friend Bhupinder” and “to reply with a solution within 10 minutes.”On the complaint of station in-charge Lajja Ram, a case was registered under Sections 170, 186, 353 and 419 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66D of the IT Act. In his complaint, Lajja Ram said, “As per my knowledge, this was not the voice of Vijay Sharma.” Vijay Sharma, who is the PA to Anil Vij at Chandigarh office did not respond to calls and messages. However, home minister Anil Vij, while talking to mediapersons, said ,“I was not aware of the matter but came to know that the call was made by someone impersonating as my PA. I’ve asked for a probe into the matter.”. Yamunanagar superintendent of police (SP) Kamaldeep Goyal said this is the second FIR in the matter and two people have been arrested in the assault case so far. On being asked about the allegations that the accused were allowed to go, the SP said, “All the accused were brought for interrogation. However, there was no complaint till then and so they were allowed to go. Now, two of them have been arrested while Bhupinder along with his friend is absconding.”Meanwhile, JJP leader and Ex-MLA Arjun Singh said the issue is being politicised. “My son was going home and got stuck in this road blockade. He stepped out of the car to check the situation but was attacked instead by the villagers who have their vested interests in the mining business. The complainant Balram has stolen Rs 58,000 from Bhupinder’s car,” he said, adding that they will lodge a theft case soon. “The station in-charge should have regulated the traffic. I have received a call from Dushyant Chautala, who asked me about the case. Some people are trying to malign the party’s image. I’ve demanded a clean investigation in the case,” Singh told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yamunanagar-assault-case-fir-against-unknown-person-for-impersonating-as-osd-to-anil-vij/story-CCjCVwOOlPpBiCHc5RsH4J.html

29-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis alleges ₹400-crore scam in Maharashtra health department||Alleging a ₹400-crore scam in the recruitment in the health department under the National Health Mission (NHM), Opposition leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding a probe. State health minister Rajesh Tope, however, said a probe has already been ordered into the allegations, after the department received complaints from Gadchiroli district last month. Fadnavis alleged that bribes between ₹1 lakh and ₹2.5 lakh are being taken from contractual employees for their recruitment in permanent jobs in the health department. He claimed 20,000 such employees are expected to be given permanent jobs. “This translates into a scam of ₹300-400 crore. This needs to be thoroughly probed and action needs to be taken against the guilty. NHM is fully funded by the Centre and implemented by the state government. It is serious if such bribes are being demanded for permanent recruitments. I have submitted audio clips alongisde,” Fadnavis has stated in the letter. “The process of appointing permanent employees started during the tenure of Fadnavis. A ministerial group headed by Sudhir Mungantiwar had recommended permanent recruitment. I had ordered a probe by Gadchiroli’s superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawde after I received complaints from the district,” said Tope. Meanwhile, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has alleged the state government played an important role in “gifting a builder ₹900 crore for a seven-acre plot at Dahisar”. “The builder has been asking the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to purchase the plot for the past 10 years. On November 2, 2019, then municipal chief Praveen Pardeshi had opposed it on the grounds that it was fully encroached and BMC would be at loss by purchasing it. However, a day after Uddhav Thackeray took over as the chief minister, BMC improvement committee decided to buy it for ₹349 crore. The builder appealed before the revenue tribunal, saying he should be paid ₹900 crore.” Shiv Sena leader and standing committee chairman Yeshwant Jadhav refuted the allegations. “There is no transaction of ₹900 crore. We are working on the progress of Mumbai, while he is indulging in making false allegations,” said Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-s-devendra-fadnavis-alleges-400-crore-scam-in-maharashtra-health-department/story-Wsr6FEmrcuHkUtevHHY0YO.html
29-10-2020||Mumbai||NCP chief Sharad Pawar urges Maharashtra onion traders to withdraw strike; blames Centre for contradictory decisions||In an attempt to end the indefinite strike called by onion traders in Nashik district, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday urged them to reconsider their decision. He assured that he would request the Centre to remove the restrictions on onion stock limits. Pawar also criticised the Central government, saying that it had removed onions from the list of essential commodities but banned its export and imposed restrictions on its stock limits in contradiction to its earlier decision.Onion traders in Nashik have been on strike since the last three days and have threatened to continue it indefinitely. They are opposing restrictions imposed by the Centre on stock limits of 25 metric tonnes (MT) for wholesalers and two metric tonnes for retailers on October 23. To keep prices in check, the Centre had banned the export of onions last month, a move that was opposed by all the political parties in the state.Nashik has around 15 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC). It also has Lasalgaon APMC, the oldest and largest wholesale market for onions in the country. The daily arrival of onion produce in the district is between 80,000 quintal to over one lakh. The strike has stopped onion supplies to many cities including Mumbai, which led to a rise in prices due to the shortage. It is also affecting farmers as onion is a perishable crop.The Central government made an amendment in the Essential Commodities Act and removed cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities last month.“On one hand, the government removed onions from the list of essential commodities; on the other, it imposed a ban on its export. Now, they have imposed restrictions on its stock limit, which is contradictory to what it had decided earlier. The restrictions are not practical and need to be removed,” Pawar said, after his meeting with onion traders in Nashik.“I will discuss the matter with the concerned union minister. I am also ready to lead a delegation along with representatives from onion traders to Delhi, but I will request you all to reconsider your decision on the indefinite strike. We can work together towards removing the difficulties. If possible, withdraw your strike as farmers have also been hit. I am sure you are not the ones who want to see others in trouble,” Pawar told traders.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman, APMC, Lasalgaon, said that they are facing loss of crores of rupees daily. “The losses of Lasalgaon APMC are around 𔝁2.5 crore a day, whereas the combined loss of all the APMCs in the district goes to around ₹10-15 crore a day. It has also disturbed supplies to cities, as a result of which they are experiencing a rise in prices. We are now hoping that the traders will withdraw their strike,” Holkar said.Ashok Walunj, director Navi Mumbai APMC said that the supply for Mumbai is not affected much as the strike was called by traders and not farmers. “Farmers have continued their supply to the market, so we were not that much affected. Also, the state government had deregulated onions in 2016, allowing farmers to sell them anywhere in the state. Hence, their direct supply to the city remained uninterrupted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-urges-maharashtra-onion-traders-to-withdraw-strike-blames-centre-for-contradictory-decisions/story-echq3aEbko9dUO4rDZvN7O.html

They are followed by west (333), New Delhi (275) and central Delhi (267). North-east Delhi, despite being the one with the highest population-density, has the lowest number of containment zones at 82.Delhi has 11 revenue districts.Government records also showed that the district officials have till date scaled down containment measures in as many as 3,610 containment zones and they are currently scaling down containment efforts in 1,177 of them even though they are officially yet to be de-notified as containment zones.The Central government had on Tuesday praised Delhi’s containment efforts, saying nearly 50% of cases surfacing in the city were located in containment zones. “We have seen the efforts that were being made to contain the disease spread in Delhi that has led to about 50% of the cases being reported from designated containment zones,” Dr VK Paul, member of Niti Aayog who heads a committee of experts, had said.Earlier this month, another expert committee jointly headed by Paul and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had flagged in a revised covid-19 document that the Capital could witness as many as 15,000 new Covid-19 cases per day in the winters. A senior Delhi government official said, “The government is aggressively creating micro containment zones. It is important to mention that the focus of the government is on creating smaller containment zones so that lesser people are affected and more active cases can be brought under scaled up surveillance. The status of the containment zones is periodically reviewed.” “Under the new policy, several residences which have more than one covid-19 case in the family, assigned home isolation, have been notified as containment zones. The policy of micro containment zones has enabled the districts to scatter containment zones to conform with the scattered nature of cases,” said the official who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-cases-spike-delhi-has-3-047-containment-zones-in-place-to-check-virus-spread/story-0tsaRp6q0rWGpkSvfKvRfJ.html
29-10-2020||Mumbai||Bollywood singer Kumar Sanu’s son’s remarks on Marathi on Big Boss show upset Shiv Sena, MNS||Bigg Boss contestant Jaan Kumar Sanu’s comment “against Marathi language” led to furore on Wednesday, with the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) threatening to stop the filming of the reality show. While Sena also demanded the show’s shooting permit be cancelled, home minister Anil Deshmukh said the state was contemplating legal action after receiving a complaint. Viacom 18 Media Private Limited, which runs Colors, the channel on which the show is aired, issued an apology, stating it respects all languages and has taken note of objections and taken corrective measures of removing the objectionable part from all future broadcasts. In an episode on the show aired on October 27, Jaan, the son of Bollywood playback singer Kumar Sanu, is seen deriding his fellow contestant who spoke in Marathi, saying she should not speak in Marathi in front of him. He is seen telling her he gets irritated with the language and if she has the courage, she should speak in Hindi. HT contacted Kumar Sanu, but he refused to comment on the issue. In a tweet, Shiv Sena secretary and head of the party’s Chitrapat Sena Aadesh Bandekar said, “Bigg Boss showrunners and the person [Jaan Kumar Sanu] must immediately apologise to Maharashtra and the people of Maharashtra. The person should be immediately evicted [from the show]... Maharashtra government should withdraw shooting permission of those who indulge in defaming the state.” Shiv Sena spokesperson and legislator Pratap Sarnaik said the show was shot in Maharashtra and earns TRPs through the state and contestants who defame Marathi language will not be tolerated. “If the son of Kumar Sanu, who made his career living in Maharashtra, is disrespecting Marathi, it will not be tolerated,” Sarnaik said in a tweet. MNS film workers’ union chief Ameya Khopkar said the MNS would not allow Bigg Boss to be filmed if both Jaan and the channel did not apologise within 24 hours. “We will see how Jaan gets work in Mumbai. Anyone who hates Marathi should get out of Maharashtra.” Viacom 18 Media Private Limited, in the apology issued to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, said: “We hereby apologise if we have inadvertently hurt the feelings of the people of Maharashtra due to the broadcast of the same comment in relation to Marathi language.” After the statement, Sarnaik said they have accepted the apology and shown both Jaan and their channel “their place”, while Khopkar said he was not convinced and want them to apologise on their show. Later in the evening, Viacom 18 also tendered an apology to MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Marathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bollywood-singer-kumar-sanu-s-son-s-remarks-on-marathi-on-big-boss-show-upset-shiv-sena-mns/story-auZzaMbHdF1ckYw2qT3SRJ.html
29-10-2020||Delhi||Social distancing goes for a toss at Delhi’s markets in festive season||A security guard with a face shield screened with a thermal scanner every visitor entering a popular saree shop at the Lajpat Nagar central market and limited the number of clients to 10 at any given point of time, diligently keeping count on a register. Inside, a few people pulled their face masks down to their chin as they scanned through the shelves and negotiated over price. Outside, a crowd gathered as people waited for their turn to step inside.On a narrow pavement outside, people jostled for space with those waiting outside a nearby footwear shop and curious buyers surrounding more than a dozen street vendors in the vicinity, , most of them selling garments.Also Read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayAround 10 feet away, a loudspeaker mounted on an elevated police post blared: “Prevent yourself from Covid-19. Always wear a mask and maintain social distance”.Thousands of people thronged Delhi’s prominent markets on Wednesday for festive shopping weeks ahead of Diwali, visibly compromising with social distancing norms at a time when Covid-19 cases are again on the rise. Delhi on Wednesday reported 5,673 new cases — the maximum number in a single day so far since the first one was detected on March 2. On Wednesday, HT visited markets such as Sadar Bazar, Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Karol Bagh and saw scores of people looking for items ranging from garments to blankets, toys to kitchen utensils till late evening.“This year has been depressing. The festive season and buying gifts for loved ones are at least bringing us some joy. We are taking all necessary precautions,” said Geetanjali Sharma, a shopper at the Sarojini Nagar market.Shadab Aarif, a shopper in Sadar Bazar, said: “It is more out of necessity. Winter is coming. We will need blankets and warm clothes. This is a good time to avail of discounts.”PRECAUTIONS BY TRADERSWhile most shop owners imposed a cap on the maximum number of visitors, depending on the size of their enterprise, the crowd outside – on the streets, pavements and interconnected maze of lanes – swelled unabated. Amid the jostling, most shoppers, however, maintained they were taking all precautions.Traders expressed happiness that all economic restrictions related to the Covid-19 lockdown had been scrapped and business was recovering. But there is palpable anxiety over the risk in the light of potential transmission of the disease and the recent spike of cases in Delhi.“We ensured scaled-up surveillance. Police are deployed to ensure social distancing. Traders are required to ensure maximum cooperation,” said Sanjay Bhargava, president of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal.Devraj Baweja, general secretary of the confederation of Sadar Bazar traders’ association, said: “We urged the civic agencies to crack down on encroachment. Even if people try to ensure social distancing, there is hardly any space in the market for that. We requested the district administration to arrange an alternative parking site.Trader bodies are in talks over staggered hours in the festive season.”“The massive festive crowd is a big challenge. People letting their guard down have added to the challenge. We are doing a massive awareness drive,” said Ajay Bajaj, advisor to the Karol Bagh traders’ federation.Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of the traders’ association in Lajpat Nagar, said: “Other than ensuring that all norms such as sanitisation, wearing of masks and social distancing are followed, we deputed a team of 10 people to assist the police in crowd management.”ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTIONRevenue minister Kailash Gahlot said the government has undertaken an intensive awareness campaign in the light of the festive season. “The objective is to bring a behavioural change among people to arrest the spread of the disease. I appeal to people to always wear face masks and maintain social distancing norms at all costs.”In Delhi’s 11 revenue districts, special teams have been deployed at markets to help with the awareness campaigns and prosecute violators of guidelines.“It is a two-pronged approach. The first is to bring a behavioural change by making people aware of the efficiency of masks and measures such as social distancing. The second aspect is penalising violators. Market areas are witnessing gatherings and they remain a key focus area,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate (South Delhi).Neha Bansal, district magistrate (West Delhi), said all sub-divisional magistrates have been instructed to engage with market associations to ensure compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour. “We are particularly targeting younger people, which comprise a large chunk of the market footfall during festive season, in our campaigns.”From blocking access points to markets to distributing masks among people, the police too have taken a number of steps for crowd management.“After meetings with market federations, the 800-metre Pahari Dheeraj Road between Rani Jhansi Road and Sadar Bazar Thana Road has been made one-way for vehicular movement till Diwali. All shopkeepers and staffers are barred from parking their vehicles outside shops. They have been asked to use designated parking lots,” deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said. Similar arrangements have been made at the Chandni Chowk, Lahori Gate, and Kamla Nagar markets in north Delhi, Karol Bagh, Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, and Gandhi Nagar markets as well, the police said.“On the prosecution front, the police issue challans to people not wearing masks or maintaining social distance. The police distribute masks for free to people who are not able to afford them,” said Amit Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara). Deputy commissioner of police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said: “Shopkeepers are supposed to ensure social distancing and the use of masks by their customers.

29-10-2020||Delhi||Four AAP MLAs, other leaders booked after protest at Civic Centre||Four AAP MLAs and other party leaders were booked under various IPC sections after the police alleged that they manhandled a senior police officer and nine other personnel, including women constables, during a protest organised at the Civic Centre in central Delhi. The Aam Aadmi Party described the police action as a conspiracy.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said nearly 1,500 protesters led by Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s MCD incharge, and party MLAs assaulted ACP Anil Kumar and other police personnel when they were controlling the crowd.Besides Pathak, AAP legislators from Kondli, Mangolpuri, Model Town and Trilokpuri -- Kuldeep Monu, Rakhi Bidlan, Akhilesh Tripathi, and Rohit Mahliyan – and other organisers, have been named in the FIR, said DCP Bhatia. Pathak said, “The AAP was protesting against privatisation of sanitisation in Delhi by the SDMC. It was to save thousands of sanitation workers from being exploited by private players. But unfortunately, the BJP unleashed it’s Delhi Police against us. But we will continue our fight against what is wrong. We won’t be bogged by such intimidation tactics,” said Pathak.Earlier, AAP leaders and councillors staged a massive protest at the Civic Centre, headquarters of north and south civic bodies, to oppose a proposal by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to privatise some of its obligatory services such as sweeping and sanitation in Kakrola ward in southwest Delhi on a pilot basis. The proposal was later rejected in the standing committee meeting of the south corporation. Pathak said that the proposal to privatise sanitation services was rejected only because of stern opposition by the AAP. “Had this proposal been passed today (Wednesday), sanitisation employees would have been left on the mercy of private companies. Due to AAP’s strong opposition, the BJP-led SDMC had to reject the proposal,” Pathak said. Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in south corporation, said that there would be no privatisation of sanitation services or of any other obligatory functions of the corporation. He said that the proposal was prepared by the officials of the civic body, which has been rejected in the standing committee meeting on Wednesday.SCHEMES CLEAREDThe south civic body on Wednesday, however, cleared the draft proposal of installation of public e-bike/e-cycle (non-motorised) transportation sharing system in its jurisdiction and also approved the proposal to provide doorstep service to tax payers in filing online property tax through ‘mobile sahayaks’.According to civic officials, the move of providing public e-bike/e-cycle (non-motorised) sharing transportation facility will work on the lines of a similar system developed by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and aims to expand sustainable and environment friendly transport modes.Under the draft policy, the civic body through a private agency will provide the facility of e-bike/e-cycle from different locations in its jurisdiction to promote low-cost and environment friendly mobility option to city residents. The officials said that to avail this service, users will have to register on SDMC’s app and can rent the e-bike for a maximum duration of up to 10 hours within the SDMC area. As per policy document, users will be charged nominal fee against the use of e-bikes, which will be available at sheds set up across different locations in south corporation’s jurisdiction. Users will have to pay Rs 15 for up to 30 minutes while they have to pay Rs 20 for an hour. For two hours, users will have to pay Rs 40 and for three hours Rs 60. Beyond eight hours, users will have to pay Rs 250.“It is a draft policy, which is at a nascent stage. We will call tenders and finalise the private agency to run the scheme. It will take a few months to start the facility on ground,” a senior SDMC official said.He added that the locations of e-bike stations/sheds are yet to be finalised but it would be near commercial spaces, Metro stations, bus stops, offices and parks among others.In another move, the civic body approved a proposal to provide doorstep service to tax payers in filing online property tax through ‘mobile sahayaks’.SDMC officials said that the step was mooted after complaints from residents filling property tax through the updated online system. The move will also enhance property tax collection of the civic body, which “had not been satisfactory” this year.Under the “doorstep service of collection of property tax through mobile sahayaks” policy, residents will have to make a call on SDMC’s call centre to avail the service. The applicant will be then given a unique token number for the same. “It will work on the model of Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of services. A mobile sahayak, equipped with a tablet and internet connection, will then visit the resident of the applicant on a given date and time and help the user in filing the property tax. Users will have to pay a facilitation fee, which will be not more than Rs 135, after successful transaction of the tax amount to SDMC,” the official said.The deadline to roll out this scheme is January 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-aap-mlas-other-leaders-booked-after-protest-at-civic-centre/story-wTEclXCDWKDmisEHccQmTO.html
29-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Supreme Court dismisses Delhi Police’s appeal against bail to Devangana Kalita||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to set aside the bail granted to Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita, dismissing Delhi Police’s assertion that she is an influential person who can tamper with evidence.The Delhi high court on September 1 had granted bail to Kalita in one of the four cases filed against her by the Delhi Police over her alleged provocative speech as part of the widespread protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The police claimed that Kalita’s speech instigated women of a particular community during the February riots in north-east Delhi that preceded the visit of US President Donald Trump to India.Incidents of murder, attempt to murder that took place during the riots were also attributed to Kalita’s speech. A total of 53 persons including two policemen died during the riots while over 600 were injured.Dismissing police’s appeal against the HC’s bail order, the apex court bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah said, “It is only a grant of bail. She is not going to run away.” Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju arguing the appeal informed the court that the HC missed out to consider important evidence of witnesses in this case. The police claimed that Kalita is a resident of Assam while her husband resides in United Kingdom and she had no roots in the society.“She is an influential person and can tamper with evidence,” ASG Raju argued. The bench remained firm on its view. The bench remarked, “Being influential does not mean you won’t get bail. And if she tampers with evidence, you can always seek cancellation of bail. We are not inclined to interfere.”Even the Delhi high court order of September 1 was passed after going through the case records submitted by the police in a sealed cover. The HC found nothing on record to show that the alleged offences took place at the instance of the petitioner.Kalita, a student of Jawaharlal Nehru University, was represented in the apex court by senior advocate Kapil Sibal. He said, “She (Kalita) will not leave the country.” Despite the Supreme Court order, Kalita will remain in jail in connection with another FIR lodged against her under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Delhi HC had allowed Kalita to be released on bail in only one FIR on deposit of Rs 25,000 bail bond and surety of the like amount.Even before the HC, the Delhi Police had vehemently opposed Kalita’s bail plea. But the HC noted there was no need to allow the petitioner to suffer further “unnecessary harassment, humiliation and unjustified detention” considering the fact that persons similarly charged as Kalita in the FIR have not been arrested.The single judge of the HC had directed Kalita not to influence any witnesses in the case or tamper with evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-supreme-court-dismisses-delhi-police-s-appeal-against-bail-to-devangana-kalita/story-EpwP1l8zhSAyfDQKgRFHRK.html
29-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi launches anti-cracker campaign, 11 teams to crack down on polluting fireworks||To save Delhi from the annual air emergency caused by the bursting of crackers, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday launched an enforcement campaign ahead of Diwali to check the use of traditional, polluting firecrackers and to ensure only green and less polluting varieties are available this time. Rai said the anti-firecracker campaign will be launched from November 3, as part of which 11 special squads of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and Delhi Police will inspect firecracker manufacturing units and wholesale and retail shops to ensure polluting firecrackers are not sold. Rai urged Delhiites to avoid bursting crackers altogether this time. “I would request people to not burst crackers at all, but if your children are insisting and there is no other way, then we urge them to only use the green varieties,” Rai said at a press conference The minister said Delhi Police’s licensing wing will join hands with DPCC to strengthen enforcement against the manufacturing and sale of polluting firecrackers. “In these special teams, five environment marshals will be present to ensure an efficient crackdown. Only 93 licensed manufacturers are allowed to sell green crackers this time. We will upload this list on the DPCC website for the benefit of the public,” Rai said. In 2017, ahead of Diwali, the Supreme Court had put a temporary ban on the sale and purchase of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. In the last two years, however, the court had ordered that only low-emission and improved fireworks could be sold in Delhi, owing to concerns over rising air pollution. Residents were allowed to burst only green crackers between 8pm and 10pm. These green crackers are said to have 30% lower emission as compared to traditional fireworks. The noise levels are lower -- 125 decibels against 160 decibels in traditional ones. Narendra Gupta, president, fireworks and general traders association, Sadar Bazar, said they assured the government that all licensed traders from Sadar Bazar or Jama Masjid, two of Delhi’s biggest markets, will sell only green crackers this time. At least 60 varieties of green crackers are available this time against three last year. “Many cracker sellers have already moved away from the business because of the uncertainty over the last three years. We are only expecting some 10-12 licence requests this time from Sadar Bazar,” he said. In 2018 and 2019, despite the ban on the sale of crackers and due to the low availability of low-emission varieties —till last year only ‘phuljhari’ (sparklers), rocket and ‘anar’(flower pots) were available —pollution levels in the city saw a major spike after Diwali as people openly burst firecrackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-launches-anti-cracker-campaign-11-teams-to-crack-down-on-polluting-fireworks/story-KWJbuPTkUOQ830BCRC4KqO.html
29-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality to deteriorate briefly before improving||Delhi’s air on Wednesday felt the positive impact of strong winds that blew over the city the previous day, with pollution levels in the Capital improving to the ‘poor’ category for the first time in six days.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI) value on Wednesday was 297, down marginally from Tuesday’s 312. India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists explained that even though winds were calm on Wednesday, Delhi’s pollution cleared up significantly in the first half of the day because of the impact of Tuesday’s strong winds. Noon onwards, however, the air quality began to dip and the AQI settled just a few points short of the ‘very poor’ zone. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the average wind speed over Delhi was around 4kmph on Wednesday. “The wind speed was around 4kmph during the day, but calmed after sun down. The impact of this will be seen on Thursday as well. The wind speed will remain low and air quality will deteriorate, but remain in the very poor zone,” Srivastava said. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, also said air quality is likely to deteriorate further on Thursday. However, he predicted that the city’s air will improve significantly between Friday and Sunday, with wind speeds likely to touch 15kmph on Friday. “There is a trough formation, which will lead to a significant improvement in wind speed over the Capital and this will lead to better dispersion of pollutants. Till Sunday, the forecast is that we will see an improvement in air,” Soni said. Meanwhile, stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana continued to add to Delhi’s pollution on Wednesday. The Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said 1,830 fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday, contributing to 18% of the Capital’s PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-air-quality-to-deteriorate-briefly-before-improving/story-0tcy7Mp0KOaIpvDdbn63tO.html

29-10-2020||Mumbai||Most find flights safer than road, railways: Survey by Mumbai airport||In order to understand passenger requirements and patterns to travel during the pandemic phase, Mumbai airport conducted a survey and found out 99.8% passengers, who had flown in September, found air travel to be safer than bus and trains. The story also revealed that approximately 84.5% of passengers were more confident travelling by air. According to the findings, Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) is seeing a rise in passengers travelling to Goa, Uttarakhand and Kerala, as they are accepting travellers without Covid-19 test or registration. With the increase in passengers, the survey also revealed that 61.8% of passengers are ready to travel again in the coming month for leisure and business travel.Mumbai airport had first conducted this ‘restart feedback survey’ in August. The second phase of the restart feedback survey was conducted last month, with more than 1,000 participants.The airport operator said that the survey conducted by CSMIA revealed a boost in passenger confidence towards air travel. “With the ease in restrictions and state borders being opened in the country, Mumbaiites have welcomed the relaxation in norms by starting to travel for business and leisure,” said a senior Mumbai airport official. “In a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19, CSMIA has been adhering to governmental norms and regulations specifically around the permitted number of flight movements per day. Between May and September, the increase in the permitted flights per day has resulted in an increase in passenger traffic at the airport. After months of lockdown and remote working, the relaxation of state quarantine norms for travellers has been well received by corporates. The survey conducted by the airport revealed a revival in business and leisure travel of passengers travelling through CSMIA,” added the official. A senior airport official said the airport also recorded rising interest and comfort of passengers in availing food and beverage services onsite.According to CSMIA, the study showed 11.1% increase in passengers availing food and beverage services at the airport from July to September. “Passengers have shared positive feedback highlighting their comfort in visiting the food outlets at the airport. It was also revealed that there is an increase of passenger confidence in shopping at the airport,” said an airport official.CSMIA officials said that 84.2% of passengers gave the airport a five-star rating, on a scale of one to five, for its overall airport safety and hygiene experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/most-find-flights-safer-than-road-railways-survey-by-mumbai-airport/story-6USgLWWaoH9W2Hr7sv7BDP.html
29-10-2020||Pune||On ventilator for 15 days, 54-yr-old recovers from abdominal TB and gets a new liver in Pune||Pune: A 54-year-old man from Baramati, suffering from liver failure and abdominal tuberculosis (TB), recovered successfully after a liver transplant. Suffering from end-stage liver disorder, the patient was brought to the hospital in an unconscious condition. After being on ventilator support for over two weeks and undergoing a transplant, son being the donor, the man has recovered, according to hospital authorities. Doctors had been following up with the patient, Jaylaxman Bichkar, for over two months. He was admitted to Ruby Hall Clinic with multiple complications. Dr Vinit Shah, gastroenterologist and hepatologist from the hospital, said, “This was a rare case of recovery where he was suffering from both liver sclerosis and abdominal TB at the same time. He was brought unconscious to the hospital and we had to put him on a ventilator immediately. For around fifteen days, he was on a ventilator. He then recovered a little and we then operated on him.”His son became a living donor for his father. Requesting anonymity, he said, “My father was unwell for around a month before we approached the hospital. He was having sleeplessness and acidity. He had also lost weight and became weak. When the doctors diagnosed that he is suffering from liver failure and needs to undergo a liver transplant, we were worried. Initially, my father was reluctant for any surgery. But later, he agreed, when I showed the willingness to donate liver for him. Post-surgery we are seeing a huge difference in his health. I am happy that he is able to live a life that he was living before surgery.”Dr Shah said, “First, we started his treatment for TB and when he was stabilised from that, we performed a liver transplant on him.”Dr Sachin Palnitkar, city-based hepatologist, said, “These cases are challenging too. In some cases, it is seen that TB tablets lead to liver failure. But in such cases, the end result is fruitful if a liver transplant is done. Post liver transplant immunosuppressant drugs are given. Managing TB cases with immunosuppressant drugs is a challenging task because it has to be ensured that TB does not become resistant to drugs. Hence, modification of TB treatment and healthy recovery post-transplant is challenging in such cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-ventilator-for-15-days-54-yr-old-recovers-from-abdominal-tb-and-gets-a-new-liver-in-pune/story-5bH9ANVJuZYLx2boBw3UjM.html
29-10-2020||Pune||Eight months on, 500 Pune villages have not reported a single Covid case||Pune: Around 500 villages surrounding Pune district have managed to keep the deadly SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, at bay. The villages have not reported a single case since the past eight month since the first case in the state and the district was reported on March 9. The villagers have been able to keep away the virus by following all norms. These villages are small with a population of not more than 2,000-3,000 and are located in the interiors. The efforts by the villagers have ensured that the virus does not enter their homes. Ayush Prasad, CEO of Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “Of the 1,400 villages, currently over 1,000 do not have any active cases and of those 500 have not had a single virus case. It has now been proven that the cases in rural Pune were somehow linked to the city. So, now when the cases in Pune city are coming down, eventually the cases in rural Pune are declining. These 500 villages had nominal floating population to Pune city and so there was no way for the infection to spread to the interiors.” Some of the initiatives taken by the villages included complete shutdown of the market by ensuring that essentials are provided door to door. The villagers also made sure that de-sanitisation takes place at least two times daily, an awareness committee was formed in every village which included the sarpanch and government officials, door-to-door survey which has been done about 5-6 times till now with the help of anganwadi members, those entering the villages were kept a watch and shops were kept shut with mutual consent with the shopkeepers. Pune rural has reported a total of 73,524 Covid cases as of Tuesday, of which 1,921 deaths were reported which took the case fatality rate to 2.61%. These cases were reported from gram panchayats, municipal councils and the three cantonments.

The family then approached police and a case was registered. Police said the family is suspecting that the incident took place between October 21, when she was admitted, and October 27, when she gained consciousness. The victim is still under treatment at the hospital.According to police, the survivor is a resident of Mahendragarh and was taken to the hospital after she complained of breathing issues. Police said she is undergoing treatment for tuberculosis and was in isolation in a private room of the ICU when the incident took place. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (HQ), said the father of the patient went to meet her on Tuesday, and she tried to convey him through written messages that she was raped. “The hospital conducted an investigation internally and we were informed by the family members (about the alleged crime), following which we have registered a case under section 376 (2) (E) of Indian Penal Code at Sushant Lok police station. We have identified the suspect but are yet to arrest him,” she said. Kundu said the woman uttered the name Vikas to her father and that is how they identified the suspect, who is a non-medical, outsourced staffer. Kundu said they have recovered CCTV footage and questioned the staff deployed in the ward. “It was found that the suspect is outsourced and is non-medical staff. We are verifying all the details before arresting the suspect,” she said. Police said the survivor is unfit to record her statement and she was put on ventilator the day after admission.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said, “A board of doctors from the civil hospital had conducted a medical investigation on Wednesday and police protection has been provided to the patient in the hospital.” The father of the woman questioned how a male staff was attending to his daughter. “My daughter was raped while being in hospital. This is a breach of patient security and safety,” he said.Fortis Hospital said in a statement: “(The) Patient came to the hospital on 21st October 2020 with severe respiratory symptoms and pulmonary tuberculosis. She was admitted in ICU, and from the second day of her admission, she is on ventilator support. Six days after admission, the patient has alleged that she has been violated within the hospital premises on the day of admission. Post complaint, police have been immediately informed.
