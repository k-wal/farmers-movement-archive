25-10-2020||City||Grit and inspiration: Delhi govt school students ace NEET JEE||New Delhi: Tamanna Goyal, 20, a resident of Shahbad Dairy, wanted to study medicine after being inspired by her mother, who works at a private clinic for a Rs 6,000 a month. Goyal, who graduated from the Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Rohini’s Sector 11 Rohini cleared the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) this year and ranked 173rd overall and 11th in the EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) category. “Though the way the health care workers were treated during the Covid-19 pandemic and the risks they were exposed to briefly did make me question my choice, eventually, I knew I had to serve as a doctor,” she said. Goyal was among the 20 students from Delhi’s government schools who cleared the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and NEET entrance tests and met chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and education minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday. Goyal said she was “excited to meet the CM and deputy CM.” “During our interaction, the students were each talking about their journey in front of top officials of the education department. It made me very emotional and reminded me of my own struggles and I broke down. The CM and deputy CM encouraged me to excel. Several other students have been inspired and approached us for our notes and guidance,” said Goyal, who wishes to study at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Around 569 students from Delhi government schools, of whom 379 are girls, qualified for NEET this year, 443 cleared the JEE Mains and 53 cleared the JEE Advanced, becoming eligible for admissions to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) across the country. Of the 1,597,433 candidates who registered for NEET this year, the government said around 85-90% students appeared for the exams. Of 858,000 applicants for JEE Mains, 635,000 had appeared for the engineering test from September 1 to 6. Kejriwal and Sisodia congratulated the students and their parents for their performance despite the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. “Our contribution to the service of the nation must not stop. This is a long journey and many people have worked hard to reach this stage. Our dream is ‘Shikshit Rashtra, Samarth Rashtra.’ We will only be able to strengthen our nation through a strong education system... I would also like to request you all to guide your juniors, take responsibility for at least 10 children from families just like you, and explain to them the significance of NEET-JEE. When you become a doctor or an engineer, please work with all honesty and dedication,” Sisodia said. Kejriwal praised the students for their achievements, since many of them did not take coaching for the medical and engineering entrance exams. “It is a general perception that no one can clear NEET-JEE exams without coaching. I took coaching, my son and my daughter took coaching, but the students sitting here clearing the exams without coaching is commendable. Every child sitting here is a diamond, equipped with so much raw intelligence. This is not the end, this is a single innings and you have to go a long way,” he said. The CM also requested the Delhi education department to start providing coaching to NEET-JEE aspirants. “I also want to request the education department to start providing coaching to the aspirants so that more and more school students qualify for the exams and the existing students also perform well,” he said. Himanshi, a former student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Nand Nagri, ranked 1,181st in NEET. “It has been challenging — especially during the pandemic. But the toughest phase is when you think to yourself that you will not be able to crack the exam. Once we get past that phase, we can always succeed. I wanted to be a doctor because if we can save a life, there is nothing more that we can want from your life,” said the teenager, whose father works as a driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/grit-and-inspiration-delhi-govt-school-students-ace-neet-jee/story-jPmv6kEUqpBtSeEO72nSXK.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Despite economic slowdown, registration of new vehicles up by 28% on Dussehra in Mumbai||Despite the economic crisis amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the registration of the new vehicles on the occasion of Dussehra saw a significant rise in the city and across Maharashtra, as compared to the registrations last year during the festival.A total of 599 new vehicles were registered across city’s four Regional Transport Offices (RTO) on Sunday over last year’s registration of 469 on the day of Dussehra. The city has witnessed 28% rise in registrations of vehicles this year.Registrations of the new four and two-wheeler vehicles are done at Tardeo, Wadala, Andheri and Borivli RTOs. Tardeo office registered 160 new vehicles on Sunday against 41 last year on Dussehra, while Wadala saw the registration of 170 vehicles against last year’s number of 42. At Andheri RTO, 241 registration were reported against last Dussehra’s number of 192. However, the Borivli transport office has been the exception to the trend as it registered only 28 vehicles as opposed to 194 vehicles registered last year.Among the new vehicles registered, two-wheelers’ number was significant with six at Tardeo, 127 at Wadala, 150 at Andheri and 21 at Borivli.Transport experts have attributed the rise in the registration to non-availability of local trains in the wake of the lockdown imposed amid Covid-19 pandemic. “People are buying more two-wheelers because of the non-availability of local trains and the Covid situation. They have no choice, apart from buying individual mode of transport. This could be harmful in the future as pollution levels could rise. But there is no alternative available for them in the current situation,” said transport expert AV Shenoy.“There has been an increase in vehicle registrations in nearly all the RTOs comparing last year’s Dussehra. The rise appears to be high because there was a significant dip in vehicle registrations the previous year,” said senior RTO official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-economic-slowdown-registration-of-new-vehicles-up-by-28-on-dussehra-in-mumbai/story-hm2uWTsiLd0CEzAvRVuMrI.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC comes up with SOP after 3 gas leak incidents in Mumbai||Following three incidents of a mysterious gas leak reported in Mumbai over the past one year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now mobilised agencies like fire brigade and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to collect air samples if such incident is reported in future. The BMC has prepared a standard operating procedure (SOP) to chalk out roles of different response agencies during a gas leak. The SOP is yet to be finalised by the municipal commissioner.In the past one year, three incidents of the mysterious gas leak have been reported in Mumbai, putting Mumbaikars in a frenzy, as its source has still not been identified. The only aspect which is common between all three incidents is that majority of the complaints which poured in are from the same set of areas (Chembur, Ghatkopar, Bhandup, Vikhroli, Mulund), the eastern suburbs. During the probe of these incidents, there were some key decisions made that stated that all companies dealing with hazardous materials should intimate about their functioning to the disaster management cell and fire brigade. Secondly, the transportation of the chemicals needs to be informed beforehand to the concerned authorities depending on their locations and that there should be specific timings for the transportation of hazardous chemicals within the city. A strict tracking and monitoring of vehicles carrying such materials were also decided. All of this is being included in the new SOP.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (disaster management), said, “The NDRF has the equipment to collect air samples, however, the fire brigade will procure the same equipment to be ready for another such gas leak. The samples could be tested which would narrow down our search. As per complaints, the gas leak has not stayed for more than 15 minutes in the air which is why it has been difficult to detect the source of the leak.” For starters, the plan is to set up these sample collecting units one each in the island city, eastern and western suburbs.Rakesh Kumar, director of CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI), said, “Since it’s not a continuous foul smell, it’s difficult to detect its source. But there should be a mapping of all residential and commercial pockets in areas where these complaints are frequent. Then, we need to map all smaller storage where chemicals are kept to find out if any illegal activities are being carried out.”Despite the denial of leakage by several petrochemical factories located in Chembur, a probe set up into finding the source of the gas leak by the BMC stood inconclusive. The probe panel included experts from IIT, Fire Brigade, NDRF, University Institute of Chemical Technology (UICT) and petro-chem representatives.There are multiple theories behind this mysterious gas leak. One of the most prominent theories is that a tanker carrying chemicals to or from one of the several petrochemical factories in Chembur could have leaked while it was passing through the eastern suburbs. A senior official from the Mumbai Fire Brigade said, “There is a chemical odorant (ethyl mercaptan) that is added to cooking gas so that it’s easy to detect leaks since the gas is otherwise odourless. The odourant is transported through vehicles which could have leaked accidentally. There was another speculation of gases emanating from sewer lines which is unlikely.”The first such incident was reported in September last year wherein 47 complaints were made to the disaster management cell. Following that in June, a similar incident was reported and a pharma company in Govandi was believed to have been the source, but it was soon ruled out following an investigation by the fire brigade department in the firm’s premises and the nearby areas.On October 17, BMC received seven complaints about foul odour, akin to a gas leak, from parts of Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Govandi and Bhandup, Mulund, Bhandup, and Powai. However, the BMC could not find the source of the leak and categorised it as an ‘unknown foul smell’. During all three incidents, authorities had alerted the petrochemical factories, mostly located in Chembur, to check their premises but no leak was reported by them. Experts and BMC officials have finally hinted that a sample collection of the foul smell is the only hope to detect the source of the mysterious gas leak incidents in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-comes-up-with-sop-after-3-gas-leak-incidents-in-mumbai/story-bHq7MrHaBTXrHI8W0XXDPI.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Two booked for robbery at Mumbai’s Bandra||In a day light robbery, a Ghatkopar resident was thrashed by two men at Bandra (West) on Saturday at 3pm. The robbers assaulted the victim and threatened him at knife point and took away his wallet and mobile phone on the busy SV Road at Lucky Hotel junction. Bandra police arrested one of the accused and are looking for his accomplice. The arrested accused is identified as Jitu Badan, 27, a resident of Vile Parle. According to police, the complainant, Kumar Siddhi Koli, was accosted by the accused at the bus stop near the hotel. Badan and his accomplice stopped Koli, flashed a knife at him and demanded that he hand over his valuables. An officer from Bandra police station said, “When Koli tried to flee, the accused grabbed him by his shirt and started threshing him. Thereafter they took his mobile phone and wallet, and fled from the spot.” Koli approached Bandra police, following which a case was registered under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, and Badan was nabbed. Police recovered the wallet from Badan. The other wanted accused allegedly has the knife and the complainant’s mobile phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-booked-for-robbery-at-mumbai-s-bandra/story-3lWq1IaEnd8rabHeHCAaHP.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Lower courts need to grant bails to reduce pendency in courts, avoid overcrowding in prisons, say experts||Over a period of time the golden rule of jurisprudence of bail — bail is a rule and jail an exception — has almost been reversed when it comes to lower courts. Legal experts feel this is because the magistrates and judges of lower courts fear criticism from higher judiciary as well as on social media. As on October 25, 4,228,774 cases were pending in Maharashtra courts of which 2,944,123 are criminal cases. The numbers also portray the grim situation in prisons. “The data collected regarding prison population in India represents a grim scenario. It indicates that 67% of the prison population is awaiting trial in India. Inconsistency in bail system may be one of the reasons for over-crowding of prisons across the country, giving rise to another set of challenges to the prison administration and state,” reads the report of the law commission of India dated May 2017.In its conclusion, the commission clearly stated, “Unnecessary pre-trial confinement should be minimised. Confinement is detrimental to the person accused of an offence who is kept in custody, imposes unproductive burden on the state, and can have an adverse impact on future criminal behaviour, and its reformative perspectives will stand diminished.” “It must be noted that 78% of the convicts are in prison for offences punishable with imprisonment of 7 years and above; whereas 57% of the undertrials are in prison on an average for 3-6 months,” reads the report. More than three years since the report, there has been hardly any changes in the lower judiciary — especially magistrate’s courts — which are still reluctant in exercising their power under section 437 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) which deals with bail. Former Supreme Court judge justice BN Srikrishna said, “As far as law is concerned, ‘bail but not jail’ is the rule. This should be the rule. Bail is a conditional order. I allow you to move around and not send you to jail provided you will attend the court, not tamper with evidence. Bail is not a punishment. In giving bail, the courts should access the facts such as if the accused can run away or tamper evidence or if he or she will not take part in the investigation. The judges ought to follow this rule. Otherwise, it’s unfair.” “It has to be seen when a person can be granted bail,” said former Supreme Court judge justice Arjan Kumar Sikri. “If you don’t grant bail, it is a human rights issue. If he is entitled to bail, and if he remains inside the prison for even a day or two, you have deprived him of his personal liberty. One has to be very sensitive in deciding these applications and they have to do their duties fearlessly. If you feel a person is entitled to bail you should not shy away from doing that. This is the ethos of our constitution and Criminal Procedure code,” said justice Sikri. Narrating his experiences as the judge of the Apex court justice Sikri said, “It has been seen that many times, particularly when either the cases are controversial or delicate or political in nature or where there can be an outburst, the tendency in the lower courts is why should we do it, let the person take it from the high court or Supreme Court.” Justice Sikri further said that the jurisprudence of bail is that the person is not to be treated as guilty. He further explained that at this time what is to be seen is if the person will participate in the investigation, will not flee, and will not try to win over or terrorise the witnesses. “If these things are taken care of, the person should be given bail. Of course, there are exceptions where the charges of very serious or grave in nature such as murder,” he added. However, justice Sikri said that judges do come under pressure from not only media but also social media. “The judges are given protection so that they can perform their task fearlessly, objectively and impartially, and there should be independence. Once these are safe guarded, they should not fear. High courts have to step in and provide a clear picture to lower judiciary that ‘do not worry, we are not going to take action unnecessarily’,” said justice Sikri while suggesting that high courts come forward and play the role of a guardian. Former Bombay high court judge justice Abhay Thipsay, who began his career first as a magistrate, said, “People are afraid of giving bail. There have been instances where actions have been taken rightly or wrongly on judges for granting bail. There is no reverse example. There is a need to create a reverse fear, whereby a judge needs to answer on why a person is kept under detention for such a long time.” Thipsay said, “Sometimes bail orders are suspected, and it affects the career of the judges. But sometimes, absolutely without any evidence, if a judge keeps on remanding an accused for months together without granting bail to the accused, the high court has to play a role. Also social media brings added pressure these days.” Two former judges of Bombay high court who refused to be named opined that lower judicial officials are reluctant in granting bail for several reasons. One of the factors is fear of adverse remarks in their annual report card or a discreet enquiry against them. They also said that opinions reflected on social media bring added pressure on them. Judicial officials also expressed fear that there can be a reverse effect on the person if he is not granted bail and kept in jail with hardened criminals. Further, not granting bail not only results in overcrowding in prisons but also adds additional burdens on the higher judiciary as the accused would ultimately have to move further up for his release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lower-courts-need-to-grant-bails-to-reduce-pendency-in-courts-avoid-overcrowding-in-prisons-say-experts/story-1KJk8vkDUvKcsrxgnhp2AJ.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Arrested accused wanted to mobilise youth through photo exhibitions on mob lynchings||Ahead of the Bhima Koregaon incident in January 2018, one of the accused – Arun Fereira – had suggested holding photo exhibitions for students on the subjects of mob lynching and Hindu militant uprising. According to a charge sheet filed earlier this month by the National Investigative Agency (NIA), this was to mobilise the youth. The NIA charge sheet, running into 10,000 pages, was filed against eight accused who were arrested by the agency. The accused include Dr Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha, Hanybabu Musaliyavirtil Tarayil, Fr Stan Swamy and three members of Kabir Kala Manch – Jyoti Raghoba Jagtap, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor. The agency has also shown one of the members – Milind Teltumbde as wanted in the case. Previously, Maharashtra Police had arrested nine accused – Sudhir Dhawale, Mahesh Raut, Soma Sen, Surendra Gadling, Rona Jacob Wilson, Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Fereira and Vernon Gonsalves. In the charge sheet, the NIA had added several letters recovered from the accused discussed strategies to mobilise more support from student organisations from Mumbai, Pune and Delhi through various activities. A letter dated December 23, 2017, addressed to ‘Comrade Prakash,’ stated that “as instructed by CC in previous letters, we have ramped up our campaign to engage with students across a much wider spectrum”. The letter further appreciated the efforts made by Fereira for engaging with student unions. “Arun [Fereira ] is engaging with various student unions on a regular basis and has come up with many creative initiatives to propagate our agendas,” the letter allegedly mentioned. It added that Fereira had suggested holding photo/cartoon exhibitions on the subjects of mob lynching and Hindu militant uprisings. “This can be organised with the help of Umar across many schools and colleges across Mumbai, Pune and Delhi, and gradually in more cities,” read the letter. In another letter dated September 25, 2017, addressed to ‘Comrade Surendra’ by Prakash, the author mentioned strategies of infiltrating student groups in detail. “We must intensify protests using students. State forces will be soft against students, which will gradually put the state at a disadvantage while acting against us,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-arrested-accused-wanted-to-mobilise-youth-through-photo-exhibitions-on-mob-lynchings/story-TFdW59jap6BmT7PXoCvNhI.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||NCB arrests 5 including TV actor Preetika Chauhan in drugs case||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) busted another module of drug supply and arrested a total of five people including television actor Preetika Chauhan and a Tanzanian national on Saturday from Mumbai. Chauhan was arrested while buying drugs in Versova while the Tanzanian national was held with cocaine from south Mumbai. The three other arrested are drug peddlers from whom NCB has seized charas, MDMA and methamphetamine. All five arrested accused were produced in the court on Sunday and granted judicial custody till November 8. Chauhan was involved only in consumption of drugs while others are interconnected with each other for distribution. Chauhan has worked in TV serials like Savdhaan India and Devo Ke Dev Mahadev. Following a tip-off, NCB officers in plain clothes were deployed at three places — one in south Mumbai and two places in Versova — on Saturday. In the first trap, NCB officers nabbed Bruno John Ngwale from Mohammad Ali Road in Masjid Bunder area and seized 4 gram cocaine from him. After an inquiry, the second team of NCB laid a trap in Versova and arrested Rohit Hire and seized 4.4 gram ecstasy, 1.88 gram MDMA from him, said NCB officers. After questioning Hire, another NCB team intercepted a vehicle and seized 325 gram marijuana, 32 gram charas, and 0.5 gram methamphetamine along with ₹12,990 cash, and arrested drug supplier Deepak Rathod, added the officer. After questioning Rathod, NCB officers laid a trap near Machhimar in Versova and nabbed Faisal Shaikh with 99 gram marijuana. Chauhan was also nabbed from the spot while buying drugs from Shaikh. During inquiry, Shaikh revealed that he had sourced the contraband from Deepak Rathod, a resident of Versova. NCB officials are probing every possible link of the accused in the case including suppliers, peddlers and consumers. Further inquiry is going on, said an NCB officer. This comes in the wake of the ongoing drug investigation after Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. NCB registered a case against Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and others and arrested a total of 24 accused so far including Chakraborty and her brother Showik. Many Bollywood celebrities also came into NCB’s radar during the probe. Actors Deepika Padukone, Shraddha Kapoor, Rakul Preet Singh and Sara Ali Khan were questioned in NCB office last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-arrests-5-including-tv-actor-preetika-chauhan-in-drugs-case/story-HzjXv1eQ6IL5M55Jb01X8L.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||2 arrested by Mumbai Police for illegally transferring ₹97.16 lakh from co-operative bank’s account||Amboli police recently arrested two men for allegedly illegally transferring ₹97.16 lakh from Mogaveera Co-operative Bank’s account. The accused managed to get user name and password of a bank official from the Kandivli branch, and used them to transfer ₹97.16 lakh to another account. The arrested accused, identified as Vineet Singh, 32, a resident of Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Rohit Singh, 33, a resident of Nallasopara. An officer from Amboli police station said, “On September 28, staff from the bank’s IT department informed the assistant general manager (AGM) that he has noticed six suspicious transactions which occurred on September 27 through which ₹68.85 lakh was transferred.” The IT department further informed him that these transactions had occurred through the bank’s account number and not from any customer’s account. “During an internal inquiry, the bank came to know that someone had used the user name and password of their Kandivli branch’s staff,” the officer said. On September 28 and 29, two more illegal transactions were made. A total of eight illegal transactions were done to withdraw ₹97.16 lakh from the bank, after which bank officials approached Amboli police and filed a complaint against unknown persons.“Following the bank’s complaint, we registered a first information report (FIR) under section 420 [cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property] of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 66 (c) [punishment for identity theft], 66 (d) [punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resource] of the Information Technology (IT) Act,” said the police officer.During the investigation, police discovered that Rohit’s bank account was used in the crime, following which a police team reached Nallasopara and arrested him. Later, police found out about Vineet’s role in the crime, and he was subsequently arrested from UP. “We are investigating about how they got their hands on the user name and password of the bank employee, and where they transferred all the money to,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-arrested-by-mumbai-police-for-illegally-transferring-97-16-lakh-from-co-operative-bank-s-account/story-fzhMcznAiGFFAXAWBcf4FK.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid-19 CFR at 4%, lower than August||As Mumbai crossed 10,000 Covid-19 deaths on Friday, the Covid-19 cumulative case fatality rate (CFR) now stands at 4%, which is considerably less than the city’s peak at 5.6% in July and August, but still more than in March and April (3.2% to 3.6%), the initial months of the pandemic outbreak. Experts say a drop in CFR is a good sign, but it needs to go below 0.5% or at least below 1%. Mumbai’s CFR is highest in the state and much above the state’s 2.63%. Officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said the civic body is focusing on reducing CFR. The relatively lower cumulative CFR in March and April has been attributed to non-reporting of many Covid deaths by hospitals in the first few months. Later in June, and July, BMC and the state government reconciled these death figures and added over 1,000 deaths to the cumulative toll, in various phases. Dr Shashank Joshi, a senior member of the Maharashtra government’s task force set up to control CFR, said, “I have always been concerned about our CFR. We have to aim to get our case fatality rate below 0.5% and 1%.” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department, said, “We are closely monitoring fatalities. After launching Mission Save Lives, the death rate has come down, but we are doing more.” On June 30, BMC launched Mission Save Lives, a nine-point programme to curb fatality due to Covid-19 in the city. Mumbai crossed 1,000 deaths on May 25, with a fatality rate of 3.2%. Mumbai’s deaths crossed the 2,000-mark on June 12, with a CFR of 3.6% and 5000 on July 8, with a CFR of 5.6%. Dr Joshi said, “There was some non-reporting of deaths in the earlier months. [If we add those numbers now] the CFR will come up to 4% or 5% even for those months. I don’t think our mortality has changed much. It has remained more or less on the same plateau.” Going by month-wise data of number of deaths after reconciled figures from June, CFR in March was around 9%, in April, May and June it was over 5%, and in July and August it was over 4%. According to BMC data from October 9, given out in a presentation called ‘Raise 2020’, the civic body over time, reduced preventable deaths in Mumbai, by improvement in hospital availability, and clarity in patient treatment. Also, BMC observed that deaths in patients below 60 years of age also have reduced. Dr Joshi said, “We need to aggressively destigmatise Covid. In Mumbai, people are treating themselves and going to doctors late which lead to high chances of death. The tests are not done on time. It is time that we seriously took care of Covid, especially in the vulnerable groups.” According to BMC, the most prevalent co-morbidities in patients who have died due to Covid-19 are hypertension and diabetes. Dr Joshi said, “At least 15% of the city’s population has hypertension and 30% has diabetes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-19-cfr-at-4-lower-than-august/story-pa2IXcPEGgdldOzEgco4KM.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: After initial arrests, CPI (Maoist) leaders began looking for moles||Soon after the arrest of the first set of members of the CPI (Maoist) by Maharashtra Police in June, based on information gathered through several leaked letters, the core members decided to probe if moles had infiltrated the group. The charge sheet filed by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) includes a letter written on July 4, 2018, by ‘Chandrashekhar’ to ‘Comrade VV’ discussing strategies and steps to be taken after the first arrests made in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case. On June 6, police had arrested five accused – Sudhir Dhawale, lawyer Surendra Gadling, activists Mahesh Raut and Shoma Sen and Rona Wilson. “However, the point of great concern is how exactly was it leaked? By whose intelligence? We need to put efforts to understand the full scale of this breach, including methods used by intelligence agencies. We also need to critically review our MO structures to periodically screen out any moles that may have infiltrated our ranks,” read the letter, which also mentioned steps which need to be taken for reviewing the internal structure as well as communication channels and for further damage control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-after-initial-arrests-cpi-maoist-leaders-began-looking-for-moles/story-DlPbWAs427sbKetKYy6OHI.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police arrest 10th accused in TRP scam||The crime branch of the Mumbai Police on Sunday arrested the 10th accused Abhishek Bhajandas Kolawade alias Amit alias Ajit, who worked as a vendor for television channels, as part of its investigation into allegations of rigged television rating points (TRP). Kolewade was wanted as an accused and the Mumbai crime branch was searching him for the last 10 days. He changed his name and was staying in Karnataka and later Goa.Kolawade surrendered before the crime branch on Sunday evening on the advice of his advocate KH Giri. Kolawade used multiple mobile numbers registered using forged documents, including two in the name of arrested accused Umesh Mishra, said inspector Sachin Vaze of the crime branch.“Earlier, we had arrested his close associate Harish Patil from Chandivali in Powai who was also working as a vendor, and Ramji Varma and Dinesh Vishwakarma, former employees of Hansa Research Private Limited. After questioning them, we learnt that Kolawade used to make payments to them for rigging viewership figures in favour of television channels,” the said crime branch officer.“Kolawade will be confronted with Varma and Vishwakarma for further leads in the investigation. Varma, Vishwakarma and Patil are in police custody till October 26,” said Vaze. Meanwhile, the crime branch has summoned CEOs of Maha Movie channel, Sandeep Varma and Amit Dave to be present at the crime branch office on Monday to join the investigation, said a crime branch officer.“During the inquiry, we learnt that Patil had registered seven companies under various addresses in Mumbai, all in his name. It appears all seven companies were dummy firms and were used for financial transactions by channels. We are investigating the veracity of these companies and their links with channels and their financial transactions,” said Vaze. The authenticity of the seven firms was in doubt since the crime branch had found that a firm owned by Patil, named Capslock Digital Solution Private Limited, was a dummy entity. “We found there was no company registered to the given address,” said Vaze.One of the five suspected channels had deposited money in Capslock Digital Solution, and Kolawade had withdrawn the amount and distributed it to others, including the arrested accused Umesh Mishra. The money was later given to households where barometers were installed, to increase TRP, added the crime branch officer. The alleged TRP scam came to light after the ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a police complaint alleging certain channels that it suspected were rigging TRPs to attract advertisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-arrest-10th-accused-in-trp-scam/story-TpXel8kd5wUsiUPBksv0MN.html
25-10-2020||Noida||Noida: PVVNL lodges over 800 power theft cases in six months||Since April this year, the power discom Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) has lodged 814 electricity theft cases in Gautam Budh Nagar at its exclusive anti-theft police station in Sector 63. PVVNL (Noida division) chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said the FIRs in these cases were lodged under sections 135 and 158B of the Electricity Act, 2003. “We withdraw the FIRs once the offenders pay the fine imposed by PVVNL,” he said. He also said after the establishment of power theft police station, the raiding team does not need to send a requisition for police force in advance, particularly raiding the areas falling under rural feeders. “We immediately take the force available at anti-theft police station and conduct raids. Section 135 of the Act is imposed against a person who taps or makes any illegal connection or tampers a meter or uses electricity in an unauthorised manner. A case under Section 158B is lodged against a person who illegally connects any meter with another’s electric line or connects it to any line for the purpose of communicating without licence or maliciously injures any meter,” he said. He said after the establishment of this anti-power theft police station, there was a big rise in the revenue recovery of the PVVNL. “Since April 1 (fiscal 2020-210), we have collected revenue of over ₹50 crore,” he said. Arun Kumar Singh, SHO of power anti-power theft police station, said, “While over 600 cases are registered under Section 135, the remaining cases have been lodged for illegal connection. We have already filed the charge-sheet in more than 100 cases.” He said that since the establishmen of anti-power theft police station in September this year, over 1,500 cases of power pilferage had been registered there. The Uttar Pradesh government decided to set up exclusive anti-electricity theft police stations in every district of state to address cases of power theft. Of the 75 such police stations, 63 are operational. The government has also raised the number of enforcement teams from 33 to 88 to launch a crackdown against those involved in power pilferage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-pvvnl-lodges-over-800-power-theft-cases-in-six-months/story-x2oDNVvoUPRhVX4cisycAL.html

The fire was reported in a shop on the second floor of City Centre mall at 8.53pm on Thursday, as level 1 (small) fire. It soon spread to other floors and MFB declared it a brigade call — level 5 — at 2.42am. The mall is a ground-plus-three-storey structure with around 300 to 400 shops on each floor. An official from MFB said, “Since there are many combustible items in many shops in the mall, such as mobile phone batteries, chargers and wires, cooling operations were underway on Sunday. But the fire was extinguished at 5.08am.” On Saturday, a sixth fireman was hospitalised at BYL Nair Hospital due to suffocation while fire-fighting. Earlier on Friday, five firemen including a deputy fire officer were admitted due to suffocation.After midnight on Friday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Mumbai Police evacuated around 3,500 residents living in the adjacent 55-storey Orchid Enclave due to thick smoke from the fire. On Saturday night, MFB gave a go ahead to these residents to begin moving back into their homes. However, MLA from Mumbadevi constituency, Amin Patel, said, “Residents were still scared and did not move in on Sunday. They will begin to move in on Monday morning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fire-at-south-mumbai-mall-extinguished-after-56-hours-cooling-operations-on/story-RGC3Bn8ob6IOMGkzmWJ86O.html
25-10-2020||Noida||Two fire incidents in Noida, no casualty||Noida: Two incidents of fire were reported in the city over the past 24 hours. However, no casualties were reported in either of the incidents, fire officials said.On Sunday morning, a call was made to the fire department around 5.15am about a massive fire at a printing ink manufacturing firm in A block of Sector 63.“The ink contained a solvent which is highly flammable. The drums in which the ink was kept were bursting due to the pressure which made the fire worse. The three buildings surrounding the firm were also at very high risk of getting burnt. It took 12 fire tenders nearly two hours to bring the fire under control and keep the damage to a minimum,” said Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire officer (CFO). He said that the manufacturing unit was not operational at that hour and there wasn’t many staff members present at the scene. “Nobody was hurt. There were two vehicles on the premises that were also brought out safely. The origin of the fire is yet to be known,” said the CFO.In a separate incident that took place on Saturday night, several shanties in a Bhangel slum were gutted.“Being a congested area, the fire spread quickly. However, it was contained within two hours with the help of four tenders. There were no casualties in this incident as well. All the residents were pulled out without any harm,” said Singh.Though the official cause of the fire is unclear, locals alleged that it started from an earthen lamp that was kept in one of the shanties. “There was a diya (earthen lamp) kept for the puja in one of the huts. The fire started from that hut. Many huts were burnt down,” said Haresh Kumar, a resident of the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-fire-incidents-in-noida-no-casualty/story-1T7IR6FpaHvWAzajiWBk1J.html
25-10-2020||Noida||GB Nagar to complete 400K Covid-19 tests by end of October||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration is en route to complete, and most likely will exceed, 400,000 tests by the end of the month. By Sunday, when it tested 3,452 daily samples, 382,023 samples had been tested in the district.District magistrate Suhas LY said, “From testing just 597 people in March, we ramped up testing to 110,205 in September. Till October 23, we have conducted 133,321 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, besides 243,873 rapid antigen tests. As a result of this increased testing, we are witnessing a continuous reduction in positivity rate and cases of new infection.” The DM said his administration has also set up an integrated Covid-19 control and command Centre, which works as the nerve centre of Covid-19 battle in the district. “It is manned by people from health and other departments and is equipped with modern equipments for communication and decision making. We are continuously focussing on improving our surveillance and contact tracing as that is the key to early detection of cases. Also, through continuous monitoring of the containment zones as well as other areas, we are trying to keep the number of cases and the positivity rate low. Surveillance has also been ramped up,” Suhas said. Suhas also said that till a vaccine for Covid-19 arrives, the administration has to focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions like enforcement of social distancing norms, hand washing practices and wearing of masks by the people. “As things open up more and more, it is necessary that people understand and voluntarily adopt Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the DM said. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that there are four ICMR-approved laboratories in the district. “While the labs in Child PGI and Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) are under the state government, the labs in National Institute of Biology (NIB) and National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) are owned and controlled by the central government. It is really commendable that the same set of labs, which used to test around 1,300 samples daily in May, are now testing over 3,000 samples in a day in October,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-to-complete-400k-covid-19-tests-by-end-of-october/story-HPfYo7kLrBV8xamp1VDfvO.html
25-10-2020||Noida||After pandemic woes, Noida’s apparel industry banks on Spring-Summer ’21 collection orders||Noida’s apparel industry is high on expectation with a revival in overseas markets. The Spring-Summer collections 2021 -- between February and June --- is expected to fetch the industry at least ₹15,000 crore, according to industry analysts, higher than the ₹10,000 crore of a usual year, considering the lag throughout the year. Around 600 garment export units had closed and the units in Noida suffered a collective loss of over ₹3,000 crore after the outbreak.The industry has been seeing green shoots of late, recording a rise in exports in September after several months of continuous fall on the back of the coronavirus disease Covid-19 pandemic that hit many clients, and the domestic industry itself with a 68-day national lockdown that started in the last week of March.Lalit Thukral, the president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), said that there was a 90% fall in orders in April this year, which gradually reduced over the last six months. “It eventually recorded a 10% rise last month over the same period last year, which indicates that the apparel sector is now on a growth-recovery path. Apparel exports in September this year was $1.19 billion, compared to $1.07 billion in 2019,” he said. “For the Spring-Summer collections ’21, we expect to bag orders of at least ₹15,000 crore. Till the date, against this expectation, we have received orders of around ₹5,000 crore. But, it will certainly get a big momentum from November as most of the overseas buyers are finalising the orders.” Thukral, who is also the vice-chairman of bi-annual India International Garment Fair (IIGF), said that 65th edition of IIGF is virtual and was inaugurated by union textile minister Smriti Irani on October 15. “This month-long fair is aimed to help Indian apparel and accessories exporters, who will showcase their latest designs and apparel for Spring-Summer 2021 here. It is expected that 10,000 buyers will be connecting and networking with over 200 participants in the entire span of the fair this time. The one district one product (ODOP) program of Uttar Pradesh is also associated with this virtual garment fair. Total participants from UP are around 70, of which 66 are from Gautam Budh Nagar district, whose district product is apparel,” he said. He said that more than 1,500 buyers registered themselves at this fair. “It’s just beginning and we hope that more than 4,000 buyers would visit the fair. We expect to get more orders as compared to last edition’s physical fair, where participants get around $200 million orders,” he said. Another exporter, Manoj Sahu, who runs a garment export company in Noida, also said that the exporters have high hopes from the upcoming Spring-Summer Collections season. “The apparel sector witnessed a major setback of over ₹10,000 crore in the last six months owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, but now there seems to be some optimism as apparel exporters are looking forward to the international festive season to bounce back. Several positive steps taken by the state and Centre, have resulted in this growth last month. Also, the pandemic has indirectly encouraged apparel exporters, to venture into a new area and diversify into medical textiles,” he said. Sahu further said that among the major commodities of export, which have recorded positive growth during September 2020 with respect to September 2019 are carpet (42.89%), handicrafts excluding handmade carpet (21.40%), jute manufacturing including floor covering (18.62%), cotton yarn/fabrics/made-ups and handloom products (14.82%), and readymade garment of all textiles (10.21%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-pandemic-woes-noida-s-apparel-industry-banks-on-spring-summer-21-collection-orders/story-h6meldC0bdmt0d0Q2zoIIL.html
25-10-2020||City||Police suspect wife’s involvement in Ludhiana man’s murder||In a twist in the Focal Point murder case, police are now probing the role of the 30-year-old victim’s wife in the case.Police have already booked two of his friends, Nand Ram and Lovlish Kumar, who were drinking alcohol with the victim, Ginni Sharma of Ishwar Colony, on the night of the murder.The cops have now found out that the victim had strained relations with his wife, Preeti. It was the second marriage for both but Ginni had found out only recently that Preeti’s first husband was alive and living in Delhi. She had earlier lied to him that her first husband had died of snake bite. The police raided her house in Ludhiana but she had already left the place. On suspicion that she may have fled to her home in Panipat, a team has been dispatched to Haryana.The murder had taken place last Wednesday. Inspector Mohammad Jamil said that Preeti’s involvement cannot be ruled out as of now but things will be clear once they track her down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-suspect-wife-s-involvement-in-ludhiana-man-s-murder/story-NZCnaSNxHup3Y3r5WjhMXN.html

As many as 55 persons tested positive for the virus in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative tally to 20, 022. A total of 18,945 persons have recovered so far, while 246 cases are still active. On a positive note, however, the rate at which the district has been adding new cases to its tally has considerably slowed down. While in early September, Ludhiana was adding 1,000 cases to its tally in every three to four days, the district’s journey from 18,000 cases (October 1) to 19,000 took a whole 16 days. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said the lag shows that the contagion is on a decline. “It has been possible because residents adhered to social distancing protocols and wore masks to keep the virus at bay,” he said.Sharing details, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said that more and more patients are recovering from the virus day by day. He added that efforts are on to keep people safe from the virus in the festive season.Speaking on the new infections, he said that a total of 66 patients tested positive in the last 24 hours, of which 55 are from Ludhiana while 11 are from other states and districts. He further said that 3, 436 samples were sent for testing on Sunday and the results are expected shortly.

25-10-2020||Bhopal||‘26% of Covid-19 deaths take place within 24 hours of hospitalisation’: Centre’s report||As many as 26 percent of deaths among Covid-19 patients take place within 24 hours of hospitalisation, suggests a report from the ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW). Through a circular dated October 23, 2020, sent to all the collectors and chief medical and health officers (CMHOs) across the state by commissioner of health services, Dr Sanjay Goyal, the officials in the districts have been asked to work on the challenges and action plan as incorporated in the ministry’s report dated October 12, 2020 based on a review meeting held by secretary, ministry of health and family welfare with secretaries in health departments of various states.The Centre’s report also stated, “This needs urgent attention of hospital-wise analysis mortality. State is to ensure early case identification and prompt shifting of patients to hospitals.” “State is expected to maintain the increasing trend of testing till positivity goes below 5 percent”, the report stated and further suggested increasing the number of tests through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on patients who test negative on rapid antigen tests but have symptoms of the disease. The report also stated, “There are about 16 percent of patients in ICU/oxygen supported beds. State should review its oxygen supply plan.” Also read: ‘Should be ashamed’ - Uddhav Thackeray’s 7 bitter attacks on BJP, CentreHead of department of pulmonary medicine at Bopal’s People’s College of Medical Science and Research Centre, Dr Sanjay Tandon said, “The data in the report suggests late arrival of Covid-19 patients at hospitals which should be a matter of concern. There may be several factors behind it inter alia like lack of awareness, illiteracy, fear of isolation, social taboo, cost of treatment (in case of paid treatment), etc.” He said another factor behind the late arrival of patients at hospitals and identification of patients could be a section of people having nurtured the false belief that they couldn’t be affected by the disease. “There are a large number of people on streets and in markets seen moving around without wearing masks. It’s a horrible situation. People are also relying on unscientific methods of treatment at homes like drinking hot water, brew of herbs, inhaling steam, etc. There is no proven fact that a Covid patient can be cured with hot water etc,” he added. Dr Tandon said, “since it’s pandemic time, there is no harm in treating such patients as Covid patients who have clear symptoms of Covid but their tests have come back negative. The treatment is not an expensive one. It can save several lives.” Head of chest disease department, Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, Indore, Dr Ravi Dosi said, “Testing needs to be increased and people with Covid symptoms have to be identified and treated early to reduce the number of deaths. There is a need for mass awareness campaign to ensure people wear masks and maintain social distancing which is found missing.” Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “As per the death analysis done by the government in the month of May, more than 31 percent of deaths among Covid patients took place in the first 24 hours and 60 to 70 percent in the first 3 days. There has been a regular analysis by the government of the Covid situation. But it’s unfortunate that the government’s action doesn’t suggest that it is serious about its own analysis or about the advisories from the Centre from time to time. Also, the government continues to fail in sharing data on the breakup on RAT and RT-PCR tests on people. There have been cases wherein people were found Covid positive even after RAT showing a negative result.” Commissioner, health services, Dr Sanjay Goyal said, “We can’t say that the situation is alarming. There is a constant improvement in terms of Covid cases and deaths. The fact is the situation in Madhya Pradesh is far better than that in several other states. However, besides a mass awareness campaign to identify and treat patients early, our major focus is on strengthening our infrastructure and enhancing the quality of treatment. We have succeeded on both fronts.” As per the health department bulletin released on Saturday, as many as 1,004 new Covid-19 cases were identified within the past 24 hours taking the tally of total cases in the state to 166,298. There were 20 more fatalities during the period to take the death toll to 2,875 with the overall death rate registered at 1.72 percent. With the recovery of 1,268 patients during the period, as many as 151,946 patients have recovered from the disease and were discharged from hospitals. Around 31,695 Covid-19 fresh tests have been conducted during the period to take the tally of tests to 2,75,0620.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/26-of-covid-19-deaths-take-place-within-24-hours-of-hospitalisation-centre-s-report/story-jxh7TpmfMp9bxlsdwRsbMK.html
25-10-2020||Gurugram||Man arrested for ATM card frauds in Gurugram||The police on Saturday arrested a man from Manesar, alleged to be part of a four-member gang that duped people by switching their ATM cards. About 50 stolen cards were recovered from the suspect, who is from Palwal, the police said. According to police, the suspect, Shakeel Khan, was traced following an investigation into a case lodged on October 22 based on a complaint by a Ritu Devi. Devi, who lives in Bilaspur and works in a private company, had alleged that her ATM card had been swapped by an unidentified person and had illegally withdrawn ₹27,000 from her account. A case of fraud was registered against the unidentified person on Friday after a preliminary investigation at Bilaspur police station. Khan was arrested at around 9.30 pm on Saturday from Binola flyover. “The suspect and his associates would go to different ATM kiosks across the city and swap people’s ATM cards with similar ones on the pretext of helping them with their transactions. He used to get hold of the people’s PIN (personal identification number) while pretending to help them with the transaction, and would withdraw money later,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). According to Gururgam police records, online banking frauds, including swapping of debit and credit cards, account for more than half the cyber crime incidents registered in the city this year. In 2018, of the 4,137 complaints lodged, 2,321 pertained to online banking fraud and cheating through credit or debit cards or through smartphones. A further 450 complaints were related to Facebook abuse/harassment, another 289 were of internet fraud and 251 were of data theft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-arrested-for-atm-card-frauds-in-gurugram/story-jIKWG9BdZwk6cf01heX0NL.html
25-10-2020||Gurugram||At least 20 arrested in police crackdown on IPL betting rings in Gurugram||Cracking down against unauthorised cricket betting rackets across the city, the crime branch of Gurugram Police arrested at least 20 people in separate cases for allegedly making bets on Indian Premier League (IPL) matches on Saturday. Since the start of the tournament last month, raids have been separately conducted at four locations – Sushant Lok, Sector 40, DLF Phase 4 and Manesar – and all suspects nabbed were booked under relevant sections of the Public Gambling Act.The alleged bookmakers had been on the police’s radar since the tournament began on September 19. According to Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, Gurugram, typically such operations mushroom whenever a domestic or international sports league is telecast. This year, however, the start of sports tournaments, which usually took place in the summer, was delayed due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. With the IPL ongoing, unauthorised betting operations which had been dormant due to Covid-19, have now come back to life, Sangwan said.In most cases of betting on cricket matches, the modus operandi is largely the same. Police officers said that during a match, the suspects are connected via a ‘live line’ where one of their ‘contacts’ is physically present at the match location, who informs them over the phone about the odds. The ‘local’ bookie takes bets from punters — a person who places the bets. There is an entire chain of ‘bookies’ who communicate over the phone. The odds keep changing as the match progresses, officers added. Sangwan said, “We are cracking down on all such authorised activities and more arrests are likely to take place on Sunday. Probe so far has found that these bookies bet on all such sporting activities and organise betting sessions from residential areas. They mostly use WhatsApp for communication and have a nexus with bookies at several locations across the city. We are trying to bust the whole chain.“Since this is a bailable offence, several accused return to gambling after they are released from jails. It is yet to be established, however, if the suspects in these four cases have a common link or whether they were running independent operations. Five FIRs have been registered at respective police stations,” said the ACP.Police officers said that on Saturday, the crime branch had received a tip-off about two bookmakers operating from a flat in DLF Phase 4, who had taken bets on a match between the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and the Delhi Capitals (DC). Police formed a raiding team and arrested the suspects, who are Delhi residents, while they were taking bets over the phone as the match was screened on a LED screen. Twenty Five mobile phones, six notebooks, eight laptops and dozens of pens were recovered from them. On Sunday, acting on a tip-off, the same crime unit arrested six persons from a society in New Developing Sectors. Police said the suspects were operating a book on an IPL match and recovered three phones, a notebook and a laptop. A crime branch official from Sector 40 said, “In one of the raids, the bookmaker on the phone was communicating that the odds were 39 paise for a bet on the team batting first, which means that a person, placing ₹100 on that team at that point of time would receive ₹139 if it wins. The odds keep changing.” The third raid was conducted after the police received “secret information” that a similar operation was being run in Sushant Lok. Four phones, along with an LED TV, a laptop and ₹20,000 in cash were seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/at-least-20-arrested-in-police-crackdown-on-ipl-betting-rings-in-gurugram/story-lXZE1aAAECkVSk6YxVgleM.html
25-10-2020||Gurugram||MCG redesigns Kaman Sarai car park due to litigation||After being stuck for nearly a year, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to redesign its multilevel parking project at Kaman Sarai, said officials on Sunday.In November last year, the foundation stone for constructing the project was laid. However, with the main office of the Congress party and a few shops coming in the way of the project, MCG had sent eviction notices to shop owners and Congress party in December, stating that the land belonged to the civic body and had been illegally encroached upon.Subsequently, the members of the Congress party had met with deputy commissioner, Amit Khatri, regarding the matter and also stated that they will approach Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on the issue.MCG officials said that a month later, the political party and shop owners had approached the local court and got a stay in the matter.“We are redesigning the project in such a manner that the multilevel parking will be built on the land available to us so that we can start construction on an immediate basis. The approval of the design project will also be done internally within the MCG and hence, necessary formalities will not take too much time as such,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.Originally, the project was designed so as to accommodate 2,000 vehicles, with the aim of reducing congestion at nearby Sadar Bazaar, and making the market a no-vehicle zone. Landmarks such as Sadar Bazar, Gurugram bus depot, Civil Hospital and post office are located in close proximity to Kaman Sarai. Located in one of the oldest parts of the city, Kaman Sarai is a mix of residential and commercial establishments.With the MCG unable to reclaim nearly 8,000 square metres of land due to the litigation, the agency has now reduced the total capacity of vehicles by nearly half, to around 1,100 vehicles. The new project is estimated to cost Rs 175 crore and is being built on around 7,000 square metres land. The facility will have three basement floors reserved for parking, while seven floors above the ground would be leased out for commercial purposes, including space for a multiplex, from which MCG is expecting to recover its construction cost, within a five-year period.A senior MCG official privy to the matter said that the civic body hasn’t completely ruled out reclaiming the land currently occupied by the Congress and a few shops, to expand the multilevel project.“We weren’t sure how long the litigation process would go on till, hence, we have decided to build the project on whatever land is available to us currently. Eventually, we are hoping to get the land back, demolish the illegal structures, and expand the parking facility,” said the official.Parking is a major issue in the city, as there are only one multilevel parking facility and 43 sanctioned parking lots. Each year around 30,000 vehicles are registered in Gurugram.Besides Kaman Sarai, MCG is also constructing a multilevel parking facility at Sadar Bazar.Captain Ajay Singh Yadav, former cabinet minister and senior Congress leader, said that the move to redesign the project and leave Congress office was a positive decision by the government. “This is a historic office of the Congress and it has remained in existence when Haryana was formed in 1966. We appreciate this decision as tallest Congress leaders have visited this office,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-redesigns-kaman-sarai-car-park-due-to-litigation/story-fO6C7Cts8cBw6EoNlPktKN.html
25-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Three mobile phones, drugs found in Bhondsi Jail||Authorities of Bhondsi Jail on Saturday recovered three mobile phones, along with their batteries and chargers, and about 800 grams of marijuana from the barracks inside the jail complex. They also recovered three 4G SIM cards and as many headsets concealed in three packets, the police said.The jail authorities filed a complaint on Saturday in the matter at Bhondsi police station. According to the complaint, a routine check of all the barracks was being conducted by jail officials at 6.30am. During the checking, three packets were found on the roof of and behind barrack number 7, the complaint said. Preliminary probe suggested that the packets, containing the phones and other items, had been thrown from outside and flung across the boundary wall of the jail complex, the police said. “The packets contained three smartphones, three batteries and chargers, three 4G SIM cards and three headsets. We are questioning inmates to ascertain if they had any knowledge of the incident,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). Several instances of mobile phones and drugs being flung across the boundary wall of the jail complex have been reported in the past. According to the police, the mobile phones are used by the inmates to make extortion calls and contact their henchmen and aides to run their operations. “An FIR has been registered in the case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and Prisoners Act at Bhondsi police station. Efforts are on to trace the locations from where the mobile phones and other items had been purchased,” Sangwan said. The easy access of mobile phones and narcotics among jail inmates had come under the scanner after the police had arrested Dharambeer Chautala, who was posted as deputy jail superintendent of Bhondsi Jail, on July 23. Chautala, along with an associate, Ravi, was caught supplying mobile phones and narcotics to inmates. The police had recovered at least 11 SIM cards and 230 grams of hashish from their possession. A special investigation team was formed to probe the matter, following which two more aides of the accused duo were arrested.

The air quality on Sunday improved marginally from the previous day, when the city recorded an AQI of 325, which is also in the ‘very poor’ category. The level of ultrafine particulate matter, having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 225.23 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Sunday, as per the data recorded by the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. The level was almost four times the permissible limit of 60µg/m³.According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve marginally but remain in the lower end of ‘very poor’ category on Monday. Experts attributed the high pollution levels to low wind speed, which is restricting the dispersal of pollutants. “Due to low wind speed, pollutants are not being dispersed. Stubble burning is also taking place rampantly and pollutant particles are being carried forward to other areas from the plains,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist. An official with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the wind speed was expected to improve after October 27, which would subsequently improve the dispersal of pollutants. “Due to low wind speed in the Delhi-NCR, coupled with other factors, dispersal of pollutants has been weak and air quality has been poor. Once the wind speed picks up, we can expect some improvement,” said the official.On Sunday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 33.7 degrees Celsius, a marginal increase from Saturday’s 32.2 degree Celsius. The minimum temperature on Sunday was 11.2 degrees Celsius, the same as the previous day. Both the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to rise by a degree on Monday, as per the IMD forecast. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, a clear sky will prevail on Monday. Shakti Singh, nodal officer for Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) implementation in Gurugram, said agencies in the city are collecting around Rs 1 lakh per day in fines every day from those violating the norms and causing dust pollution. He said that more than Rs 7 lakh had been collected from offenders as penalties, from October 15 to 24. “The fines imposed are expected to go up since we have been conducting extensive patrolling. We have been conducting night patrolling regularly to keep a check on activities that lead to dust generation. Besides, complaints addressed to us through various platforms are also being addressed to curb pollution generating activities,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/slight-improvement-in-air-quality-sudden-spike-could-land-gurugram-in-severe-zone/story-X2m5LXB0MWis3S9rCXfhqI.html

A sum of Rs 60,000 has been sent to each of these schools.According to the official list, of the 52 schools that will get the facility, 47 are in rural areas, while five lie in the urban part of the district. The five urban schools are — Government Senior Secondary School, Kundanpuri; Government High School (GHS), Dhandari Kalan; GHS Chaawni Mohalla and GHS Kamran Road.This is the first time that the authorities have sent funds for installation of RO systems in schools, as earlier it would be either to construct new rooms or toilets. As per the list, 23 are senior secondary schools and 29 are high schools.The move will help schools provide safe drinking water to the students. Last year, water samples of many schools had failed the purity test and there was a dire need to get ROs installed in government schools.At GHS Sehjomajra in Macchiwara, 158 students are studying in Classes 6 to 10. They drink water from the tap which comes from submersible pumps installed in the schools. Headmaster Kanwaljit Singh said, “We have received the funds from the SSA office and will start the process of installing RO with a water cooler for the students.”District education officer (elementary) Rajinder Kaur said, “We have received the grant and disbursed the same to the selected schools. This facility will help these institutions provide filtered drinking water to the students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/52-govt-schools-in-ludhiana-district-get-funds-to-install-ro-systems-water-coolers/story-TFBU5cAcRkdgdVt95QfPqM.html
25-10-2020||Noida||Special drive to repair potholes in Greater Noida till November 7||GREATER NOIDA: As part of its special drive to repair the city’s roads, the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has repaired at least 290 patches which had developed potholes, officials said.The authority had started the drive on October 7 with an aim to repair potholes. The target was to repair all potholes across the city in a month’s time. Officials said the work will continue till November 7. Under this drive, the authority has geo-tagged locations where repairs were needed, and also took pictures of each patch that has been repaired, officials added.The total length of the main roads, which are 45 to 132 metres wide, is 206 kilometres in Greater Noida. Total length of internal roads, which are less than 45 metres wide, is 594 kilometres.“We have done tagging and also taken pictures, with an aim to maintain transparency in repair work. After the month-long drive, the authority will reserve three days every month to repair potholes found on any city road,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.He added that Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays in the second week of every month will be designated to address issues regarding potholes. To make the special drive successful, the authority has hired a private agency – Dev Yash Projects and Infrastructure Limited – as a consultant for the repair works. The agency has been empanelled so that it can repair any pothole, said officials. Officials said the authority has started this new system of a single agency repairing all potholes in the city so that the work gets completed in a time-bound manner and with transparency. Earlier, individual work circles had to issue tenders for small works after which road repair was to be done, said officials.“But now, since a single agency is to repair all potholes, there will not be any delay in the work, which commuters complain against, unlike earlier. Earlier each circle officer, in his respective circle, was handling road repairs, in a total of eight work circles of the city. But the results were not as per expectations. So, the new system of a single empanelled agency was introduced,” said a GNIDA official, not authorised to speak to the media.The authority has divided the city into two major parts – Greater Noida West and Greater Noida East – for better administration and smooth functioning. In Greater Noida West, at least 60 patches have been repaired and in Greater Noida West, 230 patches have been repaired to offer smooth commutes, said officials. Officials said any resident can call at 120-2336046,47,48, 49 and file a complaint about potholes.“The authority has been claiming for a long time that all potholes will be repaired. And now there is this new system. We hope that all patches will be repaired now,” said Sanjiv Kumar, a resident of sector 1, Greater Noida West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/special-drive-to-repair-potholes-in-greater-noida-till-november-7/story-V4e9bLCmvzvLtthxMM2BnO.html
25-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Eight nabbed for selling refurbished vehicles after reporting them stolen||Noida: At least eight persons were arrested by the Noida police on Sunday for allegedly fabricating documents of commercial vehicles bought cheap, reporting them as stolen and then reselling them as refurbished trucks, while defrauding finance companies,According to the police, the gang has been active for the past few months.“People working with finance companies are a part of the group. They would access data of customers who were unable to pay their installments (for commercial vehicles) on time. The gang would coerce them into selling their vehicles to the gang for cheap. Then the gang would report the vehicles as having being stolen,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.Police said the gang allegedly has a contact in Bhatinda, Punjab who would provide them with fake documents for the vehicles.“They would change the engine or chassis number and then resell these vehicles. They would obtain the documents from Punjab. This way they were defrauding finance companies as well as unsuspecting buyers who were purchasing these refurbished trucks,” said Singh.He said that the suspect in Punjab is absconding, along with three other accomplices. The fake RCs for the vehicles were usually obtained for ₹1.5 to 3 lakh while the suspects earned a profit of ₹5 to 10 lakh on each vehicle, said police.They were nabbed on Sunday following a tip-off from Morna. The police also recovered five trucks from them, along with several sets of fake documents and tools used to change vehicle identifiers.Police said that most of the suspects, including the absconding ones, have a criminal history. They suspect at least 20-25 more vehicles to have been modified or reported stolen while they are searching for all cases in which the suspects have been involved.The suspects were booked for IPC sections for cheating, forgery, counterfeiting and concealing evidence. They were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-eight-nabbed-for-selling-refurbished-vehicles-after-reporting-them-stolen/story-XFCsRiF61OsxmMCSAqbt5M.html
25-10-2020||City||Noida: Rape victim’s father goes to police station with pistol, demands justice||The father of a seven-year-old girl who was allegedly raped on October 21 went to the Surajpur police station on Friday brandishing a countrymade pistol and demanding justice and monetary compensation.The girl was allegedly lured by the suspect on the pretext of offering sweets, and then raped in a flat in the building where she resided with her family. The suspect, Sonu Verma (25), was visiting a friend in the same building when he saw the girl.Verma was nabbed on the same day. However, in the evening when a police team took him for scene recreation, he tried to grab a sub-inspector’s pistol and flee from the spot. He was injured in his leg during this attempt and then taken in custody again after which he was sent to jail.On October 23, the girl’s father, a 35-year-old truck driver, reached the Surajpur police station with a pistol.A police official said that the girl’s father was in a poor state of mind and was asking for several things, including monetary compensation for his daughter and a chance to face the suspect himself for destroying their life. The pistol was eventually taken from him and he was calmed down.“The family is undergoing counselling, including the father. The girl is doing better health wise. We are trying to fast track the case so that a charge sheet is filed soon and the financial aid process can start. We are trying to help them out as much as possible,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women and children safety. Family members allege that the girl’s father was stressed.“They don’t have a lot of money and he is very scared with the state of affairs. He didn’t mean anyone harm but only wanted to make sure that they get justice for their daughter,” said his brother-in-law.Police also said that the incident of bringing the pistol to the police station is being investigated.“We understand the problem (father’s situation), but the act (of bringing a pistol to the police station) in itself was wrong. A probe in the matter is underway and necessary action will be taken soon,” said DCP, zone 2, Harish Chander.“The compensation process starts as soon as the FIR is registered. Then the medical examination report is taken into account along with the charge-sheet. For most of the POCSO cases, a compensation of Rs 3 lakh is given to the family which comes from the state government. The entire process takes about 2-3 months,”said DPO, Atul Soni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-rape-victim-s-father-goes-to-police-station-with-pistol-demands-justice/story-DQ8diCFKiFZmARkPBFqeCN.html
25-10-2020||City||NGO stages symbolic protest over inadequate fogging in Ludhiana||Protesting against the municipal corporation (MC) and district health department over inadequate fogging being done in the city, the members of Yuva NGO burned their effigies to mark the occasion of Dussehra in the Haibowal area on Sunday.The members rued that corruption in government departments and the lackadaisical approach of authorities in providing proper health facilities to the residents were the real demons of the society and, they needed to put an end to these instead of burning effigies of Ravana every year.Leading the group of protesters, Kumar Gaurav said,”Over 650 cases of dengue have been reported in the city till now but, proper fogging hasn’t been done yet. The authorities are making hollow claims that fogging is being done but, the situation is completely different at the ground level. Recently, mayor Balkar Sandhu also caught few employees of the civic body who were stealing fuel allotted for fogging but, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Corruption is prevalent in each branch of the MC.”“Illegal buildings are being constructed in the city with no check by the authorities. The MC is putting the lives of the residents by not conducting proper fogging drives. Rather than burning Ravana’s effigy of Ravana every year, we should work on eradicating the corruption from our system,” said Gaurav. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Regular fogging is being done by the corporation to keep the residents safe from diseases like dengue and chikungunya. I am personally keeping a check on the corrupt practices being adopted by MC staff and, surprise checking is also being done to catch the corrupt officers and improve the working of MC.”Despite attempts made to reach MC medical officer Vipal Malhotra, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngo-stages-symbolic-protest-over-inadequate-fogging-in-ludhiana/story-difXYnWvILx7ZGMBSuS3cL.html

25-10-2020||City||Ludhiana district health department gets cracking to prevent second Covid wave||As the first wave of coronavirus disease appears to be receding, the district health department is gearing up for the second wave, which according to health experts could be witnessed during the winter season.Doctors have been put on standby and the health department employees have been asked to rebuild the infrastructure within a 48-hour notice. Private hospitals too have been told not to shut their Covid units.Sharing details of the preparations, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said instructions have been issued to the civil hospital to share the details of expenses to be incurred in installation of heating systems at Covid care centres.“The pandemic has taught us many lessons so we have to be proactive. Now, our infrastructure is in place and we only need a 48-hour period to get back into action. Our doctors and paramedical staff have worked tirelessly and saved many precious lives. The cases now are on the decline and hopefully the situation of the second wave will not arise,” said Dr Bagga.The civil surgeon urged people to abide by the government guidelines to prevent the second wave to the Covid-19.“Hand hygiene, social distancing and wearing of masks are the best measures to curtail the second wave. Elderly people are advised to stay at home while those going out for work should follow the government guidelines,” said Dr Bagga.On the other hand, senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is member of the task force constituted to curtail the spread of Covid-19 in the state, said if people continue to violate government guidelines then a second wave is expected to arrive by the end of November.Meanwhile, the district health department today visited Dussehra committees to ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the Centre and the state government are being complied with.Organisers were directed to ensure their staffers were provided PPE kits, face masks, hand sanitisers, soap and sodium hypochlorite solution for frequently sanitising all touched surfaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-district-health-department-gets-cracking-to-prevent-second-covid-wave/story-Nvrgbiklfjx2Q3yzUAdjQJ.html
25-10-2020||City||Covid norms go for a toss during political gatherings in Baroda||People in Haryana’s Baroda assembly constituency have been gathering in large numbers to attend political meetings and rallies without following Covid-19 norms even as the state continues to register ample infections daily. The BJP, INLD, Congress and Loktantra Suraksha party leaders have been holding meetings and rallies in villages of the constituency, which is going to polls on November 3. People in the constituency wait to get a glimpse of their leader and nobody follows social distancing or wears masks.Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dhruva Chaudhary, said political parties should educate their cadre to implement government guidelines for the pandemic. “The party workers and politicians should wear a face mask and wash their hands regularly,” he added.A doctor from Rohtak’s PGIMS, on condition of anonymity, said such large gatherings could emerge as super spreader of the virus and people should not take it lightly. “Politicians should refrain from organising big rallies. A large number of people attend the public meetings and rallies and mostly nobody wears a face mask. It is the responsibility of every politician to adhere to safety guidelines and then pass these instructions to their followers,” the doctor said.Rakesh Sharma, a resident of Bhanderi village in Baroda, said no one is talking about the Covid-19 pandemic as a poll issue and it looks like the virus has disappeared, especially from this rural constituency. “Politicians and their followers have been going around freely without wearing face masks and putting the lives of people at risk. If any politician gets infected, he/she will go to a private hospital in Gurugram and Delhi but the villagers will have to visit civil hospitals, where facilities or treatment are abysmal,” he added. He said people from other areas of the state are coming to Baroda and no one is keeping tab on their health status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-during-political-gatherings-in-baroda/story-TwqApRpKH7N5lrWf4yHubK.html

25-10-2020||City||‘Evil’ goes up in flames amid heavy security, contained gatherings in Ludhiana||Even amid toned down Dussehra celebrations due to Covid pandemic, the festive fervour came alive during Ravan Dahan, which was organised at different venues across the city on Sunday.As opposed to the large crowds witnessed at Ravana Dahan programmes last year, the gatherings at different venues were limited. However, the police department faced a tough time managing the rush of visitors outside the Dussehra grounds. Heavy police force was deployed outside the Ravan Dahan venues.While many people gathered outside the grounds, some watched the burning of Ravana effigies from the rooftop of their houses as entry to the grounds was restricted by the police department and organising committees. Many visitors were seen violating social distancing norms and not wearing face masks.Heavy rush in markets Heavy rush of visitors was seen in the markets, especially outside confectionery shops, as residents greeted each other by distributing sweets on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.Ravana Dahan was organised at Daresi ground, Upkar Nagar, Rajguru Nagar, Aggar Nagar, Haibowal, Chandigarh road, Partap chowk among other areas.The city’s tallest effigy of 35-feet was burned at Daresi ground. Residents were also seen taking selfies with the Ravana effigy and uploading the pictures on social media. Height of the effigy was reduced by all the committees as earlier over 90-feet effigies were erected at Daresi ground every year. The Vaishno Dramatic Club, Jagraon burnt a ‘Covid’ effigy along with Ravana with the hope that the deadly virus would vanish along with all other evil.Only 8 committees organise Ravan Dahan Dussehra committees including those in Focal Point area, Model Town extension, Dugri and Jamalpur, did not organise Ravana Dahan citing the contagion risk and difficulty to manage the gathering. Only eight major organising committees took permission to conduct the annual event this Dussehra. Last year, nearly 80 committees had organised the effigy burning ritual.Members of Shri Ram Lila Committee, Daresi, Dinesh Marwaha and Kamal Bassi said, “Ravana Dehan was organised at Daresi as per the guidelines issued by the district administration. The ‘Dola yatra’ of Lord Rama was also carried out in old city areas. Limited gathering of people of allowed and the event was broadcast live through local cable operators. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma, police chief Rakesh Agrawal, MLA Surinder Dawar and senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra also participated in the event. Most residents supported the committee and stayed at home. The attendees were stopped from collecting the burnt remnants of the Ravana effigy to avoid unnecessary gathering at the spot.”Congress leader and councillor Seema Kapoor’s husband Sunil Kapoor said, “Ravana Dehan was organised in Aggar Nagar and Rajguru Nagar areas in a simple manner with no rush of residents. Barricading was done to avoid large gathering and volunteers along with the police were deputed at the spot.”Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, “Dussehra was celebrated at different locations in the city with heavy police deployment to avoid gatherings. The organising committees and residents supported the police and the festival was celebrated in adherence to all the norms and guidelines issued by the government.”No outdoor celebrations for many Even as some Dussehra committees telecast Ravana Dahan live through local cable operators and social networks, residents in many parts of the city missed out on the outdoor celebrations as their respective organising committees refrained from burning effigies this year.One of the residents of Model Town extension, Harpreet Singh said, “As always, my daughter was excited to see Ravana Dahan in person. But there was no such event in our area this year. These restrictions were also necessary due to the risk of virus spread.”Vinay, a resident of Dhai Marla Colony near Daresi, said, “We used to go for Ravana Dahan at Daresi ground every as the venue is just 100 metres from our house. But this time, we decided against attending the celebrations due to the Covid pandemic. Festivals bring cheer, but the revelry should not put lives at risk.”Mini effigies burnt in streets, vacant plots To celebrate the occasion, children and adults were seen burning home-made miniature Ravana effigies in their localities, including Model Town Extension, Dugri, Haiboal, Jamalpur, among other areas.A Haibowal resident, Gopal Verma said, “Children in the area had prepared a small effigy which was burnt in the street to mark Vajayadashmi. It is important that we understand the gravity of the situation and keep everyone around us safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/evil-goes-up-in-flames-amid-heavy-security-contained-gatherings-in-ludhiana/story-HMl93smC9BF8uHrAqxeY8O.html

25-10-2020||Kolkata||BJP central leaders try to end tussle between Bengal president, youth front chief||Two days after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh dissolved all the district committees of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the state youth front headed by Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan, the party’s central leaders are trying to end the tussle between the two. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and national secretary Arvind Menon – both leaders look after the organisation in West Bengal – are in touch with Ghosh and Khan, state leaders aware of the developments said. Khan is known to be close to Mukul Roy, national vice-president of the BJP who left the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in 2017 and played a key role in the BJP’s electoral success in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Roy made thousands of TMC workers and many leaders, including Khan, defect to the saffron camp. The new BJYM district committees were formed over the past five weeks. On Thursday, Khan even appointed three vice-presidents and four secretaries of the new state committee. On Friday, Ghosh dissolved all the district committees and empowered the BJP’s district presidents to take over till further decisions are taken. On Saturday, an aggrieved Khan left the BJYM WhatsApp group, saying he would resign from the BJP. He, however, returned to the group after a few hours and uploaded a video message on his Twitter handle. “It is true that we will fight to establish a BJP government in Bengal next year. It is also true that I was aggrieved. But I am not going to leave the party because of one person. The party is our family. I am honoured that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have shown us a path. For BJYM workers, the only task now is to carry on agitation relentlessly,” Khan said in the video without naming anyone. He also wished BJYM members on the occasion of Ashtami, the second day of Durga Puja. Khan came under limelight on October 8 when the BJYM organised the ‘Nabanna Chalo’ (march to the state secretariat) agitation in protest against lack of employment opportunities in Bengal and law and order problems. This was the BJP’s biggest agitation in recent years. BJP leaders, who did not want to be quoted, said Ghosh dissolved the committees following differences with Khan over appointment of some office bearers who were earlier in the Trinamool Congress (TMC). Ghosh wrote the order on his personal letterhead as Lok Sabha member from Midnapore and not on the party’s letterhead. Khan was the sitting TMC Lok Sabha member from Bishnupur constituency in Bankura district when he joined the BJP before the 2019 polls. He retained the seat and was appointed as president of the state BJYM about two months ago. “Due to some reasons, till any further announcements, all district presidents of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and respective district committees are being dissolved from today. Till further announcements their duties will be taken up by the respective district presidents of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” said the organisational announcement signed by Ghosh on Friday. On Thursday, Shankudeb Panda, also a former TMC leader, was appointed as the state vice-president of the BJYM by Khan. Two others, Digvijay Singh and Avishek Singhania were also made vice-presidents and four persons, including actress Rimjhim Mitra, were appointed as secretaries. Neither Ghosh nor Khan made any statement on this issue on Sunday. Party leaders said the differences had been brewing since the first week of September when Khan published a list of members in the BJYM’s new state committee. Ghosh declared the list null and void and wanted changes to be made. Khan had to publish a new list in which Prakash Das, a youth leader known to be close to Ghosh, was named as the Morcha general secretary. “A section of central leaders of the BJP wanted Shankudeb Panda, who is known to be close to Mukul Roy, to be the Morcha general secretary,” a state BJP leader said on condition of anonymity. He said Vijayvargiya, who also wanted Panda’s induction, had a discussion with Ghosh but the latter was not willing to budge. BJP leaders said Ghosh had reservations about former TMC leader Anupam Hazra as well. Hazra, the former TMC Lok Sabha MP from Bolpur, defected to the BJP in March 2019 and was defeated by TMC’s Mimi Chakraborty at Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency. He was first made a vice-president in the BJYM in September. This decision too was changed and Hazra was recently appointed as a national secretary of the BJP in place of Rahul Sinha. An aggrieved Sinha has distanced himself from the party since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-central-leaders-try-to-end-tussle-between-bengal-president-youth-front-chief/story-5OY2dHWW3qNW6NxdLDmGDP.html

The SIT had recovered around Rs 4.5 crore after the arrest of some accused including two assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) - Rajpreet Singh and Joginder Singh.Rs 4.57 crore was recovered from the arrested accused. Other accused are yet to be arrested and the remaining amount is also still to be recovered.“A separate financial SIT was constituted, which has been investigating the matter as to how much amount was lying in the FMJ house at the time of the occurrence, and the SIT’s report is still awaited. Due to this, the currency notes may not be released to the applicant,” the state responded to court.On September 11, Mohali additional district and sessions judge, while allowing the application of Sahodhya, had ordered that the prosecution will prepare a detailed inventory of the currency notes after taking proper and legible photographs of the notes as per the recovery memos of different accused.It added that Sahodhya will give undertaking to the prosecution that it will refund the amount to the court if in future it is proved that they are not owner of the amount.“Sahodhya will furnish the bank guarantee equivalent to the disputed amount, with the investigating officer (IO). The IO will deposit the amount in the account of Sahodhya in shape of an FDR with directions to the bank to not release the said amount to the applicant till furnishing of an NOC from the income tax department pertaining to the amount,” the court order read.Father Anthony confirmed the development over phone and said that it has been nearly one-and-a-half month but police have not deposited the amount. On furnishing the bank guarantee equivalent to the amount, he said that that is to be done after police deposit the money.“My advocate has contacted the police, but the matter is still pending,” he added.Assistant inspector general of police, state crime unit, Manmohan Sharma, didn’t respond to calls and messages but a senior official from the state crime wing, on condition of anonymity, said that the process might be delayed as the money is lying with different police districts. “It will be released to the firm as per the court orders,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-weeks-on-punjab-police-yet-to-release-rs-4-57-cr-to-sahodhya/story-ZXIQa9hHtkJrOFWJLrPCYJ.html

25-10-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC seeks reply from state government on Nov 5 on salary cuts||Rajasthan High Court has sought a reply from the state government on the issue of pay cut of government employees by November 5. The high court has also ordered that the amount deducted or to be deducted from the government employees’ salary should be deposited in a separate account.The order was given by Judge Dinesh Mehta on a petition by All Rajasthan State Government Employees’ Joint Federation. Advocate Kuldeep Mathur, on behalf of the Employees’ Joint Federation, said that the state government has ordered a deduction from the salaries of government employees, including members of the federation.The government does not have the right to deduct any part of the salary of employees as there is no such provision in the service rules nor the Pandemic Diseases Act-1897 that empowers it to take such steps.On Friday, the high court withdrew the order banning pay cuts. A day before, Rajasthan HC had stayed the state government’s decision to deduct one-day salary of government teachers, in a civil writ petition filed by an individual.Four different cadres under All Rajasthan State Government Employees’ Joint Federation had filed four applications in the high court against the government’s decision to cut the salaries of the employees. The hearing in the five other petitions regarding the same issue will be held on November 3.In September, the federation had also launched a five-phase stir to protest against the state government’s decision to deduct salaries of the employees as the cabinet had earlier decided to deduct two day’s remuneration of officers belonging to all-India and state services and a day’s salary of other employees from that month. The government had said that this was being done to mobilise resources for Covid-19 relief fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-hc-seeks-reply-from-state-government-on-nov-5-on-salary-cuts/story-jWfpSusQ8FcJioUMdLZsbM.html

Launching the new party, Sushant said, “The party will emerge as an alternative to the Congress and BJP. Our party will contest elections in all four parliamentary seats and 68 Vidhan Sabha seats. The political structure will be streamlined over the next six months.”Sushant accused the current regime of compromising the state: “Poor fiscal management of the present regime has pushed the state into a debt trap. The per capita debt has increased to ₹80,000. Unemployed in the state has been continuously increasing but the government has no plans of creating more job avenues. Himachal Pradesh is rich in resources but the government has failed to utilise them to generate income,” he said.“ Both the Congress and BJP have hoodwinked the public. Our regional party has both leaders and workers who hail from Himachal,” he said, adding “The chief ministers in the state are no different than subedars as they are ruled by an emperor in Delhi.”He said during his tenure at the Lok Sabha he had raised the state’s voice in the parliament. Sushant promised to provide employment to two lakh youngsters if voted to power. “I promise to not get into political gimmickry like the Congress and BJP,” he said.In a veiled attack on former chief minister Shanta Kumar, “Leaders who talk about high-principle politics and write a letter every third day supporting the National Pension System (NPS) should give up pensioner benefits and amenities provided by the government to them,” he said.Who is Sushant?

He was jailed as a student for opposing the Emergency.He became the youngest member of the Himachal Pradesh legislative assembly in 1982.

He won from the Kangra Lok Sabha seat in 2009 as a BJP candidate but quit the saffron party after a fallout with the party leadership in 2014.He later joined AAP and became its state convener.

The central laws pose a serious threat to the interests of farmers of Punjab and Haryana and I cannot stand with a party that has anti-farmers vision,” he added.Gill, who remained active in municipal council politics in Moga district, expressed displeasures with the Congress government.“By tabling bills, the Congress has expressed its non-serious attitude towards farmers. The bills have no meaning before the central laws. Opposition parties supported the bills that propose MSP for wheat and paddy, which is already bought by the central agencies on the assured rates. There is no mention of cotton, maize and other crops sown in the state. Moreover, provision of jail term to those buying below MSP would only lead to an atmosphere of distrust between a farmer and a trader,” said the leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-bjp-leader-gill-says-no-to-politics-will-fight-for-farmers-rights/story-BlDzigm6dsN8DlcrRE6FiI.html
25-10-2020||Chandigarh||Uncertainty over wheat sowing looms large in Abohar villages||Prolonged waterlogging in low-lying region has increased salt concentration in the soil, making it impossible to sow rabi crop BATHINDAAfter widespread damage to standing cotton crop due breach in a drain in August, farmers in Abohar belt of Fazilka district are worried about sowing wheat as prolonged waterlogging in the low-lying region has increased salt concentration in the soil.Fields in nearly 10 villages were inundated after the catchment area of the Aspal drain in Fazilka, Muktsar and Ferozepur districts witnessed heavy rainfall on August 21 and 22. Due to heavy inflow of rainwater, the drain breached its banks near the Seeto Gunno area of Abohar and it led to flooding in the adjoining areas.Nearly 21,000 hectare land in Abohar region remained submerged for about 40 days and it led to considerable damage to kharif crops, mainly cotton.Farmers like Sandeep Kumar of Dutarwali village said it has become a challenge to plough marshy fields. “Though water has been drained out from the fields this week, a white layer or ‘shora’ or efflorescence has surfaced all around. I doubt if wheat seeds could germinate in the fields with a high concentration of salt. It will be a serious economic setback to farmers if the existing adverse soil condition does not allow wheat sowing,” he said.Punjab Agricultural University has advised commencing wheat sowing after October 25.Nirmal Singh of Raipura rues lack of much support from the state authorities. “My cotton crop on six acres was completely damaged while it is impossible to harvest paddy on other four acres land as the machines cannot enter the wet fields. Since fields in Raipura and Sardarpura were filled with water, there is no scope to sow wheat. Four families pooled nearly Rs 2 lakh to dewater our 50 acres land and we have left with no resource for the next season after complete loss of kharif crops,” he added.Another farmer, Kulwant Bishnoi, suffered an estimated loss of Rs 25 lakh after cotton and rice on 52 acre land was submerged.“As the groundwater table is very high in the area, it is unlikely that fields will get any respite in the next few days. Traditionally, wheat sowing in the semi-arid belt begins in the first week of November and we are keeping fingers crossed for the season ahead,” he said.Dutarwali sarpanch Surinder Kumar Bishnoi said 2,200-acre farm area in their village was almost submerged for 40 days.“The drain had caused havoc in the area earlier also but the authorities concerned did not come forward with a solution. As the government provided ample support to drain out water, it should now release compensation to the affected farmers without any delay,” he said.Fazilka agriculture officer Sarwan Singh said farmers in a sizeable area may be unable to sow wheat due to adverse conditions while a large area may witness late sowing if the situation improves in the next week three weeks. From the coming week, the department experts will start issuing wheat sowing advisory on the basis of soil and water testing of the affected areas, he added.“Our field assessment said 17,000-hectare cotton area and nearly 4,500 hectares under paddy cultivation was affected. The revenue department is undertaking ‘girdwari’ of the affected area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/uncertainty-over-wheat-sowing-looms-large-in-abohar-villages/story-dtkvJlujqh3fXPEEI8X49I.html

It has converted politics into a thriving commercial activity. The ruling party is aware that it’s going to face a massive defeat in the upcoming bypolls. The BJP’s lust for power is evident. I am appealing to the public to give a befitting reply to the BJP for its brand of dirty politics,” Kamal Nath alleged.The BJP responded to Kamal Nath’s allegations.“Congress MLAs felt neglected and humiliated during their government’s 15-month misrule, where more attention was paid by Kamal Nath to industrialists and celebrities than his own lawmakers. The depressed Congress legislators are impressed with the BJP governments’ development agenda at both the Centre and the state under the able guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Minister for Home Affair Amit Shah and MP CM Chouhan,” said Vijesh Lunawat, who is the vice-president of the BJP’s MP unit.Earlier on March 10, 22 Congress legislators had resigned from the assembly in an act of rebellion against the then CM Kamal Nath, leading to the collapse of the 15-month-old state government.Three more Congress lawmakers had resigned from the assembly in July and joined the BJP.Lodhi is the 26th Congress legislator to join the BJP.All 25 former Congress lawmakers, including 12 who are ministers in the Chouhan-led government, are seeking re-election to the state assembly on BJP tickets in bypolls slated to be held on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/cong-mla-resigns-from-mp-assembly-joins-bjp-in-run-up-to-bypolls/story-rXGFTvlBqLg56kv41Q9CJM.html
25-10-2020||Dehradun||Delayed Mahakumbh work to be monitored through CCTVs||The Kumbh Mela administration has decided to install closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) cameras at all the major construction sites for Mahakumbh 2021. The decision has been taken in order to monitor the construction work that is still pending while the time is running out -- only three months are left of this year and the mela is set to begin in January 2021.According to officials, monitoring through CCTVs will assist them in ensuring time-bound completion of the work. They said some sites had reported slow pace of work and laxity by those involved in construction work. In this regard, a monitoring committee has been set up to assess, monitor and check the progress of all Kumbh-related work. The committee reports on a daily basis to the mela administration officer in-charge. Mela officer in-charge Deepak Rawat has routinely been inspecting the construction sites to gauge the progress of the works. “On sites where construction work has not been found satisfactory, directives have been given to carry out work under the closed-circuit cameras, so that these can be monitored virtually. By December-end, we have to ensure all permanent nature work gets completed. Through on-site physical and virtual monitoring, we are assessing the progress of Kumbh project,” said Rawat, while inspecting Sukhi rivulet, where construction of a 44-metre-long bridge is going on at Bhoopatwala. Meanwhilem public work department secretary R Sudhanshu has assured that there will be no compromise on the quality of work. The Mela administration had sought additional time from the Irrigation department of Uttar Pradesh to extend the Ganga canal closure from a fortnight to a month this year. Ganga canal closure from October 14-November 15 has expedited the construction work. Also, the nodal agencies are working in two shifts to meet the deadline.

25-10-2020||Dehradun||Char Dham shrine portals to close for winter months beginning November 15||In keeping with the tradition of announcing dates of closing of the portals of the Char Dham shrines on the day of Dussehra, the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board said on Sunday that this year, the portals of the Badrinath temple will be closed for the winter months on November 19. Likewise, the portals of Gangotri will be closed on November 15 (Govardhan Puja, next day of Diwali)) and portals of Yamunotri and Kedarnath shrines on November 16 (Bhaidooj). The additional chief executive officer of the Board, B D Singh, said the auspicious time for closing the portals of the Char Dham shrines is arrived at through astrological calculations by local temple bodies and priests. Also read | Religious tourism may get boost as Uttarakhand eases curbs“In case of Kedarnath and Yamunotri, it is a tradition that their portals close on Bhaidooj, which falls on November 16 this year,” he said Singh said portals of Badrinath will close at 3.35 pm on November 19, those of Kedarnath at 8.30 am on November 16 and those of Gangotri at 12.15 pm on November 15. Besides these Char Dham shrines, the portals of Tungnath temple will be closed on November 4 The four Himalayan pilgrimage sites of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath -- collectively called the Char Dham, located in Garhwal Himalayas -- are among the most revered pilgrimages in the Hindu tradition and attract hundreds of thousands of pilgrims each year. It is believed that every Hindu should undertake Char Dham pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime to avail the blessings of gods adorning the shrines. Traditionally, the Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east. Last year, a record 2.9 million pilgrims visited Char Dham compared to over 2.7 million pilgrims the previous year. This year, so far over 135,000 pilgrims have visited the shrines since July 1. After relaxations under Unlock 5.0 with the exemption of mandatory negative Covid-19 report, the number of pilgrims visiting these shrines has increased. Char Dham shrines were opened to people in the state on July 1. They have been open to people from other states since July 25. Given the increase in pilgrim influx, the Char Dham board earlier this month increased the number of pilgrims who can visit the shrines now. The number of pilgrims allowed daily has been increased to 3,000 for Badrinath, 3,000 for Kedarnath, 900 for Gangotri and 700 for Yamunotri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/char-dham-shrine-portals-to-close-for-winter-months-beginning-november-15/story-v3pNeRp8VhnNFVSIbil3qI.html
25-10-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 and Kanjak puja: Home chefs to cook up Navratri delights||Amid the coronavirus outbreak, Navratri celebrations are subdued and too much #WorkFromHome has made people turn to home chefs, to help them cook up a delight for Kanya Pujan — where they worship nine girls on Ashtami (the eighth day) or Navmi (the ninth day) day of the fasting period. Most working individuals feel that seeking help from home chefs is a comfortable option in these times.Amita Garg, a Gurugram-based home chef, who has been preparing Navratri delicacies since last five years, says, “This year, people who are busy juggling work and home, and are unable to find time to prepare bhog for Kanjak, are placing orders with us for home delivery of food. There is a sense of trust and faith since they know that we prepare our food keeping in mind utmost hygiene, and they know that I too fast during Navratri.” The bhog includes halwa poori and chhole, that is offered to young girls worshipped as Durga incarnations. “Some customers have even requested us to add in titbits such as chips or chocolates, so we’ll include those as well in the packets that we will make for Ashtami and Navmi,” adds Garg.For Teena Ahluwalia, a lawyer based in Delhi’s IP Extension, chefs like Garg are helpful in the time of need. “I’ve immense work pressure, which has increased manifold during Covid times. While I try to make bhog for kanyas on Ashtami and Navami, it’s not going to be possible with my schedule this year. Home chefs make great Navratri food, and from their home kitchens that are sanitised, so I will be asking one to make and deliver it to my place on the day of the puja,” says Ahluwalia, adding that ordering in from home chefs is a safer option since it assures quality as well as safety, which is paramount during this time.Another home chef Abhilasha Jain, a Gurugram resident who specialises in vegetarian food, says orders for vrat (fasting) food picked up amid the pandemic. “A lot of working women placed orders for Kanjak bhog with us. This year, people didn’t want to risk the safety of young girls by calling them home for puja. So, I was asked to deliver the bhog at 7 in the morning to their homes, so that they can in turn drop the packages to the homes of young girls,” she says, adding that for people who have to go to their offices, Jain had the option of packing the bhog in steel boxes that people could safely deliver to the Kanjaks on their way to work.Abha Bhhakoo, a resident of Dwarka, agrees that the provision of having home chefs cook for Kanjaks eased her work. She says, “I’ve certain commitments because of which I wasn’t able to make the food myself. So I’ve asked a home chef to make it for me. Plus, it may not be safe to ask young girls to come home for the puja, so I plan to get the bhog packed in cute tiffin boxes, which can be delivered to the girls at the comfort of their homes. This way we will continue the tradition, and yet not put their health at risk.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-and-kanjak-puja-home-chefs-to-cook-up-navratri-delights/story-dlMqqlQoxCHVXLRCTsCAIN.html
25-10-2020||City||Punjab and Haryana high court takes suo motu notice of accused’s details shared on Facebook||Chandigarh Taking suo motu notice of the Ludhiana Police sharing personal details of an accused in a car theft case on Facebook, the Punjab and Haryana high court has sought a personal affidavit from the Ludhiana police commissioner.The bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh warned that if an affidavit was not filed, the commissioner would be summoned to the court. The high court acted on the plea of a Ludhiana man, who had approached it on September 8, seeking a compensation of Rs 10 lakh and directions to the police to remove all his personal details from social media platforms, shared by the department upon his arrest.Last week, when the case was taken up again, the youth told court that police have now removed his details and that the matter be disposed of now. The court, however, did not entertain his request.“...though learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he wishes to withdraw this petition as the respondents have removed posts from Facebook and other social media platforms and therefore the petitioner does not want to pursue the petition; however, since this is an issue which would be affecting the public at large, this court, while taking suo motu notice of the matter, directs that an affidavit by the commissioner of police, Ludhiana, shall be filed in court, after which the petitioner may be allowed to withdraw the petition,” the bench observed. The FIR came to be registered on July 21, under police station division 5 of Ludhiana. After his arrest, the commissioner’s office and the local police uploaded his photographs, name, father’s name and address etc on social networking sites, including Facebook. After this, social media users started criticising and abusing him in their posts. Some even reached his house, abused his parents and instigated locals to throw the parents out of the city, his counsel Sandeep Kumar had told court.‘LIVES THREATENED DUE TO POLICE ACTION’ “It is settled law that everyone is presumed to be innocent, until and unless proved guilty after due trial. There is no provision in the CrPC to upload photographs of any accused/ convicts on any social media or to display them at any public place stating to the effect that such persons are culprits/accused,” Kumar had told court. He added that the threat to the life of petitioner and his parents persisted as some people were coming to their house, spitting on their door and abusing them loudly.Kumar added that the father had submitted a representation before police on August 21 to remove all social media posts but no action was taken. The petitioner has suffered and is continuously suffering huge losses and defamation due to the social media posts. Now, even if he is acquitted in the FIRs, still he will not be accepted in society and no one would employ him. His personal, professional and social life is destroyed, Kumar had told court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-takes-suo-motu-notice-of-accused-s-details-shared-on-fb/story-NVy6rm4sfARvd4q3Lq3lWL.html

25-10-2020||Mumbai||Dussehra: Maharashtra CM Thackeray to address Sena’s annual rally today||Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will address the party’s annual rally on Sunday on the occasion of Dussehra. Thackeray is likely to hit out at the Opposition in his speech at the event, which will be held at Savarkar Memorial in Dadar, Mumbai.The live streaming of his speech is set to reach about 20 million people in Maharashtra, said Sanjay Raut, chief spokesperson of the Sena and a Rajya Sabha (RS) member.This year’s Dussehra rally is significant because this is the first time a Sena chief is also the Maharashtra CM. Besides Thackeray, his family members, other Sena leaders and members of the Maharashtra legislative assembly (MLAs) from Mumbai will be present at the event.“Last year, I had said that the next Dussehra rally will be addressed by a Sena CM. This year’s Dussehra rally has an extraordinary importance. Our chief, who is also the Maharashtra CM, will address millions of Sainiks today,” Raut told media persons on Sunday.Over the past few months, the Opposition has targeted CM Thackeray and the Sena over the alleged death by suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput on June 14. He has been in the line of fire after actor Kangana Ranaut weighed in on the role of the Mumbai Police in the probe into Rajput’s death. Earlier, the CM was also attacked following the lynching of two Hindu seers in Palghar on April 16.Thackeray had said that he would remove the “mask of CM” at an opportune time and speak on these issues. Raut said the Dussehra rally could be the “perfect stage” for the Sena chief to dwell on these topics.“I cannot comment on what exactly Uddhav ji will speak about, but he will definitely speak on these topics. He has said in the past that he would take off the mask of CM and speak. The Dussehra rally is the perfect stage for it. Uddhav ji is fully prepared.... He will also give directions to the party and the state as it is a Sena-led coalition government also comprising the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress,” Raut added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-thackeray-to-address-sena-s-annual-rally-today/story-tqLDHdqAbUBslBcGLk8OeL.html
25-10-2020||Jaipur||Man held in Rajasthan’s Barmer on suspicion of spying for Pakistan||Rajasthan Police’s special branch has detained a man (28) from Barmer district on suspicion of spying for Pakistan, officials said on Sunday. The accused, Roshan Din, works as a JCB driver in the Bharat Mala Project on the India-Pakistan border in Barmer, police said. “The accused was in touch with an ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) agent. He shared confidential details about the movement of security forces’ vehicles in the border area. He was paid for the tip-off, which he had shared via video calls,” said Umesh Mishra, additional director-general of police (ADG), intelligence, Rajasthan Police. Also read: Four held for robbing jewellery worth Rs 90 lakh last weekMishra said Din has been brought from Barmer to Jaipur, where central and state agencies are questioning him to obtain more details, which may lead to his arrest and registration of a case under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), 1923. Another police official, who didn’t want to be named, said Din was on the radar of the criminal intelligence department (CID) for over six months. “So far, it has been found that the accused used to send audio recordings to a Pakistani agent. Some pictures of movement of border forces were also sent by him to Pakistan. His interrogation is in progress,” the official said. Din has relatives in Pakistan and he has visited to the neighbouring country to meet them several times. “During his visit to Pakistan, the ISI had lured him by offering money. He recently got Rs 10,000 from an ISI agent.” This is the third case of espionage reported from Barmer in the last four months. On August 27, a man (40), identified as Mushtaq Ali, was arrested on charges of sharing confidential information about border areas with Pakistani agencies. Ali allegedly used to share confidential information via social media at the behest of a Pakistani handler. Ali’s father Khandu Khan was also arrested in Barmer August 9 in a narcotics and fake Indian counterfeit note (FICN) racket case. On September 8, Meera Khan (38), who is allegedly an aide of Ali, was arrested on charges of espionage. Khan had allegedly shared information with Pakistani agents before the Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes, which were carried out in February 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/man-held-in-rajasthan-s-barmer-on-suspicion-of-spying-for-pakistan/story-7rIRSx0LRnHbicaZXlWUNJ.html

25-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: New plant species discovered in northern Western Ghats||Researchers from India and Italy have discovered a new plant species of the Sahyadri globe thistle, Echinops sahyadricus, from the Rajgad Fort area in Pune district, which is located in the Sahyadri hills in the northern Western Ghats of Maharashtra.The newly discovered species, under the genus Echinops (spiny thistle) and an erect branched flowering herb with stout stems, is endemic to western Maharashtra and found only on a few open hilltops in the northern Western Ghats.The discovery by the Mumbai-based botanist Sushant More from Sathaye College, Vile Parle, Mumbai, in collaboration with Fabio Conti from the University of Camerino, Italy, and Harshal Bhosale from the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Mumbai, was published in the Nordic Journal of Botany last Friday.Also read: Centre’s panel issues advisory for forest staff during Chandrapur tiger captureThe new species is distributed from Salher in Nashik District, which is located in the north and south of Kolhapur district, in the northern Western Ghats and grows mostly on open mountain slopes from 800 to 1400 metres (m) above sea level. It grows during monsoon – between June and September -- and flowers bloom in November. The fruiting occurs in December.“The importance of this discovery highlights the hidden treasures of the Western Ghats in Maharashtra and infrastructure projects such as road widening and construction activities along these forts could affect the population of the species,” said More.Researchers said the new species was unique due to the size of its composite inflorescence because a large number of small flowers clustered together. “They measure up to 9 centimetres (cm) in diameter, which is relatively large compared to other Echinops species around the world,” said More. “There are about 130 species of Echinops in the world, out of which five species are found in the country and two in Maharashtra alone. This species is named after the Sahyadri hills,” he added.The new species is similar to other species found in the country such as Indian globe thistle (Echinops echinatus) and the great globe thistle (Echinops sphaerocephalus). “However, we can distinguish the new species based on its unique size, inflorescence, arrangement of phyllaries (spine-like bracts) around the floret (smaller flowers making up the main flower head) and type of leaves surface,” said More.In India, Echinops are distributed across the Himalayas and neighbouring areas, while a species is endemic to Rajasthan. The new species is endemic to Maharashtra. However, the Usnakantaka (Echinops echinatus Roxb) is found across Indian sub-continent, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Myanmar in dry open scrublands.In October, three new odonate species of Reedtail damselflies (Protosticta species) were discovered from across three states in the southern Western Ghats. Last week, a tiny and colourful fish species inhabiting streams and water rich in oxygen, Schistura, a freshwater loach, was discovered from the Sahyadris.“All these findings show that the Western Ghats have potential from both the floral and faunal point of view and need to be protected,” said Rajendra Shinde, botanist and principal of St Xavier’s College in Mumbai.In early October, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to declare the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ), spread across 4 lakh square (sq) kilometres (km) in Western Ghats, spanning across six states, by December. The notification has been pending for the past six years.Of the proposed 56,825 sq. km, all the six states have proposed that over 6,000 sq km be further reduced from the notification, an affidavit by the MoEFCC submitted before the NGT had stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-new-plant-species-discovered-in-northern-western-ghats/story-xYzo17LNW3hckQf7ntMDFN.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||250 firefighters, 228 tankers: How Mumbai mall fire was doused||The fire that had been raging since Friday at a mall in south Mumbai was finally extinguished on Sunday morning. The cooling operations are, however, still underway. Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said the fire at the City Centre Mall was extinguished at 5.08 am, 56 hours after it started. “Since there are many combustible items in many shops in the mall, such as mobile phone batteries, chargers and wires, cooling operations are still going on,” a fire official added. The fire broke out in a shop on the second floor of the mall in the Nagpada area at 8.53 pm on Thursday, as a level 1 (small fire). It soon spread to other floors and the Mumbai fire brigade declared it a brigade call – level 5, an event in which the chief fire officer is required to be present – at 2.42 am on Friday.Over 250 firefighters and 228 tankers were deployed to bring the blaze under control. “The mall is spread on a huge area, with around 400 shops on every floor. The major problem which we are facing is that the fire flames are falling from the ceiling, owing to which we are unable to move without restrictions to douse the blaze,” an MFB official had said on Saturday. He had also pointed to the risk of explosion due to the presence of mobile batteries, chargers, and power banks. As many as six firemen, including a deputy fire officer, were hospitalised in the city’s Nair Hospital due to suffocation. “Prima facie, we have found that there were sprinklers, but we will investigate if there was adequate fire safety equipment and if they were functional,” the MFB said. After the fire escalated to level 5 on, around 3,500 people from a neighbouring residential building were evacuated and rushed to safety as thick smoke had engulfed the 55-storey building premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/250-firefighters-228-tankers-how-mumbai-mall-fire-was-doused/story-h6Yv7M3wAJ3r6eYonuYN7M.html
25-10-2020||Delhi||Dussehra’s eco-friendly avatar: Delhi-NCR residents say won’t burn effigies but will cut cake||Every year, huge effigies and firecrackers mark the victory of good over evil in Delhi-NCR, as part of the grand celebrations for Dussehra. Needless to say it adds to the already poor AQI, and increases noise pollution as well. But in Covid-19 pandemic, quite a few denizens will usher the spirit of this festival in eco-friendly ways.Burning Ravana, digitally With restricted Ramlila celebrations in Delhi-NCR, to curb the impact of Covid-19, quite a few locals have in mind to avoid crowded places and have thus come up with an innovative solution to witness Ravana dahan. Akanksha Pandey, a homemaker from north Delhi, says, “At home all these months, my husband and I have been teaching our 5-year-old daughter about our mythology. But, we don’t feel it’s safe for her to go in a crowded place to witness Ravana dahan. So, we have decided to make a digital Ramlila story with voice overs from her grandparents, at the end of which we will burn an effigy of Ravana on the computer screen! We want our daughter to know about our culture, and we also want her to grow up with eco-friendly values, celebrating all festivals in a green way.”An effigy, you can eat too!“Instead of using plastic, paper or crackers, I’ll be baking a Ravana cake, and cut it to celebrate Dussehra this year,” says Prabhkeen Kaur, a baker based out of Hari Nagar. “Over the last few years, I saw people making Ravana effigies from plastic and that cause so much pollution in my locality. So I’m taking the green route this year. Plus, it’s the need of the hour, with the pandemic having taught us the values of a clean and healthy environment,” she adds. Soon after she had put a photo of her Ravana effigy cake online, people have been requesting her to bake it for them, too. Kaur feels the cake serves an important purpose; letting her and her family stay safe at home and yet revel in the festive fervour. She says, “Instead of noise and air pollution, if you can let good emerge triumphant with a symbolic cake, so why not!” Learn and make your own Ravana effigy  A green lifestyle needs to be passed on to our children, and celebrating festivals like Dussehra in an environment-friendly manner is therefore of great significance. This is what made members of The Stagecrackers, a Gurugram-based group organise a Ravana effigy-making class for youngsters, via a mobile app. “Pollution in Delhi is a widespread issue, and we want to teach our children about keeping their environment safe,” says Nidhi Lamba, the founding member of the group, and a resident of Gurugram’s DLF Phase 2, adding, “Because of the pandemic, parents aren’t keen to partake in Dussehra celebrations physically. So, we are organising an online class for kids to make the faces of Ravana at home from simple, recyclable materials. This will keep them engaged and also help them learn about the relevance of the festival of Dussehra.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dussehra-s-eco-friendly-avatar-delhi-ncr-residents-say-won-t-burn-effigies-but-will-cut-cake/story-zoAuulvD2mPbHXv11CSPUJ.html
25-10-2020||Delhi||Ramlila 2020: Ravana might be scared of Rama, but for corona there’s sanitiser!||Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman battle Ravana, but with social distancing. Delhi’s long-standing Ramlila traditions have found new moulds this year, in the wake of government restrictions on large gatherings. With few guests and even fewer actors, many Ramlila committees in the city are braving the pandemic to perform live in front of the audience for a few days, this year. 6 feet ki doori, Ravana ko bhi zaruriYash Chauhan, director of Delhi’s Sanskriti Kala Sangam, says they’re going to perform in Karkardooma on Dussehra, reducing their Ramlila program, that usually spanned across days, to a mere three-hour-long dance drama. “Safety of members and guests is paramount,” insists Chauhan, adding, “We also decided to go digital this year, and recorded our Ramlila scenes both indoors and on the banks of Yamuna, which we are telecasting on our social media. We did this because we want least public interaction. We’ve choreographed everything keeping distance in mind, we’ll be performing live on Dussehra.”Shri Ramlila Committee at Indraprastha is also going live for three days with a digital telecast. “We’ve booked the Ipex Bhavan in Patparganj and humne 200 logo ki gathering ke liye prepare kara hai. There is a gap of six feet between chairs, aur hum poori Ramlila sirf teen ghante mein dikhayenge. People were keen on not breaking the tradition, so we have reduced the number of artistes as well,” says Suman Prakash Gupta, the committee’s director.Rama ho ya Ravana, everyone needs a sanitiserBackstage as well, actors are adhering to safety measures. “Before we started preparing, we all underwent a Covid-19 test, and then only we started rehearsing,” says Abhishek Sharma, who is performing with Shri Azad Ramlila Kala Kendra in Maujpur, since the first day of Navratri. “We are checking the temperature of all artistes and guests who are coming to see the show. Backstage bhi hum masks pehente hain aur scenes ke beech mein sanitiser use kar rahe hain. Ram ho ya Ravan, is waqt sanitiser ki zarurat toh sabko hai,” he chuckles. Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra’s (SBKK) annual dance drama, Shri Ram is also adhering to all the guidelines issued by the concerned authorities for Covid-19 prevention. “At the entrance we are doing thermal screening of each and every visitor, and also giving them hand sanitisers. Everyone has to wear a mask for the entire duration of the performance! Also, people are being seated with a gap of one seat between them and the first row has been kept at a distance of 10 feet from the stage. All the actors and staff were tested before we premiered the show on October 17, and all have tested negative. Hence the show goes on,” says Shobha Deepak Singh, director, SBKK. In Delhi’s Vinod Nagar as well, Kamdhenu Ramlila Committee has been performing in front of an audience of 200 people. Kids under 10 and guests over the age of 60 are not allowed! And all entrants are being provided sanitisers and masks, right at the gate. “We maintain a distance of one foot while performing. Plus we are acting in a way that the audience thinks there is contact but there is no physical contact between actors. We are also sanitising all props before and after use,” says Himanshu Visht, who is playing the titular role of Rama. When Rama said, ‘Corona se bachne ke liye samay samay pe haath dhoye’ Separate make-up rooms, thermal scanning, free masks, social-distancing, Gurugram’s one of the oldest Ramlila is taking place after months of uncertainty, and with all the safety norms in place. Raj Saini, from Durga Ramlila, says, “Kalakaar ka utsah thoda kam hain iss baar, kyunki kalakar ka utsah tabhi badta hai jab samne baithne wale darshak dher saari taliyon se samman karte hai. Earlier there used to be 1,200-1,500 people in audience, which has now reduced to 400 people. The distance between audience and artistes is 15 feet. We tried a performance with face shields on, but in vain because of the fog it creates while talking. Since we are performing in the Covid era, this time the character of Rama will say: ‘Jis tarah se yeh rakshas is prithvi pe hai, jinka main sarvanash karne aaya hoon, issi tarah se aaj ke yug mein corona hai, usse bachne ke liye apne ghar par rahe aur samah samah pe haath dhote rahe.”‘Ravan bhi corona ka nash karna chahta hain’“Jisko pakda woh kaal ke panje mein phas gaya, jisko dabaya woh rasatal zameen mein dhas gaya,” says Aditya Meena aka Ravana from Durga Ramlila in Gurugram, which has been running since 19 years. Before he enters the stage, he tells us: “I was motivated to play Ravana this year... I used sanitiser on the stage kyunki Ravana bhi corona ka nash karna chahta hai! Isliye usne stage pe sanitiser use karke logon ko jagrook kiya. People started clapping and cheering. Every year we used to hug everyone, but now one has to maintain social distancing even from family members, especially with the elderly. Even during rehearsals, we maintained social distancing. And for one month we wore masks to practise... Saans lene mein bahut dikat hoti thi (It was too difficult to breathe with the face mask on while we were rehearsing for the show).”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ramlila-2020-ravana-might-be-scared-of-rama-but-for-corona-there-s-sanitiser/story-ZTWuXeTWGaqFegU647y1sJ.html
25-10-2020||City||SGPC task force, Sikh outfits protesting over missing ‘saroops’ clash at Golden Temple, 15 injured||At least 15 persons were injured when a clash between the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) task force and members of some Sikh organisations protesting over the missing Guru Granth Sahib ‘saroops’ episode turned violent in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar on Saturday. The incident took place when task force tried to evict the protesters staging an indefinite sit-in in front the SGPC headquarters, Teja Singh Samundri Hall. Many of those leading the protest were held captive inside the SGPC office and thrashed by the task force personnel. The Sikh outfits, including the Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee, have been protesting since September 14 seeking justice in the missing saroops episode for which SGPC staffers were held guilty by a probe committee. How it unfoldedIt started early morning when Sukhjit Singh Khose, one of the protest leaders, locked the gate of the Teja Singh Samundri Hall after he claimed to have been humiliated by the SGPC employees. He along with his aides sat on the side gate blocking the entry to the head office for hours. When SGPC additional secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhoora along with other staff objected to it, the two had a verbal spat, said the eyewitnesses. Around 1pm, the SGPC staff forcibly took Khose inside and thrashed him badly. Thereafter, the SGPC personnel carrying sticks and kirpans tried to evict the protesters numbering 10 to 15, leading to a scuffle in which Sarbjit Singh, a gurdwara body employee, sustained deep injuries near his chest. He was hospitalised and was being operated upon by doctors. SGPC additional secretary Bijay Singh also got injured.Then the SGPC staff forcibly the protest leaders Balbir Singh Muchhal, Dilbag Singh, Manjit Singh Chabhal, Bibi Manjinder Kaur and Paramjit Singh Akali to a room and beat them up badly. They were held captive for four hours. To protest the move, their supporters gathered at the gate and started raising slogans.Police turn up after hours A police team turned up at the spot hours after the clash. Also, the SGPC employees attacked the journalists present at the spot to stop them from covering the incident. A reporter of a vernacular newspaper was slapped and his smartphone was snatched. They forcibly took a TV cameraman inside the office and kept him captive for several hours. He was released after the journalists staged a dharna outside the head office and lodged a police complaint. The SGPC officials claimed it was the protesters who attacked their employees first. “The activists were violating the maryada of the Golden Temple. They crossed their limits when they blocked the entrance to the SGPC head office and used objectionable words against our employees,” said gurdwara body general secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami. The SGPC staff thrashed and injured another group of Sikh activists who came in support of the protesters. Later, the car of SGPC additional secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhoora, who was seen directing the SGPC task force at the time of the clash, was attacked by unidentified persons with sharp-edged weapons when he was returning him. His driver was injured even as Bhoore had a narrow escape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sgpc-task-force-sikh-activists-protesting-over-missing-saroops-clash-at-golden-temple-15-injured/story-XOmFe2QGazpBvjUFVsnUaL.html
25-10-2020||Election:||RJD stresses job pledge, vows farm loan waiver||The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) released its manifesto for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections on Saturday, reiterating its pledge to provide a million government jobs if elected to power even as it indicated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s promise of generating 1.9 million jobs was a strategy to “fool” voters.The RJD’s 17-point manifesto, running into 20 pages, also announced the waiver of farm loans, higher minimum support price for farmers, better health care facilities, 22% of the state budget allocated for education (as compared to a little over 20% in 2020-21), regularisation of ad hoc workers in some sectors and plans to develop smart villages.“We have talked about issues such as employment, women’s empowerment, agri industry, education, smart villages, panchayati raj institute, poverty, community development, and health care services,” Tejashwi Yadav, the chief ministerial face of the opposition alliance led by the RJD, said at the party office after the release of the manifesto.“If we had to make fake promises like the BJP did... we would have promised to give five million or 10 million jobs,” he said. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar has been raising doubts about our promise of providing one million jobs. So how will his future government fulfil ally BJP’s declaration of 1.9 million jobs? Who are they fooling?” he asked.In its 11-point Sankalp Patra (document of pledges), the BJP pledged to generate 1.9 million jobs, expand the minimum support price regime, and recruit 300,000 teachers, among others. It also promised free Covid-19 vaccines for Bihar whenever they are approved.Reaching out to the youth, the RJD’s manifesto pledged to waive fees needed to apply for government jobs and also promised 85% reservation in public service for the state’s students. It also talked about the concept of “equal pay for equal work” along with providing ₹1,500 unemployment allowance a month to those up to the age of 35 years.“This is not a manifesto but our party’s pledge to bring about a change...Every sector has been taken into consideration while preparing this; it will make the state happy and prosperous,” Tejashwi Yadav, 31, said.He also spoke about developing smart villages with concrete roads and free computer centres in every panchayat. For the betterment of health infrastructure, a dialysis centre — free for the poor — was promised in each district. On the education front, apart from increasing budgetary allocations, the manifesto promised speedy hiring of teachers at government schools and a focus on e-learning.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/rjd-stresses-job-pledge-vows-farm-loan-waiver/story-N9yonKCQxX8y74aOGCVXfL.html

25-10-2020||Election:||Ahead of first phase of Bihar polls, barbs fly thick and fast||With days left before assembly elections kick off in Bihar, top leaders from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition Grand Alliance (GA) are trying to add more firepower to their campaigns. Seventy-one assembly seats go to the polls in the first of three phases on October 28.Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is seeking a fourth straight term, addressed a poll rally in Alauli assembly seat — associated with Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan — but refrained from speaking anything either against the party or its president, Chirag Paswan, who has been attacking him regularly and decided to fight the polls independently after breaking away from the ruling NDA.Ram Vilas Paswan, a Dalit icon who died on October 8 at 74, had started his political innings in 1969 from Alauli. The reserved seat includes Paswan’s birth place, Saharbbani village, in the Khagaria district.The constituency is witnessing a three-cornered contest between the Janata Dal (United), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the LJP. Kumar’s party has fielded Sadhna Sada, RJD has given ticket to Rambriksha Sada while Chirag’s LJP has put Ramchandra Sada on the seat that will go to vote in the second phase on November 3.Taking a swipe at the RJD, Kumar said: “Those who neglected education, health and roads construction and spent time in encouraging ‘jungle raj’ are today talking about development...its nothing but a joke.” Chirag Paswan, however, continued his tirade against Kumar by saying that, if elected to power, the LJP will launch a probe into the JD(U) ‘Saat Nischay’ (seven resolves) Scheme, and prosecute officials and the CM if they are found responsible for corruption. Addressing a rally in Chenari, Paswan said Kumar failed in governance and the state was facing its worst ever crisis in health care, farming and employment sectors.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda took a dig at the RJD and Tejashwi Yadav’s poll promise of one million jobs. “Lawlessness is the nature of RJD. They never sought forgiveness for what they did to the people of Bihar. This implies that they still have the same intentions. Nitish Kumar knew that good governance cannot be achieved while in power with the RJD alliance. This is why he broke ties with them and came with BJP,” Nadda said during a rally at Biharsharif.Union minister Smriti Irani, too, addressed a rally at Munger where she reminded people of the fodder scam. “Bihar’s self-respecting people don’t pray to God for a chance to get money in fodder scam. While praying to goddess Laxmi, they find that she neither comes by holding ‘haath’ of Congress nor brings ‘Lalten’. She comes by sitting on ‘Kamal’,” she said.Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, which is contesting elections in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Lok Samta Party, also addressed a rally in favour of RLSP candidate Birendra Kumar Singh from Bhabua. “Atrocities, poverty and unemployment were the fate of people here during 15 years of rule of RJD and NDA each. Bihar was the only state in the country where 48,000 patients were left on mercy of a single doctor. Here, education system had completely collapsed and youth go to Rajasthan, Delhi and Mumbai to complete their education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/ahead-of-first-phase-of-bihar-polls-barbs-fly-thick-and-fast/story-Fnn7dsCKP0eGkFwk5CexoI.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to soon begin Phase-3 of Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine trial||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has completed the second phase of clinical trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The civic body will soon start third-phase trials as the first batch of volunteers of the second phase completed 28 days since their first vaccination on Friday. On September 26, the first dosage of the second phase of trial was given to three volunteers between 20 and 45 years old at KEM Hospital. As many as 200 healthy volunteers participated in the second phase of the trial of the vaccine candidate, Covidshield. Both, King Edward Memorial (KEM) and BYL Nair hospitals, which are conducting the trials, will now submit their reports to the data safety monitoring board under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (the national regulatory body for medicines made in India) to seek approval for the Phase-3 of the trial. “With the approval, we will be able to start the third phase of the trial as the first set of volunteers completed 28 days of the first vaccination. As per ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), the third trial can only be conducted on volunteers after a gap of 28 days,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, also confirmed that they are soon to start the third phase of the trial. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has partnered with British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine, formulated at the University of Oxford. Meanwhile, SII has suggested the civic body to include 50 more volunteers for the first phase of the trial, following which, both the hospitals have written to ICMR seeking approval. “As we have achieved our target of 100 volunteers, we have asked ICMR if they want us to include more volunteers. So far, we haven’t received any response. However, we have kept additional volunteers on standby,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair hospital. However, Kakani said that BMC is unlikely to wait any further for ICMR’s response and will start the third-phase trial. “We can’t wait any further as we need to provide the dosage in the third phase to the first set of volunteers who have completed their 28 days of waiting period,” he said. In August, when ICMR selected the two Mumbai-based hospitals to run clinical trials for the vaccine, they were instructed to enrol 160 volunteers at each hospital. Later, the number of total volunteers was reduced to 100 each for the second phase of the trial. As per ICMR, every volunteer is covered by a life insurance worth Rs1 crore in the event of death owing to any side-effect of the vaccine administered during the trial. They are also covered under a medical insurance of Rs50 lakh for the treatment of any possible adverse effect from the vaccination. In the second week of September, both hospitals had to halt the trial after a participant developed an adverse reaction in the United Kingdom. Later, the Drugs Control General of India granted permission to run the second and third phases of the trial. However, both civic hospitals had to receive final approval from their ethics committees before starting with the screening of the volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-soon-begin-phase-3-of-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/story-F8MIsQWW5Q120ZgzpMCbCP.html
25-10-2020||City||Operations to douse south Mumbai mall fire continue for over 48 hours||Forty-eight hours after a fire broke out at Mumbai Central’s City Centre Mall, efforts were on to douse the blaze on Saturday. The Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said that the fire is under control but there are isolated spots where smaller flames continued to break out owing to minor explosions of mobile batteries and chargers that were stored inside the mall. On Saturday at 7.05pm, 55-year-old firefighter Chandrashekhar Sawant was rushed to in Nair Hospital after he complained of suffocation. On Friday, five firemen, including a deputy fire officer, were hospitalised due to suffocation. However, no civilian injuries were reported in the incident. The fire was reported in a shop on the second floor of the mall at 8.53pm on Thursday, as a level 1 (small fire). It soon spread to other floors and the Mumbai fire brigade declared it a brigade call – level 5, a rare event in which the chief fire officer is required to be present – at 2.42am. More than 250 firefighters are at the spot since Thursday night to douse the blaze and have utilised 228 tankers for freighting. “The mall is spread on a huge area, with around 400 shops on every floor. The major problem which we are facing is that the fire flames are falling from the ceiling, owing to which we are unable to move without restrictions to douse the blaze. Our risks are very calculated, and so the operations are taking time. Also, there is a huge presence of mobile batteries, chargers, power banks, all which have high potential to explode,” said an MFB official. The MFB said it has yet not found any fire safety violations inside the mall yet as a part of its investigations into the cause behind the blaze. “Prima facie, we have found that there were sprinklers, but we will investigate if there was adequate fire safety equipment and if they were functional. Currently, the focus is on dousing the fire and the task is getting difficult as some shops where the mini blasts are taking place have closed down shutters,” the MFB official said. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), too, said that it did not find any structural violations that jeopardised fire safety. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner, said, “We have checked our records and a few alterations were made, for which the permissions were issued by BMC. We will match the plan with the actual spot after the fire is doused. But we will issue a notice to the owners of the mall for verifying the documents.” On Saturday around 1am, Shiv Sena legislator and cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is also the city’s guardian minister, inspected the site. “Just visited the location of the fire incident at the City Centre Mall. I’ve been taking updates on it constantly. Thankfully till now there is no injury to human life. Our brave jawans of Mumbai Fire Brigade have worked along with technology like fire dousing robots successfully,” Thackeray tweeted. On Friday, around 3,500 residents of the nearby Orchid Enclave, a 55-storey building were vacated to safety, after thick smoke engulfed the building premises. “Now, we don’t mind if the residents wish to go back to their homes. But the direction of the smoke may change anytime due to wind pattern. The smoke is very thick and hence we have suggested the residents to stay where they are for the next one or two days till we are done with cooling operations,” the MFB official said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/operations-to-douse-south-mumbai-mall-fire-continue-for-over-48-hours/story-589vAIAtiXyIReBbzt6ohM.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Republic TV owners named as accused in TRP case||The Mumbai Police crime branch named the owners of Republic TV, News Nation and Maha Movie and some of their staff as accused in the case of alleged manipulation of television rating points (TRP). The matter came to light on Saturday when the Mumbai Police crime branch, in their remand plea filed before a magistrate’s court seeking extension of custody of two persons arrested in the case, which HT has seen, mentioned that the owners of the TV channels have been named as accused, though the names were withheld.When asked who the owners of the three channels were, Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner of police (crime) said, “We have not named anyone specific yet.” The development came on a day Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami was asked to attend the hearing for proposed chapter proceedings initiated against him by Mumbai police. Goswami’s lawyer attended the hearing and requested his client be exempted from physically appearing for the hearing. The police accepted the request and kept the next hearing of the matter on November 7. “On Saturday (October 24) Goswami was asked to appear and submit his version on the police’s say (opposing his previous version). But he did not appear for the second time. He would now have to appear before me on November 7,” said ACP Jambavdekar. When contacted by HT, Republic TV’s lawyer did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/republic-tv-owners-named-as-accused-in-trp-case/story-hhf8laHP0YsVqXWVhKNQnO.html
25-10-2020||City||Social activist Anjali Damania files complaint against NCP leader Eknath Khadse in Mumbai for ‘using derogatory language’ against her||Social activist Anjali Damania has filed a complaint against former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse at Vakola police station for allegedly using derogatory words against her on Friday at an event in which he was being inducted into the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). She said that despite warning Khadse, he continued his tirade and used “inappropriate words” against her at the public forum. “I have been asking Khadse to desist from using inappropriate words, but he continues to target me with such language. This time, I am determined to pursue the case to its logical end till Khadse is put behind bars,” said Damania, who along with couple of her colleagues visited Vakola police station on Saturday and demanded the officers to register a first information report (FIR) against Khadse. Khadse said that the complaint was lodged at the behest of former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, whose only intent he said was “cutting the newly-inducted NCP leader to size”. Khadse has been blaming Fadnavis for his defection to NCP. Meanwhile, Manjunath Singe, deputy commissioner police (DCP), zone 8, assured Damania that they would first study the complaint filed by her before registering an FIR. Damania said she will also seek an appointment with NCP chief Sharad Pawar to explain her side and wondered how the veteran leader kept quiet when Khadse targeted her in his presence during the event. In 2017 too, Damania had lodged a case against Khadse at Vakola police station for using “derogatory words” against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-activist-anjali-damania-files-complaint-against-ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-in-mumbai-for-using-derogatory-language-against-her/story-hG2uCTcqo1blUhnQUS13FM.html

25-10-2020||Mumbai||Kalyan-Dombivli blood banks in need of plasma donors||Nearly 94 per cent of the 52,000-plus total number of Covid cases in Kalyan-Dombivli have recovered. However, not even one per cent of those recovered have donated their plasma till date.As per the data with Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the three blood banks in Dombivli have collected 429 plasmas till October 19. From the donated plasma, a total of 846 bags were prepared and 815 of these have already been issued for therapy.As on October 19, the stock of plasma bags available with the three blood banks in Kalyan Dombivli was only 31.According to the Maharashtra state government records, the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KMDC) has recorded 52,500 Covid cases.Dr Pratibha Panpatil, KDMC epidemic officer, said, “Earlier, people hesitated to donate plasma due to lack of awareness. Now-a-days, most youngsters are voluntarily doing it but the response is still low.One major reason for this is the criteria for donation i.e. not every recovered patient can donate the plasma. There are criteria for age, the count of antibody and also previous medical condition of the recovered patient.Panpatil added, “There is a shortage of plasma in Kalyan-Dombivli. So, the blood banks are ready to accept donors anytime. People should make it a point to come forward and donate,” added Panpatil.The KDMC, along with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and social media group – It’s All About Kalyan – initiated an online plasma collection drive in September. This saw merely 50 donors.Jaydeep Hajare, an advocate who initiated the drive, said, “The drive was aimed at preparing a bank of plasma so that a Covid patient can reach out to the blood banks and get the desired plasma within a short time. Even though 50 people have registered through the drive, we have managed around 100 donations till now. However, this needs to increase in the coming days to save the lives of Covid patients,” added Hajare.Even today, several Covid patients’ relatives search for matching plasma for 3-4 days continuously. Sumant Mahale, 32, lost his 64-year-old father, a retired railway employee a month ago after battling the virus for 23 days.Mahale said, “I had to search for donors for five days and finally I found one that matched my father’s blood group. But, it was too late for the therapy. There was no plasma in blood bank and we had to call up random donors through our contacts. This was very challenging.”Thirty-six-year old Rahul Gaikwad, a Dombivli-based doctor who survived Covid-19 virus after a week-long hospitalisation, has donated his plasma twice after his recovery. He is now planning to do it again for the third time just to pass on a message to other recovered patients to come forward and donate their plasma to help treat the Covid patients in need.Gaikwad said, “I have worked in the frontline, treating a number of Covid patients in Dombivli since the beginning. When I contracted the virus and recovered, the only thing I had in mind was to help others recover. It takes only 45 minutes to donate and it does not harm the donor in anyway.”He added that there was lot of stigma attached to the donation due to which people don’t come forward.The plasma donation has also helped a few. Atul Angre, 46 a civil engineer from Thane, said, “Both my father and mother were hospitalised with Covid infection while I was home quarantined with other family members. I could not go out when doctor told me plasma was required for their treatment. Luckily, I got plasma through patients who donated it at blood banks for my parents’ treatment. My father survived while my mother succumbed to the illness as she had other health issues too.”How to register:** Donors have to share their name, blood group and address so that they can be contacted.** The details can be registered at the link https://forms.gle/t3pBb6kTrZCj87b8A.** For details call 0251-2211373 or 9323042121.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-blood-banks-in-need-of-plasma-donors/story-fFE6b4J7HkbZIb6SM9vHGI.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Kalyan-Dombivli commuters can pay fares online from today||Commuters taking the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Transport (KDMT) ring route bus from Kalyan Station can pay their fares through online payment mode from Sunday morning.The KDMT has digitalised bus fares for five ring route buses to avoid contact during ticketing. The service will be extended further on other routes.“Changing the mode of payment from cash to digital is to avoid any contact between conductors and passengers, and curb the spread of Covid-19 infection. Since we have resumed buses within and outside the city limits, online payment service is a must,” said Milind Dhat, general manager, KDMT.On Friday, the KDMT officials and committee members finalised on how the online payment would function by giving a demo of the online payment system.“We will provide a uniform QR code to the conductors which the passengers can scan through online payment modes and make their payment,” added Dhat.The KDMT, which was completely shut during the initial months of lockdown, has resumed services on 15 routes including Kalyan-Panvel and Dombivli-Vashi routes.On Sunday, which marks Dussehra, the online payment mode will be inaugurated on one route, the Kalyan ring route that covers Kalyan station - Murbad Road - Birla College Road -Duragadi Chowk - Lal Chowki - Shivaji Chowk – Kalyan station. Later on, it will be enabled in all other routes.“We are planning to increase the number of buses and its frequencies as there is a requirement due to the lockdown relaxations. In order to make sure there is no contact while making payment of fare, we decided to go digital,” added Dhat.Sumit Patil, 29, who takes the KDMT bus from Kalyan to Panvel for work, said, “Paying the fare by cash is very risky as there will be some contact. Most of the passengers have smart phones and they can make the payment online. This is a good move by the transport body and should be imposed effectively.”Presently, the KDMT has 137 buses out of which only 52 are running as many buses are to be repaired. Out of these 52, twenty are given to the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation for Covid duty. The rest are for common public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-commuters-can-pay-fares-online-from-today/story-DVLEQBCXAE9tCjo7mZu1OI.html

25-10-2020||Mumbai||NCB arrests one more accused in Sushant Singh Rajput death case||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) arrested one more accused, Sahil Mazhar Ali, an alleged drug supplier, in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. NCB conducted searches at Ali’s residence in Jai Bhim Nagar in Dapodi area, Pune and recovered 7.2 gram round-shaped black sticky substance purported to be charas. Ali’s name cropped during interrogation of South African National Agisilaos Demetriades, a brother of a Bollywood actor’s girlfriend. Demetriades was arrested with a small quantity of drug from Lonavala on October 18. NCB then raided Ali’s residence and summoned him for questioning at NCB’s Mumbai office on October 23. “Ali’s statement was recorded under section 67 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act wherein he revealed that he supplied cocaine to drug peddler Agisilaos Demetriades. Ali also said that he had purchased LSD and MDMA from Demetriades,” said an NCB officer. Ali is a part of the chain of drug peddlers and was also in touch with several other drug peddlers and suppliers in the city. After his role and involvement in drug supply was clear, he was arrested in the case, the officer said.He supplied cocaine and cannabis to Demetriades, who was connected with arrested accused Kaizan Ibrahim, Sandeep Gupta, Anuj Keshwani and accused Dwyane Fernandes, and they were further linked to Deepesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda who were linked with Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik, said the officer.The agency has so far arrested 24 people including Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Rajput’s house manager Miranda, domestic help Sawant, and drug peddlers Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar and others. Chakraborty was granted bail by the Bombay high court (HC) on October 7 while her brother is still in jail.On October 15, NCB arrested Jai Madhok, a management professional and drug peddler and distributor of cocaine and hashish. Madhok’s name came during various statements of drug peddlers recorded in the SSR case.Madhok was involved in cocaine and hashish consumption as well as distributing drugs along with Dharma Productions’ former executive producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad and Ankush Arenja, both were earlier arrested in connection with the case. Madhok has direct links with Nigerian nationals and procured cocaine for himself and distributed to his friends.Last month, NCB recorded statements of actors Rakul Preet Singh, Deepika Padukone, Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan. Apart from that, Padukone’s manager Karishma Prakash’s statement was also recorded. The agency is probing into the drug angle related to Rajput’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-arrests-one-more-accused-in-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case/story-JayKB3Z7wF7TqzmfKIS3SM.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||India had most deaths in road accidents in 2019: Report||A total of 151,113 people were killed in 480,652 road accidents across India in 2019, an average of 414 a day or 17 an hour, according to a report by the transport research wing of the ministry of road transport and highways. India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed. The United States of America (USA) reported the most road accidents at 2,211,439, and witnessed 37,461 deaths in 2019.According to the report, speeding was the leading cause of deaths, while, in terms of vehicles, two-wheelers were involved in most road fatalities.Across states, most road accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu (57,228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50,669), Uttar Pradesh (42,572), Kerala (41,111) and Karnataka (40,658) accidents. Maharashtra ranked sixth with 32,295 accidents, but saw the second-highest number of fatalities (12,788), after 22,655 in Uttar Pradesh.Among cities, Delhi retained its first rank with 1,463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1,283), Chennai (1,252) and Bengaluru (768). Mumbai ranked ninth with 447 people being killed in road accidents in 2019. The report stated that national and state highways, which account for just five per cent of the total roads in the country, saw the most deaths — 61% of the total.Two-wheelers were involved in 37% of the road deaths in the country, followed by pedestrians at 17% and light vehicles (comprising cars, jeeps and taxis) at 16%. A total of 56,136 people riding two-wheelers lost their lives, while 25,858 pedestrians died in 2019, stated the report. The report stated that speeding accounted for most road accidents and deaths (ranging between 63% and 73% for accidents and between 62% and 70% for deaths) on all categories of national highways. In 2019, like in previous years, young adults in the age group of 18-45 years accounted for nearly 69.3% of road accident deaths, while those in the age group of 18 – 60 accounted for 84.3%. Interestingly, it wasn’t curved roads that took the most lives — 96,624 people lost their lives on straight roads, while curved roads saw 20,141 deaths. “Traditionally, for any accident or crash, the major causes could be ‘driver/human’, ‘road infrastructure’ or ‘vehicle-related factors’. Sometimes, there might be combinations of these factors which might lead to accidents. Among these major factors, ‘driver/human’-related factors or errors dominate,” said Nagendra R Velaga, associate professor (transportation systems engineering), department of civil engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Examples of such human/driver factors include — rash driving, fatigue/sleep deprivation (particularly for long-haul truck drivers), speeding (due to certain reasons like time pressure or time constraints to reach the destination), on-board distractions (eg: using digital devices such as mobile phones while driving), driving under influence of alcohol and drugs, among other, said Velaga. “Advanced technologies and artificial intelligence can control some human errors or driver factors (for example, camera-based speed-detection system). However, I strongly feel that it is the individual’s responsibility to respect their own life use required and appropriate precautionary measures (use seatbelt and helmet, follow traffic rules, and do not use phone while driving, avoid rash driving and drunk driving),” added Velaga Former chairman of the Supreme Court (SC) committee on road safety, retired justice KS Radhakrishnan, said speeding is the major cause of accidents, especially on straight roads and highways, where control on speed is minimal. On curved roads, speeding is less, due to which accidents are less. “Condition of roads, traffic violations, drink and drive, among others, are also major contributors to high number of fatalities and accidents,” said Radhakrishnan. Radhakrishnan, whose committee conducted 250 meetings with the government, national highways authority, state traffic departments and international agencies, to curb accidents, said, “The meetings are heading in the right direction,” said Radhakrishnan. “The fine in India is not a deterrent,” said Radhakrishnan adding, “However, the average person here will not be able to afford heavy fines. The government will just end up seizing licences.” To bring down fatalities, Velaga said, “In addition to national-level policies and legislation, regional or local-level control strategies or measures are required. Strong enforcement is also required.” Velaga also said, “Causal and impact analysis of accidents/crashes is required for state, regional and local level. More focus on research related to human/driver factors may be needed to understand the exact of factors influencing the crashes and suitable remedial measures.” Commenting on the report, Piyush Tewari, CEO and founder, SaveLIFE Foundation said, “There is an urgent need for full implementation of the road safety provisions in the motor vehicle (amendment) Act 2019, including implementation of child safety provisions. Additionally, identifying risk factors specific to the safety of children and creating a plan to mitigate them should be prioritised by all state governments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-had-most-deaths-in-road-accidents-in-2019-report/story-pikRXxsS4hptNVvf6J2g9O.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds life term of man for raping a 3-and-half-year-old girl||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday upheld the life term given to a 27-year-old from Sinnar in Nashik district for raping a three-and-a-half-year-old girl in September 2014.After scrutinising the evidence on record, the division bench comprising justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik concluded that the trial court had rightly convicted Sudam Shelke. The bench also affirmed the life imprisonment handed down to him, saying he did not deserve leniency.According to the prosecution, the incident took place on September 12, 2014 when the girl, who was playing outside her house, could not be found. The family launched a search and her grandmother found the child crying in a nearby Bajra crop field. The girl had to be taken to hospital as she had injuries in her private part. The next day the child narrated the ordeal to her family, following which the police was informed and an offence was registered.Shelke was arrested on September 17 and was subsequently prosecuted for sexually assaulting the child. The prosecution examined 11 witnesses that proved him guilty. On January 18, 2016, an additional sessions judge at Nashik convicted him for raping the child and sentenced him to life imprisonment.Shelke then filed an appeal before HC challenging the conviction. The bench dismissed his appeal after noticing that the evidence on record showed that the convict had given his cell phone to the girl for playing sometime before the incident, the survivor’s grandmother had seen him running out of the Bajra field and his motorcycle was found lying nearby.Besides, the court also took note of the fact that blood stains were found on an under garment of the accused and the DNA report specifically showed that blood group of the DNA extracted from the blood stains found on his underwear matched with blood group of survivor.HC also rejected the argument advanced on his behalf that non-examination of the survivor was fatal to the prosecution case. The bench said the girl was hardly 3 years and 8 months old at the time and added, “There can be no infirmity in the prosecution case only because of non-examination of the victim.” The HC bench also found no merit in the convict’s submission that his complicity in the crime was ruled out as he had not sustained any injury on his private part. He maintained that he should have suffered some injury, especially because the victim was only 3 years and 8 months old.In this regard, HC said, the trial court had correctly relied on relevant medical jurisprudence that in young children there are few or no signs of general violence caused by resistance, for the child usually has no idea of what is happening and also it is incapable of resisting. In such cases, complete penetration is not possible, especially when the perpetrator is a grown up man, but slight penetration is sufficient to attract section 376 (sexual assault) of the Indian Penal Code.“We are in agreement with the view of the trial court that no benefit can be given to the accused merely because he has not sustained any injury on his private part,” the bench said while dismissing Shelke’s appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-upholds-life-term-of-man-for-raping-a-3-and-half-year-old-girl/story-LbGwxCro89WU8bcFjOphzO.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Teachers cannot be forced to report to school: Maharashtra education department||After receiving several complaints from teachers associations about teachers being called to school every day, the Maharashtra education department has clarified that teachers can continue working from home. In a circular issued by the office of the deputy director, Mumbai region, schools have been told to teach online. “Complaints have been received by this office from teachers who allege that they are being called to report from various parts of the city even as trains are not functioning regularly. Schools should note that the work done by teachers for online education should be calculated as their official work hours and their salaries should not be deducted,” states the circular. A teacher from a Kandivli-based school said, “The school is asking us to physically report to work every day. Teachers have to spend ₹2,000 each day to travel from Thane and beyond. Sometimes we only conduct online classes from the school which we can conduct from our homes too,” she added. As per the current guidelines, teachers can be called to school once or twice a week if needed by the principal. However, teaching work has to continue online. Teachers suffering from hypertension, cardiac ailments, etc. and those over the age of 50 years are exempt from physically attending the school.Several teachers groups, such as Shikshak Parishad and Shikshak Bharati, had also complained about several schools forcing parents to submit answer sheets of solved papers as part of the exams. “So far, the education department has not declared any specific guidelines about the conduct of exams. Schools should thus continue only online activities,” the circular further states. The department has warned schools of action if they do not comply with the rules. “Strict action will be taken against principals and managements of such schools,” states the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teachers-cannot-be-forced-to-report-to-school-maharashtra-education-department/story-DpzKvdU4t8X34HHcfcmVBK.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Independent Mumbai MLA who had pledged support to BJP joins Sena||After Eknath Khadse’s move to the ruling Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has suffered one more jolt on Saturday as an independent member of the legislative Assembly (MLA) Geeta Jain, who had earlier declared support to the party, switched loyalty to the ruling Shiv Sena.A BJP rebel, Jain was elected from Mira-Bhayander near Mumbai. A former mayor of the city, she contested as an independent candidate after BJP denied her a ticket for the 2019 Assembly election. She defeated sitting BJP MLA Narendra Mehta. She had pledged support to Devendra Fadnavis after getting elected. On Saturday, she joined Sena. However, there are doubts whether the move would be beneficial for her as provisions of anti-defection laws do not allow independent MLAs to join a political party on the floor of the legislature.Jain was welcomed into the party by chief minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray at his Bandra residence, ‘Matoshree’.“Uddhavji assured me that he would speed up developmental work in my constituency,” said Jain. She said she took this step as the BJP has been neglecting her despite pledging support to the BJP after the 2019 Assembly elections. “The BJP was not calling me for their events and neglecting me. I met every senior leader, but all I got was just assurances from them and no action,” rued Jain.Soon after the results, she met former chief minister Fadnavis and extended support to the BJP. Since the BJP got 105 seats and wanted to form the government, it was seeking help from various parties and independents.According to her supporters, after winning the Assembly elections last year, the BJP should have handed over the reins of the party to her in Mira-Bhayander. However, the party still favoured Mehta due to which he still holds sway in this constituency.Meanwhile, officials from the state legislature said an independent MLA cannot join a party after election.Also, there is no provision of affiliated or associated MLAs of a political party in the anti-defection law, which is currently in practice.“The provisions under anti-defection law clearly said that an elected member of the House (Parliament or state legislature), who has been elected as such otherwise then as a candidate set up by any political party, shall be disqualified for being a member of the House, if he/she joins any political party after such elections,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.“There is a practice going on about affiliated or associated MLAs who give their support to a political party, but don’t become a member of the legislative party. In this case as well, there is no provision available in the anti-defection law and the practice is going on for years unofficially,” he added.The speaker of the Assembly has the powers to decide on disqualification of an independent MLA. If an independent MLA declared joining a political outfit then his or her statement may become a ground for a filing petition on violation of anti-defection law before the Speaker and it is upon the latter to decide action to be taken, the official said.The BJP said Jain’s joining of Sena will not make any difference to the party. “She was an independent legislator and she is free to join anyone. It does not matter to us,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/independent-city-mla-who-had-pledged-support-to-bjp-joins-sena/story-fRIW9w9Ghld7JED7gFb9WI.html

25-10-2020||Mumbai||Domestic violence calls drop with relaxation of lockdown in Maharashtra||When lockdown restrictions were at their strictest, the state women and child development (WCD) department’s helpline recorded a surge in the number of callers on its helpline for domestic violence. Between April and September, the helpline (181) received 26,164, of which 6,590 were reporting domestic violence. Experts say this is just a fraction of the actual situation as an estimated 86% of women who experience intimate partner violence do not report it or seek help, according to the National Family Health Survey. Globally, the Covid-19 pandemic created situations in which there was more domestic abuse and the lockdown made it harder for victims and survivors to get away from their abusers or report the crime. Lawyer and co-founder of the not-for-profit women’s rights organisation Majlis, Flavia Agnes said, “In India, men often beat up their wives to take their frustrations out. During the lockdown, when men lost their jobs and got stuck inside four walls, they started abusing their wives. As police were focused on Covid duty and courts were closed, nothing could be done about it,” she said, adding that cases of sexual abuse also saw a spike but few of these were placed on official record.In April, the WCD helpline (181) received an average of 180 calls daily, reporting domestic violence. By September, when some relaxations were introduced, the daily average of calls regarding domestic violence had dropped to 95. Data from the National Commission of Women shows that between March 25 and May 31, 1,477 complaints of domestic violence were reported across the country, which is a higher number than the complaints received in the corresponding period in the past 10 years.Since the lockdown, 7,055 cases of domestic violence have been filed at various police stations across Maharashtra.The surge in intimate partner violence has been attributed to the psychological stress felt by many during the lockdown, particularly those who have suffered job losses and economic hardship. Sneha, a Marathwada-based non-government organisation (NGO) for women’s rights, has counselled more than 700 women survivors of domestic violence during the lockdown. Mumbai-based psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said, “We are receiving relapsed cases of domestic violence. After repetitive counselling, several men have stopped hurting their wives. But in the lockdown, their anxiety triggered their habit of beating up their wives.”Experts pointed out that the recorded cases of violence against women are not reflective of the on-ground situation because these crimes are underreported. Even in pre-pandemic scenarios, the National Family Health Survey (2015-2016) estimated that 86% of women who experienced violence at home did not report it or seek help. During the lockdown, reporting these crimes became even more difficult than in other times. State WCD secretary IA Kundan said, “We have observed that many women who were victims of domestic violence couldn’t approach police stations due to the lockdown. Also, many women didn’t even get the opportunity to call at the helpline in the presence of family members.”For construction worker Aditi Salvi, 34, the lockdown meant no work, which in turn forced her to leave Mumbai and return to Latur in April, with her two children and husband, who is also a construction worker. Soon after, Salvi was subjected to violence at home. “I was being blamed for the pandemic and my husband along with my mother-in-law started beating me up. Due to lack of money, I stopped recharging my phone and therefore couldn’t get a chance to call the police. One day, I ran away and took shelter in my neighbour’s house who finally called 181,” Salvi told HT. Salvi has chosen not to file an official police complaint, but had she wanted to, the process could have been daunting. Sudhir Mishra, a coordinator at Sneha, said that often, police refused to register domestic violence cases because they were overwhelmed by their Covid-related duties. “They didn’t have the time to look into domestic violence cases. This led to women continuing to live under the same roof with their abusive families, who subjected them to repeated violence,” said Mishra. HD Yashod, commissioner, WCD, said,“We have 34 senior protection officers at district level and 358 junior protection officers at taluka level who are working full time in prevention of domestic violence and relief services.”Of the 6,590 calls that the WCD’s helpline received regarding domestic violence, 3,448 received general family counselling; 363 were given medical care; 1,973 received psychological counselling; and 532 were sent to short-term shelter facilities. In an effort to provide support to survivors, all 37 one-stop crisis centres were functional during the lockdown period. “To prevent and address cases of domestic violence, we also started the ‘Mala Bolayache Aahe’ helpline. Round the clock, we coordinated with police control rooms across districts and shared contact numbers of protection officers and social workers across the state,” said Kundan. Women helpline records 16K Covid-19 related calls Since April, the state’s WCD helpline has received more than 26,000 calls, of which 61.8% were related to Covid-19. In April and May, the helpline recorded the most calls, averaging 500 daily. On some days, the helpline received over 1,000 calls, most of which were queries about Covid-19.“In the initial days of the lockdown, we got calls seeking ration or queries about hospitals. Many also called asking about symptoms of Covid-19 and what steps to follow,” said state WCD secretary IA Kundan. “We directed the women to the concerned departments according to their needs. We simultaneously coordinated with police and NGOs to help the callers,” said Kundan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/domestic-violence-calls-drop-with-relaxation-of-lockdown-in-maharashtra/story-rBlCbTgLNVIVn7eNL1RMbP.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to form fact-finding panel to look into online exam fiasco||Weeks after examinations of University of Mumbai’s (MU) Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL) were disrupted and eventually postponed due to technical glitches, Maharashtra education department has decided to constitute a fact-finding committee with technical experts to look into all complaints of online exams being affected due to errors in the ongoing universities exams.In a virtual press conference on Saturday, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant stated that in October, students from several state universities were left struggling due to glitches in online exams, including the incident from first week of October that left thousands of IDOL students anxious and unable to appear for their final-year exams. “Students who were already stressed about examinations were put under more stress due to the technical errors and will now have to re-appear for all exams. Such issues cannot be ignored. The fact finding committee will delve deep into this issue and present a report on the same at the earliest,” said Samant. He added that the committee will bring together at least two education director-level officials along with a technical expert, and the committee will be ready to start work by November 10. “This committee will submit a report based on their findings within one month,” he added. In the first week of October, after postponing three exams within a week for students of the distance education wing, MU announced postponement of all IDOL exams. However, close to 9,000 third-year BCom and BA students could not attempt their paper on three consecutive days due to “technical glitches”. The university finally blacklisted the previous service provider, LittleMORE Innovation Labs, and hired a new exam software company to conduct the exams. Similar instances were reported across state universities this year.Samant further highlighted that based on the report submitted by the fact-finding committee, it will also be decided whether such companies should be blacklisted by all state universities in the future. Meanwhile, all state universities have been asked to not only finish announcement of results by the second week of November but also to ensure that mark sheets are released by the end of November. In a meeting between Samant and vice-chancellors of al state universities on Friday, a decision was taken to form two separate expert committees — one to discuss the implementation of National Education Policy (NEP) and another to suggest amendments to the Maharashtra Public Universities Act (2016). “These committees will get to work immediately. They have been asked to submit their reports to the government within a month,” said Samant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-form-fact-finding-panel-to-look-into-online-exam-fiasco/story-54dKhwjU5Sd1T8aGX8Qs1H.html
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 7th straight day of fewer than 10,000 Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 6,417 Covid-19 cases, the seventh consecutive day of less than 10,000 infections, pushing the count to 1,638,961. A steady fall in active cases continued as it further reduced to 140,194, accounting for 8.55% of the total. The toll reached 43,152 as 137 casualties were reported in the past 24 hours, health officials said.Maharashtra continues to record a relatively lower number of Covid-19 cases for weeks, after last month’s single-day spike had gone up to a record 24,448. It can be further observed that the total number of cases recorded in the first week of October was 97,377, in the second week it fell to 73,900 and in the third week it further came down to 63,269 . The first three days of the fourth week have recorded 21,303 cases.But officials are concerned that cases may rise by November-end, considering festivals and people not following social-distancing norms strictly. “We are afraid of a repeat of the post-Ganesh festival, when the state faced a surge in cases. The same situation may come again post Diwali as three festivals — Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali — are going to be celebrated in a row. We also cannot see people taking coronavirus seriously and following social-distancing norms in markets and other public places. Hence, there is concern that cases are going to rise by the end of November,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.In terms of deaths, Maharashtra has the most deaths across states in the country. The state is still far from reaching its target of achieving a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1% as it is still at 2.63%. It also continues to be at second position after Punjab in the country. The CFR of Punjab was 3.15% (with 4,095 deaths) till Friday, according to information shared by the state medical education department.Mumbai continued to record highest cases in the state with 1,257 fresh infections on Saturday. Its case count reached 250,059. The number of active cases in the city increased to 17,977. The city’s toll also reached 10,059 after 50 casualties were reported.Pune city contributed the second-highest number of infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 336, taking its tally to 170,206.Nagpur city recorded 328 cases, third-highest number of infections, pushing its case count to 75,878.On Saturday, the state conducted 68,881 tests and its positivity rate for the day comes to 9.31%, against the overall positivity rate of 19.17%. The total tests conducted till date are 8,548,036.The number of recovered patients also reached 1,455,107 as 10,004 recoveries were recorded in the last 24 hours. The recovery rate was recorded at 88.78%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-7th-straight-day-of-fewer-than-10-000-covid-19-cases/story-HvLnS8ZLWp6Hm0HiT75KiO.html

The average annual PM 2.5 concentrations in China ranged from 45 to 75 micrograms per cubic metres in 2019 compared to 75 to over 85 micrograms per cubic metres in India.SOGA 2020 released by US-based Health Effects Institute and Global Burden of Disease project underlined that these improvements are mainly owing to meticulous enforcement of their five-year air pollution plan and targets. China implemented the first comprehensive five-year plan to improve air quality between 2013 and 2017 and subsequent plans have continued to address air pollution. Between 2010 and 2019, outdoor PM2.5 levels in China decreased by 30%, largely due to actions undertaken in the past 5 to 7 years, including a shift from coal to gas in residential and industrial sectors and a reduction in industrial emissions. “However, there are fears that the recent economic slowdown and related increases in coal-burning capacity will continue to pose challenges with respect to air pollution control,” it said.India released its National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in January 2019. NCAP doesn’t have a legal mandate but aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 (respirable, pollution particles) concentrations over 2017 annual levels in over a hundred cities. A big concern with India also is that Covid-19 pandemic could slow down the implementation of various national level initiatives, including a complete switch to BS VI vehicle emission standards and compliance of thermal power plants to emission norms by installing pollution control equipment.Also Read | Delhi pollution: Plans on paper, and poison in the airCentre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Finland based think tank which tracks China and India’s air pollution policies closely said that China’s environment ministry has already published draft air quality targets for this winter as air pollution started deteriorating in Beijing. Targets have been released for key control regions including Beijing, Tianjing and 26 surrounding cities; Yangtze Delta covering Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and parts of Anhui and other areas. India or the polluted region of Indo Gangetic Plains doesn’t have similar annual targets yet.The backbone of China’s national action plan is a comprehensive monitoring network of approximately 1,500 air quality stations providing real-time data, said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA, while adding that improving air quality and enforcing industrial emission standards is included in the performance evaluation of provincial and local government officials, which determines their career prospects.“We need to control emissions at source, which means shifting our mode of transport to more public transport and NMT (Non-Motorised Transport), installing efficient pollution control technology at coal based power plants, reducing emissions from industrial operations, and shifting our energy sources from polluting fuels of past to decentralised sources of energy which are more sustainable, cleaner and economical in the form of renewable energy,” said Dahiya, adding that these need to be paired with a strong enforcement strategy.“China’s annual PM2.5 average concentration was 47.7 micrograms per cubic metres in 2019. In the last few years, China has focused efforts on air pollution control. As a result, it has experienced a steady decline in exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter or PM2.5, a key measure of air pollution as well as use of solid fuels for cooking in households. However, recent reported increases in coal burning capacity have the potential to pose continuing challenges,” said Pallavi Pant, scientist at Health Effects Institute. Sagnik Dey, associate professor, IIT Delhi said “it’s impossible to reduce air pollution levels to WHO safety guidelines in a few years. It took the US 30 years to achieve that. But we have to be very focused and ambitious.”WHAT CHINA DOES RIGHT Michael Greenstone, Milton Friedman Professor in Economics at University of Chicago and Patrick Schwarz, pre-doctoral fellow at Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago documented in 2018 why China is winning the war on pollution in their analysis with the same title.· China released its National Action Plan on Air Pollution Prevention and Control, a document similar to NCAP in 2013.· In 2014, Premier Li Keqiang declared a “war against pollution” at the opening of China’s annual meeting of the National People’s Congress. · Using daily data from more than 200 monitors across the country from 2013 to 2017, Greenstone’s team found most populated areas recorded improvements in air quality, ranging from 21 to 42%.· If these reductions are sustained, the average Chinese citizen would see their life expectancy increase by 2.4 years relative to 2013, Greenstone said.· China invested about $270 billion in the plan with focus on the densely populated Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, Pearl and Yangtze River Delta regions, respectively.· Beijing, which had additionally set aside $120 billion to fight pollution had the target of reducing PM2.5 levels to below 60 micrograms per cubic metres, or a 34% decline from its 2013 levels.· The plan pledged to meet these goals by reducing dependency on coal, controlling vehicle emissions, increasing renewable energy generation, and increasing enforcement of emissions standards.India:• India has launched its National Clean Air Programme in 2019 which aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 (respirable, pollution particles) concentrations over 2017 annual levels in over a hundred cities• India introduced BS VI fuel emission standards skipping BS V norms altogether.• Most brick kilns in NCR states have switched low emission, high efficiency zig-zag technology• Delhi has implemented a graded response action plan (GRAP) which ensures various emergency measures are taken when air pollution levels breach a certain threshold in the Capital• India has introduced a number of other measures like subsidising LPG use under the Ujjwala scheme, promoting electric vehicles and various other city specific interventions• According to Central Pollution Control Board, in Delhi there is around 20% reduction in annual PM 2.5 concentrations from 2016 to 2019 and 25% reduction in PM 10 concentrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/how-china-managed-to-consistently-reduce-pm-2-5-concentrations-in-recent-years/story-dtWOaWt6JyMrHyJgCCxA4L.html
25-10-2020||Delhi||Unfortunate that MCDs not paying salaries even during festival time,say AAP; release funds, counters BJP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday said it is unfortunate that at a time when organisations and institutions are giving bonuses to their employees for the festive season, the municipal corporations are not even paying salaries to their employees.Addressing a media briefing, senior AAP leader in charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak raised the issue of non-payment of salaries to workers, doctors, and nurses at civic-body-run hospitals. He said a budget of Rs 18,000 crore has been allocated to the three municipal corporations, and had they efficiently used even 10% of that fund, they could have comfortably paid salaries of employees. “Instead of paying salaries, the BJP is playing politics. If the BJP cannot release the salaries of employees, then the party does not have the moral right to run the civic bodies. This month also marks the beginning of the festive season. Today (Saturday) is Ram Navami, tomorrow is Dussehra, followed by Valmiki Jayanti and, finally, Diwali (on November 14). For Hindus, these are some of the most important festivals,” he said. “Today, at a time when every Indian will be busy celebrating with families, thousands of employees of the BJP-ruled municipal corporations are still protesting to get their salaries. Doctors and nurses who had put their lives at stake to treat Covid patients in Delhi, have resorted to hunger strike to get their salaries. They have not been paid a remuneration for the past five to six months,” Pathak said. He said the BJP has been running the municipal corporations since the past 14 years and they have done nothing but looted the civic bodies, leaving them in such a state that they are unable to pay their employees. Responding to AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the Kejriwal government owed crores of rupees to the three municipal corporations. “But the Kejriwal government will never talk about those dues for want of which the MCDs are in financial distress. It is due to sheer political malice that the Delhi government has not released the entire funds allocated to the MCDs -- and whatever was given, was not given on time,” he said. “The Delhi government had to release stalled funds of about ₹18,000 crore by March 31, 2020, to all the three municipal corporations. Half of the current financial year 2020-21 has gone by, but even 25% of the total allocation had not been released,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unfortunate-that-mcds-not-paying-salaries-even-during-festival-time-say-aap-release-funds-counters-bjp/story-LSlErEMkeyU48K8Na8kw1K.html
25-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Mundka, Alipur choke on severely bad air||The air quality of the city improved marginally on Saturday. But residents in two localities of Delhi — Mundka and Alipur — continued breathing toxic air, with the air in the region hovering in the ‘severe’ category for more than 38 hours.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings on Saturday showed that while the city’s overall air quality index improved to 345 from Friday’s 366, Mundka and Alipur — both of which were categorised as pollution ‘hotspots’ by CPCB in 2018 — have now been in the ‘severe’ zone for over 38 hours at a stretch. In Mundka, the average AQI on Saturday was 425, while in Alipur, the levels were measured at around 413 throughout the day. Hindustan Times visited these two severely polluted neighbourhoods of the city to find out the reasons behind the air emergency and if preventive actions promised by enforcement agencies were being implemented on the ground. Mundka Driving through NH-10, a thick cloud of dust envelops your vehicle as you approach the Mundka Metro station. On Saturday, dust on broken roads— that has not been swept for days — was seen flying around as high speed vehicles zoomed through the highway. Surendra Singh, a business owner on the Rohtak Road, said that the area is perpetually enveloped in dust during the day, while at night the emissions from waste burning, industries and construction takes over. “Every pollution source that you can possibly think of is active here. The roads have not been swept in weeks, which caused dust to be accumulated on the sides and as vehicles move, it flies around. If you go a little inside, there is some private construction work going on and the cement and the construction material is often kept in open, without any covers. I have made several complaints with the CPCB and the Delhi government. But instead of addressing the concerns,they sit on it and then close the complaint without taking any action,” Singh said. The service roads leading to Mundka metro station, are dotted by several tyre repair shops and open air eateries, which add to the already worsened air. Locals there claimed that after sundown daily, heaps of tyres are piled up on the road side and set ablaze. This emits thick black smoke into the air, making it difficult to even stand in the vicinity. The blaze and the smoke billowing from such fires can often be seen from several metres away, residents said. “Open burning is a major problem here. Not just these tyres, but people just dump garbage and once in about a week or two, these piles are set on fire. At night, once shops are closed you cannot stand here without getting choked,” said Majid Khan, a shop owner. On Saturday, the PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels in Mundka spiked to 372ug/m3—nearly six times above the acceptable limit of 60ug/m3. The PM 10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) reached 788ug/m3, as against the standard of 100ug/m3. Contacted, the monitoring teams of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) claimed that the winter segment of the Supreme Court-approved Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) is in force across the city and surveillance and action against polluting activities has increased. The focus, they said, is also on areas in the hotspot list, of which Mundka is a part. “We have been monitoring the pollution sources across the city, but our focus has been on the hotspots. Mundka is an industrial area . Apart from what we observe through patrolling, we also promptly respond to complaints received by residents,” a senior DPCC official said. The onus is also on the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the primary enforcement agency responsible for checking open air burning, which residents claimed they have been lax in doing so far. Jai Prakash, north Delhi mayor, said that the municipal agency was doing its best with the resources available with them. “We are short of staff and money but that does not mean that we have stopped work. Our teams are working round the clock to ensure that water sprinkling is routinely happening in all the areas under our jurisdiction. Dust control measures are also being taken,” he said. Alipur In Alipur, a locality which shares its close proximity with Bhalswa landfill, vehicular emissions from trucks is the main culprit for the area’s toxic air. The Alipur main road is lined with truck yards. The poor maintenance of these commercial vehicles and the bad condition of the roads here, become a lethal combination in pushing the air quality into emergency levels every winter. N. Sudama, a truck dealer in Alipur, said that every day around 6,000-7,000 trucks move in and out of the area. He said that apart from the emissions from the tailpipe of the trucks, these trucks are mostly parked on unpaved yards and the constant movement leads to dust flying around. “We have no option because this is our business and there are no residential areas in the vicinity. But if the authorities help us improve facilities here, things can surely get better,” Sudama said. Pollution data shows that on Saturday, the PM 2.5 levels in Alipur had touched 405ug/m3, while the levels of PM10 had spiked to 737ug/m3. Right below the Alipur flyover, the road construction work by the Public Works Department (PWD), was also seen to be violating dust control norms. The uncovered fine particles from the mounds of construction material were clearly visible flying around. “We ensure that the entire area is regularly sprinkled with water. The material is not covered now but we usually cover it up,” said a supervisor at the site. Krishna Sharma, a worker at one of the yards on the stretch said, that vacant plots also become a hotspot for burning and dumping of construction rubble. “I work here and I have never seen any official stop anyone from dumping waste in these plots. The government must be working only in the New Delhi area and some posh neighbourhoods around it,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-mundka-alipur-choke-on-severely-bad-air/story-ddWsNFLGz7f9s24S7pnVWO.html
25-10-2020||Delhi||Six things govt did to control pollution, but how effective were they?||With Delhi facing an impending air crisis -- a glimpse of which the city got on Friday when the air quality plunged to ‘severe’ levels in at least 12 of the 35 pollution monitoring stations -- the Delhi government is scrambling to firefight the annual air problem. But it may be a case of “too little, too late”, say pollution experts. With the city’s air continuing to remain ‘very poor’ with a reading of 345 on the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s air quality index, the BJP and the Congress accused the AAP-led Delhi government of inaction. “We have asked the government to get the roads repaired, improve the public transport system and plan flyovers on congested road stretches,” said BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly. Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary pointed out that even with a lot of work left to be done to control local sources of pollution, the AAP government is busy pinning the blame on neighbouring states for stubble burning. Also Read | Delhi pollution: Plans on paper, and poison in the air“Stubble burning is only a component; we also have vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, unchecked construction activities and open burning,” Chaudhury said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, said for concrete results, agencies have to work round the year. “Last moment measures will not work. Winter action is only firefighting,” she said. HT takes a look at six steps taken by the Delhi government to control pollution and their effectiveness.Transplantation policy Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, earlier this month, had announced the tree transplantation policy, aimed at increasing the green cover and keeping better checks on construction agencies. But this was met with criticism from experts, who said transplantation seldom ensures survival of trees. Bharati Chaturvedi, founder and director, Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group, said, “Which neighbourhood doesn’t need trees? The policy isn’t about saving trees, but the loss of several hundreds of trees from a neighbourhood.” ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign In a city where over 10 million vehicles are registered, vehicular emission control is crucial. Towards that end, the government launched the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign, to get motorists to turn off the ignition while idling at traffic signals. Over 2,500 volunteers have been deployed at over 100 traffic signals to make the campaign a success. Anti-dust campaign Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had announced stricter monitoring of construction sites across the city. All major sites, operating in an area over 2,000 sqm, were ordered to mandatorily install two antismog guns, for regular water sprinkling. Other measures such as covering the site by tin sheets and covering construction material with green covers have also been made mandatory. But dust still continues to fly thick, say experts. Bio decomposer The government, in early October, started spraying bio decomposer, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), on crop stubble to turn it into manure. “Even though we do not have much farm land, we have still taken an initiative to spray the bio decomposer in rural pockets,” Rai had said. This again did not have the desired effect as a majority of farm fires happen outside Delhi. Smog tower The Delhi government had announced the setting up of smog towers in Connaught Place in 10 months. A smog tower sucks the polluted air, which is purified by the multiple layers of filters, before being recirculated. However, the effectiveness of such structures in open spaces has been questioned by experts. Electric Vehicle Policy The government’s electrical vehicle policy was notified in August offers subsidies on the purchase of electric vehicles. The government is encouraging citizens to move towards electric vehicles but it will many more months for the policy to evoke any results, said road transport experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/six-things-govt-did-to-control-pollution-but-how-effective-were-they/story-dHt7OqbCnKMAdAYE2Y5TzH.html
