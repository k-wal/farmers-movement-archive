28-10-2020||News||On digital governance, don’t repeat mistakes||The evolution of data governance is in a state of healthy flux right now. India is simultaneously juggling fundamental questions such as the nature and categories of data, while moving steadfastly on building a regulatory apparatus to govern these. There have now been two versions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, a report on non-personal data, and a variety of other proposals to regulate the digital economy from telemedicine to e-commerce to drones. At a macro-level though, two key problems may emerge. The first is of State overreach and the second is of multiple regulators. India’s past experience — particularly with industrial licensing and regulation of the financial sector — may be useful in informing the future of data governance.There is little disagreement that the State is entrenching itself excessively in the process of regulating the data economy. Both the Personal Data Protection Bill as well as the non-personal Data report contains various clauses and suggestions that mandate compulsory data-sharing with the government. We shouldn’t be surprised at this, considering India’s history with State entrenchments. The Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951, gave the State a number of regulatory powers to dictate the output and prices of industries. This led to suppressing growth and innovation for decades. Almost 70 years later, the data regime is suggesting mandatory sharing of data for businesses on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory(FRAND)-based remuneration. How will the State decide on this remuneration? The same issues that existed with price controls under the industries Act are bound to affect the data economy should we go down this route.In fact, it may be even more problematic, given the value of data changes based on its end-use, other data points available and the intelligence the underlying algorithm can generate. The 4 Vs of data — velocity, volume, veracity and variety — will amplify the problems in setting a price for the data economy. Price controls on data also reduce the incentives for companies willing to invest in the creation of databases — leading to economic and geo-political advantages for other countries. India’s past experience tells us that State-led pricing will be anything but FRAND-friendly, and, therefore, the State must step away rather than jump in.The more important issue is the creation of multiple regulators to regulate data in the country. There is a proposed regulator for non-personal data as well as for e-commerce, in addition to the Data Protection Authority (DPA) to be set up. These regulators may be aimed at different aspects of the data economy, yet the significant overlaps among them can’t be ignored. Consider an instance where non-personal data linked to an individual’s IP address, which is easily re-identifiable, could be used for targeted advertising for an e-commerce platform. This could lead to similar battles between regulators as seen in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) on regulating Unit-Linked Investment Plans (ULIPs). IRDAI had to step in because ULIPs were provided by insurance companies and SEBI had to do so because these consisted of money invested in the market generating returns. In other jurisdictions, ULIPs are transferred by insurance companies to asset management companies, and kept in check by market regulators. But this is barred in India, leading to a complex structure of financial regulation. We see ourselves making the same mistake with data governance too.Specifically, two key issues arise out of such confusion — uncertainty for businesses and increased cost of regulatory compliance. The Economic Survey (2018-19) shows that policy uncertainty in India was at its highest in 2011-12, directly affecting the input costs, especially the cost of capital or borrowings for firms. This led to the subsequent dampening of investment by businesses for the next few quarters. The digital economy is no different. Multiple regulators will exacerbate these already existing fissures — for instance, India’s draft e-commerce policy is already being criticised for bringing in uncertainty for investors.Multiple regulators also lead to the possibility of a lack of oversight, given that each authority presumes another regulator is responsible for regulating that issue. The Personal Data Protection Bill earmarks mergers and acquisitions as one area where data can be processed without user-consent — but this could have adverse competition and privacy concerns and can largely become an area overlooked by both the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and DPA. All this is due to unclear jurisdictions and no demarcation of authority across regulators. This problem was one of the contributing factors to the 2008 financial crisis, with the United States having at least nine regulators for the financial sector alone. India should applaud itself for adopting a holistic approach to economic regulation of data. But, while keeping the complexities of data in mind, it should not forget the complexities of regulation learnt from its own experience across sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-digital-governance-don-t-repeat-mistakes/story-J7XLYEzESd2Vw5FSuBzBkO.html

28-10-2020||News||How India’s economy is recovering rapidly from the pandemic||The popular story of the shepherd boy who repeatedly cried “wolf” even though there was none has been heard over many generations now. The story seems to be repeating itself in today’s India but in a different form, with the Opposition constantly painting doomsday scenarios about the economy. However, the emerging economic data, in the wake of the pandemic, tells a different story. The pandemic has led to a huge economic setbacks for many nations and India is no exception. From supply chain disruptions to reduced consumer activity, from the plunge in trade to the near-collapse of certain industries, the world is going through one of the most difficult times in collective memory. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi put human lives before the distress in the economy caused by the lockdown. After all, in a pre-lockdown poll, 64% of the people wanted the government to choose to save lives, even if it meant a slower economic revival. The philosophy of the government evolved dynamically with changing scenarios, from jaan hain toh jahan hain (if one is alive, there is a world) for the first lockdown to jaan bhi, jahan bhi (life also, world also) subsequently, and, finally, jan se lekar jag tak (from an individual to humanity), before the the Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) campaign. The government launched the world’s largest food security scheme for 800 million people coupled with cash transfers of ₹1.7 lakh crore under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme. Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) were put on hold for six months; ₹18,000 crore was released for taxpayers; foreign direct investment (FDI) norms were changed to protect Indian companies from opportunistic acquisitions; collateral-free loans and bank guarantees were announced for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); tax deadlines were increased significantly to give relief to taxpayers; and One Nation One Ration Card schemes were implemented. The overall economic package of ₹20 lakh crore, that is, 10% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) became the financial spine for a self-reliant India. The government’s effort has been to fight back and not just soldier on through the pandemic. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection is ₹95.5 thousand crore for September, a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth of 4%. Similarly, power consumption saw 4.6% Y-o-Y growth in September at 113.5 billion units. The rail freight is up 15% in comparison with the corresponding period during the previous years. The e-way bills, in terms of value, have surged past the previous year levels in September reflecting a positive Y-o-Y growth in logistics. In the first fortnight of September, petrol consumption grew by 2% and diesel consumption grew by 5.5% compared to the previous years. These numbers indicate not only a recovery of the supply chain but also a surge forward of sorts. Exports stood at $27.4 billon in September (up by 5.27% in comparison to the corresponding period last year). The Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) too jumped to an eight- year high of 56.8. The consumption of flat steel and long steel was down by only 5% and 10% respectively in August as against 43% and 15%, respectively, in June. This shows that the real estate sector is changing gears and accelerating. The aviation sector, too, has started showing much greater improvement than forecasted. The average number of weekly air travellers increased from about 38,000 in the week starting May 29 to a whopping 135,000 in the week beginning September 25. While many countries announced immediate measures to ease the strain caused by the virus, India found opportunity in adversity through the implementation of long-term goals. These numbers tell the story of belief in the human spirit over forecasting; the same human spirit which pushed India to become a global manufacturing hub for Personal Protective Equipment kits and masks. The encouraging numbers are testimony to the PM’s inspirational call to the country to go from being at a standstill to moving at warp speed.Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is Union minister, Jal Shakti ministry The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-india-s-economy-is-recovering-rapidly-from-the-pandemic/story-ny96v4BJapSkEg4BDd6xGM.html
