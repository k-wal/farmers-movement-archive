22-10-2020||News||The India moment in the $100-billion club||After the announcement of its results in October, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)’s market valuation rose to $144.7 billion, pipping Accenture at $142.4 billion and IBM at $110.5 billion. All at once, TCS has become globally the most-valued company in its market segment, IT services. What does the achievement mean? Who are the global market leaders in other sectors? How big is the $100-billion-dollar market capitalisation club? And how has it evolved in the last two decades? In 2000, the most-valued company in the world was General Electric with a market cap of over $500 billion. At that time, there were 43 companies globally with a market cap of over $100 billion. The total market capitalisation of all these companies together was almost $9 trillion. Among the companies, 21 were from the United States (US), seven from Brazil, four from the United Kingdom (UK), three from Japan and the others were from the rest of Europe. There was a full spread of sectors represented by these companies, with media and telecom being the most significant — 12 of the 43 companies belonged to this sector. However, companies represented other sectors too — industrials, energy, consumer and retail, health care, big tech, IT services and financial services. If one evaluated the discrete segments, the segment leaders came from the US or Brazil. By 2010, after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the standings in the club changed, the impact of the Asian century had started to take effect, but as it were, only for China. Globally, the number of $100-billion companies had risen to 51, but the impact of GFC brought down total market capitalisation of all these companies put together, to around $8.2 trillion. Country representation had also changed. While the US still had nearly 50% of the companies on the list, China’s share had grown to the second-highest at 14%. A few other countries such as Brazil, UK, Australia and Switzerland also had companies in the club. It was financial services and energy (specifically oil and gas) companies that dominated the list, and Exxon Mobil was the world’s most valuable company. Sector leaders were relatively spread across countries — big tech from the US (Apple), banking from China (ICBC), commodities from Australia (BHP), consumer and retail from Switzerland (Nestle). India did not have any companies in the club, though China had ICBC at that time. By 2020, the world has seen the emergence of the trillion-dollar market cap companies. This is a new phenomenon with five trillion-dollar behemoths. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google’s parent) are all from Silicon Valley; the one exception being Saudi Aramco in this top set. Each of these companies can consume the entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of all but 16 countries (that have a GDP of over $1 trillion) in the world. The membership of the $100-billion club has grown to over 100 companies, with 60 of them coming from the US. The total market capitalisation of these 106 firms is over $26 trillion, with 35% of this coming from big tech. Banks and energy companies seem to be past their prime — taking only around 10% share each. China’s share has remained relatively unchanged since 2010 at 14%, with its banks being replaced by China’s big tech companies, such as Alibaba and Tencent. Countries such as Brazil and the UK have all but disappeared. The silver lining in all of this is that India has entered this club with the entry of two of its companies — Reliance Industries and TCS. The bulk of the segment leaders come from the US — Apple (big tech, at over $2 trillion), Walmart (consumer and retail, beating Proctor & Gamble), Berkshire Hathaway (financials, beating Visa), Johnson & Johnson (health care, beating United Health Group), Tesla (industrials and electronics, beating Taiwan Semiconductors), Verizon (media and telecom, beating Disney), UPS (logistics) and then we have Saudi Aramco from Saudi Arabia in energy and TCS from India in IT services. Chinese big tech firms have very high market valuations but are not segment leaders, being pipped by the US big tech firms out of Silicon Valley. In fact, no Chinese company currently is a global segment leader. Interestingly, two of the four trillion-dollar Silicon Valley market cap companies are led by CEOs of Indian origin. It is worthwhile to appreciate the full achievement of TCS. In 2000, TCS was not a listed company. It was not even the segment leader in India. By 2010, its market cap had grown to a creditable $25 billion and it had become the segment leader in India. In the next 10 years, it has managed to enter the $100 billion club, and today, it has become a global segment leader. India, therefore, is the only Asian country that can currently boast of a global segment leader. It is worth noting that the segment that TCS operates in is ruthlessly competitive. It is global and of late has suffered from the changes in US policy on immigration that has adversely affected Indian talent. Unlike big tech in China, TCS has got no protection or specific support from the Indian government in its path to leadership. In fact, most of its revenues are global.  This terrific achievement opens a fundamental geopolitical business opportunity. Can we make 2020 the “US’ India decade” with a partnership in technology, just like 2000 was the “US’ China decade”, which propelled China to global dominance in manufacturing? It will require a determined effort, but the talent is there, and the underlying national governance is based on democratic values, much-needed in developing global standards in data protection and privacy, distinct from the values espoused by China. To think Microsoft and Google are run by CEOs of Indian origin is just an indicator of the potential. Will we take it?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-india-moment-in-the-100-billion-club/story-pmoISN0hYhanvOijLDkCpJ.html
22-10-2020||News||WTO needs to get its mojo back. A new SDG round of negotiations would help||It is common knowledge that the Doha Round of trade negotiations has long been dead. Yet the fundamental basis of the Doha Round, namely, that the WTO must mainstream development in all its work is a sound one and worth pursuing. The WTO is on the verge of getting fresh top leadership which is a very good thing. The substantial challenge, however, is to build a consensus around a common work programme and a negotiating agenda. There is no gainsaying the fact that there is a backlash against globalisation, free trade and by extension, against international organisations such as WTO. People who have lost out from technological disruption, globalisation or free trade have found an important voice and have started asserting themselves through political choices made in national elections. These are subsequently reflected in country negotiating positions in the WTO. This is hard to ignore anymore; on the other hand, it is for organisations such as WTO to demonstrate that it is on the side of the underdog and the vulnerable in this political battle that is being played out. What better way to do this than by announcing that the WTO’s future work programme and negotiating agenda will be based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) so painstakingly agreed upon by all UN members in 2015.A new SDG round of trade negotiations has numerous advantages for the WTO.First, it is hard to disagree with the SDGs themselves since all countries have publicly committed themselves to achieving it within a definite time frame; so, dubbed the Agenda 2030.Second, it will be a splendid opportunity for the much-maligned WTO to get its mojo back and secure endorsement for the principle of free trade. After all, it is a matter of consensus among economists of all hues that trade is indeed the best instrument for achieving many of the SDGs.Third, the WTO’s future work programme and negotiating agenda must be directly linked to the objectives of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO i.e. raising standards of living, ensuring full employment, expanding the production and trade in goods and services, the optimal use of resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development and finally to do this for all countries at different levels of economic development. This is very similar to SDG number eight which talks of promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth as well as full and productive employment and decent work for all. What would this entail in practical terms for the WTO? First, the WTO must carefully recalibrate the Special and Differential Treatment for countries that deserve it. Rather than junk the whole concept or excessively politicise it, there is a simple metric which can be used to redefine it. The SDG number one is described thus: to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The best place to begin for achieving this goal is with the regions where “extreme poverty” is widely prevalent. The two geographical regions which display “extreme poverty” are: parts of Africa and South Asia. It goes without saying therefore that countries belonging to these two geographical regions must get Special and Differential Treatment without any question. Extreme poverty is now well defined and is backed by the Oxford Multidimensional Index of Poverty, so objective criteria may be utilised for deciding countries which are eligible. This automatically takes care of the American argument that countries such as Singapore and South Korea (or China for that matter) cannot lay automatic claim to Special and Differential Treatment.The multilateral negotiations on Fisheries Subsidies is proceeding apace and must be concluded by the next Ministerial Conference in June 2021. Again, these negotiations must be consistent with SDG number fourteen which is defined thus: Conserve and use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Developing countries and least-developed countries whose citizens depend on fisheries for their livelihood must be treated appropriately in these negotiations.Agriculture has always been a contentious subject in past WTO negotiations. Again, the SDG number two provides sufficient guidance in this critical area: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. The US, EU and other rich countries have long subsidised their agriculture, often with disastrous consequences for the economies of developing and least-developed countries. It is time to make amends. The credibility of the WTO, no less, is at stake.Electronic Commerce poses enormous challenges for developing and least-developed countries. These challenges have to do with digital infrastructure, digital literacy and data sovereignty. The SDG number nine that talks of building resilient infrastructure, promotes inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation should guide these negotiations. There is a steep learning curve ahead for several countries about the implications of digitalisation in the context of the fourth industrial revolution and developed countries need to take into account the serious digital divide that currently exists when they pursue their national interests in these negotiations.The above is obviously not an exhaustive list but an illustrative one. More crucially, it provides a template for the new round of trade negotiations and the work programme of the WTO by anchoring it in the all-important SDGs. Such a move can kill two birds with one stone: to revive the negotiating agenda as well as to resuscitate the WTO itself.(Dr Mohan Kumar is a former Indian negotiator at the WTO, former Indian Ambassador to France and currently Chairman, RIS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/wto-world-trade-organisation/story-TmP5vBUlM8IxFCc12L8uOO.html
22-10-2020||News||Expand and strengthen the Indian State||Over the past few decades, the public discourse regarding the role of the Indian State in the economy and society has become deeply flawedThe disillusionment with the Nehruvian dirigiste State and samajwadi (socialist) policies has generated a backlash against the government and especially government employees. Since the 1990s, the chorus of reducing the size of the government has reached a crescendo with government jobs as favourite target of the chatterati. The perception is that the government is oversized, and we must “reform” the government by reducing the number of officials and employees across government departments and public sector.But the reality is that India has among the lowest public sector employment ratios in the world. According to the Seventh Pay Commission, there were only 139 government employees for every 100,000 people, excluding railways and postal departments. In contrast, the United States (US), with its ”minimum government”, has 668 government employees per 100,000 residents. Most of the government employees in India work in the railways, postal department, home ministry, and in defence while areas such as health and urban development have only a skeleton of the government staffing.There were 750,000 vacancies at the level of central government alone in 2014. Around 38% posts of judges in high courts are lying vacant. In the states, the bureaucracy has been slowly diminishing due to the absence of recruitment at mid-level positions for years.Instead of cutting down the supposedly bloated government sector, what India needs is augmentation of State capacity by hiring more people. Reforming the public sector is not synonymous with cutting down the number of employees. What India needs is restructuring by redeploying its public sector workforce towards delivery of public services.There are massive vacancies in schools, totalling around one million across states. There are around 30% vacancies in the rural and agricultural ministries, which have the task of implementing ambitious governmental schemes affecting a majority of citizens. Even central universities and colleges have been reduced to a pitiable state, with more than 50% vacancies in some cases. And the less we talk about state universities, the better, for the recruitment process can be stuck endlessly.The Indian State is being reduced to a ghost State with successive governments beholden to the humbug of finance and its inexplicable opposition to public spending. It is alleged that paying salaries to government employees is wasteful expenditure and a drag on economic growth. This shallow reasoning fails to take in account the positive impact of a well-staffed and functioning State on economic growth. More judges will ensure speedy justice in the hopelessly overburdened judicial system; more policemen will mean better law and order; and more doctors mean better health care. Only in an alternative world can they be a burden on the economic growth.Government employment has also been a major source of demand due to job stability and better pay in an economy with a low per-capita income, evident in this pandemic. The inability or unwillingness to impose proper performance criteria does not mean that government should stop hiring people altogether. And the problem has never been the numbers of government employees, which was always abysmal. It is about the excessive and arbitrary powers in the hands of the bureaucracy leading to rent-seeking and ability to obstruct lives of the private citizens. We have seen this bureaucratic raj during the pandemic when 4,000 rules were issued in four months creating chaos. The solution, thus, lies in reforming the public services and not disbanding them.The rhetoric of free-market or less government fails to realise that India has historically not had a large, effective State over centuries. People lived without the protection of the State, be it under the military occupation of the Sultanate period or the extractive Mughal State. In fact, the ideal of “Apne Raja Ram” (our king is Ram) spread from village to village as people avoided interacting with the State for settling disputes and societal affairs. Despite creating the foundations of a modern bureaucracy, even colonial rule was a distant, minimalist and non-interventionist State.And the Republic of India too failed to build a strong State with an effective presence at the grassroots, and instead, exercised coercive power via police and district magistrates. Over the last few decades, even the limited gains made in augmenting State capacity are withering away. But the core point is that citizens do not desire the retreat of the State. Instead, they desire more State presence. The entire movement of the Dalits and other subaltern castes is aimed at becoming “visible to the State”, and invoke its protection against the harsh socio-economic realities of their existence. We must start appreciating the fact that after centuries we have a State. And we must learn to own it and build it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/expand-and-strengthen-the-indian-state/story-UMjuHUV0U26YmSnedLKK7I.html
