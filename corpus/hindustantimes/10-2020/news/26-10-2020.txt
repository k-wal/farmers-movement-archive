26-10-2020||News||Bihar: A referendum on Nitish Kumar||The 2020 assembly election in Bihar has taken an interesting turn. The competition between top national and regional parties, the rift within existing alliances, the discourse around jobs, and most importantly, the focus on Nitish Kumar’s record have made the polls complex . Indeed, it is difficult to predict which key electoral issue is going to influence voters most deeply. After election dates were announced, public discourse was centered mainly around creating a formidable alliance of parties, which would bring together caste-based votebanks. But, as polling day approaches, there are still cracks in both the main coalitions in the state. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) was not able retain three potential partners within its formation. Two of them, the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by Mukesh Sahni and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) led by Jitan Ram Manjhi, shifted to the rival group, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), while the Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) led by Upendra Kushwaha has allied with other smaller parties. These parties may be small but they command the loyalty of segments of distinct social groups, based on the caste appeal of their leaders, which could well affect the fortunes of the mahagathbandhan. On the other hand, the internal dynamic within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Nitish Kumar led NDA is not smooth either. The coalition could not retain the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in the pre-poll alliance. Interestingly, the LJP is fighting mainly against the Janata Dal (United). Twenty-one out of its 134 candidates are former BJP functionaries who are taking on the JD(U) on the LJP symbol. This has created confusion among BJP supporters over whether to support the JD(U) candidates or the LJP. And while Chirag Paswan has attacked Chief Minister (CM) Nitish Kumar, he is all praise for the BJP. He has proclaimed that he is a fan of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, and the LJP continues to be remain part of the NDA at the Centre. Many BJP leaders have issued somewhat unconvincing clarifications that the LJP is not part of the NDA in the state. Modi’s silence on this issue in his campaign speeches on Friday has also deepened speculation over that there could be a tacit understanding between the BJP and LJP. There is no doubt that the PM is popular among the voters and, therefore, the LJP may be trying to use this to its advantage, despite the BJP’s protestations that it has asked the LJP to refrain from doing so. These developments pose a challenge for Nitish Kumar who is facing anti-incumbency after 15 years in power.The election campaign is now centered around Nitish Kumar. Unlike in the previous election, the Opposition has refrained from attacking the PM. Therefore, it is Nitish Kumar’s record as CM which seems to be the key electoral issue. His victory in both 2005 and 2010 was the outcome of a successful “coalition of extremes” that brought various caste groups together with the help of the BJP and the other influential caste leaders. In 2015, he allied with Lalu Prasad, who had his own winning combination of Yadavs and Muslims. He then split from Lalu Prasad, whose absence, this time around, should have made the fight easier for the CM, but given the discord within the NDA, that is not the case anymore. The other issue which features prominently, and has been taken up by the Opposition, is unemployment. The challenge of generating employment is not limited to Bihar, but the huge population coupled with the lack of job opportunities has posed a substantial policy challenge. Apart from the public sector, employment is dependent on the size and scope of the private sector. Bihar’s market constitutes only 4% of the national market. The state is hobbled by the absence of land reform and the effects of persistent feudalism persist. The surplus from agriculture has not been ploughed into industry. Bihar has not yet taken a capitalist turn, even though social change and democratisation has taken place. Apart from the effects of large-scale migration, bottom-up corruption has corroded most state structures.The absence of bijli, sadak and paani (electricity, roads and water) as significant issues in this election suggests a paradigm shift in the electoral discourse. There was a time when many parts of the country, including Bihar, were struggling to get basic infrastructure. This suggests that Bihar, under Nitish Kumar, has successfully addressed these issues. The other issues are related to people’s aspirations to achieve outcomes on par with those of other developed states. With migration and the electronic media, the cognitive world has expanded even in rural Bihar.Experience from the previous elections suggest that the key factor behind Nitish Kumar’s success has been the coalition of extremes, which includes dominant castes as well as the most marginalised backward, Dalit and Muslim groups. He is still one of the most popular chief ministers in the country, which is why the BJP has been compelled to accept him as the face of the coalition. Even if Chirag Paswan’s attempts to chip away at the CM succeeds, the BJP will not allow anyone else, but Nitish Kumar to become the CM if the NDA wins. The BJP will wait for another term for its chance because this is the only Hindi heartland state where the party has not yet reached its peak.

26-10-2020||News||Suspend international IP, patent obligations on Covid-19 vaccines||Although strenuous efforts are on across the globe to develop vaccines and drugs to fight Covid-19, the issue of their equitable access remains a major challenge. A formidable barrier to ensuring timely access to vaccines and drugs could be patents or other intellectual property (IP) rights. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), in a 2017 report, documents how patents have hindered the introduction of affordable vaccines in developing countries. The rights of the inventor should be protected through IP laws. Arguably, such protection spurs innovation, overcoming the social costs imposed on the public through limited accessibility of the product. However, in a world living through the worst pandemic in a century, there is a strong case for the collective interests of humanity to trump the individual interests of the inventor. India’s recent proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO), jointly with South Africa, asking for a temporary waiver of the application of certain provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement on Covid-19 vaccines and drugs must be seen in this light. If the waiver is granted, WTO member- countries will not be under obligation, for a temporary period, to either grant or enforce patents and other IP-related rights to Covid-19 drugs, vaccines,ventilators, masks and other related items. This will help them devise plans for vaccinating their populations without worrying about legal suits. While many developing countries have endorsed India’s proposal, countries such as the United States have opposed the move. Articles IX.3 and IX.4 of the WTO agreement empowers the ministerial conference to grant such a waiver. The ministerial conference should state the exceptional circumstances justifying the decision, the terms and conditions governing the working of the waiver, and the date on which the waiver shall end. Thus, the WTO can temporarily suspend the application of the IP-related provisions for a certain period to address the issue of accessibility of vaccines and drugs. There are several instances where WTO has adopted such waivers in the past. Arguably, there is no need to suspend the application of the TRIPS agreement because countries can make use of its flexibilities such as the issuance of compulsory licences. But, working out of some of these flexibilities involves onerous procedural requirements. For instance, while Article 31 bis of the TRIPS agreement allows countries with insufficient manufacturing ability to benefit from the issuance of compulsory licences, the procedural requirement of packaging and labelling is cumbersome. It can lead to delays in supplying vaccines or drugs. Thus, a temporary waiver will be more effective than relying on flexibilities. However, the concern regarding IP rights becoming a barrier in speedily distributing Covid-19 vaccines and drugs is germane not just for WTO law but also vis-à-vis bilateral investment treaties (BITs). Several BITs recognise IP rights as part of foreign investment. Consequently, State regulatory measures that impact the investments of transnational pharmaceutical corporations could be challenged as potential breaches of BITs. This could have a chilling effect on State regulation aimed at ensuring accessibility of Covid-19 drugs and vaccines. Globally, pharma companies have, in the past, used BITs to challenge State regulations on IP rights. Thus, India and other countries must also secure a waiver from the application of BITs to Covid-19 vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics. Countries can do this by adopting a binding declaration to that effect either bilaterally or multilaterally. Some pharmaceutical companies have voluntarily offered that they would not enforce their Covid-19 vaccine patents. However, given the real dangers of “vaccine nationalism” — as per Oxfam’s report, a small group of rich countries has already purchased more than 50% of the future supply of Covid-19 vaccines — voluntary efforts may not be enough. Coordinated State action at the global level that temporarily suspends the application of relevant international law to Covid-19 vaccines and drugs will be an important step in fighting the pandemic.Prabhash Ranjan is a senior assistant professor of law at South Asian University The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/suspend-international-ip-patent-obligations-on-covid-19-vaccines/story-C8KL9pTmRcvaxvMOXhZcYN.html
26-10-2020||News||Designing a new digital governance framework||India’s digital markets have witnessed three paradigm shifts this year. First, there has been rapid digitalisation of traditional sectors, as a response to Covid-19, leading to the phenomenal growth of markets such as edtech, healthtech, telemedicine and digital on-boarding. Second, 200 applications, which originated in China, including popular communications and entertainment platforms, have been banned due to security considerations. Finally, a growing set of voices advocate less dependence on American platforms such as Google that can single-handedly determine the market potential for digital start-ups. All these changes point to the need for a suitable policy response.Nimble-footedness is a key characteristic of competitive digital businesses, which deserves reflection in policy design. Businesses that offer multiple use-cases, products and services account for a large share of the economic value generated in global digital markets. Seven of the top eight global firms in terms of market capitalisation use data-centric business models, and are either American or Chinese. The global digital economy is unfortunately a caricature of the traditional economy. The United States (US) and China dominate because their market conditions are conducive for “platformisation” — stacking multiple services into single catch-all applications such as Facebook or WeChat. There are five Chinese and 13 American counterparts for every digital business in India that generates over a billion dollar in annual revenues. Platformisation of digital India is contingent on the availability of adequate data and content. The combination of organised datasets and compelling content unlocks network effects that help digital businesses achieve scale. Datasets allow companies to anticipate market dynamics, tailor custom offerings, minimise transaction costs and maximise enterprise efficiency. Content precipitates a virtuous cycle of consumption and production, and links digitalisation to the knowledge economy. To access or generate data and content, entrepreneurs need the ability to evolve business models and take risks. India’s Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, a 20-year-old law, theoretically governs all digital applications. It grants legal recognition to e-commerce and is the legislative basis for fundamental rules and regulations. Parliament enacted this omnibus law to promote the early digital economy’s growth in India. India’s IT leadership has identified the need for legal reform because our digital ecosystem has developed beyond recognition. In 2000, India had no digital unicorns, no platforms and less than one per cent of its citizens had access to the internet. Conversely, with around 700 million broadband subscribers today, India sees over 400 million unique site/app visits every month, 97% of which are directed at data and content-driven entertainment. Domestic digital transactions grew at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29.4% between FY 2018-FY 2020. The modernisation of the legal framework for IT offers an unparalleled chance to generate economic gains from this frenetic pace of activity, by removing legacy hurdles. A new framework will require a concerted focus on modern design. Traditional legal-regulatory constructs, based on licences and controls, suffer from a lack of agility and leeway to accommodate the pace of technological change in the digital economy. Governments all around the world are exploring ways to address this problem. This includes detailed discussions in the United Kingdom (UK)’s House of Lords and the European Union (EU)’s European Commission on the merits of wider goals-based or principles-based statutes versus narrower rules-based ones. The former requires thoughtful calibration and state capacity for enforcement, but is more resilient to changes in technology and business models. The latter allows for easier enforcement but is rigid and prevents innovation.In deliberations with top executives, jurists and academics, we found most enthusiasm for a principles-based approach. India can compete effectively in the global digital economy if three criteria are met: Product businesses must become platforms, single utility platforms must transition to multi-utility ones, and these must achieve global scale. India has a strong IT base, which is already export-oriented, and new platforms can ride on its coattails to access global markets. However, the three criteria necessitate policy design that provides legal certainty and supports innovation. In other words, India will have to prioritise bold new principles over prescriptive rules and build new capacities for associated regulatory oversight. India has already shown the gumption to embrace a principles-led approach to digital governance in technical areas such as network-neutrality, despite its repeal in the US. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has also reaffirmed the need for a light-touch regulatory framework for digital applications. Future principles could include constructs such as “platform neutrality” to ensure that large platforms do not become gatekeepers in digital markets, combined with the wider use of “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms to govern business conduct. The country has a historic opportunity to define high-impact principles for governing digital applications. These can serve as a template for other digital markets, even as they foster a level- playing field at home.

26-10-2020||News||Indian democracy is being hollowed out||The world’s largest democracy is at the crossroads. That the economy is in deep crisis is clear. But what is less appreciated is that all the pillars of a democratic system of governance are under assault. The fundamental right to freedom of expression has been systematically suspended through suppression and intimidation. Dissent is deliberately stifled as “terrorism” or branded as an “anti-national activity”. Many institutions that are meant to uphold the rights of citizens and society at large have been co-opted or subverted. The Indian State now diverts attention from real problems of the people by pronouncing bogus threats to “national security” everywhere. Of course, some of these threats are real and have to be dealt with uncompromisingly but the Narendra Modi government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conjure up sinister conspiracies behind every political protest, indeed behind any and everything they see as opposition to them. The system unleashes investigative agencies on dissenters and deploys proxies through sections of the media and online troll factories. India’s hard-won democracy is being hollowed out.The Modi government leaves no scope for exaggeration. Every organ of State that could possibly be used to target political opposition has already been pressed into service — the Police, the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and even the Narcotics Bureau. These agencies now dance only to the tune of the Prime Minister and home minister’s office. The use of State power must always obey constitutional norms and respect established democratic conventions. Foremost among these are two: Such power must always be used in the interest of all citizens without discrimination of any kind; and the State machinery must not be used to selectively target political opponents. The Modi government has consistently done more than any previous government in Independent India to violate these core principles. Early in its first term, the Modi government began designating its own political opponents as enemies of the Indian State. This self-serving move unleashed the most draconian laws in our penal code against any and every protester who disagreed publicly with the BJP and its politics. It began in 2016 with the invoking of sedition charges against young student leaders in Jawaharlal Nehru University, one of India’s foremost universities. It has continued relentlessly in a wide variety of contexts, with a series of disturbing arrests of well-known activists, scholars and intellectuals. They have no doubt taken positions contrary to that of governments in power. But that is what democracy is all about.The most cynical attempt to label anti-BJP protests as anti-India conspiracies is seen in the Modi government’s response to the extraordinary protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). The CAA-NRC protests, led primarily by women, showed how a genuine social movement can respond to sectarian and discriminatory politics with a strong message of peace, inclusiveness, and solidarity. The protests at Shaheen Bagh and at other countless sites across the country demonstrated how dominant male power structures can be persuaded to play a supporting role, leaving the centre stage to women. It was also notable for its proud use of national symbols, including the Constitution and its Preamble, the national flag, and our freedom struggle.This movement received widespread support from civil society activists and organisations across the political spectrum who also opposed the divisive CAA-NRC. But the Modi government refused to acknowledge this movement. Instead, it chose to vilify it and made it a divisive issue in the Delhi elections. BJP leaders — including the minister of state for finance and the home minister — used abusive rhetoric and violent imagery to attack what was essentially a Gandhian satyagraha. Other BJP Delhi leaders publicly threatened to attack the protesters. The ruling party created the conditions in which violence broke out in northeast Delhi. These riots in February would have never occurred had the government wished to prevent them. In the months following, the Modi government carried its vendetta to extreme lengths, claiming that the protests were a conspiracy against the Indian State. The result has been blatantly biased investigations, with around 700 FIRs filed, hundreds being questioned, and dozens detained under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Prominent civil society leaders, some of whom are renowned all over the world, are being named as masterminds and instigators of the Delhi violence. The BJP may have differences with dissenters and civil society activists. Indeed, the same activists have often protested against Congress governments as well. But to paint them as anti-national conspirators promoting communal violence is prejudicial and extremely dangerous for democracy.It is nothing less than shocking that eminent economists, academics, social campaigners and even very senior political leaders that includes a former Union minister have been maliciously targeted through so-called disclosure statements in the investigations by the Delhi Police. This only shows that the BJP is determined to pursue its authoritarian strategy regardless of consequences. The Uttar Pradesh government’s vile response to the Hathras protests against the rape of a Dalit girl, the unlawful cremation and the intimidation of her family crying out for justice is in keeping with this intolerant and undemocratic mindset. It also happens to be in total contrast to how the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government handled the Nirbhaya case.Undermining the basic principles of liberty and freedom of expression in this manner poisons politics and the society itself. The BJP, like every other political party, is entitled to propagate any ideology within the framework of the Indian Constitution. But our Constitution also assures every Indian that fundamental rights do not end with the right to vote — they also include the right to freedom of expression, the right to protest and dissent publicly and peacefully. To paint genuine civil society leaders as evil conspirators and terrorists is to burn the bridges of communication with the common people, on whose behalf they speak. Citizens do not cease to be citizens when the party they voted for loses an election. The Prime Minister repeatedly claims to represent 130 crore Indians. But his government and the ruling party are treating political opponents, dissenters, and those who did not vote for the ruling party as second-class citizens without democratic rights. The people of India are not just an electorate. They, and only they, are the nation. Governments exist to serve them, not vilify this or that part of them. This nation will thrive only when democracy as envisioned by our Constitution and the Independence movement is followed in its letter and spirit.Sonia Gandhi is the president of the Indian National CongressThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indian-democracy-is-being-hollowed-out/story-AvED52JaiKrJxBk2NI4kWN.html

Future principles could include constructs such as “platform neutrality” to ensure that large platforms do not become gatekeepers in digital markets, combined with the wider use of “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms to govern business conduct. The country has a historic opportunity to define high-impact principles for governing digital applications. These can serve as a template for other digital markets, even as they foster a level- playing field at home.

26-10-2020||News||Indian democracy is being hollowed out||The world’s largest democracy is at the crossroads. That the economy is in deep crisis is clear. But what is less appreciated is that all the pillars of a democratic system of governance are under assault. The fundamental right to freedom of expression has been systematically suspended through suppression and intimidation. Dissent is deliberately stifled as “terrorism” or branded as an “anti-national activity”. Many institutions that are meant to uphold the rights of citizens and society at large have been co-opted or subverted. The Indian State now diverts attention from real problems of the people by pronouncing bogus threats to “national security” everywhere. Of course, some of these threats are real and have to be dealt with uncompromisingly but the Narendra Modi government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conjure up sinister conspiracies behind every political protest, indeed behind any and everything they see as opposition to them. The system unleashes investigative agencies on dissenters and deploys proxies through sections of the media and online troll factories. India’s hard-won democracy is being hollowed out.The Modi government leaves no scope for exaggeration. Every organ of State that could possibly be used to target political opposition has already been pressed into service — the Police, the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and even the Narcotics Bureau. These agencies now dance only to the tune of the Prime Minister and home minister’s office. The use of State power must always obey constitutional norms and respect established democratic conventions. Foremost among these are two: Such power must always be used in the interest of all citizens without discrimination of any kind; and the State machinery must not be used to selectively target political opponents. The Modi government has consistently done more than any previous government in Independent India to violate these core principles. Early in its first term, the Modi government began designating its own political opponents as enemies of the Indian State. This self-serving move unleashed the most draconian laws in our penal code against any and every protester who disagreed publicly with the BJP and its politics. It began in 2016 with the invoking of sedition charges against young student leaders in Jawaharlal Nehru University, one of India’s foremost universities. It has continued relentlessly in a wide variety of contexts, with a series of disturbing arrests of well-known activists, scholars and intellectuals. They have no doubt taken positions contrary to that of governments in power. But that is what democracy is all about.The most cynical attempt to label anti-BJP protests as anti-India conspiracies is seen in the Modi government’s response to the extraordinary protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). The CAA-NRC protests, led primarily by women, showed how a genuine social movement can respond to sectarian and discriminatory politics with a strong message of peace, inclusiveness, and solidarity. The protests at Shaheen Bagh and at other countless sites across the country demonstrated how dominant male power structures can be persuaded to play a supporting role, leaving the centre stage to women. It was also notable for its proud use of national symbols, including the Constitution and its Preamble, the national flag, and our freedom struggle.This movement received widespread support from civil society activists and organisations across the political spectrum who also opposed the divisive CAA-NRC. But the Modi government refused to acknowledge this movement. Instead, it chose to vilify it and made it a divisive issue in the Delhi elections. BJP leaders — including the minister of state for finance and the home minister — used abusive rhetoric and violent imagery to attack what was essentially a Gandhian satyagraha. Other BJP Delhi leaders publicly threatened to attack the protesters. The ruling party created the conditions in which violence broke out in northeast Delhi. These riots in February would have never occurred had the government wished to prevent them. In the months following, the Modi government carried its vendetta to extreme lengths, claiming that the protests were a conspiracy against the Indian State. The result has been blatantly biased investigations, with around 700 FIRs filed, hundreds being questioned, and dozens detained under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Prominent civil society leaders, some of whom are renowned all over the world, are being named as masterminds and instigators of the Delhi violence. The BJP may have differences with dissenters and civil society activists. Indeed, the same activists have often protested against Congress governments as well. But to paint them as anti-national conspirators promoting communal violence is prejudicial and extremely dangerous for democracy.It is nothing less than shocking that eminent economists, academics, social campaigners and even very senior political leaders that includes a former Union minister have been maliciously targeted through so-called disclosure statements in the investigations by the Delhi Police. This only shows that the BJP is determined to pursue its authoritarian strategy regardless of consequences. The Uttar Pradesh government’s vile response to the Hathras protests against the rape of a Dalit girl, the unlawful cremation and the intimidation of her family crying out for justice is in keeping with this intolerant and undemocratic mindset. It also happens to be in total contrast to how the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government handled the Nirbhaya case.Undermining the basic principles of liberty and freedom of expression in this manner poisons politics and the society itself. The BJP, like every other political party, is entitled to propagate any ideology within the framework of the Indian Constitution. But our Constitution also assures every Indian that fundamental rights do not end with the right to vote — they also include the right to freedom of expression, the right to protest and dissent publicly and peacefully. To paint genuine civil society leaders as evil conspirators and terrorists is to burn the bridges of communication with the common people, on whose behalf they speak. Citizens do not cease to be citizens when the party they voted for loses an election. The Prime Minister repeatedly claims to represent 130 crore Indians. But his government and the ruling party are treating political opponents, dissenters, and those who did not vote for the ruling party as second-class citizens without democratic rights. The people of India are not just an electorate. They, and only they, are the nation. Governments exist to serve them, not vilify this or that part of them. This nation will thrive only when democracy as envisioned by our Constitution and the Independence movement is followed in its letter and spirit.Sonia Gandhi is the president of the Indian National CongressThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indian-democracy-is-being-hollowed-out/story-AvED52JaiKrJxBk2NI4kWN.html
