On Thursday, Poland hit a new record of daily infections that exceeded 20,100 in the nation of 38 million.“I am asking for these protests to be cancelled because of the epidemic,” Morawiecki said, stressing that the health care system is close to its limits.But women’s rights activists confirmed plans for a huge march in Warsaw Friday evening, and more actions and city blockades next week.Large crowds have protested daily over the past week across the predominantly Catholic country, after a top court ruled that abortion of fetuses with congenital defects is unconstitutional. Police estimate that some 430,000 took part in demonstrations on Wednesday alone.Earlier Thursday Poland’s President Andrzej Duda partially broke ranks with his country’s conservative leadership that has pushed for the new abortion restrictions, and said he thinks women should have the right to abortion of fetuses with deadly defects.“It cannot be that the law requires this kind of heroism from a woman,” Duda said in an interview with radio RMF FM. The president said he still favors outlawing abortion in cases of fetuses with non-lethal congenital defects, such as Down syndrome.Deep divisions that had been brewing for a long time in Poland are now erupting on the streets, with young people heeding a call by women’s rights activists to defend their freedoms. The young, even teenage protesters intentionally choose vulgar chants against the right-wing Law and Justice party to emphasize their anger with the ruling team and that there can be no negotiating with them, language analysts say.Poland’s most powerful politician, Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, had called for his supporters to come out to defend churches after protesters disrupted Masses and spray-painted churches on Sunday.Many interpreted Kaczynski’s call as permission for violence against the protesters.Opposition Civic Coalition lawmakers will seek a no-confidence vote against Kaczynski, who is deputy prime minister, in parliament, saying he triggered huge social tensions at the difficult time of the pandemic.“He started a fire and is pouring gasoline on it,” said opposition lawmaker Monika Wielichowska.It was not clear when the vote would be. The ruling party and its two small coalition partners have 10 votes more than the opposition in the lower house.On Wednesday night, men with a far-right group, All-Polish Youth, attacked women taking part in protests in Wroclaw, Poznan and Bialystok.However, a group guarding a church in the northeastern city of Bialystok held a banner in support of the women but saying their anger should be directed against the government, not churches.Once the court ruling is published and takes effect, abortion only will be legal when a woman’s health or life is in danger or when a pregnancy results from crime like rape or incest.Duda’s comments Thursday were in contrast to his initial reaction last week, when he welcomed the court ruling. He now spoke against abortions of fetuses with Down syndrome, which form the majority of over 1,000 legal terminations performed in Poland each year. Duda called for a new law to distinguish between fatal and non-fatal defects.“I believe that there should be a regulation which, in case of lethal defects, will unequivocally guarantee the rights on the side of the woman,” the president said.His words have no legal bearing on the court ruling and are not expected to appease protesters.Kaczynski’s comment was that Duda “is the president and has the right” to say so.also signaled a difference of opinion with Kaczynski on the issue of security, saying police should have the sole responsibility for protecting the streets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polish-pm-calls-for-stop-to-mass-protests-as-covid-19-pandemic-rages/story-GZIzRA9Jsxn0m751TJP3gK.html

A man originally from Pakistan was arrested over the attack.October 3, 2019 - Mickael Harpon, a 45-year-old IT specialist with security clearance to work in the Paris police headquarters, killed three police officers and one civilian employee before being shot dead by police.

29-10-2020||World||France attack: Church sexton had throat slit while preparing for Mass||As he did every day, the sexton of the Notre Dame church in the French city of Nice opened up the doors around 8:30 a.m. There were few people around; the first Mass of the day was not due to start for another two hours.But soon after he started work, a man armed with a knife entered the church and slit the throat of the sexton, beheaded an elderly woman, and badly wounded a third woman, according to a police source.The sexton and the elderly woman died on the spot, the third woman managed to make it out of the church into a nearby cafe, but she died from her wounds, Nice mayor Christian Estrosi told reporters at the scene. None of the victims has so far been named.What happened in the initial moments of the attack inside the church, a neo-Gothic building in a tree-lined square in the centre of Nice, remains unclear.But testimony from witnesses, mobile phone footage, and accounts from officials, offer an initial if incomplete picture of how the attack ended. Also Read| Attacker that killed 3 people in France’s Nice a 21-year-old Tunisian migrant: ReportAt some point during the attack inside the church, someone ran to a bakery next to the church, and asked staff to call the police.“I thought it was a joke, I didn’t believe it,” said one of the staff in the bakery, who spoke to French broadcaster BFMTV and gave his name as David.But when the person insisted the police should be called, David said he walked the short distance to the corner of Rue d’Italie and Avenue Jean Medecin, where last year local authorities installed an intercom in front of the church that connects directly to the municipal police.David said he pressed the button on the intercom, and summoned the police. The mayor, Estrosi, who had attended last year’s unveiling of the intercom, said this was how police were first alerted to the attack. David said the police arrived on the scene within 30 seconds, while he went back inside his bakery and pulled down the blinds. BLOOD AND PANIC At some point during the attack, the knifeman came out of the church, according to Didier-Olivier Reverdy of police officer’s union Alliance Police Nationale. “When the attacker came out, there was a kind of panic around the concourse” surrounding the church, said Reverdy. “There was blood visible.” Anais Colomna was in the lawyer’s office where she works, next to the church, when her phone call was interrupted by the sound of gunfire.“When I turned around, I saw that they (the police) were firing at someone who was moving away from the church,” she told Reuters. The man police were firing at then disappeared from view, she said.The first shots were fired at 8:58 a.m., according to local officials in Nice. What happened next is unclear, but it appeared the attacker went back towards the church. In video footage obtained by Reuters, shot from a balcony across the street from the church, police officers with guns and Tasers raised, could be seen in the side entrance of the church, looking inside. Gunshots could be heard. It was not clear from the footage what they were shooting at.Estrosi said that, as police were detaining the attacker, “he kept shouting on a loop, ‘Allahu Akbar’.” The Arabic phrase means God is Greatest. The attacker carried on shouting the phrase even after he was shot and wounded by police, Estrosi said. The attacker was detained by police at 9:10 a.m., local officials said.Footage from the same balcony vantage point later showed a man with dark hair on an ambulance gurney being wheeled away from the side of church and into a waiting ambulance. Police with guns surrounded the man on the stretcher, who was motionless.A witness who observed the scene said the man on the gurney was the knife attacker, but Reuters was unable to independently verify that.Also Read: Turkey condemns deadly knife attack in France’s Nice, foreign ministry saysOutside the church a short while later, parishioners gathered to seek news about the victims.Michele Malé, one of the parishioners, broke down in tears. “We just found out on TV that our sexton was assassinated,” she told reporters. “We’re in shock.”The sexton -- a lay member of staff responsible for the upkeep of the church -- was in his late 40s or early 50s and had two children, said Gil Florini, a Catholic priest in Nice.“He did his job as a sexton very well. He was a very kind person,” said Florini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-attack-church-sexton-had-throat-slit-while-preparing-for-mass/story-AacQx5nhmfdZjJQX8XySVL.html

Tunisia’s anti-terrorism court prosecutor began a forensic investigation into “the suspicion that a Tunisian committed a terrorist operation abroad”, Mohsen Dali, spokesman for the specialised counter-militancy court, said in Tunis. In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, state television reported that a Saudi man had been arrested in the Red Sea city of Jeddah after attacking and injuring a guard at the French consulate. The French Embassy said he was in hospital after a knife assault though his life was not in danger.Within hours of the Nice attack, French police killed a man who had threatened passersby with a handgun in Montfavet, near the southern city of Avignon.France’s Le Figaro newspaper quoted a prosecution source as saying the man was undergoing psychiatric treatment, and that they did not believe there was a terrorism motive.Nice’s mayor, Christian Estrosi, said the attack in his city had happened at Notre Dame church and was similar to the beheading earlier this month near Paris of teacher Samuel Paty, who had used cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics class.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attacker-that-killed-3-people-in-france-s-nice-a-21-year-old-tunisian-migrant-report/story-ImkCd9wFKj67L6rZ9ORpnN.html
29-10-2020||World||Turkey condemns deadly knife attack in France’s Nice, foreign ministry says||The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it strongly condemned the deadly knife attack in the French city of Nice.In a statement, the ministry said Turkey stood in solidarity with the French people against violence and terrorism.Ankara strongly condemned Thursday’s “savage” knife attack in southern France that left three people dead, offering its “solidarity”, despite a running diplomatic spat with Paris.Earlier on Wednesday Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vented his outrage at a “disgusting” cartoon in the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo depicting him looking up a woman’s skirt while drinking beer in his underpants.Erdogan’s office vowed to take “legal and diplomatic action” while Turkey’s NTV television said Ankara had also summoned the second-most senior diplomat at the French embassy to express its “strong condemnation”. Under normal circumstances, France’s ambassador would have been summoned, but he has been recalled to Paris for consultations in a further sign of the deteriorating diplomatic relations between the two North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) allies. The front cover Charlie Hebdo cartoon came out just days after Erdogan called for a boycott of French products and questioned President Emmanuel Macron’s sanity for promoting a drive against Islamic extremism.Macron’s defence of the media’s right to mock religion, as exemplified by Charlie Hebdo’s blasphemous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, has stirred angry protests across Turkey and swathes of the Muslim world.Erdogan said he had not personally seen the Charlie Hebdo caricature because he did not want to “give credit to such immoral publications.”“I don’t need to say anything to those scoundrels who insult my beloved prophet on such a scale,” Erdogan said in a speech to his party’s lawmakers.“I am sad and frustrated not because of this disgusting attack on me personally, but because of the impertinence taking aim at our prophet we love more than ourselves.”Macron’s defence of Charlie Hebdo’s right to publish drawings of the prophet, which is forbidden under Islam, came after the brutal murder on October 16 of a French school teacher who had shown cartoons to pupils during a class discussion about freedom of speech.Erdogan’s policies have put Turkey at growing odds with the European Union and Macron has become one of Turkish leader’s most vocal critics.The two statesmen have sparred over the eastern Mediterranean as well as Turkey’s policies across the Middle East and -- most recently -- in the war between Azerbaijani and Armenian separatist forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.Turkish Presidential Communications Director Fahrettin Altun said that Islam cannot be used in the name of terrorism and condemned the attack.“We call on the French leadership to avoid further inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims and focus, instead, on finding the perpetrators of this and other acts of violence,” Altun wrote on Twitter.Altun also said Turkey would continue to confront any politician who insults its religion and values and renewed Turkey’s call for cooperation against terrorism and extremism.Thursday’s attacks, on the birthday of the Prophet Mohammad, came at a time of growing Muslim anger at France’s defence of the right to publish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad and protesters have denounced France in street rallies in several Muslim-majority countriesA knife-wielding attacker killed three people in a suspected terrorist act at a church in the French city of Nice on Thursday, while a gunman was shot dead by police in a separate incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-condemns-deadly-knife-attack-in-france-s-nice-foreign-ministry-says/story-wwdXYXx0z4XYdVl1do7y0L.html

The PPP chairman also warned that his party won’t allow stealing of votes in Gilgit-Baltistan.He stated that it was unfortunate that the ‘tyrants’ had snatched Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Shaheed Shahnawaz Bhutto, Shaheed Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto from the people.“I have gone to the smallest town and village in Gilgit-Baltistan and seen that Bhutto is alive at all those places,” Zardari declared.Thousands of PPP workers from across the Baltistan division had shown up in the meeting.Former Gilgit-Baltistan governor and PPP central leader Qamar Zaman Kaira, former chief minister Mehdi Shah, PPP GB president Amjad Hussain Advocate and Sadia Danish were also present on the occasion.Along with moving ahead with its plan to make Gilgit-Baltistan as its province, Pakistan is also planning to hold elections to the so-called Gilgit Baltistan legislative assembly on November 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bilawal-bhutto-confident-of-people-s-government-taking-over-in-2021/story-PO8o44NuqqmA8JVFAG0VIM.html
29-10-2020||World||Wisconsin Republican Party says hackers stole $2.3 million from account||Hackers stole $2.3 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party’s account that was being used to help reelect President Donald Trump in the key battleground state, the party’s chairman told The Associated Press on Thursday.The party noticed the suspicious activity on Oct. 22 and contacted the FBI on Friday, said Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt.Hitt said the FBI is investigating. FBI spokesman Leonard Peace did not immediately return a message seeking comment.The attack was discovered less than two weeks before Election Day as both Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden made their final push to win Wisconsin and its 10 electoral votes. Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016 and planned his third visit in seven days on Friday. Biden also planned to campaign in Wisconsin on Friday. Polls have consistently shown a tight race in the state, usually with Biden ahead by single digits and within the margin of error.Hitt said the stolen money would have been used in the final days of the campaign to make snap spending decisions based on the state of the race.He said the hackers manipulated invoices from four vendors who were being paid to send out direct mail for Trump’s re-election efforts and to provide pro-Trump material such as hats that could be handed out to supporters. Invoices and other documents were altered so when the party paid them, the money went to the hackers instead of the vendors, Hitt said.The hack was discovered after someone noticed that an invoice was generated that should not have been, he said.Hitt said it appears the attack began as a phishing attempt. It does not appear that any data was stolen, said party spokesman Alec Zimmerman.The money was stolen from the state party’s federal account, which currently contains about $1.1 million, but that number fluctuates daily because of quick moving resources late in the campaign, Zimmerman said.Hitt said he was not aware of any other state GOP being targeted for a similar hack, but state parties were warned at the Republican National Convention this summer to be on the lookout for cyber attacks.Campaign finance reports filed this week in Wisconsin show Democrats have raised far more money than Republicans. The state Democratic Party raised nearly $59 million over the past two years compared with just $23.7 million for Republicans.Early voting is in full swing in Wisconsin, with more than 1.6 million ballots returned as of Thursday morning. That is nearly 55% of the total vote cast in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wisconsin-republican-party-says-hackers-stole-2-3-million-from-account/story-YOEKfyQXUFJcgpZNHgxjfL.html

Their population decreased from 542,091 in July to 517,702 in August following the government measures to reduce the expatriate population and allow more Omanis to join the job market, the report said.It attributed the fall in the number of Indian expats to the government’s “Omanisation process” and the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic. Foreigners, who account for over 40 per cent of the country’s total population of 4.6 million, have played a key role in Oman’s development for several decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-finds-oman-s-indian-diaspora-declined-due-to-omanisation-pandemic/story-atXiIDGVVR2nCoV8wtPIpL.html
29-10-2020||World||UK’s Labour Party suspends Jeremy Corbyn in anti-semitism row||The UK’s Opposition Labour Party on Thursday suspended former leader Jeremy Corbyn from its ranks after a report by the country’s human rights watchdog held the party “responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination” during his time in charge.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which had launched an investigation into antisemitism within the party following a string of complaints, found that Labour had broken the law in its failure to handle antisemitism, or anti-Jewish, complaints and there were “serious failings” by its leadership at the time. However, in his reaction to the report, Corbyn said that the number of complaints made during his tenure were “dramatically overstated”.“One antisemite is one too many, but the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated,” said Corbyn, in reference to the report.A Labour Party spokesperson issued a statement soon after to announce that Corbyn had been suspended from the party.“In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation. He has also had the whip removed from the Parliamentary Labour Party,” the spokesperson said.In his reaction to the EHRC report, current Opposition leader Keir Starmer had indicated that a denial stance to the report would not be tolerated, without any specific references to Corbyn.Starmer said: “And if – after all the pain, all the grief, and all the evidence in this report, there are still those who think there’s no problem with antisemitism in the Labour Party. That it’s all exaggerated, or a factional attack.“Then, frankly, you are part of the problem too. And you should be nowhere near the Labour Party either.” Earlier, the EHRC had served the Labour Party with an unlawful act notice after an investigation into antisemitism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found it responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination. Its investigation, launched in May last year, identified serious failings in the party leadership in addressing antisemitism and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints. The party was found responsible for three breaches of the UK’s Equality Act (2010) relating to political interference in antisemitism complaints; failure to provide adequate training to those handling antisemitism complaints; and harassment.“The equality body’s analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent antisemitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it,” the EHRC said.Starmer said he is “truly sorry” for all the pain and grief that has been caused and apologised to Jewish people who had been driven out of the party and Parliament.He said: “I know how hard these last few years have been, how painful today will be, and how hard you have to fight to hear your voices heard.“I hear you, and I can promise you this: I will act. Never again will Labour let you down. Never again will we fail to tackle anti-Semitism and never again will we lose your trust.“We will implement all recommendations, and we will implement them in full.” Some Labour members of Parliament who had distanced themselves from the party over the issue have since responded positively to the Labour leader’s reaction to the damning EHRC findings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-labour-party-suspends-jeremy-corbyn-in-anti-semitism-row/story-aB9KbSiDxH5EQ3C2mM9upN.html

The attacker was a member of the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.“Hum ne Hindustan ko Ghuss ke Mara Hai (We have entered and attacked India),” said Fawad Chaudhry, the science of technology minister in the Imran Khan cabinet, amid clapping from the ruling party MPs. “The victory in Pulwama is a victory for the people of Pakistan under the leadership of Imran Khan,” he added.Also Read: Pak military on damage control after MP says IAF pilot was released out of panicThe minister said that the credit for Pulwama goes to all: “We are all stakeholders in it.”Chaudhry said it is a matter of pride “the way we entered India and beat them at Pulwama.” The way our Shaheens (Air Force) and our Sipahis (soldiers) and our sons beat them is a cause of embarrassment for the Indian political leadership and the Indian media, he said.Watch: Pakistan minister brags about role Imran govt’s role in Pulwama attack  Chaudhry was replying to comments made a day earlier by former speaker and MP from the PML-N party, Ayaz Sadiq, on the floor of the house. Sadiq had alleged that the Pakistani leadership had panicked after the Pulwama attack and the subsequent shooting down of an Indian air force place. Sadiq had said that Imran Khan had taken the decision to return the Indian pilot even before a meeting with the country’s political leadership. He had alleged that the Imran Khan government was so panicked that “the legs of the foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi kept on shaking from fear.”Also Read: Centre designates 18 Pakistan-based terrorists as ‘individual terrorists’Chaudhry replied on Thursday that Sadiq “had lied with confidence.” He lamented that Sadiq has gone against the interests of the state of Pakistan by issuing false and shameful statements. “Criticise the government but don’t criticise the state,” he told Sadiq. The Pakistan minister said that in his capacity as speaker, Ayaz Sadiq has been involved in the internal deliberations that took place. “But he should have some shame on how he has lied,” he added. Later in the day, Chaudhry claimed the Indian media has “once again acted with gross irresponsibility” by misrepresenting his speech.A spokesperson of his ministry said in a statement that the minister had referred to the ‘Operation Swift Retort’ which was a successful military response by the Pakistan Airforce ( PAF) to IAF, “as a result of which two Indian jets were shot down, not to mention the arrest of the widely discussed pilot Abhinandan, who was later released by the Government of Pakistan as a diplomatic gesture of peace.”The spokesperson added that the fact remains that, as recently Indian media had erroneously presented a petty political skirmish in Karachi as a civil war, and caused embarrassment to India at international level, it has, yet again, “acted irresponsibly” vis-a-vis Mr Chaudhry’s speech, and made a futile attempt to malign the image of Pakistan.”“It is reiterated that Pakistan has always upheld the international norms of peace and tranquility”, and believes in mutual co-existence and cordial relations with its neighbouring countries.“Therefore, any such misrepresentation of facts by the Indian media must be avoided and efforts be made for regional peace,” the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/guss-ke-maara-minister-admits-pakistan-s-role-in-pulwama-attack/story-mXhUH1mBuPMIFeaWrjMxMJ.html

We urge the US side to keep their words, take effective measures to stop military provocations in the sea and air spaces around China, and stop any actions that harm China’s core interests and major concerns,” Wu said.“Should anyone dare to stir up a conflict on the sea, the Chinese side will fight back resolutely to safeguard its national sovereignty and security interests,” he said.The US-China military tensions heightened in recent months over the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan.China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea area while the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over it.The US in recent months has stepped up naval and aerial patrols over the area to assert the right of freedom of navigation. The Chinese military closely tailed the US patrols sparking tensions.China is also concerned over US naval ships travelling through the Taiwan straits and high-tech arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-asks-us-to-walk-with-it-instead-of-continuing-provocations-in-sea-and-air/story-IEf016gh1VZ2DdYw0SlRDP.html

An official statement said that both the companies have signed a statement of intent with the Gavi Alliance, which administers the Covax plan for fair vaccine distribution. The Covax plan, which has over 180 countries, seeks to ‘equitably allocate and deliver’ around two billion doses of vaccine by the end of next year.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMeanwhile, on Monday, a report by the Financial Times said the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine against the coronavirus disease saw a robust immune response in elderly people. Earlier, the trials for the vaccine had stopped after a volunteer fell sick.As there is a rise in infections particularly in continents such as Europe where countries have started re-imposing lockdowns and other related restrictions, the need to come up with a vaccine at the earliest is of utmost interest.Here is a look at the latest developments around the Covid-19 vaccine:1. Russian president Vladimir Putin on Thursday said the country’s experimental vaccines were found to be effective with hopes to start mass vaccinations by the end of 2020.2. US-based biotechnology company Moderna said its independent data monitoring committee is expected to conduct an interim review of its ongoing 30,000-volunteer late-stage trial in the month of November. Moderna has signed deals with the United States government and several other countries.3. German chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday said preparations for anti-coronavirus disease vaccinations in the country are underway and added that the government is working on ethical guidelines on who should the shots be available to.Also Read| India’s average daily Covid tests in past 6 weeks at about 11 lakh: Centre4. Scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have said the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is used for treating tuberculosis (TB), is also beneficial against Covid-19 among the elderly. Those who are over 60 years of age and have co-morbidities such as hypertension, cardiac issues, kidney-related diseases and several other conditions are more prone to getting infected by Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease.5. Reports suggest that Chinese-based Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products has started a mid-stage trial of its experimental vaccine. As per details furnished by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on Wednesday, the company plans to test the vaccine’s safety and ability to trigger immune responses in Phase 2 clinical trial, which is expected to have 1,000 participants.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-from-sanofi-glaxosmithkline-vow-to-russia-s-plan-of-mass-vaccinations/story-kAqkq1vyLSnDkrFEozqJLJ.html
29-10-2020||World||If Joe Biden wins presidential election, what would US climate change pledge look like||If he wins next Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election, Joe Biden has pledged to give the country a leading role in global efforts to curb climate change. Experts are wondering how ambitious his plans would be on slashing emissions this decade.President Donald Trump, who has rejected mainstream science on climate change, does not have a plan to address global warming. The Republican president rejected the 2015 Paris Agreement early in his first term, and the United States is set to formally exit the deal to rein in global emissions on November 4, the day after the election.His Democratic challenger, former Vice President Biden, has pledged that if he wins and takes office in January he would immediately rejoin the international accord, and commit the country to reach net zero emissions by 2050.A push by Biden to re-assert U.S. leadership on the issue would likely also include a pledge to slash emissions by 2030.That is because under the Paris Agreement progress towards curbing climate change is measured by countries’ pledges to rein in emissons this decade. All countries have been asked to update those pledges, but so far, few have.“Credibility begins at home,” said John Podesta, a counselor on climate and energy to former President Barack Obama, who is now an informal adviser to Biden.Podesta’s think-tank, the Center for American Progress, has recommended to the Biden campaign that the United States commits to cut greenhouse gas emissions 43% by 2030, from 2005 levels.“I think the campaign will take a hard look at that,” he told Reuters.Researchers at The Rhodium Group agreed a 43% goal would put the country on track for net zero emissions by 2050 - a pathway which, if followed globally, would avoid the worst impacts of climate change.However, as the world’s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases and the biggest economy, “the U.S. should clearly do more than merely the global average,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.A fair U.S. contribution would require more than a 70% cut in emissions this decade, from 2005 levels, he said.The Biden campaign has not yet set an economy-wide emissions target for 2030, but his climate plan features a goal to eliminate carbon emissions from the power sector by 2035.With lethal heatwaves, wildfires and floods intensifying around the world, scientists say the world’s ability to avert catastrophic climate change could slip out of reach, if emissions do not drop sharply this decade.A Biden administration could get a boost from climate policies already in place in many states, cities and businesses. Together, these efforts could curb U.S. emissions 37% this decade, from 2005 levels, according to Bloomberg Philanthropies’ “America’s Pledge” initiative.“Maximising that potential will require strong, decisive action from federal leaders in the White House and in Congress,” said Antha Williams, head of Bloomberg Philanthropies climate programmes.But Biden’s ability to implement his $2 trillion plan to slash emissions would also depend on whether Democrats wrest control of the Senate from the Republicans next week. If they do not, he may need to take executive action.Executive action is more vulnerable to lawsuits. Trump has faced over 100 environment-related lawsuits for his moves to unwind regulations meant to protect health and the environment in his bid to lower costs for the energy and auto industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-joe-biden-wins-presidential-election-what-would-us-climate-change-pledge-look-like/story-X8DpoenEUhEAYkqOOQSp5M.html

The attacker had said he wanted to punish the teacher for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson.Since Paty’s killing, French officials have re-asserted the right to display the cartoons, and the images have been widely displayed at marches in solidarity with the killed teacher. That has prompted anger in parts of the Muslim world, with some governments accusing Macron of pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.Saudi Arabia on Tuesday condemned cartoons offending the Prophet Mohammad, but held back from echoing calls by other Muslim states for action against images being displayed in France of the Prophet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-arrested-in-jeddah-after-knife-attack-on-guard-at-french-consulate/story-ihFjd0OtkWHSmb25nscvVM.html
29-10-2020||World||Boris Johnson under pressure to impose tougher lockdown measures as Covid-19 cases surge||Boris Johnson faces growing calls to introduce another national lockdown as scientists warn coronavirus measures in England are failing to control the spread of the disease.Infections are doubling every nine days and an estimated 960,000 people are carrying the virus in England on any one day, according to the latest findings from Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori, which is conducting one of the country’s largest studies of the disease. The reproduction rate of the virus -- a measure of how many people on average are infected by a single carrier -- has risen to 1.6, compared to 1.2 when the last figures were published October 9.The stark results add to the pressure on the Prime Minister to impose even tighter social restrictions in the fight against the virus, as deaths and cases climb once again. Elsewhere in Europe, governments are already taking action: France has announced a new monthlong nationwide lockdown and Germany has imposed its toughest rules since the spring.So far, Johnson has resisted a second national lockdown, preferring a localized tiered approach where regions with the highest infection rates face tougher social distancing rules, including a ban on household mixing and closing pubs that don’t sell meals. But members of the SAGE scientific committee advising the government are calling for tougher action.“It’s like living through a fire that is out of control with the government using buckets of water instead of fire engines to extinguish the flames,” Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London who sits on SAGE, said on Twitter.Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert who also sits on SAGE, said delaying a lockdown in March left the U.K. with one of the worst outcomes globally and warned the government against making the same mistake. “Delaying is itself a decision with consequences,” he said on Twitter.But the government stood firm on Thursday and said it will continue with its localized strategy.“It is right to try everything in our power to avoid a blanket national lockdown, it brings with it great damage to people’s lives and livelihoods,” Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio 4. “Each country has to take its own balanced judgment.”Nottinghamshire was the latest area to move into the government’s highest level of restrictions on Wednesday, joining the likes of Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Merseyside.Coronavirus continues to spread across the U.K.: 310 new deaths were reported on Wednesday, following the 367 on Tuesday which was the highest daily total since May. The number of daily positive cases rose by 24,701, compared to 22,885 the day before.The Imperial findings cohere with new modeling by SAGE, which suggests the U.K. is on course for a prolonged winter peak in the pandemic where there will be more deaths than last spring.Britain’s death toll from the second coronavirus wave could reach 85,000 in a “reasonable worst case scenario,” the Telegraph newspaper reported, citing SAGE documents.“The second wave of the epidemic in England has now reached a critical stage,” the scientists said in the report led by Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial. “Our results suggest strongly that one or more of the policies themselves, the timing of tier advancement, or levels of compliance, have not been sufficient to date to achieve control.”The opposition Labour Party, as well as Johnson’s own scientific advisers last month, have called for a temporary “circuit breaker” national lockdown to get the virus under control. Labour called on Johnson to hold a press conference Thursday on the government’s Covid strategy.“People will be alarmed and worried and looking for reassurance from ministers,” Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said in a statement on the Imperial College study. “Businesses are fearful that a delay in taking decisive national action will create further, deeper uncertainty for the economy.”The surge is coming as the government’s key test-and-trace program continues to miss key targets, hampering efforts to contain the disease. The Guardian newspaper reported government officials have asked local health chiefs to deploy new 30-minute saliva kits to accelerate mass screening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-impose-tougher-lockdown-measures-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-TaJGDvnxX6nh1mRH4X74MN.html

The Robert Koch Institute also recorded 89 additional deaths, taking the country’s total to 10,272. That is still one-fourth the death toll in Britain.Merkel told lawmakers that Germany is in a “dramatic situation” as it goes into winter, which she said would be “four long, difficult months. But it will end.”The long-time German leader said authorities had no choice but to drastically reduce social contacts as three-quarters of infections in Germany now can’t be traced anymore.“If we wait until the ICUs are full, then it will be too late,” she said.Merkel said democratic debate about the virus restrictions was important, but blasted some critics who have claimed the German government is exaggerating the threat of the virus.“Lies and disinformation, conspiracies and hatred damage not just the debate but also the battle against the virus,” she said. “It’s not just democratic debate that depends on our relationship to facts and information, human lives depend on it.”Also read | ‘Lockdown light’ declared in Germany to check rising Covid-19 casesOpposition leader Alexander Gauland of the far-right Alternative for Germany party responded to Merkel’s speech by accusing the government of “wartime propaganda” and likened the pandemic to motorized traffic, arguing that society accepts a certain number of car deaths too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-warns-germans-of-a-difficult-winter-as-covid-19-surges/story-giYQVj3xTNYcKfYbHEkEaL.html
29-10-2020||World||Some recovered Covid-19 patients may still carry virus, says study||Some recovered Covid-19 patients may still carry the novel coronavirus, according to a new study which recommends that people leaving quarantine avoid close contact with others, wear a face mask, and possibly undergo an additional test to confirm if they are free of the virus. The study, assessed 131 Covid-19 patients who met the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for discontinuation of quarantine, and found that close to 17 per cent of them, who were considered fully recovered, tested positive for the virus in follow-up screening.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “Our findings indicate that a noteworthy rate of recovered patients with Covid-19 could still be asymptomatic carriers of the virus,” said study co-author Francesco Landi from Fondazione Policlinico Universitario in Italy. In the study, the researchers followed Covid-19 patients after their recovery to assess the impact of the virus on their bodies. It found that patients who continued to have respiratory symptoms, especially sore throat and rhinitis, were more likely to have a new positive test result. The researchers said the persistence of these two symptoms should not be underestimated and must be adequately assessed in all patients considered recovered from Covid-19. “Clinicians and researchers have focused on the acute phase of Covid-19, but continued monitoring after discharge for long-lasting effects is needed,” Landi explained. In the study, the researchers assessed 131 patients who met the WHO criteria for discontinuation of quarantine.  It specifies that patients should be fever-free without fever-reducing medications for three days, show improvement in any symptoms related to Covid-19, and be more than seven days past symptom onset. According to the WHO criteria, the patients must also test negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus twice, at least 24 hours apart, with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) testing. The scientists also collected demographic, medical, and clinical information from the patients with an emphasis on the persistence of symptoms and signs related to Covid-19 such as cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headache, smelling disorders, loss of appetite, sore throat, and rhinitis. Their analysis found that twenty-two (16.7 per cent) of the patients tested positive again. The study did not find any significant difference between patients with positive and negative test results in terms of age or sex. It noted that none of the patients had fever and all reported improvement in their overall clinical condition. According to the researchers, the time since onset of disease, number of days hospitalised, and treatments received while receiving care were not significant. However, they said some symptoms such as fatigue (51 per cent), laboured breathing (44 percent) and coughing (17 percent) were still present in a significant percentage of the patients studied. But the scientists added that there were no significant differences between individuals with a positive or negative test. The only two symptoms that were higher and significantly prevalent in patients with a positive test were sore throat and signs of rhinitis, they said. “The main question for the containment of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection that still needs to be answered is whether persistent presence of virus fragments means the patients is still contagious,” Landi said. The scientists explained that the RT-PCR test looks for small fragments of viral genetic material, it’s RNA, and a positive swab test can reveal if patients are still shedding viral fragments. “But it is not able to discern whether they are or aren’t infectious,” Landi added. For patients who continue to have symptoms potentially related to Covid-19, the researchers said it is reasonable to be cautious and avoid close contact with others, wear a face mask, and possibly undergo an additional nasopharyngeal swab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-recovered-covid-19-patients-may-still-carry-virus-says-study/story-w2oXk6jzRnKXzu7gFerKII.html
29-10-2020||World||Woman beheaded, 2 more killed in knife attack at French church||A knife-wielding attacker shouting “Allahu Akbar” beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a suspected terrorist act at a church in the French city of Nice on Thursday, while a gunman was shot dead by police in a separate incident.Within hours of the Nice attack, police killed a man who had threatened passersby with a handgun in Montfavet, near the southern French city of Avignon. He was also shouting “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest), according to radio station Europe 1.In Saudi Arabia on Thursday, state television reported that a Saudi man had been arrested in the city of Jeddah after attacking and injuring a guard at the French consulate.The French Embassy said the consulate was subject to an “attack by knife which targeted a guard”, adding the guard was taken to hospital and his life was not in danger.Nice’s mayor, Christian Estrosi, who described the attack in his city as terrorism, said on Twitter it had happened in or near Notre Dame church and was similar to the beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty in an attack this month in Paris.Estrosi said the attacker had repeatedly shouted the phrase “Allahu Akbar”, even after he had been detained by police.One of the people killed inside the church was believed to be the church warden, Estrosi said, adding that a woman had tried to escape from inside the church and had fled into a bar opposite the 19th century neo-Gothic building. ​ “The suspected knife attacker was shot by police while being detained, he is on his way to hospital, he is alive,” Estrosi told reporters.“Enough is enough,” Estrosi said. “It’s time now for France to exonerate itself from the laws of peace in order to definitively wipe out Islamo-fascism from our territory.”Reuters journalists at the scene said police armed with automatic weapons had put up a security cordon around the church, which is on Nice’s Jean Medecin avenue, the city’s main shopping thoroughfare. Ambulances and fire service vehicles were also at the scene.SOLIDARITYFrench President Emmanuel Macron is due to visit Nice, Estrosi said.In Paris, lawmakers in the National Assembly observed a minute’s silence in solidarity with the victims. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the people of Nice “can count on the support of the city of Paris and of Parisians”.Police said three people were confirmed to have died in the attack and several were injured. The French anti-terrorist prosecutor’s department said it had been asked to investigate.A police source said a woman was decapitated. French far-right politician Marine Le Pen also spoke of a decapitation having occurred in the attack.A representative of the French Council for the Muslim Faith strongly condemned the attack. “As a sign of mourning and solidarity with the victims and their loved ones, I call on all Muslims in France to cancel all the celebrations of the holiday of Mawlid.”.The holiday is the birthday of the Prophet Mohammad, which is being celebrated Thursday.Estrosi said the victims had been killed in a “horrible way”.“The methods match, without doubt, those used against the brave teacher in Conflans Sainte Honorine, Samuel Paty,” he said, referring to a French teacher beheaded earlier this month in an attack in a suburb of Paris.The attack comes while France is still reeling from the beheading earlier this month of middle school teacher Paty by a man of Chechen origin.The attacker had said he wanted to punish Paty for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson.It was not immediately clear if Thursday’s attack was connected to the cartoons, which Muslims consider to be blasphemous.Since Paty’s killing, French officials - backed by many ordinary citizens - have re-asserted the right to display the cartoons, and the images have been widely displayed at marches in solidarity with the killed teacher.That has prompted an outpouring of anger in parts of the Muslim world, with some governments accusing Macron of pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.In a comment on recent beheadings in France, the Kremlin said on Thursday it was unacceptable to kill people, but also wrong to insult the feelings of religious believers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-police-2-dead-in-knife-attack-near-church-in-nice/story-Y2O7MNh7tbzudspuFFzzoI.html

The TAR has a long and disputed boundary with India.The data centre covers an area of more than 645,000 metres.The new centre is part of the Chinese information technology ministry’s plan to make Lhasa the communication and information hub for South Asia.“After the completion of phase one, the data centre will have 10,000 machine cabinets and an annual revenue of 1.5 billion yuan ( $223.5 million), meeting the data storage needs of key clients in the country and in South Asia,” the Xinhua report said.Located at nearly 10,000 feet, the centre, operated by private technology firm Ningsuan Technologies, is the highest cloud computing centre in the world.Wang Jun, Ningsuan’s vice president and chief marketing officer, was quoted as saying that as Lhasa pushes forward with the construction of a regional bureau for stepping up international communications services, Tibet will become a big-data industrial base.The firm, with the support of the Chinese government, is seeking cooperation with south Asian countries under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), President Xi Jinping’s legacy project that seeks to connect China with the rest of Asia and beyond through infrastructure projects – including digital ones.While India has refused to join the BRI because of sovereignty issues, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh are part of it.As an international offshore data centre in Lhasa, the “facility has high reliability, cost-effectiveness and energy-saving ability, which are competitive factors when competing with data centres in other provinces or regions in China,” Hu Xiao, general manager of Ningsuan Technologies, had told Chinese state media in June, in a rare report on the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-building-cloud-computing-centre-in-tibet-to-serve-south-asian-countries/story-ebvvSPVmC4V3CQ4yV5St0N.html
29-10-2020||World||Hurricane Zeta slams into southern United States, downgraded to tropical storm||Hurricane Zeta barreled through the southern United States as a Category 2 storm Wednesday, bringing dangerous winds and surging ocean waves as New Orleans residents were left without power.Zeta, which was downgraded to a tropical storm during Thursday’s early hours, would “continue to spread well inland across portions of northeastern Alabama, northern Georgia, the Carolinas, and southeastern Virginia,” according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).It was packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour, the center said at 0900 GMT.Early on Thursday, New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell said the city was dealing with many downed power lines.“Downed lines can be energized and are VERY dangerous,” she tweeted. “Please continue to stay inside and let public safety officials respond to #Zeta hazards.”The city emergency medical service tweeted that there had been one “electrocution fatality” from a downed power line.Mississippi governor Tate Reeves had signed an emergency declaration ahead of Zeta’s approach earlier Wednesday, and Alabama governor Kay Ivey took to Twitter to advise state residents to prepare for the storm and “listen to all local advice.”Hurricane and storm surge warnings were lifted for Louisiana, but governor John Bel Edwards urged people to stay inside.“Today has been hard,” he tweeted. “As we continue to weather #Zeta and feel its effects, everyone needs to keep listening to their local leaders and follow any curfews that may be in place.”Heavy wind and sheets of rain cut through New Orleans, and power outages were reported in various areas.Edwards said in an earlier radio interview that nearly 500,000 were without power in the state, including 78 percent of New Orleans.Officials had urged residents to evacuate vulnerable areas or stock up on emergency supplies of food, water and medication for at least three days.Curfews were in effect for harder-hit coastal areas.Zeta hit just six days before the presidential election, although it was not expected to affect the outcome, with early voting in Louisiana already finished.French Quarter deserted As rainfall and winds began ahead of the storm’s arrival, New Orleans residents rushed to prepare, boarding up windows, moving vehicles and boats to higher ground and in some cases stacking sandbags to guard against potential flooding.The hurricane was the fifth major storm to hit Louisiana this year.The New Orleans area has repeatedly had to be on guard, though it has been spared so far this year, with the brunt of earlier storms hitting cities such as Lake Charles, some 200 miles (320 kilometers) west near the Texas border.This time, though, local officials were urgently warning against complacency.Flooding was less of a threat this time for the low-lying city -- 80 percent of which flooded during 2005’s Hurricane Katrina -- because the storm was fast-moving at 25 miles per hour.New Orleans remains traumatized by Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people 15 years ago.Annie Quattlebaum, a 39-year-old biologist, and a group of friends visiting from Denver were stranded when the storm caused their flight to be canceled.They were roaming the city’s famous French Quarter, largely deserted on Wednesday afternoon, in search of an open store to buy drinks and food as they prepared to hunker down in their hotel for the night.“We’ve been told by friends that are familiar with this area and familiar with the weather to have snacks and have your phone charged,” said a mask-wearing Quattlebaum.“We’re not going to do anything stupid. We’re just going to hunker down while it’s going on.”‘These poor guys’Along the shores of Lake Catherine, on the far northeastern edge of the city where many locals have weekend homes and commercial fishermen operate, boats were lined up along the higher ground of roadsides.At Island Marina, Geoff Wallace, 60, secured wood and other material he was using for a construction project to keep it from flying away and becoming missiles.“It’s just a part of living here,” he said, gray skies shadowing the marshland and a shrimp boat behind him.“These poor guys,” he said of the marina owners. “They’ve had to go through this four or five times this year.

If infections continue at this rate, we will be at the limits of the capacities of our health system,” said the chancellor at a press conference, adding that schools and nurseries would remain open.The new lockdown norms were announced due to a surge in the virus infection rate that went over a threshold of 50 per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. The German government along with the country’s 16 state premiers has decided to close restaurants and pubs throughout November, along with cinemas, trade fairs, theatres, and fitness centres.The move is going to affect the sports too as all professional sports competitions in Germany, including top-level football, will be held behind closed doors from Monday and amateur sports activities will not be allowed, reported Euro News.“No more than ten people should convene at one time and contact is set to be limited to two households,” said Merkel.The recent measures have created anger amongst Germany’s hospitality industry, already overburdened due to the coronavirus pandemic staged a protest at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate to demand financial support from the government.Meanwhile, the government has announced Euro 10 billion in additional emergency aid to help those who have been financially impacted by the pandemic.Germany’s new daily infections hit its highest total yet on Wednesday at over 14,000, with just 25 per cent of the country’s intensive care beds available reported Euro News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-light-declared-in-germany-to-check-rising-covid-19-cases/story-irUQJS1zdVpc7wRGzhfhRP.html

France’s Covid-19 deaths are currently at the highest level since the peak of the pandemic in April and 33,000 new cases of the virus were recorded on Tuesday.“The evolution of the virus in France has surpassed ‘even the most pessimistic projections’“, said Macron.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAmid the new confinement rules, which will come into effect from Friday, it was announced that school and creches will remain open. People will be allowed to leave their homes for essential work purposes, medical appointments along with grocery shopping, reported Euro News.French international borders will remain closed and mandatory testing will be done on anyone entering the country.“A ‘special plan’ will be conceived to help the self-employed, shopkeepers, as well as very small enterprises (VSEs) and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are impacted financially by the lockdown and employees who are unable to work, will benefit from a furlough scheme and receive cash for expenses and rent in the coming weeks,” added Macron.The restrictions introduced in the last few weeks, which included curfews in some of the worst-hit areas of France, were insufficient in combatting a second wave, the leader added.Further, Macron said he hoped that French families could celebrate Christmas and New Year together after the national lockdown was over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-french-prez-emmanuel-macron-announces-new-lockdown-rules-amid-surge-in-cases/story-8M0TxE4TMe8F89RPykYMQI.html

29-10-2020||World||Pakistani clerics give approval to Hindu temple construction||Pakistan’s state-run council of clerics, which advises the government on religious issues, gave its approval Wednesday to the construction of a new temple for minority Hindus, ruling Islamic law allows them a place of worship.Lal Malhi, a prominent Hindu leader who is also a member of parliament, applauded the ruling but noted the council also recommended the government not spend public funds directly on the construction of private places of worship.The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June. Khan’s decision came amid threats from radical Muslims who called construction of the temple a blasphemous act.Some extremists had vowed to try to stop the temple’s construction with force, raising tensions. Khan turned to the council to decide if public money could be used for construction. He had promised $600,000 for the temple’s construction.It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether Khan would follow through with providing the funds in light of the council’s ruling. However, the council’s ruling left open the possibility the money could be distributed to the Hindu community to use as it sees fit.Khan, who has promised equal rights for minorities, is expected to issue a formal order to allow the temple’s construction.Currently, there is no functioning temple for Hindus in Islamabad. An ancient temple exists in the capital, but Hindus don’t use it for fear of attacks.About 3,000 Hindus live in Islamabad with its population of more than 1 million, mostly Muslims.Muslims and Hindus generally live peacefully together in Pakistan, but there have been incidents in which Hindu girls were forcibly converted to Islam.Most of the country’s Hindus migrated to India from present day Pakistan in 1947 when India was divided by Britain’s government. Nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and India have a history of bitter relations. They have fought three wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is split between them but claimed by both in its entirety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-clerics-give-approval-to-hindu-temple-construction/story-xJbJuKr6eVSgcb7YI9UkML.html

29-10-2020||World||Melbourne, locked-down for 3 months, has bleak lessons for the world||As countries across the globe grapple with the prospect of renewed lockdowns, the Australian city of Melbourne offers a stark lesson on the costs of bringing the coronavirus under control.The city of 5 million people on Wednesday emerged from one of the world’s strictest and longest lockdowns that shuttered businesses and confined residents to their homes for more than three months.While infections have dropped from a daily peak of about 700 in early August to just two new cases on Wednesday, the economic and social impact of Melbourne’s second lockdown since the crisis began has been enormous. Australia’s government estimates 1,200 jobs have been lost on average a day across Victoria state, while demand for mental health services has surged by more than 30%.Also Read | Australia’s second-largest city ends 111-day Covid-19 lockdownDespite key factors working in Melbourne’s favor, including closed borders, an infection count that was tiny by international standards, and a state government with strong public backing, it still took twice as long as anticipated to crush the curve.It’s a bleak reality confronting political leaders, particularly in Europe, who have already experienced the damage wrought by full-blown lockdowns and are now weighing options to fight a resurgence of the pandemic.Australia was in the vanguard of nations that had early success in controlling community transmission. Its first nationwide lockdown, which lasted roughly from March to May, reduced the number of cases to just a handful a day.But security failures at quarantine hotels for returning overseas travellers, poor communication of critical information to migrant communities and inadequate contact tracing allowed the virus to roar back in Victoria.On July 7, state Premier Daniel Andrews announced a six-week lockdown, ordering Melbourne residents to stay home except for essential work and services, medical treatment, school or an hour’s exercise a day. Less than a month later, as cases continued to rise, the restrictions were extended across the entire state, Melbourne was placed under a nighttime curfew, schools were closed and large parts of retail, manufacturing and hospitality were shut down.With Victoria accounting for about a quarter of the nation’s gross domestic product, the restrictions have deepened Australia’s first recession in almost 30 years.The lockdown has slashed A$100 million ($71 million) a day from economic activity and through August and September resulted in a daily average of 1,200 jobs being lost across the state, Luke Yeaman, a Treasury department official, told a parliamentary panel this week.Long RecoveryBusiness leaders say it may take years for Melbourne -- ranked as the world’s second-most livable city last year -- to recover. Melbourne chef Scott Pickett warned that ongoing capacity restrictions would continue to hit restaurants and cafes and that many would fold once government wage subsidies end early next year.“Some may get to Christmas, January and say they can’t do this anymore,” said Pickett, who owns the bistro Estelle. “It’s going to be a bloodbath out there at some stage.”“This is the beginning of a long road of recovery,” said Michael Madrusan, co-owner of Made in the Shade, which operates venues in the city including The Everleigh cocktail bar. “We are in no way out of the woods just because we can open the doors.”Also Read | Melbourne opens up dining, shopping as four month virus lockdown liftedThe social costs are also mounting. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners says demand for health services nationwide has risen 15% since early March, and by 31% between September and October in Victoria. Alcohol consumption has risen and domestic violence spiked.“Only being allowed outside for an hour a day was awful,” said Tessa Patrao, 27, who is finally back at work as a primary school teacher after the 112-day stay-at-home order. The second lockdown was even harder than the first, particularly as much of the country had returned to normal, she said.While governments in the UK, Italy and Germany have faced protests against second lockdowns, Victorians have been largely compliant. That’s in part down to the popularity of the state’s Labor government, which won the 2018 election by a landslide, and the high approval ratings of Premier Andrews. The carrot-and-stick approach taken by authorities has also helped, with A$1,500 payments for people who couldn’t afford to self-isolate and court-imposed fines of as much as A$20,000 for repeat breaches of isolation orders.Circuit Breakers“It would’ve been impossible to meaningfully police if there wasn’t community support,” said Terry Slevin, chief executive officer of the Public Health Association of Australia. “It’s an example where a compact between a government and a community that’s been driven by expert advice has achieved a valuable public health outcome.”According to Catherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University in Melbourne, it’s likely too late for the UK, US and European countries to replicate Melbourne’s success in crushing new infections. Instead, authorities would likely opt for 2-3 week circuit breaker lockdowns to take the load off the public health system.“A circuit-breaker just might help bring it back into line and allow it to be containable,” she said. “But unless you’ve gone very early” it’s very hard to bring new cases down to zero.The lockdown may have quashed the virus for now, but it’s clear from outbreaks around the world that it can come back with a vengeance if not coupled with ongoing requirements such as mask-wearing, social distancing, temperature checks and a robust testing and contact-tracing regime. Such “living with the virus” elements are in place in countries such as Korea, Japan and China, which have been able to keep their cases under control.“Australians need to have the conversation on what the new normal looks like so we can live alongside this virus without more lockdowns,” said Jennifer Westacott, CEO of the Business Council of Australia. “If mask-wearing and hand sanitizers are the new normal now, is everyone on board? The big question is whether individual Australians are ready to fully adjust their lives to the Covid era.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-locked-down-for-3-months-has-bleak-lessons-for-the-world/story-AczPNitTmd71wTu1UQi08J.html
29-10-2020||World||US agencies, including FBI, warn of ransomware attack on healthcare system||Federal agencies warned that cybercriminals are unleashing a wave of data-scrambling extortion attempts against the US healthcare system designed to lock up hospital information systems, which could hurt patient care just as nationwide cases of Covid-19 are spiking.In a joint alert Wednesday, the FBI and two federal agencies warned that they had “credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to US hospitals and healthcare providers.” The alert said malicious groups are targeting the sector with attacks that produce “data theft and disruption of healthcare services.”The cyberattacks involve ransomware, which scrambles data into gibberish that can only be unlocked with software keys provided once targets pay up. Independent security experts say it has already hobbled at least five US hospitals this week, and could potentially impact hundreds more.The offensive by a Russian-speaking criminal gang coincides with the US presidential election, although there is no immediate indication they were motivated by anything but profit. “We are experiencing the most significant cyber security threat we’ve ever seen in the United States,” Charles Carmakal, chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said in a statement.Alex Holden, CEO of Hold Security, which has been closely tracking the ransomware in question for more than a year, agreed that the unfolding offensive is unprecedented in magnitude for the US given its timing in the heat of a contentions presidential election and the worst global pandemic in a century.The federal alert was co-authored by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services.The cybercriminals launching the attacks use a strain of ransomware known as Ryuk, which is seeded through a network of zombie computers called Trickbot that Microsoft began trying to counter earlier in October. US Cyber Command has also reportedly taken action against Trickbot. While Microsoft has had considerable success knocking its command-and-control servers offline through legal action, analysts say criminals have still been finding ways to spread Ryuk.The US has seen a plague of ransomware over the past 18 months or so, with major cities from Baltimore to Atlanta hit and local governments and schools hit especially hard.In September, a ransomware attack hobbled all 250 US facilities of the hospital chain Universal Health Services, forcing doctors and nurses to rely on paper and pencil for record-keeping and slowing lab work. Employees described chaotic conditions impeding patient care, including mounting emergency room waits and the failure of wireless vital-signs monitoring equipment.Also in September, the first known fatality related to ransomware occurred in Duesseldorf, Germany, when an IT system failure forced a critically ill patient to be routed to a hospital in another city.Holden said he alerted federal law enforcement Friday after monitoring infection attempts at a number of hospitals, some of which may have beaten back infections. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.He said the group was demanding ransoms well above $10 million per target and that criminals involved on the dark web were discussing plans to try to infect more than 400 hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities.“One of the comments from the bad guys is that they are expecting to cause panic and, no, they are not hitting election systems,” Holden said. “They are hitting where it hurts even more and they know it.” US officials have repeatedly expressed concern about major ransomware attacks affecting the presidential election, even if the criminals are motivated chiefly by profit.Mandiant’s Carmakal identified the criminal gang as UNC1878, saying “it is deliberately targeting and disrupting US hospitals, forcing them to divert patients to other healthcare providers” and producing prolonged delays in critical care.He called the eastern European group “one of most brazen, heartless, and disruptive threat actors I’ve observed over my career.”While no one has proven suspected ties between the Russian government and gangs that use the Trickbot platform, Holden said he has “no doubt that the Russian government is aware of this operation — of terrorism, really.” He said dozens of different criminal groups use Ryuk, paying its architects a cut.Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, said there are “certainly lot of connections between Russian cyber criminals and the state,” with Kremlin-employed hackers sometimes moonlighting as cyber criminals.Neither Holden nor Carmakal would identify the affected hospitals. Four healthcare institutions have been reported hit by ransomware so far this week, three belonging to the St. Lawrence County Health System in upstate New York and the Sky Lakes Medical Center in Klamath Falls, Oregon.Sky Lakes acknowledged the ransomware attack in an online statement, saying it had no evidence that patient information was compromised. It said emergency and urgent care “remain available” The St. Lawrence system did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.Increasingly, ransomware criminals are stealing data from their targets before encrypting networks, using it for extortion. They often sow the malware weeks before activating it, waiting for moments when they believe they can extract the highest payments, said Brett Callow, an analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.A total of 59 US healthcare providers/systems have been impacted by ransomware in 2020, disrupting patient care at up to 510 facilities, Callow said.Carmakal said Mandiant had provided Microsoft on Wednesday with as much detail as it could about the thr eat so it could distribute details to its customers. A Microsoft spokesman had no immediate comment.—-Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., Lisa Baumann in Seattle and Deepti Hajela in New York City contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agencies-including-fbi-warn-of-ransomware-attack-on-healthcare-system/story-EG7LchrANF0PyNCHtUgr4K.html
29-10-2020||World||Anonymous writer who made revelations on Trump govt chaos reveals himself||A former official of the US homeland security department injected new drama into a tumultuous presidential race on Wednesday by revealing himself as the “Anonymous” author of a bombshell 2018 Op-Ed chronicling deep disaffection among senior members of the Trump administration.Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff to the secretary of homeland security, owned up to the controversial piece and a subsequent book — A Warning — that further chronicled the chaos in a blog on Medium. He left the administration last fall, joined Google and is now on leave.He has been a strident critic of the president as a TV commentator.Trump slammed him as a “sleaze bag” and a “low life” at a campaign rally in Arizona and said, “This guy, in my opinion, he should be prosecuted.”More vitriol followed from the Trump campaign, which called the disclosure “the least impressive, lamest political ‘reveal’ of all time”.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany slammed Tyler as “this low-level, disgruntled former staffer … a liar and a coward”.In an Op-Ed in the New York Times in 2018, the “Anonymous” author, who was described as a “senior administration official”, had written of a widespread “resistance” by senior officials to frustrate parts of the president’s agenda they found disagreeable and his “worst inclinations”.In the blog post on Medium, Taylor conceded writing the Op-Ed anonymously may have been problematic for some, especially because of the seriousness of his assertions, but said by remaining anonymous he “forced the president to answer them (his assertions) directly on their merits … rather than creating distractions through petty insults and name-calling”.Taylor’s reveal added a new and dramatic element into the race that is now in the final stages in which more than a third of eligible voters — 75 million — have already cast their ballot through early in-person voting or by mail in an unprecedented turnout before Election Day on November 3.Trump held two rallies in Arizona in an effort to hold on to a traditionally Republican state that he had won in 2016, by a reduced margin than the Republican nominee before him, but where he has been trailing his Democrat challenger Joe Biden by a slim but steady margin.Biden, who cast his vote with his wife in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday will be campaigning in Florida Thursday, as will be Trump.Florida is a key battleground state that no successful presidential candidate has not won in recent memory. Trump squeaked through with 1.2% victory margin in 2016, but he now trails Biden by 2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 1.5 point in the FiveThirtyEight average.The race itself may be slipping out of the president’s grip as he trails his Democrat challenger by a margin that has held steadily over past months.He is behind Biden by 7.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 8.9 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anonymous-writer-who-made-revelations-on-trump-govt-chaos-reveals-himself/story-Do65JOB834zBiREsY1PkBP.html

29-10-2020||World||Philadelphia Police pledges to release body camera footage over fatal shooting of African-American youth||Philadelphia police pledged to release 911 tapes and police body camera footage “in the near future” in the shooting death of a Black man with a history of mental health problems, a death that prompted protests, widespread vandalism and an overnight curfew days before Election Day.Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw pledged to release the video evidence once the department shares it with the family of Walter Wallace Jr. Outlaw, who came to Philadelphia less than a year ago from Portland, Oregon, lamented at a news conference Wednesday that her department lacks a mental health unit or consistent way to coordinate police calls with specialists.“We don’t have a behavioural health unit, which is sorely needed,” said Outlaw, when asked about reports that police had been called to the home twice before that day. “There’s clearly a disconnect on our end in terms of knowing what’s out there “ at the scene.Police say they fatally shot Wallace on Monday after he ignored orders to drop a knife, a death that intensified already heightened tensions in the presidential battleground state. Wallace’s mother said she warned police Monday afternoon that her son was in the throes of a mental health crisis.In the days since, more than 90 people have been arrested and about 50 police officers injured in clashes with protesters and vandals, including the 1,000 or so who suddenly swarmed a shopping center Tuesday night, breaking windows and stealing merchandise. That scene erupted on the other side of the city, miles from Wallace’ neighborhood, where protests were underway.“We had zero information to warn us of this,” Deputy Commissioner Melvin Singleton said. “By that time ... the damage was done.”The clashes come as Pennsylvania emerges as a key focus of the contentious 2020 election, with President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, a native son, locked in a battle for the state’s 20 electoral votes. Both candidates have made frequent campaign stops in the state.More than 9 million Pennsylvanians have registered to vote, and many in Philadelphia waited in line for hours this week to request a mail-in ballot by Tuesday’s deadline, as news of the police shooting spread.City officials announced Wednesday they would enact a curfew in the city from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m., as business owners cleaned up damage from the melee and boarded up windows.Mayor Jim Kenney told reporters the Pennsylvania National Guard would also be deployed to help protect property and assist the police. The first troops were expected Friday and Saturday.The unrest started Monday evening, shortly after Wallace, 27, was killed, and set off protests elsewhere, including in Washington, D.C., the Brooklyn borough of New York City and Portland, where demonstrators held their hands in the shape of a “W” in his honor.His family’s lawyer said the family had called for an ambulance to get him help with a mental health crisis.Wallace’s wife, Dominique, is pregnant and was scheduled to be induced Wednesday, according to the family’s attorney, Shaka Johnson. Johnson said Wallace had nine children, two of whom briefly spoke at a news conference late Tuesday, along with Wallace’s mother and father.“When you come to a scene where somebody is in a mental crisis, and the only tool you have to deal with it is a gun ... where are the proper tools for the job?” Johnson said, arguing that Philadelphia police officers are not properly trained to handle mental health crises.Police officials said they could not confirm what information had been given to the responding officers, whether they were told about a possible mental illness or how many calls they had received for help at Wallace’s address Monday.Outlaw said earlier the officers involved in the shooting were taken off street duty as they investigate. She said the officers’ names and other identifying information, including their race, would be withheld until the department could be sure releasing the information would not pose a threat to their safety.Neither had a Taser or similar device at the time of the shooting, Outlaw said, noting the department had previously asked for funding to equip more officers with those devices.The two officers each fired at least seven rounds — at least 14 total shots — but police could not say how many times Wallace was struck.Wallace’s father, Walter Wallace Sr. said Tuesday night that he is haunted by the way his son was “butchered.”“It’s in my mind. I can’t even sleep at night. I can’t even close my eyes,” he said.In video filmed by a bystander and posted on social media, officers could be seen yelling for Wallace to drop a knife. In the video, Wallace’s mother and at least one man followed Wallace, trying to get him to listen to officers, as he briskly walked across the street and between cars.Wallace advanced toward the officers, who then fired several times, said police spokesperson Officer Tanya Little. Wallace’s mother could be seen screaming and throwing something at an officer after her son was shot and fell to the ground.The video does not make it clear whether he was in fact holding a knife, but witnesses said he was.Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest, Little said. One officer drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said.Lawyer Robert Trimble represented Wallace in a 2016 robbery case that led him to spend about a year in jail. His sentence, according to court records, included mental health supervision and six years of probation. He had new charge pending at the time of his death.“I ran into him about a year ago by City Hall. He stopped me on the street and thanked me for helping him,” Trimble said. “I remember him being a decent guy.”Both Outlaw and the mayor pledged to address the lack of coordinated mental health services.“We have limited resources and we have a large number of people with problems,” Kenney said. “We need to do a better job.”___ Associated Press writer Claudia Lauer contributed to this report from Philadelphia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philadelphia-police-pledges-to-release-body-camera-footage-over-fatal-shooting-of-african-american-youth/story-8K5OJuATKI8c2WFQP1xXzM.html
29-10-2020||World||Pfizer says Covid-19 vaccine may yet be possible in 2020||Pfizer executives expressed measured optimism on Tuesday over the prospect of providing a coronavirus vaccine in 2020 as the pharma giant reported lower third-quarter profits due to disruption in health care that dented drug demand.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the drug giant could supply some 40 million doses in the US in 2020 if clinical testing proceeds as expected and regulators approve a vaccine. “If all goes well, we will be ready to distribute an initial number of doses,” said Bourla, who pointed to a US government contract for Pfizer to supply 40 million doses by the end of this year and 100 million doses by March 2021.But Bourla said the company still had not reached key benchmarks in assessing vaccine efficacy. Pfizer has said previously that it could have the data in October.Bourla said the company expects to file for emergency use authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine in the third week of November, roughly in line with earlier timetables.Asked if he was “bullish” the vaccine would work, Bourla said: “I’m not bullish a vaccine will work. I’m cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will work.”Regarding earnings, Pfizer reported a 71% drop in profit to $2.2 billion. The year-ago period included a large gain connected to a transaction. Revenues dipped 4% to $12.1 billion, missing analyst estimates.Pfizer estimated a revenue hit of $500 million connected to Covid-19 due to lower pharma demand in China and fewer wellness visits from patients in the US.The company saw an 11% drop in its hospital business in emerging markets, primarily due to fewer elective surgeries in China and shorter in-patient hospital stays in the country.This effect was partially offset by increased demand for the Prevnar-13 vaccine for pneumonia “resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses”, the firm said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-covid-19-vaccine-may-yet-be-possible-in-2020/story-SVTjXDClaWVoxQK8SbE64J.html
29-10-2020||World||US Elections 2020: It’s going to take lot of hard work to end Covid-19, says Joe Biden||Focused firmly on Covid-19, Joe Biden vowed Wednesday not to campaign in the election homestretch “on the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch.” President Donald Trump, under attack for his handling of the worst health crisis in more than a century, breezily pledged on his final-week swing to “vanquish the virus.”The Democratic presidential nominee also argued that a Supreme Court conservative majority stretched to 6-3 by newly confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett could dismantle the Obama administration’s signature health law and leave millions without insurance coverage during the pandemic. He called Trump’s handling of the coronavirus an “insult” to its victims, especially as cases spike dramatically around the country.“Even if I win, it’s going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,” Biden said during a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. “I do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.”His comments reflected an unwavering attempt to keep the political spotlight on the pandemic. That was a departure from the president, who downplayed the threat and spent his day in Arizona, where relaxed rules on social distancing made staging big rallies easier.The pandemic’s consequences were escalating, with deaths climbing in 39 states and an average of 805 people dying daily nationwide — up from 714 two weeks ago. Overall, about 227,000 Americans have died. The sharp rise sent shockwaves through financial markets, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to drop 900-plus points.Trump, who frequently lauds rising markets, failed to mention the decline. But he promised that economic growth figures for the summer quarter, due Thursday, would be strong, declaring during a rally in Bullhead City, Arizona, “This election is a choice between a Trump super-recovery and a Biden depression.”As Trump spoke, an Air Force fighter thundered nearby and released a flare to get the attention of a non-responsive private aircraft that was flying in the restricted airspace. North American Aerospace Defense Command said the plane was escorted out by the F-16 “without further incident.” Trump was at first caught off guard but later cheered the fighter, proclaiming, “I love that sound” as it roared overhead.The president also condemned violence that occurred during some protests in response to the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a Black man, in Philadelphia saying Biden stands “with the rioters and the vandals.”But Biden said in Wilmington, “There is no excuse whatsoever for the looting and the violence.”Bullhead City is just across the border from Nevada, a state Trump is hoping to flip during Election Day next Tuesday. A Trump Nevada rally last month attracted thousands and led to the airport that hosted it being fined more than $5,500 for violating pandemic crowd restrictions.Rather than curb his crowd, Trump moved just across the border and used his rally Wednesday to scoff at Democratic leaders in states like Nevada for trying to enforce social distancing rules. The event’s crowd looked to be mostly from Arizona, though there were attendees from Nevada. Few wore masks.The weather was far milder than during a Tuesday night Trump rally in Omaha, Nebraska. After Trump left that one, hundreds of attendees at Eppley Airfield spent hours waiting in the cold for transportation to cars parked far away. Several people were taken to hospitals amid concerns about exposure.“Because of the sheer size of the crowd, we deployed 40 shuttlebuses – double the normal allotment – but local road closures and resulting congestion caused delays,” Trump spokeswoman Samantha Zager said in a statement.Trump is trailing Biden in most national polls. Biden also has an advantage, though narrower, in the key swing states that could decide the election.Biden voted early in Wilmington on Wednesday and received a virtual briefing from health experts. One, Dr. David Kessler, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, warned, “We are in the midst of the third wave, and I don’t think anyone can tell you how high this is going to get.”Trump was nonetheless defiant, declaring, “We will vanquish the virus and emerge stronger than ever before.”In a campaign sidelight, the president lashed out after news that Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, was revealed as the author of a scathing anti-Trump op-ed and book under the pen name “Anonymous.”“This guy is a low-level lowlife that I don’t know,” he said. “I have no idea who he is.”Trump views Nevada favorably, despite it not backing a Republican for president since 2004. Hillary Clinton won it by less than 2.5 percentage points in 2016.And Biden wants to flip Arizona, which hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1996. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, was in Arizona on Wednesday, meeting with Latina entrepreneurs and African American leaders as well as holding two drive-in rallies.On Friday, Harris will visit Fort Worth, Houston and the U.S.-Mexico border town of McAllen in Texas -- a state that hasn’t backed a Democrat for president since 1976 or even elected one to statewide office since 1994. Texas was long so reliably red that top national Democrats visited only to hold fundraisers.“I am really grateful for the attention that they have given Texas because it has been so long since a presidential campaign gave this state a look,” said Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman and onetime presidential hopeful. But he declined to predict that Biden would win the state, saying only “There is a possibility,” contingent on turnout breaking records.Biden heads later in the week to three more states Trump won in 2016, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan, where he’ll hold a joint Saturday rally with former President Barack Obama.Democrats point to a larger number of their party members returning absentee ballots — results that could be decisive since more people are likely to vote by mail during the pandemic. Trump’s campaign argues that enough of its supporters will vote on Election Day to overwhelm any early Biden advantage.Around 71.5 million people nationwide have so far voted in advance, either by casting early, in-person ballots or voting by mail, according to an Associated Press analysis. That’s already far more than the total advance ballots cast before the 2016 presidential election.“We’re talking to people everywhere,” Harris said. “And there’s no area that’s off limits.”___Weissert reported from Washington, Jaffe from Wilmington.

29-10-2020||World||Hurricane Zeta hits Louisiana with flooding, power outages||Hurricane Zeta slammed into storm-weary Louisiana on Wednesday with New Orleans squarely in its path, pelting homes and businesses with rain and howling winds, knocking out power to thousands and threatening to push up to 9 feet of sea water inland in a Gulf Coast region already pounded by multiple storms this year.Roads were flooded near the coast, where forecasters said Zeta made landfall around Terrebone Bay near Cocodrie, an unincorporated fishing village at the end of a highway with few if any full-time residents and a marine laboratory where a building was inundated.Also Read: Louisiana braces for third hurricane strike this year as ‘Zeta’ approachesStreams of rainfall ran off roofs in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter, signs outside bars and restaurants swayed back and forth in the wind and palm trees along Canal Street whipped furiously. A few trees were down, and one that fell across utility lines sparked a bright orange flash. Officials said a person was hospitalized with minor injuries after a structure collapsed, but further details weren’t available.About 350,000 customers were without electricity in Louisiana and Mississippi, including more than 255,000 in metro New Orleans.Zeta had top sustained winds of 110 (177 kph) as a Category 2 hurricane and was the 27th named storm of a historically busy Atlantic hurricane season — with over a month left before it ends. It set a new record as the 11th named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. in a single season, well beyond the nine storms that hit in 1916.Tropical storm warnings were issued as far away as the north Georgia mountains, highly unusual for the region. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings for as far east as the Florida Panhandle.New Orleans was in the warning areas of six previous storms that veered east or west this season. This time, Zeta stayed on course.Zeta had been predicted to hit as a relatively weak Category 1 hurricane, but Louisiana residents awoke to updated forecasts predicting a Category 2 at landfall around the southeastern part of the state.“The good news for us — and look, you take good news where you can find it — the storm’s forward speed is 17 mph. That’s projected to increase, and so it’s going to get in and out of the area relatively quickly, and then we’re going to be able to assess the damage more quickly,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said in an interview on The Weather Channel.Officials urged people to take precautions and prepare to shelter in place, and a business-as-usual atmosphere in the morning in New Orleans diminished as the storm neared and grew stronger. Traffic slowed, and restaurants and coffee shops shut down.“This year, the storms have been coming back-to-back. They’ve been avoiding New Orleans but finally decided to come,” cookie shop worker Curt Brumfield said as he stowed empty boxes in trash cans outside and others boarded up the windows ahead of the storm’s arrival.Winds picked up and water rose above the docks in Jean Lafitte, a small fishing town south of New Orleans that takes its name from a French pirate. Workers drove truckloads of sand to low-lying areas where thousands of sandbags were already stacked for previous storms.“We’re going to get a lot of water fast,” said the mayor, Tim Kerner Jr. “I’m optimistic regarding the tidal surge because of the speed of the storm, but we’re not going to take it for granted.”Zeta’s wind, rain and storm surge reached more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) east of New Orleans. In Mississippi, street lights swayed in Biloxi and the city of Pass Christian ordered all boats out of the harbor. Dauphin Island, Alabama, shut off water and sewer service in areas that typically are swamped in storms.Also Read: Zeta likely to become hurricane before hitting Mexico’s Yucatan peninsulaNew Orleans officials announced that a turbine that generates power to the city’s aging drainage pump system broke down Sunday, with no quick repair in sight. There was enough power to keep the pumps operating if needed, but little excess power to tap if other turbines fail, officials said.Officials said they were running through contingencies should there be other equipment problems. Forecasts called for anywhere from 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 centimeters) of rain to fall in the New Orleans area, but Zeta’s pace could mitigate the flood threat.Before landfall, Zeta’s top winds had risen to just shy of a major, Category 3 storm, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.On Tuesday, Zeta raked across Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, toppling trees and briefly cutting power to more than 300,000 people but causing no deaths.It then regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico along a path slightly to the east of those of Hurricane Laura, which was blamed for at least 27 deaths in Louisiana in August, and Hurricane Delta, which exacerbated Laura’s damage in the same area weeks later.Hurricane warnings stretched from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Alabama/Mississippi state line, including Lake Pontchartrain and metropolitan New Orleans.The deteriorating weather prompted early voting sites to close for hours in the western Florida Panhandle.Tropical storm warnings were issued for a large swath of the South, from Louisiana and Mississippi into Alabama and Georgia, including all of the Atlanta area, where winds could gust up to 55 mph (89 kph) early Thursday. Winds could be “especially severe” in the southern Appalachian Mountains, where flash flooding is possible, the hurricane center said.Large school systems in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina planned to close Thursday or open late.Edwards asked President Donald Trump for a disaster declaration ahead of the storm. He and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey both declared emergencies, as did Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich in Biloxi, Mississippi. Trump declared an emergency for Louisiana Tuesday evening.An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms. This extraordinarily busy season has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.After Hanna, Isaias, Laura, Sally and Delta, Zeta will tie a record set in 1886 and repeated in 1985 for six hurricanes smacking the continental U.S., according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.“I’m physically and mentally tired,” a distraught Yolanda Lockett of Lake Charles, one of about 3,600 evacuees from Laura and Delta still sheltering, said outside her New Orleans hotel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-zeta-hits-louisiana-with-flooding-power-outages/story-Kr6cpXD3oHC0HtKUccu7bL.html

Foreign Minister said for God’s sake let Abhinandan go, India’s about to attack Pakistan at 9 PM”, Sadiq recounted the events of the important meeting.Dunya News further quoted Sadiq as saying that the opposition has supported the government in all issues including Abhinandan but will not be able to further support it.Wing Commander Varthaman shot into limelight after he shot down a Pakistani aircraft F-16, which had transgressed into the Indian airspace during a dog fight between Indian and Pakistani air force in February 2019 and in the process, his plane crossed over to Pakistani side and was shot down. Abhinandan was returned to India from the Attari-Wagah border on March 1.

29-10-2020||World||UK under pressure as Covid-19 epidemic doubling every 9 days||The British government is under pressure to develop a national strategy to combat a surge of Covid-19 cases and “rescue Christmas’’ as scientists warn that the number of people hospitalized with the disease in the U.K. could almost triple by the end of next month unless something more is done now.Mark Walport, a former chief scientific officer, said Britain only needs to look across the English Channel to see what’s coming. Britain’s current measures are similar to those in France and Spain, where authorities are struggling to control the virus and daily cases have already far outstripped those in the U.K.Also Read: Early Covid-19 vaccines may be imperfect: UK Vaccine Taskforce“With our current measures … there’s little evidence that there is as much social distancing as there was when we clamped down on the first wave and so we know that the risk is significant that cases will continue to grow,” Walport told the BBC.It is “not unrealistic’’ that 25,000 people in the U.K. could be hospitalized by the end of November — up from about 9,000 now, he said.According to results from a large, ongoing study into the Covid-19 epidemic in England, scientists estimated that there are about 96,000 new cases every day and that the outbreak is doubling in size every nine days.“The rate of growth we’re seeing is really quite rapid,” said Steven Riley, a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, one of the leaders of the study funded by the Department of Health.Riley and colleagues took samples from more than 85,000 people randomly selected across England in late October and found that about one in every 128 people in England is infected with the coronavirus.Also Read: Long-term immunity in doubt as UK study finds Covid-19 antibodies fall rapidlyThey reported that rates were increasing among all age groups, including those most at risk: they noted a tripling of Covid-19 rates in people aged 55 to 64 and a doubling in those over 65.“Our data shows there’s no reason to expect that exponential rise to change for the next few weeks regardless of what we do,” Riley warned. “New cases will turn into hospitalizations.” He said it was unclear whether recently imposed restrictions in northern England would be enough to stop the spiraling spread of the virus.Riley said that if politicians were considering more stringent measures, “the (study) results argue for something sooner rather than later,” adding that “something needs to change before Christmas.”Dr. Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia, who was not connected to the study, said it was “likely that infection rates now are very similar to and maybe even higher than at the peak in April.”The World Health Organization said for the second consecutive week, the European region accounted for the biggest proportion of new infections, with more than 1.3 million cases or about 46% of the worldwide total. The U.N. health agency also said deaths were also on the rise in Europe, with about a 35% spike since the previous week, and hospitalizations and ICU occupancy due to Covid-19 increased in 21 countries across Europe.Walport’s assessment came as two opposition parties called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene a summit of the U.K.’s four nations to develop a coordinated plan for combatting Covid-19.Under the U.K.’s system of devolved government, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have all developed their own rules to fight the pandemic. Meanwhile, Johnson has implement a three-tiered regional strategy to applies only in England. That has a led to a patchwork of regulations that change from one nation to the next, and sometimes from city to city.Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the four nations must develop a unified strategy to avoid confusion and deliver a clear message. The Liberal Democrats and Northern Ireland’s Alliance Party have written to Johnson asking for a summit.“I think they need to have some action now … because otherwise, if we don’t get the virus back under control, I’m afraid there’s little chance of being able to rescue Christmas,” Davey told the BBC.Britain already has Europe’s highest virus death toll, with over 45,400 confirmed deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-under-pressure-as-covid-19-epidemic-doubling-every-9-days/story-cW9nGlCitnNep2aFPCtkFL.html
29-10-2020||World||Lockdowns set to return as global Covid-19 cases top 44 million||The World Health Organization reported that 2 million Covid-19 cases were reported globally in the past week, a new record, as Europe moved towards new restrictions and lockdowns to curb an unabated second wave.Global cases have passed 44 million, according to a Johns Hopkins university tally.Reports said France may enter into a fresh month-long national lockdown as President Emmanuel Macron prepares to address the nation on Wednesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel met state premiers in a video conference on Wednesday and agreed on a partial lockdown that will see bars and restaurants closing from November 2 to 30. Shops will be allowed to remain open on condition that they set strict social distancing limits, people familiar with the talks said.Records were broken in daily infections and deaths in several countries: Germany reported a new high of 14,964 new infections; Russia saw unprecedented daily deaths at 346 and Iran registered 415 fatalities, its worst ever. The United States added nearly 500,000 cases in a week.The situation is so bad in Belgium that even Covid-positive doctors and nurses have been asked to work as long as they don’t have any symptoms. Belgian hospital admissions soared to a record 689, surpassing the peak reached on March 28.UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure for a new lockdown amid 367 more deaths recorded on Tuesday, and warnings that hospital patient numbers could double in weeks to more than 25,000. In Italy, business owners and opposition politicians rebelled against new virus restrictions, even as the country registered 24,991 daily cases, a record for the second consecutive day. China has reported 42 new cases of Covid-19 including 22 local transmissions, recording the sharpest increase in several weeks, national health authorities said on Wednesday.Tuesday’s tally was sharply up from 16 on Monday, with all the 22 new local cases reported in the past 24 hours from the remote Xinjiang region’s Kashgar prefecture.Canada’s death toll has crossed 10,000, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said the situation “really sucks”, warning that if the current trajectory continues, it may impact family gatherings during the Christmas season.On the vaccine and treatment front, the US agreed to pay Eli Lilly & Co $375 million for 300,000 vials of its experimental Covid-19 antibody.Drugmakers Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc agreed to make 200mn doses of their experimental vaccine available to Covax, a global effort to provide shots for developing nations.The drugmakers signed the supply arrangement with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, according to a statement. Gavi is among the groups working with the World Health Organization to ensure access to immunization for people around the world.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has submitted applications to the World Health Organization for an Emergency Use Listing and prequalification of its coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund said on Tuesday. The only good news came from Melbourne. There was exhilaration and relief as the five million people of Australia’s second largest city were able to return to shops and restaurants after months at home. The pandemic lockdown in the city had lasted 111 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdowns-set-to-return-as-global-covid-19-cases-top-44-million/story-0VoIK5JMfNg8W8VnkUnicO.html
29-10-2020||World||Myanmar terror outfit arms itself with Chinese weapons||The Arakan Army, an insurgent group whose activities have severely affected the India-backed Kaladan multimodal transport project in Myanmar, has benefited from the clandestine transfer and smuggling of Chinese-made weaponry, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday. The group, designated a terrorist organisation by Naypyitaw, clashed with Myanmarese troops on nearly 600 occasions last year, and a majority of the skirmishes took place in close proximity to the $480 million Kaladan project. There have also been at least four instances of Arakan Army cadre targeting the shipments of materials for the infrastructure project, or attacking Myanmar troops providing security to the project, the people said on condition of anonymity. In 2019, just as a key phase of the Kaladan project was nearing completion in Rakhine and Chin states, the Arakan Army shifted its area of operations there, they added. “The Arakan Army has always kept its anti-Kaladan activities below a certain threshold to not raise the ante. But its activities have had the overall impact of severely impeding the execution of the project,” one of the people cited above said.India and Myanmar are currently working to operationalise Sittwe port by early next year as part of the massive transport and transit project that will connect with Kolkata port and help in moving goods to the landlocked northeastern states via Kaladan river. On June 23, the Thai military seized a consignment of Chinese-made weapons, including AK-47 assault rifles, in Mae Sot district bordering Myanmar’s Karen state. The weapons, worth 30 million baht (almost $1 million), were meant to be supplied to the Arakan Army and Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), both active in Rakhine, the people said. There are also reports that another large consignment of Chinese-made weapons was smuggled into Rakhine state via Monakhali beach near the junction of Myanmar and Bangladesh in the third week of February this year. “This illicit flow of Chinese-made weaponry into Myanmar poses a threat to regional security, and has implications for the Kaladan project. There are strong suspicions that China is orchestrating the actions of the ethnic armed groups in Myanmar to further its objectives,” said a second person from the security establishment. The people said there were growing signs that Myanmar’s military is acting to curb China’s influence, and has had a hand in cancelling or curtailing projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The $3.6-billion Myitsone dam project remains suspended, while the Kyaukpyu port project was scaled down. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it appeared China was trying to undermine the viability of the Kaladan project after being unable to convince Myanmar to give up on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-terror-outfit-arms-itself-with-chinese-weapons/story-s1U39cqQ9G3gvOlhPgk1vM.html
29-10-2020||World||Republicans tell tech CEOs ‘free pass’ legal shield should end||The leaders of big US technology companies came to testify about legislation that shaped the modern internet. They ended up being accused by senators of abusing their power over political speech six days before the election.“Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report?” Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, asked Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey in a congressional hearing on Wednesday.While the fiercest attacks came from Republicans, Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee also questioned Dorsey, Google’s Sundar Pichai and Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg to determine whether Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act needs to be updated.The rule grants online platforms some legal immunity from the content users post. It has come under intense scrutiny after Facebook and Twitter recently limited the online reach of a New York Post story about the family of former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, prompting claims of bias and censorship. Twitter backtracked, but the episode fueled tense exchanges during Wednesday’s hearing.“The time has come for that free pass to end,” said Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who chairs the panel, referring to Section 230. The questions devolved into partisan bickering. Republicans criticized tech companies’ moderation of US President Donald Trump’s posts, while Democrats said they feared the hearing was a Republican attempt to influence the CEOs days before the election.“They seem to want to bully and browbeat the platforms here to try and tilt them in President Trump’s favor,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said. “The timing seems inexplicable except to try and game the refs.”The tech executives, who all appeared remotely, began their testimony by explaining the importance of the rule for building their businesses. Dorsey called Section 230 “the internet’s most important law for free speech and safety,” and argued that repealing it would lead to more policing of content, not less.Dorsey was questioned about what Wicker called Twitter’s “double standard” for labeling posts from different world leaders, saying he’s collected dozens of examples of unequal application of the company’s policies. The CEO said real-world harm is one of the factors Twitter considers when deciding whether to put a warning on a specific tweet.Section 230, passed into law as part of the CDA in 1996, lets internet companies wait to moderate users’ speech until after it is posted online, helping their platforms to grow unencumbered by constant legal challenges. Google’s YouTube video-sharing site doesn’t have to pre-screen the millions of videos uploaded daily, and Facebook doesn’t have to read every comment; they can let user posts flow freely and clean them up later if something bad happens.“Our ability to provide access to a wide range of information is only possible because of existing legal frameworks,” Pichai said.The hearing eventually turned to the actual language of Section 230, which grants platforms the ability to remove content they deem lewd, harassing or “otherwise objectionable,” among other criteria, from their services as long as they act “in good faith.” GOP lawmakers have said the language is too vague and protects the removal of political discourse.Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, asked the executives about how they define the phrase “otherwise objectionable.” Multiple Republican lawmakers have introduced bills seeking to narrow the phrase, only allowing companies to remove particular categories of content such as those that promote terrorism or self-harm.Zuckerberg argued that the current language enables companies like Facebook to capture more content that might be bullying or harassment, and Pichai said companies need flexibility. Many of Facebook and Twitter’s rules, for example, are worded in ways that give the company more leeway to address new and unexpected issues.Capito also questioned Dorsey and Zuckerberg’s argument that repealing Section 230 would hurt startups. “How many small innovators and what kind of market share could they possibly have when we see the dominance of the three of you?” she challenged.Zuckerberg said that Section 230 was instrumental when he started Facebook. “If we were subject to a larger number of content lawsuits because 230 didn’t exist, that would have likely made it prohibitive for me as a college student in a dorm room to get started with this enterprise,” he said.Next week’s US presidential election was a thread throughout the hearing, often cited as the topic for examples of good and bad content moderation. Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, asked all three executives if Russia and other foreign countries continue to try to use their platforms to influence the election. All three CEOs said yes.Twitter and Facebook have both recently removed networks of accounts that originated out of Iran and Russia. Facebook now makes monthly announcements about the networks it removes, with its latest update on Tuesday.One idea that has been floated is to create a single system for moderating all the platforms together, ensuring they all play by the same rules. But the three tech companies have no incentives to create a shared system for identifying and moderating harmful information, said Sridhar Ramaswamy, the former head of the advertising business at Alphabet Inc.-owned Google, in a recent interview.He argued that any new system shouldn’t be restricted to the largest tech companies, but should be deployed for the internet more broadly. “An outcome that gives any more responsibility to small teams is not a great outcome,” said Ramaswamy, who now runs the startup Neeva. “Because that then becomes a massive moat that no one else can cross.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-tell-tech-ceos-free-pass-legal-shield-should-end/story-2wN4uC4zMAdSACsojvfnUO.html
29-10-2020||World||Joe Biden votes, attacks President Donald Trump over Covid-19 response||Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden cast their votes in their hometown of Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday after a speech on his plans to tackle Covid-19 if elected, while attacking President Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic.“I’ll be a president who is not in it for himself, but for others. A president who doesn’t divide us — but unites us. A president who appeals not to the worst in us — but to the best in us...A president guided not by wishful thinking — but by science, reason, and facts,” he said in the speech.Trump, who voted in Florida last Saturday, is rallying supporters in Arizona on Wednesday, defending a traditionally Republican state he won in 2016, but where the race has turned competitive, with just six days left for polling to close for the presidential election.Biden was in Georgia on Tuesday, a Republican state he hopes to breach and expand the battleground in a growing sign of confidence that will take him also to Iowa, another state that Trump carried in 2016. “There aren’t a lot of pundits who would have guessed four years ago that the Democratic candidate for president in 2020 would be campaigning in Georgia one week before Election Day,” he said in Georgia. “But we do — because something is happening.”Trump will hold two rallies in Arizona, hoping to hold on to the state whose creeping leftward tilt due to growing Latino and young demographics in recent years has been accentuated by frustration with the president’s handling of the pandemic.Trump trails Biden in all national polls and battle ground states. He is behind the Democrat by 8.7 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls and by 7.3 points in RealClearPolitics average.In Arizona, Trump trails Biden by 2.8 and 2.4 points in FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics averages respectively. He had won the state by 3.5% in 2016, which was a considerably lower margin than Mitt Romney, who won it in 2012.Trump will hold the first rally at an airport in Bullhead City, Arizona that also serves adjoining Nevada’s Laughlin, and then in Phoenix. He will not go into Nevada; his second son Eric Trump was there on Tuesday.Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris is also campaigning in Arizona on Wednesday — among Latina business owners in Tucson and Blacks in Phoenix.More than 71 million Americans have already voted, a record for early balloting, in person, voting stations or through ballots. That’s more than a third of the total of 240 million eligible voters. The unprecedented early voting has already passed the halfway mark for the 2016 total.Trump had held rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin — the two states that won him the presidency in 2016 with Pennsylvania — and Nebraska, a conservative state that comes into play because of its unique system (which it shares only with Maine) of granting electoral college votes by congressional districts, not winner-takes-all.Trump is trailing Biden in both Wisconsin and Michigan — by 7.1 percentage points and 8.3 points respectively in the FiveThirtyEight average of polls and by 5.5 points and 9 points in the RealClearPolitics average. His path to victory will shrink dramatically without these states.First Lady Melania Trump addressed her first rally this cycle in Chester, Pennsylvania, the most critical of the key states this election.And former President Barack Obama was in Orlando, Florida, where he launched a scathing attack on Trump. “What’s his closing argument? That people are too focused on Covid,” he said at a rally, referencing the president’s complaints about the epidemic. “He said this at one of his rallies. ‘Covid, Covid, Covid’ he’s complaining,” Obama said. “He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-votes-attacks-president-trump-over-covid-response/story-wH0HPFqR5eAfovHcrVbkoI.html
29-10-2020||World||Imran Khan punched above his weight; snubbed by Saudi Arabia, Iran||Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Sunni and Shia shoulders of Islam, refused to allow Pakistan missions to hold public events to observe the 27 October anniversary of Jammu and Kashmir’s accession to India as a Black Day, a departure from previous years that signals Pakistan’s shifting equations in West Asia.People familiar with the matter said the Pakistan embassy in Iran had proposed an event in Tehran University to observe what it has called a Black Day. But Tehran surprised Islamabad when it communicated its refusal to allow the event. The embassy later settled for a webinar, clearly a sign of Imran Khan government’s growing desperation for its failure to garner support over India’s abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. Islamabad’s plans to hold a public event within the Pakistani consulate in Riyadh were also blocked by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.People familiar with the matter said the change in stance adopted by two influential Islamic countries is a reflection of Pakistan’s equations in the Middle East, in large measure a fallout of its growing partnership with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who is attempting to establish Turkey’s prominence in the Middle East. Quite like the Ottoman empire that ruled the region for 500 years before being pushed back.Also Watch l Will Pak Army ‘sacrifice’ Imran Khan amid Opposition protests? Pak scribes comment Pakistan’s proximity to Turkey was on full display this month at the Financial Action Task Force plenary session when Ankara was the only one of the 39 members to push hard for keeping Islamabad out of the global terror financing watchdog’s ‘grey list’ despite its patchy track record.Prime Minister Imran Khan and Turkey’s Erdogan have been partnering to form a new radical Islamic axis as opposed to the established Sunni order led by Saudi Arabia and Shia order led by Iran.The two radical axis countries - Malaysia, who under Mahathir Mohammed was part of this new axis, has now taken a back seat - also made public their opposition to the United Arab Emirates establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel. Pakistan’s statement was much muted, given that it is still in the process of shifting sides, but Erdogan’s first reaction was a shot across the bow. He threatened to break off relations with UAE.But the freshly-minted partnership has its downside. Riyadh’s refusal to allow the Kashmir event was one. Saudi Arabia’s decision earlier this year to demand that Islamabad immediately repay a $ 3 billion loan after Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi tried to shame the royal kingdom into holding ministerial-level meet to discuss revocation of Article 370 was another. Analysts believe Imran Khan had bitten off more than he could chew and eventually had to send Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa to cool tempers in Riyadh. Gen Bajwa didn’t get the meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Islamabad had hoped for but is believed to have helped paper over the deep cracks in the relationship.Analysts suggest that Turkey’s Erdogan, who is seen to aspire for a leadership role in the Islamic world, too may have punched well above his weight. Turkey has its soldiers fighting in Iraq, Syria and Libya set up a garrison in Qatar, an overseas base in the Somali capital Mogadishu and is seen to challenge the Saudi Arabia-led Arab coalition in Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-punched-above-his-weight-snubbed-by-saudi-arabia-iran/story-glnjJS8vUSpw9ApniiQJBM.html
