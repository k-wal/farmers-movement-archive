Pelosi later said she’s “pretty happy” about the talks, even though there are a few sticking points, like the scale of funding for state and local governments.“The last 24 hours have moved the ball down the field,” Meadows said on Fox Business Wednesday morning.Mnuchin and Pelosi are scheduled to speak again at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. Any agreement still faces a roadblock in the Senate, however, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell having warned the White House against agreeing to anything akin to Pelosi’s more sweeping proposal.McConnell “might not mind doing it after the election,” Pelosi said. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier that if the actual vote on a compromise has to wait until post-election, just announcing a deal before Nov. 3 would still be “very helpful to the economy and markets.”“There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent -- my goal -- or will it be shortly after,” Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC. “I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.”Stocks opened higher with the negotiations continuing, though gains faded. The S&P 500 Index was up 0.1% as of 1:31 p.m.Despite the comments from Pelosi and Kudlow, it could still be an uphill battle to get passage in the Senate after Nov. 3.“It’s pretty hard to predict because I think that what happens in the presidential election will determine that more than anything we know right now,” Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told reporters.Senate Republicans remain on an entirely different track, with a number of them opposing anything on the order of $1.8 trillion. Mnuchin has put forward $1.88 trillion, while Pelosi wants $2.2 trillion.GOP vote counters in the Senate won’t have the 13 Republican votes needed to pass a stimulus package as large as Pelosi is seeking, according to a Senate aide.Given the risk of a damaging public split in the party just days before they face voters, McConnell has warned the White House not to rush into an agreement before the election, according to a person familiar with the matter.Meadows denied such a “warning” had been given, though did say Tuesday that he recognized some GOP senators oppose another stimulus. He went to Capitol Hill Wednesday to speak with Senate Republicans.“We’re working with Speaker Pelosi right now trying to get her to be reasonable,” Meadows said on his way into a closed GOP meeting. “Once we get a deal there, hopefully we’ll be able to discuss the merits with our Senate colleagues.”McConnell plans to seek a vote on a scaled-down package Wednesday -- a maneuver he tried last month only to be blocked by Democrats insisting on a comprehensive bill.“Our Democratic colleagues have been happy to talk about further relief as long as it remained a hypothetical concept,” McConnell said Wednesday. He criticized Pelosi for insisting on getting everything she wants out of a deal, including “wheelbarrows of cash” for mismanaged states.The Senate Republican effort of $500 billion includes items that both sides support, but is stripped of the elements many GOP members oppose -- including large-scale assistance to state and local authorities, tax credits for working families and relief for airlines.Timing questionMcConnell said Tuesday his chamber would take up a comprehensive coronavirus stimulus package “at some point” if Pelosi and Mnuchin are able to resolve the final areas of disagreement and get a bill through the House. But he didn’t say whether he would support such a deal, or encourage GOP members to back it.The Senate majority leader is focused instead on speeding confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, with a potential vote expected early next week.Meadows said on CNBC Tuesday that if a deal does get done and through the House, “it probably will divide the Republican conference.” There are “some senators who really believe that we’ve done enough for the economy and want zero,” he said.Progress was made in recent days over a national coronavirus testing and tracing plan. Pelosi also said, in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday, she planned to bring a counter-offer to Mnuchin on a Republican push to provide businesses with liability protection against virus-related lawsuits.Meadows also said the “biggest issue remains state and local assistance.” While the administration estimates that those authorities have lost $250 billion to $275 billion in revenue thanks to the coronavirus crisis, Pelosi is seeking aid of “about twice that number,” or closer to $500 billion, he said.Meadows suggested a compromise could be found, however. “If we can add additional moneys in terms of transportation and onshoring I think there’s a deal to be made,” he said, referring to the White House’s desire for incentives to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-mnuchin-near-a-deal-with-post-election-vote-floated/story-LHb0oJ0KIrDu2Q8B9EBsaP.html
21-10-2020||World||Thai protesters give PM Prayuth Chan-ocha three days to quit||Thai protesters on Wednesday gave Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha a three day deadline to step down or face more demonstrations, but the leader who made the announcement was arrested within two hours.Prayuth had earlier said he was ready to lift emergency measures he imposed last week to stop the protests as a move to “de-escalate” the situation.Tens of thousands of people marched to his offices at Government House. The protesters have been demonstrating for months against Prayuth and to demand curbs to King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s powers.They claimed success after handing a mock resignation letter for Prayuth to an official outside.“Our fight isn’t over as long as he doesn’t resign. If within three days he doesn’t resign, he will face the people again,” protest leader Patsaravalee ‘Mind’ Tanakitvibulpon, 25, told the crowd.Also Read | Thailand anti-government protests explainedShe was subsequently arrested on charges police said were related to a protest on Oct. 15, joining a list of dozens of activists picked up in the past two weeks. Her lawyer said she was charged for breaching the emergency measures.As Patsaravalee was led away she said: “I’m not worried. This is the government’s game.”In a televised address, Prayuth had said he was ready to lift measures banning political gatherings of five or more people and publication of information deemed to threaten security.“I will make the first move to de-escalate this situation,” Prayuth said.“We must now step back from the edge of the slippery slope that can easily slide to chaos,” he added, saying talks should go to parliament, where his supporters have a majority.The protests have become the biggest challenge to Thailand’s establishment in years and have drawn the most open opposition to the monarchy in decades despite lese majeste laws setting jail terms of up to 15 years for insulting royalty.Water cannonMost demonstrations have been peaceful so far, but police used water cannon against protesters last Friday, further fuelling the anger of government critics.Riot police briefly held up Wednesday’s march at one point before letting the crowds through.Protesters say Prayuth rigged an election last year to keep hold of power he seized in a 2014 coup. He says the election was fair. Protesters accuse the monarchy of enabling years of military domination.The palace has a policy of making no comment to media.Prayuth said protesters should wait for next week’s emergency session of parliament, whose entire upper house was appointed by his former junta.“The protesters have made their voices and views heard,” Prayuth said. “It is now time for them to let their views be reconciled with the views of other segments of Thai society.”Also Read | Thai Cabinet approves parliament session to discuss protestsScores of Thai royalists and anti-government protesters earlier confronted each other at Ramkhamhaeng University. The yellow-shirted royalists advanced on student protesters and the two sides shouted abuse at each other. Some threw water bottles and other objects before the students pulled back and police stepped in to separate the sides.“I beg you, do what you will, but do not touch the monarchy,” one of the royalists, Sirimongkol Ruampan, 24, told Reuters. “I don’t believe in violence. I beg again, don’t bring the monarchy into politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-give-pm-prayuth-chan-ocha-three-days-to-quit/story-rzrjLF5Vxdboz8BVsIAbXO.html
21-10-2020||World||Barack Obama hits campaign trail for Joe Biden in final stretch of White House race||Former US president Barack Obama hits the campaign trail for Joe Biden on Wednesday in a bid to drum up support for his former vice president among young Americans and Black voters in the final stretch of the White House race.As the 59-year-old Obama makes his first in-person campaign appearance -- at a drive-in car rally at a sports stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- President Donald Trump is to visit North Carolina, one of the battleground states key to victory on November 3.Biden, 77, who is leading in the national polls, had no public events on his schedule for the third day in a row, leading the 74-year-old Trump to accuse his Democratic opponent of going “into hiding.”The Biden campaign said the former vice president was preparing for the second and final debate against Trump, which is to take place in Nashville, Tennessee, on Thursday.Obama remained on the sidelines during the Democratic presidential primaries but he threw his support behind Biden after his former deputy won the nomination.The Biden campaign is hoping the star power of America’s first Black president will help boost turnout among young voters and African Americans, who are key to Democratic hopes of recapturing the White House.African Americans voted in record numbers for Obama in 2008 and 2012 but their participation dropped off in 2016, a contributing factor to Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton.Obama appealed directly to young voters in a video released on Tuesday.“One of the most inspiring things about this year has been to see so many young Americans fired up, organizing and fighting for change,” he said.“Your generation can be the one that creates a new normal in America, one that’s fairer, where the system treats everybody equally, and gives everybody opportunity.”Obama said there was a “growing movement for justice, equality and progress on so many issues” and “that momentum only continues if we win this election.”“I know Joe better than almost anybody,” he added. “I trust him to be a great president. He’s on the right side of the issues.”‘Existential matter’Trump has spent much of his first term in office seeking to erase the legacy of his predecessor but Obama doesn’t view the election “as a personal grudge match with Trump,” Obama’s former chief strategist David Axelrod said.“He views it as an existential matter for the country and for democracy,” Axelrod told CNN.Axelrod said Democrats had been strategic in having Obama make his first appearance on the campaign trail at this late date.“In terms of his value, it’s been smart not to overuse him,” Axelrod said. “They’ve been using him in targeted digital appeals to constituencies that Democrats need to arouse in this election: young people and people of color.”“He’s always understood if he was out there constantly, people would want to turn this into a Trump-Obama race,” Axelrod added.While Biden has been keeping a low profile over the past few days, Trump is seeking to recapture the enthusiasm of four years ago with daily rallies in battleground states.Trump’s message has been a mix of optimism, telling Americans that the worsening coronavirus outbreak is practically over, and ever more extreme attempts to tar Biden as corrupt -- even saying Tuesday that he wants the attorney general to open an investigation into his rival.First Lady Melania Trump had been scheduled to join her husband in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday but -- in a reminder of the pandemic which has cast a shadow over his presidency -- she was forced to cancel at the last minute, complaining of a “lingering cough” following her own bout with the virus.Trump is to hold an outdoors campaign rally in Gastonia, North Carolina, on Wednesday, an event the Biden campaign said violated the state’s coronavirus guidelines.“President Trump still has no plan on how to get this virus under control,” the Biden campaign said in a statement.“Instead, he is attacking our nation’s leading scientists and public health experts, continuing to spread deadly misinformation about the virus, and holding rallies that fly in the face of North Carolina’s Covid-19 guidelines.”Democratic vice president Kamala Harris will also be in North Carolina on Wednesday, seeking to encourage voters to cast their ballots early.At least 40 million Americans have already voted, according to the US Elections Project of the University of Florida, nearly 30 percent of the total turnout in 2016.With the election less than two weeks away, Biden has an 7.9 point lead over Trump in an average of national polls, according to the RealClearPolitics website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-hits-campaign-trail-for-joe-biden-in-final-stretch-of-white-house-race/story-jpg3DDdQEMm123l0Q2P25N.html
21-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Why winning the Senate is important for both Republicans and Democrats?||Along with the presidential elections on November 3, elections will also be held for 33 out of the 100 US Senate seats. Special elections will also take place to fill the vacancies in the seats of Arizona and Georgia. So overall, 35 senate seats are up for election.Twelve of these seats are held by the Democrats and 23 by the Republicans. Currently, Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 53 seats. Democrats would need a net gain of four seats, or three in addition to winning the presidential election, to take control of the chamber. The vice president casts tie-breaking votes in the Senate.For the Democrats Colorado, Arizona, Maine, North Carolina, Georgia, Montana, and Iowa look very competitive. For Republicans two states hold the key: Alabama and Michigan. Importance of a Senate majorityNo US President can deliver on a bold agenda without a Senate majority. Therefore, it is very crucial for both the parties to ensure that along with the presidential win, they get a majority in the Senate as well. It is more important for Democrats to win the Senate as they have been promising change on key issues like health care, climate change and the pandemic. If the results of the election turn out to be like 2016, winning the Senate is even more pertinent for the Democrats.Even now, the Democrats and Republicans are at a standstill with respect to the Covid-19 relief package and therefore, the first priority for the Democrats if they win the majority in the Senate would be the relief package. The anti-corruption reforms, the Affordable Care Act, the criminal justice bill to combat police brutality against Black Americans, immigration reforms, the Build Better plan proposed by Joe Biden; all depend on the Democrats securing a majority in the Senate.The recent confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is an apt example of the power that lies with the Senate. Even though the Democrats oppose the nomination of Judge Barrett to the seat left vacant after the passing away of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, they are aware that their options are very limited as Republicans have a 53- 47 majority in the Senate. Therefore, the importance of a Senate majority is something that the Democrats cannot ignore as it is the Senate majority that Republicans are effectively using to push their agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-why-winning-the-senate-is-important-for-both-republicans-and-democrats/story-jvRWb5FSesHsL2jlIWVd7N.html
21-10-2020||World||UK-EU trade talks back on the table after the bloc’s olive branch||The British government and the European Union will resume stalled trade negotiations in London, the UK government said -- days after Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared the talks over.Johnson declared the talks at an end last week, accusing the bloc of expecting Britain to make all the concessions to get a deal. He said they could only proceed if the bloc made a “fundamental” change of policy.Since then, the EU has agreed to “intensify” talks — a key UK demand — and to discuss the legal text of an agreement. But Johnson’s Downing Street office said Tuesday that it wasn’t a big enough change to resume negotiations.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier struck a further conciliatory note on Wednesday and said compromise would be needed from both sides to get a deal. That turned out to be the key.Johnson’s office said that on the basis of Barnier’s words it was “ready to welcome the EU team to London to resume negotiations later this week” for “intensified” talks.Barnier told the European Parliament on that “despite the difficulties we’ve faced, an agreement is within reach if both sides are willing to work constructively, if they are willing to compromise.”Barnier spokesman Daniel Ferrie said EU negotiators would travel to London on Thursday.Downing Street seized on Barnier’s words about compromise and his acknowledgement that a deal would have to respect the UK’s “sovereignty,” a key word for British Brexit supporters.The two sides have been trying to strike a trade deal since the UK left the EU on Jan 31. They must do so within weeks if an agreement is to be ratified by the end of the year, when a post-Brexit transition period ends.Barnier played down the chance of ground-shaking change after all these months when talks on key issues moved at a glacial pace.“May I remind you that the European Union’s attitude in this negotiation has in no way shifted and it will not shift,” Barnier told EU legislators. “We will also remain firm and determined when it comes to defending the principles and the interests of each of the EU member states.”But Barnier’s emollient tone contrasted with the combative stance of European Council President Charles Michel, who rejected Britain’s insistence that the EU fundamentally change its negotiating stance and cede more to UK demands. Michel told the European Parliament that if Britain wants vast access to the 27-member bloc’s markets, it will have to keep its waters open to EU fishermen, something the UK is refusing to do.Michel said: “Yes, we want to keep access to UK waters for our fishermen. Exactly like the UK, too, want to keep access to our huge and diversified markets for its companies.”Any trade deal needs to go through legal vetting and legislative approval before Jan 1, so it makes the real deadline for a deal closer to the first week of November instead of New Year’s Eve.EU officials have said such time pressure made the UK decision to delay further talks even more baffling.The bloc accuses Britain of seeking the kind of unfettered access to its markets usually reserved for EU members.“The UK wants access to a single market while at the same time being able to diverge from our standards and regulations when it suits them,” Michel said. “You can’t have your cake and eat it too.”EU leaders also remain angry over the UK’s plans to disregard some parts of the legally binding withdrawal agreement it signed with the bloc.If passed, the Internal Market Bill will allow the British government to override parts of the legally binding Brexit withdrawal agreement relating to trade with Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK to share a border with the EU.Johnson’s government says it needs the legislation as an insurance policy in case the EU behaves unreasonably after a post-Brexit transition period ends on Dec 31 and tries to impede the flow of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UKThe bloc sees it as a flagrant breach of an international treaty that could undermine the delicate foundations of Northern Ireland’s peace settlement, created by the 1998 Good Friday accord.It further feeds a general sense of mistrust of Britain, and complicates any trade deal since the EU will look at every single, tiniest paragraph to make sure the UK will be respecting it.Michel used it to highlight the need to respect high environmental and social commitments in any trade deal.“Our UK friends say they want to maintain the highest standards. If that’s the case, why don’t they commit to them? We don’t need words. We need guarantees,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-trade-talks-back-on-the-table-after-the-bloc-s-olive-branch/story-hIV98wQf727uFqbci45e3K.html
21-10-2020||World||Controversies around third presidential debate in US: Topics, moderator and rules||The third and final presidential debate before the election in the United States is set to take place on October 22 between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The debate is consequential for Trump as polls show that voters are favouring Biden in the election. It is also important for Biden because as per US media, his lead is decreasing in the battleground states.The debate has already become controversial even before it has taken place which is certainly a reflection on the fact that the race to the White House is getting heated as November 3 is coming closer.Controversy over the debate topicsThe Trump campaign wants foreign policy to be one of the topics to be discussed in the debate. Trump’s campaign manager Bill Stepien wrote a letter to the US Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) urging them to include foreign policy as a debate topic. But, the list announed by moderator Kristn Welker doesn’t include this. Trump’s campaign has accused the organisers of deliberately leaving out the topic of foreign policy in order to “help” Biden.Controversy over the debate moderatorQuestions were also raised by the Trump campaign and the US President himself about the credibility of the debate moderator Kristen Welker. Trump attacked the NBC correspondent by calling her “fake news reporter”, “terrible” and “unfair”. Fox News (which is believed to be pro-Trump) did a segment on Welker and alleged that her parents “poured cash” into the Democratic Party and that Welker has “deep democratic ties”.Controversy over the debate rulesIn the first presidential debate, both Biden and Trump repeatedly interrupted each other and thus the CPD introduced a new rule of muting microphones and giving full, uninterrupted two minutes to each candidate at the beginning of each 15-minute segment. The Trump campaign agreed to the muting of the microphones, adding that the new rules are “last-minute rule changes from the biased commission in their latest attempt to provide advantage to their favoured candidate”.The debate will be held at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/controversies-around-third-presidential-debate-in-us-topics-moderator-and-rules/story-n3oQDhH1uZtv3sqzRB74YO.html
21-10-2020||World||Out-polled and out-funded, Trump faces China account questions||As Donald Trump sought to escalate his corruption allegations against Democratic nominee Joe Biden and turn around a presidential race in which he has been badly out-polled and out-funded, the US president was hit by news reports of a bank account in China that he never declared.The account was controlled by Trump International Hotels Management, which paid local taxes in China, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. This was one of three foreign accounts the publication found during an analysis of the president’s tax records; the other two were in Ireland and Britain. None of them figured in public financial disclosures by the president. A Trump Organization spokesperson told NYT the China account was opened after an office was established there to “explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia”.Trump, who has refused to release his tax returns, had attacked Biden in recent days alleging corruption by the former vice-president and his younger and only surviving son, Hunter Biden, for latter’s business dealings in Ukraine and China. He has based his attacks on claims in a news report in a conservative-leaning paper that other publications have not been able to verify. Critics have raised the possibility of the report being part of a misinformation campaign by Russia to influence the elections. Biden has dismissed the allegations as a “smear campaign”.Trump has been trailing Biden in polls: by 8.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls on Wednesday, which was an improvement upon the double-digit deficit he faced a week ago. But the FiveThirtyEight weighted average had him steadfastly short by more than 10 points.The president has been also massively out-funded. According to filings with the federal election commission on Tuesday, the Trump campaign had only $63.1 million in the bank at the end of September, compared to Biden campaign’s $177.3 million.The president’s cash-strapped re-election campaign was unequally matched for the onslaught of hostile ads that has already started from the Biden campaign. Trump has had to bank on free airtime through more in-person rallies and a slew of interviews as one way of plugging the hole.One such interview did not go too well. Trump abruptly ended a sit-down session at the White House with a CBS 60 Minutes anchor on Tuesday and threatened to release his own recording to pre-empt whatever went wrong before the scheduled telecast coming Sunday.Biden, in the meantime, has gone off the campaign trail to prepare for the third and final debate. His former boss and President Barack Obama, the Democratic party’s most potent and popular canvasser, will address a drive-in rally in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/out-polled-and-out-funded-trump-faces-china-account-questions/story-zTniXvSjvcmjCTHX0IaRDP.html
21-10-2020||World||Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro rejects Chinese vaccine against Covid||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro overruled his own health minister on Wednesday, rejecting the announced purchase of 46 million doses of CoronaVac, a potential vaccine against Covid-19 being tested in Sao Paulo state.Health minister Eduardo Pazuello announced the purchase on Tuesday alongside Sao Paulo’s Gov. João Doria, a foe of Bolsonaro’s whose state government is participating in the vaccine’s development.The cost of the acquisition was estimated at 2 billion Brazilian reals (USD 360 million).“The Brazilian people will not be anyone’s guinea pig,” Bolsonaro said on his social media channels, adding that the shot made by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac is yet to finish its testing phase — which is true of all potential vaccines. “My decision is to not purchase such a vaccine.” It is common practice for governments to purchase doses of promising vaccines, to build a stockpile in case they are proven effective. That investment is usually not refundable if the shot fails.Brazil counts more than 153,000 deaths by Covid-19, second only to the United States. The South American nation also confirmed 5.2 million cases of the disease, the third biggest in the world, behind the US and India.Bolsonaro and Doria have had an adversarial relationship since the start of the pandemic, with each taking opposite stances regarding stay-at-home recommendations and restrictions on activity. The governor of Brazil’s most populous state heeded the counsel of public health experts and adopted such measures, which the president blasted, arguing the economic fallout could kill more than the disease.Doria, who supported Bolsonaro’s in the 2018 elections, has distanced himself from the president and is also widely cited as a likely challenger in the 2022 vote.Lawmaker Bia Kicis, a close ally of Bolsonaro’s, published on her social media channels another message that she said came directly from the president: “I warn that we will not buy a single dose of vaccine from China, and my administration does not maintain any dialogue with João Doria on the matter of Covid-19,” the message said.In June, Brazil’s government announced a deal with Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to purchase 100 million doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-rejects-chinese-vaccine-against-covid/story-rhQil605Ovlmhqcr26wmiM.html

It tallied a record 927,000 confirmed cases over the last week.Based on a 14-day moving average, Switzerland now counts about 394 cases per 100,000 people, he said.“A month ago, it was less than 60,” Berset said, alluding to a previous level at which Swiss authorities had set as a warning threshold.He said the Swiss government would wait until next Wednesday to see if new measures can stem the spread, because it will take 10 days to determine their effect, and would tighten them if necessary.Those measures, announced Sunday, include a requirement for people to wear face and nose coverings in all publicly accessible indoor areas, such as railway stations, airports, schools, shopping malls, stores, places of worship, libraries and hotels.Gatherings of more than 15 people aren’t permitted in public, and new regulations were put on private events of more than 15 people. People were urged to work from home if possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-fear-rise-in-covid-19-cases-could-overburden-hospitals/story-5KLz5xTf3eVkPMQe6mvNtK.html
21-10-2020||World||Ajanta cave images, Bhagwad Gita deposited at eternal Arctic archive||High-resolution images of the iconic Ajanta caves and the Bhagwad Gita on Wednesday joined in a unique archive deep inside a decommissioned coal mine in the remote arctic island of Svalbard in Norway, where items of world memory are stored to last nearly 1,000 years.The Arctic World Archive, the unique repository for the benefit of future generations, was opened in 2017. Several governments have since deposited items there for long-term storage in a facility designed to withstand natural and man-made disasters.Supported by India’s ministry of culture, the Ajanta images and a paper on the caves, titled ‘Revelation of Ajanta Caves’ by noted photographer Benoy K Behl, were deposited by a group that included representatives of the National Museum of Norway, Unicef Norway, the Norwegian Defence Museum and Mjøndalen Sports Association.The Bhagwad Gita was deposited in the archive in February 2018, a spokesperson of Norwegian data-storage company Piql AS that created the archive with the National Museum of Norway said. The Ajanta items were deposited by Indian data enterprise Sapio Analytics, which has been working with various ministries on the project.Ashwin Srivastava of Sapio Analytics said: “This deposit is the initiation of deposits of digitised and restored murals of Ajanta Caves. We are starting off with one of Benoy Behl’s masterpiece photographs of Ajanta paintings, widely regarded to be the best ever art by any human being. We also have a few other restored works and papers in this deposit. This marks the start of preserving the gateway of culture of Asia for eternity.”Behl added: “The murals of India have been established as one of the greatest and most sublime traditions of the art of the world. The murals on Ajanta Caves are one of the greatest art created ever in the history of humankind.” “This is India’s deepest cultural connection to all the countries of Asia. The paintings of Ajanta are recognised and deeply revered by art historians and Buddhist priests. I am proud to see my work on Ajanta Caves getting saved.”The Ajanta items were the first deposit in the archive from any Unesco heritage site, and among several others deposited on Wednesday. Since the Ajanta paintings cannot be photographed with lights, a special low-light photographic technique was used.

21-10-2020||World||‘So much work to do’: How Joe Biden is planning for transition||If Joe Biden defeats President Donald Trump next month, he’ll quickly face a new challenge: standing up a new administration to lead a divided nation through a series of historic crises.After making Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign, Biden will have to show that his team can better handle the public health calamity. He will also have to contend with what Democrats say is the damage the Trump administration has done to the bureaucratic machinery in Washington, as well as low morale throughout the civil service.And he’ll face pressure from liberals to deliver early wins with personnel and Cabinet picks to ensure their buy-in for his big policy fights to come.With the election less than two weeks away, Biden and his aides are most focused on maintaining his advantage in polls against Trump. “No decisions, from personnel to policy, will be made until after the election,” Biden transition spokesman Cameron French said Wednesday.Still, some Democrats are beginning to prepare for the challenges that may swiftly unfold once the campaign is over.“This will be one of the most important, most difficult and yes most costly transitions in modern American history,” Chris Korge, the Democratic National Committee’s finance chair, warned donors in a recent letter obtained by The Associated Press. “There is so much work to do.”According to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that advises presidential candidates on the transition, Biden will have to name more than 4,000 political appointees to fill out his administration, including more than 1,200 requiring Senate confirmation. There are 700 key executive branch nominations that must go through Senate confirmation, 153 of which are currently vacant.Chris Lu, executive director of President Barack Obama’s 2008 transition, said there are vacancies in some of the departments that will be key to addressing the country’s standing globally and the climate crisis.“There’s a lot of expertise that’s just gone now — in particular, when you look at places like the State Department and the gutting of the Foreign Service or, you know, in climate agencies like EPA or Interior,” he said.Launching a team to address the pandemic would probably be Biden’s top priority.Chief among Biden’s first priorities as president will be moving quickly to address the pandemic. He would likely move quickly to announce Cabinet picks that would be key in the response, according to people involved in transition planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Those roles include leaders of the treasury and health and human services departments and the director of the National Economic Council.Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a longtime Biden ally and friend, is seen as a top contender for secretary of state, and he has been increasingly vocal about foreign policy in recent weeks. He wrote an essay in Foreign Affairs and participated in a recent panel discussion on the future of US foreign policy.Biden is also expected to look to some of his former opponents and those he vetted as his potential running mate for top Cabinet positions.Rep. Karen Bass of California, whom Biden considered for vice president, is seen as a potential housing and urban development secretary.Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who was also included in Biden’s vice presidential shortlist, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former primary opponent, are discussed for secretary of veterans affairs. One person familiar with the transition planning said Buttigieg could also be an ambassador to the United Nations.Other news reports have suggested Michèle Flournoy, a top adviser to two secretaries of defense under Obama, is a top contender for defense secretary, and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is a possible energy secretary.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, could be a candidate for treasury secretary, though she could face confirmation challenges, depending on the makeup of the Senate, if she’s seen as too progressive.The Biden team is looking at a few other departments as opportunities to make history: There’s never been a female or a Black defense secretary, nor a Black interior secretary or female veterans affairs secretary.Biden might face his first real fight over possible White House aides.His team is expected to roll out a chief of staff and director of the National Economic Council within days of the election. He’s believed to be considering former chiefs of staff Steve Richetti, Bruce Reed and Ron Klain to reprise their old positions, and Jeff Zeints and Brian Deese, both top officials on the National Economic Council under Obama, to return.Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive advocacy group geared toward putting pressure on Democratic administrations to appoint liberal nominees and top officials, said those picks will have potentially pivotal implications for the success of Biden’s first 100 days in office.“The potential honeymoon for a Biden administration with progressives will be very short, if he is making impactful decisions that seem to augur four years of moderation in the face of things believed to be serious, a serious crisis,” he said.Hauser said the left views Richetti and Reed as “really bad” picks because Reed is seen as a moderate and Richetti is a longtime lobbyist.Zeints and Deese are similarly concerning for progressives; Hauser said they’d prefer Heather Boushey or Jared Bernstein, both of whom are current Biden campaign economic advisers, to lead the National Economic Council.If Biden wins, it’s unclear how closely Trump administration officials would work with the incoming team. Alan Kessler, a prominent Democratic fundraiser, said he worries about the possibility that Trump could direct his top officials to resist sharing key details with the transition.“When you have the president saying, ‘I’m not going quietly, and if I lose, it’s because it was rigged and there’s fraud,’ that’s a concern,” he said. “Is it going to mean the Biden campaign’s not going to be able to conduct the transition? No. But it will be a lot harder if the current administration doesn’t cooperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-so-much-work-to-do-how-joe-biden-is-planning-for-transition/story-LlrKYnLKNuze06ys9ONJpM.html
21-10-2020||World||Sindh Police chief kidnapping plot by Rangers fans Pakistan political crisis||The high-profile kidnapping of a police chief in Pakistan by official paramilitary troops signals further turmoil in a country already bracing for more protests against Prime Minister Imran Khan.Troops known as rangers raided the house of Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar, the inspector general of police in southern Sindh province. Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, a spokesman for opposition politician Bilawal Bhutto Zardari -- whose party rules the state -- told Dunya TV the rangers forced the police chief to sign an order to arrest another opposition leader, Safdar Awan.While Khan’s pro-military government has not yet addressed the issue, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa ordered an inquiry. A spokesman for the prime minister was not immediately available to comment, and the office of the rangers in Karachi declined to do so.Since the incident, Mahar told his officers to delay leave until the completion of the probes by the army and state government, the Sindh police said on Twitter late Tuesday. Top ranking police officers in the province have sought leave for being “ridiculed,” Khokhar said.The incident comes amid the worst turmoil in Pakistan since Khan’s rise to power about two years ago. An alliance of 11 opposition parties is holding nationwide rallies seeking his removal over food shortages and inflation, and demanding the military stop meddling in politics.The army, which has directly ruled Pakistan for about half of its existence since 1947, has historically played a key part in shaping foreign and national security policy, but has expanded its role under the current government. The army and the judiciary cannot be criticized publicly under Pakistan’s constitution.The rangers are headed by a military officer and operate under the interior ministry, according to the force’s website.The alleged kidnapping happened before the police arrested Awan -- husband of Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who is the daughter and political heir of three time premier Nawaz Sharif. Awan, who was charged with raising political slogans during a visit to the tomb of the nation’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Karachi, secured bail from the Sindh High Court.It follows the arrest of journalists and opposition leaders, some whom have been charged with treason by Khan’s government for criticizing the army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/high-profile-kidnapping-plot-fans-pakistan-political-crisis/story-to9ZWyBnVgAOTnCqAqTPKM.html
21-10-2020||World||Donald Trump abruptly leaves CBS interview after 45 minutes||United States President Donald Trump abruptly concluded a solo interview with CBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Tuesday, and did not return for an appearance he was scheduled to shoot with US Vice President Mike Pence, sources said.After camera crews set up at the White House on Monday, Trump sat down with host Lesley Stahl for about 45 minutes on Tuesday before leaving abruptly the interview and told the network he believed they had enough material to use, according to two sources, CNN reported.CBS News did not instantly respond to a CNN request for comment. When reached for comment, the White House did not dispute CNN’s reporting.Later, Trump posted on Twitter a clip of the reporter at the White House attacking her for not wearing a face mask.“I am pleased to inform you that, for the sake of accuracy in reporting, I am considering posting my interview with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, PRIOR TO AIRTIME! “ he added. “This will be done so that everybody can get a glimpse of what a FAKE and BIASED interview is all about ... “ Trump tweeted.Also Read| US Presidential Elections 2020: Donald Trump tends to his electoral map, Joe Biden prepping for debateHowever, a source later informed CNN that Stahl had a mask on from the time she entered the White House to when the interview started. The image from the tweet only showed her standing with her producers before she went back to her belongings to wear the mask.According to CNN, with about two weeks until the election, “Trump has spent this week lobbing scatter-shot attacks and growing upset at depictions portraying his campaign as doomed. His truncated taping on “60 Minutes” seemed an extension of what has been Trump’s visible irritation as he enters the campaign’s final days.”Along with Trump and Pence, former Vice President Joe Biden and California Senator Kamala Harris also gave interviews with CBS and all four are scheduled to appear in a programme on Sunday. Trump and Pence were scheduled to appear on the Sunday programme together, as they did four years ago for a walk and talk session before Trump decided to end the interview without reason. Biden and Harris, however, filmed their interviews separately.Trump is facing a massive national polling shortage against Biden.He even called the director of NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) Dr. Anthony Fauci a “disaster” on Monday, and called the news media “criminals” for not reporting unproven accusations against Biden.Trump also demanded his attorney general to work “fast” to investigate the unfounded accusations against Biden before the elections. After the panel organizing Thursday’s debate announced that the candidates’ microphones would be muted for certain parts of the event, Trump accused them of bias.Also Read: Trump says he could be ‘king’ of all fundraisers, slams Biden for being ‘servant’ of lobbyistsTrump has also expressed anger over news stories commenting that his campaign is fated for defeat. He has even questioned why the Republicans are appearing to distance themselves.Trump told reporters, “I’m not running scared,” “I think I’m running angry.”Polling in states where Trump won in 2016, shows Biden to be ahead this time. Trump admitted that he was upset while standing on the tarmac in Arizona on Monday.While speaking to Trump off-camera in 2016, Stahl said that he admitted his attacks on the press were meant to demean negative stories that are published about him.As per CNN, “He said, ‘You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.’ He said that,” Stahl said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-abruptly-leaves-cbs-interview-after-45-minutes/story-FM3IyWar11vFUQMF3fuxSN.html
21-10-2020||World||Special Taliban unit ambush Afghan forces butchering 34 during peace talks||A special unit of Taliban militants ambushed a convoy of Afghan security forces on Tuesday evening, killing as many as 34 even as the insurgent group holds peace talks with the Kabul government to end the 19-year-old war.The night raid by Taliban fighters, some armed with night-vision goggles and laser-assisted rifles, took place in Afghanistan’s north as the convoy made its way to the city of Takhar, said Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the province. Hejri said many soldiers and police officers were wounded and still missing. Abdul Qayum, the head of the province’s public health department, confirmed the death toll by phone.The attack is the worst in two weeks after a days-long battle in southern Helmand province displaced about 30,000 Afghans and resulted in heavy casualties to both sides. Another suicide car bomb attack in Ghor on Sunday, which Kabul blamed on the insurgents, killed 15 people and wounded more than 80 others.The Taliban have continued to ratchet up violent pressure while talks are being held in Doha between the group and Afghan government. They have yet to reach an agreement on even the most basic issues. These include procedural rules and whether a landmark February agreement between Washington and the Taliban should serve as the basis for talks.Violent LeverageThe Kabul administration has accused the insurgents of mounting attacks across the country in a bid to gain leverage in the negotiations. The Taliban haven’t made any comment on the ambush and Hejri said the insurgents also suffered heavy casualties.The talks began after the U.S. signed the agreement with the Taliban that called for the departure of all foreign military forces by May 2021. However, US President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he wants all American forces in Afghanistan home by Christmas, comments that the Taliban welcomed.Experts have said that continued violence enacted by the Taliban is a worry that would be exacerbated by the Americans leaving before the intra-Afghan peace talks make any real headway. Afghanistan is the site of the US’s longest war, and 5,000 American soldiers are currently serving there. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and cost the US almost $1 trillion since its invasion in 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/special-taliban-unit-ambush-afghan-forces-butchering-34-during-peace-talks/story-lwAP1Z5AjPaSVj34DW0XlJ.html
21-10-2020||World||Durga Puja, Diwali turn virtual in UK in wake of Covid-19||The Midlands city of Leicester is reputed to hold the largest Diwali celebrations outside India, and Durga Puja in the popular London Sharad Utsav attracts many, but the Covid-19 pandemic has forced organisers to adopt innovative ways to ring in the festive spirit this year.The Leicester City Council that funds and promotes celebrations on the arterial Belgrave Road said that this year will be the city’s first virtual Diwali Day celebration. There will be no gatherings on the road for traditional entertainment and fireworks.Instead, the council has invited people to join the celebrations from the safety of their homes. It said in a statement: “Members of the public can send in their personal video messages, which could feature in an hour-long package of entertainment that will be streamed on the Visit Leicester website on Diwali Day – Saturday 14 November.”The council said each video filmed on a mobile phone should be around 30-45 seconds long, shot in landscape format and recorded in English. People can use their video to wish a friend, or a family member, a Happy Diwali, or they could share their tips for a socially-distanced celebration with people around the world.Leicester has a large population of Indian origin, many of whom migrated after being expelled by Idi Amin in Uganda in the early 1970s. Several Indian banks, shops and restaurants catering to the population are based on Belgrave Road.Deputy city mayor Piara Singh Clair said: “We all need to find different ways to celebrate important festivals like Diwali and Christmas this year. Although we can’t meet up with our extended families in person this year, our virtual Diwali celebration will help bring people together”.“We hope that people will enjoy recording their messages, and we look forward to sharing as many of them as possible as part of our Diwali Day programming,” he added.The council said that besides the video messages, the Diwali Day programme will feature music, story-telling, dance and the traditional lighting of the ‘diva’ lamp. It will not organise fireworks, but footage of the spectacular displays from previous years will be included in the virtual event.In London, this year’s theme for the London Sharad Utsav is ‘A Ray of Hope’ to pay tributes to the legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray (1921-1992) on his birth centenary year, as well as reflect optimism in the time of pandemic. Its organisers are also making use of innovative technology. Suranjan Som, vice-president of London Sharad Utsav, said: “No one will miss our Pujo. Anyone will be able to offer Anjali or pray during Sandhi Pujo from their home. We are using Google VR technology to ensure London Sharad Utsav reaches every home and mobile device across the world. “With a relatively inexpensive Google Cardboard VR headset, they will feel that are sitting right in front of our idol, while our priest carries out the regular ceremonies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/durga-puja-diwali-turn-virtual-in-uk-in-wake-of-covid-19/story-THDrRpUjnMRmcrSZTP44zO.html
21-10-2020||World||US govt sues Google: What is the antitrust case and how will it impact the tech giant||The Justice Department of the US government has sued Alphabet owned Google accusing the company of illegally abusing its dominance in internet search and harming competitors and consumers. Here is everything you need to know about this lawsuit:What is the US government’s stand?The government has accused Google of illegally protecting its dominant position in the market for search and search advertising through deals signed with big companies like Apple and other smartphone makers, all of who have Google as the default search engine on their devices. This makes Google dominant in the search market, a “monopoly gatekeeper for the internet” as described by the Justice Department. Other than that, digital advertising on Google is also under the scanner which includes search, web display and video ads. The lawsuit alleges that Google’s behaviour in the digital advertising space is that of a monopolist, “exclusionary” as it stifles smaller competitors and inhibits innovation resulting in a huge disservice to the consumers. What is Google’s stand?Google has consistently maintained that their services are useful for the consumers and free for everyone to use. It has also emphasised that all the deals it has made are legal and help the companies.Is this politically motivated?While questioning a single company holding so much power is more of a policy concern that has been repeatedly raised by senators like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Occasio Cortez, this lawsuit has immediate implications as it comes just two weeks before the US 2020 presidential elections. Attorney General William Barr is said to have moved rather quickly on this lawsuit as taking on the Big Tech giants was one of Trump’s election promises.Has such a lawsuit ever happened before?A similar case happened 22 years ago in 1998 against Microsoft as the company was accused of bundling all products around Windows. At the time of the Microsoft lawsuit, Google was just a startup and had claimed that Microsoft’s practices were “anti-competitive”.What will happen next?The US government and Google could reach a settlement but if that doesn’t happen, both of them are headed to the court. The outcome of the case will certainly take years to come but the lawsuit is the first significant step taken against Google.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-govt-sues-google-what-is-the-antitrust-case-and-how-will-it-impact-the-tech-giant/story-5MBLVjsSa4YuJBbQ8UFfFM.html
21-10-2020||World||Thai protesters continue rallies, ask court to revoke order||Student activists applied to a court Wednesday to try to revoke a state of emergency that Thailand’s government declared last week in an effort to rein in the country’s growing anti-government protests.Demonstrations have continued daily in a movement that calls for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to step down, for a more democratic constitution and for reforms to the monarchy — a revered institution traditionally treated as sacrosanct in Thailand.Protesters gathered Wednesday for an eighth straight day, even though many of their top leaders have been detained and the state of emergency bans public gatherings of more than four people.The main group of a few thousand at most met at Bangkok’s Victory Monument, and then began marching to Government House, the office of the prime minister.A taped televised speech by the prime minister, meanwhile, was scheduled to be broadcast Wednesday evening. He was expected to call for a peaceful resolution of the political crisis through parliamentary means.Even the forcible dispersion of a rally by riot police backed by water cannons in Bangkok last Friday failed to faze protesters, who appeared in equal or greater numbers on subsequent days.Since Friday, police have not confronted the protesters directly, instead trying to disrupt their gatherings by selective shutdowns of mass transit and seeking to block their online organizing activities.The six university students who went to a civil court in Bangkok on Wednesday are suing Prayuth, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan and national police chief Suwat Chaengyodsuk. They want the court to temporarily revoke the emergency decree until a full legal ruling can be issued on its legality.The students, who read their petition to the media in Thai, English and German, said the decree restricted the legal right of assembly and “excessively, unfairly and shamelessly violated the rights and freedoms of people” with no respect to the constitution.The court did not act on their petition but may rule Thursday on a similar appeal that was filed Tuesday by the opposition Pheu Thai party.Separately Wednesday, two protest leaders sought to be released on bail at a Bangkok criminal court. After a hearing, however, the court refused to release them, saying they could pose a threat to public order.The two — Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak and Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul — were initially taken into custody during an attempted overnight rally outside the prime minister’s office on the night of October 14. They were released Tuesday but immediately rearrested on other charges.As he was being driven into the court compound in a prison van, Parit opened a window, flashed a three-fingered salute — the protesters’ symbol of defiance — and shouted, “The court must side with the people!”Another activist was arrested Wednesday morning in connection with last week’s protests. Suranart Panprasert is accused of involvement with acts of harm against the queen when her motorcade passed a small crowd of demonstrators. Depending upon exactly what he is charged with by a court, he could face a life sentence if convicted.According to witnesses and video footage, no violence occurred as the motorcade passed, but a small group of people made the three-finger protest gesture and shouted slogans at the car carrying Queen Suthida, the wife of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.The calls for reform of the monarchy have galled conservative Thais. Royalists have stepped up their presence online and held a small rally Wednesday.Thailand’s Parliament is reconvening for a special session next week to deal with the political pressures of the protests. The government has also sought to censor reporting of the demonstrations, citing “distorted information” that could cause unrest and confusion, but the targeted outlets continued to broadcast Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-continue-rallies-ask-court-to-revoke-order/story-teJHGahO6Go3z2fbasB2mM.html
21-10-2020||World||Hurricane Epsilon, the tenth of a busy season, nears Bermuda||Hurricane Epsilon, the 10th of this very busy Atlantic season, was moving toward Bermuda on Wednesday.Epsilon is expected to make its closest approach to the island on Thursday night, and there is a risk of a direct impact, according to the US National Hurricane Centre. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Bermuda and residents have been urged to closely monitor the storm.Large swells generated by Epsilon are already affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and the Leeward Islands, and are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast of New England and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.The Miami-based hurricane centre said Epsilon had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) on Wednesday morning. The storm was located about 450 miles (725 kilometres) east-southeast of Bermuda, and was moving northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).This year’s hurricane season has had so many storms that the Hurricane Centre has turned to the Greek alphabet for storm names after running out of official names.Epsilon also represents a record for the earliest 26th named storm, arriving more than a month before a storm on November 22 in 2005, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-epsilon-the-tenth-of-a-busy-season-nears-bermuda/story-jfcjqBZIF75k1BHh4MZTkM.html
21-10-2020||World||China preparing PLA for long haul at LAC, upgrading weapons, logistics||China is rapidly upgrading infantry weaponry and logistical support for its border troops stationed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) amid the ongoing boundary tensions with India in eastern Ladakh, state media reported.The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Western Theatre Command (WAC), under which the long and disputed India-China border falls, is commissioning new and precision-based weapons and upgraded winter clothes and permanent barracks for its troops.The upgrades come in the backdrop of the months-long stand-off in eastern Ladakh, which has seen both sides amassing troops and equipment along the LAC.India has consistently opposed presence of PLA troops across LAC. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said last week that it presents a critical security challenge to India.“It has obviously had a very deep public impact and a very major political impact and it has left the relationship profoundly disturbed,” he said, referring to the large numbers of Chinese forces deployed at friction points on the LAC. “I haven’t got a reasonable explanation...from them [Chinese] on this matter,” he said, adding that the concentration of Chinese troops at the disputed border represented a “critical security challenge”.However, it seems clear that the PLA is equipping and readying itself for the long-haul in areas of Tibet and Xinjiang, which witnesses some of the harshest winters in the world.By all indications, even if the current border friction is resolved and troops disengage – even if partially – PLA troops are unlikely to fully pull back as they are expected to be prepared for the winter chill.Besides heavy artillery, the PLA is focussing on arming its soldiers with light, precision-based infantry weapons.The news comes as the two sides are set to hold the eighth round of military-diplomatic talks next week on disengagement in the Ladakh theatre.Read: The LAC is the new LoC | HT EditorialEarlier this week, the PLA Tibet Military Command announced that its soldiers, especially from special operation forces, will receive new QBU-191precision rifles with a 30-bullet magazine and variable long-distance magnification.The new gun is expected to replace the QBU-88 sniper rifle currently used by the troops, state media reported.The Tibetan plateau’s extreme cold will help test the rifle’s performance in extreme environments, collecting first-hand data for its future optimisation, state media reported.Earlier, this month the Tibet command also tested, for the first time, the latest “truck-based multiple rocket-propelled mine launchers” at high altitude.The drills were carried out at over 14,000 feet, state media reports said.Not only weapons, the PLA is also getting itself enough layers to keep its soldiers warm in the coming months.On Tuesday, the PLA Daily, the PLA’s official newspaper, reported that the powerful Central Military Commission – headed by President Xi Jinping – has commissioned specially-made quilts, tents, inner-wear and boots for Chinese border troops.These new sets of clothing can withstand temperatures as low as -40-degree centigrade.A Chinese clothing manufacturer which makes winter wear for China’s national mountaineering team members – including those climbing Mount Everest – has developed the new quilts and tents for PLA soldiers.“The clothing supplier urgently developed and produced a batch of new cold-proof quilts for the plateau border troops. This batch of materials is specially tailored for military officers and soldiers…good thermal insulation effect, and light overall material. They will be delivered to frontline officers and soldiers in the near future, providing strong guarantee for completing various training and duty tasks under extreme cold conditions,” the PLA Daily report said.Besides the tents and sleeping bags, the soldiers will soon have new cold-proof down jackets, boots and insulated inner-wear to withstand severe winter.The new barracks for PLA soldiers in the remote Ngari area of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) at nearly 15,000 feet come equipped with new technologies to conserve heat and are built to ensure more oxygen supply for troops.“While facilitating the daily life of officers and soldiers to the greatest extent, the new generation of plateau barracks also enhances the function of training and preparation for war,” the report added.Recently, the PLA’s Army Engineering University developed and handed over “ready-to-assemble” thermal shelters for border troops.The shelters comprising dormitories, canteens, washing rooms, toilets, warehouses, microgrids and heating equipment are expected to function in temperatures as low as -55 C and at an altitude over 15000 feet, the PLA Daily reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-preparing-pla-for-long-haul-at-lac-upgrading-weapons-logistics/story-lA8t5kSPnfMHjFkYrIMU4J.html

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has sought a detailed report of the incident from the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-killed-20-injured-in-explosion-in-pakistan/story-VotIdJ6ZzNKPvhL4SUIJfP.html
21-10-2020||World||Thailand anti-government protests explained||Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the world has been witnessing anti- government protests in Thailand for the past few months. Among other things, the protesters have been demanding reforms to the monarchy and the resignation of Thailand’s PM Prayuth Chan- ocha.Who are the protesters?Most of the protesters are young people and the protests have largely been leader- less much like the Hong- Kong protests. Some groups like Free Youth Movement, the United Front of Thammasat and Demonstration, Bad Student movement of highschoolers have been actively participating in the protests. The symbols used by the protesters are the “anti-coup” three-finger salute from The Hunger Games series, and gestures like hands crossed over the chest, and hands pointing above the head. Why are they protesting?The protests began last year after the disqualification of opposition politician Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit as a Member of Parliament after which a ban was put in place on his party Future Forward. The party was largely supported by the youth of Thailand. The pandemic halted the protests but they resumed again in July. Protesters are demanding the dissolution of parliament, PM’s resignation, constitutional changes to curb the power of the monarchy and an end to harassment of critics and dissenters.Why are the protesters angry with the King and the PM? The current ruler, Maha Vajiralongkorn, became king in December 2016. Prime Minister Chan-ocha came to power through a coup in 2014 that is said to be endorsed by the king. Protesters are also angry with the king as he spends most of his time in Europe and in 2017 increased his constitutional powers. A scrapping of the strict lese majeste law that protects the monarchy from any criticism is also being demanded by the protesters. What has been the government’s response to the protests?The government has continuously stymied the protests by using water cannons, banning gatherings of five or more people in Bangkok, banning publication of information about the protests and even blocking access to some websites. The government has also arrested several demonstrators but the protesters have only increased in numbers, thus creating a lot of pressure on the government and also on the monarchy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-anti-government-protests-explained/story-fj1imurm8vFZdn8BWm3HFI.html
21-10-2020||World||US Presidential Elections 2020: Donald Trump tends to his electoral map, Joe Biden prepping for debate||President Donald Trump is hopping from one must-win stop on the electoral map to the next in the leadup to a final presidential debate that may be his last, best chance to alter the trajectory of the 2020 campaign.Democrat Joe Biden has been taking the opposite approach, holing up for debate prep in advance of Thursday’s faceoff in Nashville, Tennessee. Trump, trailing in polls in most battleground states, stopped in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and was bound for North Carolina on Wednesday as he delivers what his campaign sees as his closing message.“This is an election between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression,” the president said in Erie, Pennsylvania. “You will have a depression the likes of which you have never seen.” He added: “If you want depression, doom and despair, vote for Sleepy Joe. And boredom.”But the Republican president’s pitch that he should lead the rebuilding of an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by a series of fights. In the last two days he has attacked the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and a venerable TV newsmagazine while suggesting that the country was tired of talking about a virus that has killed more than 221,000 people in the United States.Before leaving the White House for Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Trump taped part of an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” that apparently ended acrimoniously. On Twitter, the president declared his interview with Lesley Stahl to be “FAKE and BIASED,” and he threatened to release a White House edit of it before its Sunday airtime.Also trailing in fundraising for campaign ads, Trump is increasingly relying on his signature campaign rallies to maximize turnout among his GOP base. His trip to Pennsylvania on Tuesday was one of what is expected to be several visits to the state in the next two weeks.“If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” Trump said in Erie.Erie County, which includes the aging industrial city in the state’s northwest corner, went for President Barack Obama by 5 percentage points in 2012 but broke for Trump by 2 in 2016. That swing, fueled by Trump’s success with white, working-class, non-college-educated voters, was replicated in small cities and towns and rural areas and helped him overcome Hillary Clinton’s victories in the state’s big cities.But Trump will probably need to run up the score by more this time around as his prospects have slipped since 2016 in vote-rich suburban Philadelphia, where he underperformed by past Republican measures. This raises the stakes for his campaign’s more aggressive outreach to new rural and small-town voters across the industrial north.His aides worry that his opponent is uniquely situated to prevent that, as Biden not only hails from Scranton but has built his political persona as a representative of the middle and working classes.Trump, who spoke for less than an hour, showed the crowd a video of various Biden comments on fracking in a bid to portray the Democrat as opposed to the process. The issue is critical in a state that is the second leading producer of natural gas in the country. Biden’s actual position is that he would ban new gas and oil permits, including for fracking, on federal lands only. The vast majority of oil and gas does not come from federal lands.Three weeks of wrangling over the debate format and structure appeared to have subsided after the Commission on Presidential Debates came out with procedures meant to reduce the chaotic interruptions that plagued the first Trump-Biden encounter last month.This time, Trump and Biden will each have his microphone cut off while his rival delivers an opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics, the commission announced. The mute button won’t figure in the open discussion portion of the debate.Trump was to have been joined in Erie by first lady Melania Trump, in what would have been her first public appearance since she and the president were sickened with Covid-19. But her chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham, said Tuesday that Mrs. Trump has a lingering cough and would not accompany the president.As Trump was on the road, Biden was meeting at his lakeside home in Wilmington, Delaware, with senior adviser Ron Klain, who is in charge of debate preparation. Also on hand: a group of aides that the campaign has purposely kept small to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.Biden, who taped his own interview with “60 Minutes” on Monday at a theater near his home, had no public events Tuesday or Wednesday and wasn’t scheduled to travel — except to the debate — on Thursday. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, was out campaigning, and he was expected to receive a late boost from Obama, who was to host an event Wednesday in Philadelphia.Biden is now tested about every two days for the coronavirus and has never been found to be positive. He suggested before last week’s planned second debate in Miami that the proceedings shouldn’t happen if Trump was still testing positive for Covid-19 after contracting the virus earlier in the month.The candidates instead held dueling town halls on separate networks after the commission said the debate should occur virtually, citing safety concerns, and Trump rejected the idea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2020-donald-trump-tends-to-his-electoral-map-joe-biden-prepping-for-debate/story-n9tljYPrRdEowRGyRCdgOI.html
21-10-2020||World||FATF needs to take hard look at Pakistan to ensure it comply with terror-related obligation: Report||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) needs to take a hard and objective look at Pakistan’s attempts to leverage “nuisance value” to ensure that the country fully complies with terror financing and money laundering obligations before it can be de-listed, Global Watch Analysis reported.The FATF, the global money-laundering and terror-financing watchdog, is holding its plenary session from October 21 where it will decide the fate of Pakistan. The country is in grey-list since 2018. Early this month, the FATF’s Asia Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering has kept Pakistan on “Enhanced Follow-up List” for its slow progress on the technical recommendations of the FATF to fight terror financing. Pakistan’s progress has remained unchanged -- non-compliant on four counts.According to a report by Roland Jacquard, Chairman of Roland Jacquard Global Security Consulting (RJGSC), published in Global Watch Analysis, the APG’s latest report of September 2020, based on the evaluation conducted after a year, Pakistan’s report card remained more or less unchanged with the country being able to move one of its partially compliant parameters to fully compliant.“The APG has a stringent set of monitoring processes while evaluating a country’s compliance with AML/CFT measures. It has a scale of 40 parameters based on which it prepares its evaluation report on any country. These parameters range from the presence of effective laws and supervision to prevent terror financing or money laundering to identifying non-profit organisations that act as fronts for terror groups,” he said. “In Pakistan’s case, the APG, in its Mutual Evaluation Report in October 2019 had found the country compliant on 1, non-compliant on 4, partially compliant on 26 and largely compliant on 9 of these 40 parameters. In the APG’s latest report of September 2020, based on the evaluation conducted after a year, Pakistan’s report card remained more or less unchanged with the country being able to move 1 of its partially compliant parameters to fully compliant,” he added.Jacquard said that the APG is a non-political body and its opinion is not binding on the final decision of the FATF, adding that the FATF’s Joint Group Progress Report of October 2020 has taken a more “lenient stance” on Pakistan.Pakistan is in the FATF’s grey list since June 2018 and the government was given a final warning in February to complete the remaining action points by June 2020. Another review meeting will be held later this month.The FATF extended the June deadline to September due to the spread of coronavirus that disrupted the FATF plenary meetings.The country is facing the difficult task of clearing its name from the FATF grey list. As things stand, Islamabad is finding it difficult to shield terror perpetrators and implement the FATF action plan at the same time.In recent weeks, Pakistan has been trying to paint a picture that it has started the reforms, including the passing of some Bills in order to prevent blacklisting by the FATF.In late July, Pakistan Financial Monitoring Unit Director-general Lubna Farooq told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that the country is yet to comply with 13 conditions out of the 27-point Action Plan of the FATF, including curbing terror financing, enforcement of the laws against the proscribed organisations and improving the legal systems. Jacquard said the reason for the FATF leniency is Trump administration’s hurry to leave Afghanistan and therefore its dependence on Pakistan to convince the Taliban for an honourable exit.“However, since the APG is a non-political body, its opinion is not binding on the final decision of the FATF. As a result, despite APG’s recent evaluation, the FATF’s Joint Group Progress Report of October 2020 has taken a more lenient stance on Pakistan,” he writes.“As per this group’s assessment, Pakistan has fully complied with 21 of the 27 action points and more or less complied with the remaining 6, thereby indicating that it was more or less on the path of being de-listed. The reasons for this tempered position on Pakistan can only be speculated. The most obvious reason is the Trump administration’s hurry to leave Afghanistan and therefore its dependence on Pakistan to convince the Taliban for an honourable exit,” he adds.Jacquard said that the important institutions like the FATF should not be allowed to be pressured into taking a decision based on political considerations.“Whatever may be the case, important institutions like the FATF should not be allowed to be pressured into taking a decision based on political considerations, especially when the ground situation in Pakistan tells an alarming story,” he noted.A closer look at the Pakistan-based social media accounts conveys a different tale of UN proscribed Pakistani terrorist groups like the Jaish-e-Muhammad, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and their leaders being allowed freedom of movement and activity in the country, Jacquard highlighted.While these groups openly collect fund in the name of jihad, the Pakistan government tries to convince the FATF that its recently passed Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism laws were evidence of its commitment to act against terror groups, he said. “The FATF, therefore, needs to take a hard and objective look at Pakistan’s attempts to leverage its nuisance value, in the larger interest of preserving its credibility as a global financial watchdog and ensure that Islamabad fully complies with terror financing and money laundering obligations before it can be de-listed. In this connection, one is reminded of the case of Iceland that was ‘greylisted’ for lesser infractions and took more than a year to get delisted,” he concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-needs-to-take-hard-look-at-pakistan-to-ensure-it-comply-with-terror-related-obligation-report/story-ZSReY76NMn92xHAmmMufjP.html

It suggests that ‘long Covid’ affects around 10% of 18 to 49-year-olds who become unwell with the virus.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “The findings from researchers at King’s College London are stark and this should be a sharp reminder to the public – including to young people – that Covid-19 is indiscriminate and can have long-term and potentially devastating effects”.“The more people take risks by meeting up in large groups or not social distancing, the more the wider population will suffer, and the more cases of ‘long Covid’ we will see. The powerful new film we’re releasing today…should act as a stark reminder to us all,” he added.New figures as part of the ‘Hands, Face, Space’ campaign reveal uncertainty around how long it takes to recover from the virus.Over a third of people (34%) believe symptoms disappear after four weeks, while 1 in 5 (20%) of the 18 to 34 age group stated they thought this would take two weeks. Over a third (31%) of the same respondents admitted they are unsure how long it would take to recover from the symptoms.Nearly a third (29%) of people aged between 18 to 34 said they were not aware it is possible to have the virus without displaying symptoms, meaning many people could also be at risk of acting as a ‘carrier’ and passing it on to vulnerable family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-covid-can-affect-the-fit-and-young-warns-uk/story-9Aux1upBmhyDgbWAcSaRnN.html

He shook hands and leaned in to chat privately with each one.While the clerics wore masks while seated during the audience, all but one took his mask off to speak to the pope. Only one kept it on, and by the end of his tete-a-tete with Francis, had lowered it under his chin.Vatican regulations now require facemasks to be worn indoors and out where distancing can’t be “always guaranteed.” The Vatican hasn’t responded to questions about why the pope wasn’t following either Vatican regulations or basic public health measures to prevent Covid-19.Francis explained to the audience why he didn’t plunge into the crowd at the start of the audience as he usually would do. But he said his distance from them was for their own well-being, to prevent crowds from forming around him.“I’m sorry for this, but it’s for your own safety,” he said. “Rather than get close to you, shake your hands and greet you, I greet you from far away. But know that I’m close to you with my heart.”He didn’t address his decision to forego wearing a mask.Francis did, however, wear a white face mask throughout an interreligious prayer service in downtown Rome on Tuesday, removing it only to speak. He had previously only been seen wearing one once before as he entered and exited his car in a Vatican courtyard on Sept. 9. Italian law requires masks indoors and out.At 83 and with part of a lung removed when he was in his 20s due to illness, the pope would be at high risk for Covid-19 complications. He has urged the faithful to comply with government mandates to protect public health.In the past week, 11 Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Francis lives have tested positive.In Italy, coronavirus cases are surging, with the Lazio region around Vatican City among the hardest hit. Lazio has more people hospitalized and in intensive care than any other region except Italy’s most populous and hardest-hit region, Lombardy.Inside the Vatican auditorium Wednesday, the crowd wore masks as did the Swiss Guards. But Francis and his two aides didn’t.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-reverts-back-to-mask-less-old-ways-at-indoor-audience/story-jxLYZIBpTeBRSLongtIkhL.html
21-10-2020||World||Spain’s parliament debates no-confidence vote to oust govt||Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is facing a no-confidence debate in parliament brought by the nation’s far-right Vox party, but it appears the maneuver lacks the necessary votes to topple the government.The parliament is hearing arguments for and against the motion on Wednesday before a vote scheduled for Thursday. Vox argues that Sánchez’s government must depart for what the party says is the poor handling of the pandemic by authorities.If the no-confidence vote were to succeed, it would replace the current left-wing coalition government with one led by Vox leader Santiago Abascal.The leading opposition party, the conservative Popular Party, however, has already said it won’t back Vox. Without the Popular Party’s votes, the motion has no chance.“With victims, outbreaks and infections, the truth is that this no-confidence motion is a waste of time,” Popular Party secretary-general Teodoro García Egea said before the start of the debate.Many observers of Spanish politics consider the no-confidence vote as a way for the upstart Vox to put more pressure on the Popular Party. The Popular Party has been very critical of Sánchez, but Vox’s rise in recent years has come at the expense of the Spain’s traditional right-wing force. Now it must choose between one adversary or the other.Spain is set to become the first country in Western Europe to reach 1 million reported infections of the virus. The country has confirmed more than 34,000 deaths from COVID-19, but experts say the true death toll has likely been impossible to record because of a shortage of tests in the first weeks of the health crisis.“Sánchez’s government is the worst in the world that has faced the coronavirus,” Abascal told the parliament’s lower house. He said that the current government is the “worst in 80 years of (Spanish) history” signaling his preference for the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco that ruled from the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939 to after his death in 1975.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-s-parliament-debates-no-confidence-vote-to-oust-govt/story-tAvOFt3CM30U39zn5DhE8O.html
21-10-2020||World||Trump says he could be ‘king’ of all fundraisers, slams Biden for being ‘servant’ of lobbyists||Joe Biden is a “servant” of lobbyists and “Washington vultures” who got rich by bleeding America dry, US President Donald Trump has claimed while responding to his Democratic rival’s unprecedented fundraising in September, asserting that he could be the “king” of all fundraisers, but does not want to do it.Biden raised a whopping USD 383 million for his election effort in September, a record-breaking sum that eclipses the unprecedented fundraising from the previous month. “He (Biden) is a servant of the globalist, lobbyist, wealthy donors, and Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know I said the other day… I never thought of it because they’re raising a lot of money, (USD) 300 million. I could be the king of all fundraisers. I would be the greatest that ever lived the president of the United States,” Trump alleged at an election rally here on Tuesday.Biden holds a massive cash advantage over Trump in the last leg of the campaign, The Hill newspaper reported, citing latest figures from the Federal Election Commission.Biden has over USD 177 million in the bank, compared with USD 63.1 million for the president.In September, Biden raised USD 383 million, while Trump raised USD 247.8 million. The month before, Biden raised a then-record of USD 364.5 million, compared with USD 210 million for the president, the report said. “All I have to do - give me a list of the top 100 companies. I’ll call the president of everyone. They will pay me whatever I want. I would set every record. The problem is I owe them. Because when they call and have a problem for a lot more money than we’re talking about you know, it’s like hard to say no. Hey, they were nice. They treated you good,” he said.“I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do that. We don’t need the money. I don’t’ want to do that. I don’t want to do it. But when you see them raise USD 300, 350 million in a month and a half, you know deals are being made- just so you understand. Deals are being made. Big deals. Look at the deals that he is making for himself. Deals are being made,” Trump said. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this depraved political establishment and elect an outsider as president who is finally putting America first, he said. “The fact is whether you like it or not, whether you want to hear it or not, Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. He is a corrupt politician. And smoking gun emails show that the Biden family sold the Vice Presidency for a very, very substantial amount of money. More money than anybody would believe. He let China plunder our jobs while his family raked in millions of dollars from China and foreign nations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-could-be-king-of-all-fundraisers-slams-biden-for-being-servant-of-lobbyists/story-Q6FtuLmF1jCEaHRgJfITWI.html
21-10-2020||World||Five takeaways from US government’s lawsuit against Google||The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google alleging antitrust violations marks the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. The lawsuit claims Google has abused its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and harm consumers.Here are five things to know about the lawsuit and what might be coming down the line.GOVERNMENT BRANDS GOOGLE A MONOPOLY After years of hemming and hawing over the matter, the U.S. government has now formally described Google as an illegal monopolist.Just being a monopolist isn’t illegal. And that’s been good for Google, since it dominates roughly 90 per cent of the market for internet searches. But abuse of monopoly can easily land a company in trouble.The Justice Department went there, calling Google a “monopoly gatekeeper for the internet” that has used “anticompetitive tactics” to maintain and extend monopolies in both search and search ads. The lawsuit alleges that Google stifled competition and innovation from smaller upstarts and harmed consumers by reducing the quality and variety of search options — and that the company also uses its monopoly money to lock in its favorable position on smartphones and in browsers.GOOGLE: FREE! FREE IS GOOD! YOU LIKE FREE! Unsurprisingly, Google sees this differently. The company argues that its services are useful and beneficial to consumers, that they face ample competition and that they’ve unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives.What’s more, those services are free for consumers to use, at least in monetary terms. What Google doesn’t often remind its users is that it’s handsomely reimbursed by all the search ads it runs on behalf of outside advertisers, which it targets using the personal information its users hand over, often unknowingly, while taking advantage of its “free” services.Google also emphasises that its services hold down the cost of smartphones and that its lucrative exclusive deals to make Google Search the default on many phones — what the government calls its “exclusionary agreements” — don’t stop users from changing to rival search engines if they want to.Also Read | How Google evolved from ‘cuddly’ startup to antitrust targetDO POLITICS LURK BEHIND THE CASE? From the timing of the case to its co-plaintiffs, the Justice Department’s lawsuit raises unanswered questions about the politics behind the move. For starters, there’s the fact that it filed the suit exactly two weeks before Election Day, a time when most administrations generally try to avoid making splashy moves for fear of being seen as attempting to influence elections.It also did so in conjunction with just 11 states, all of whom have Republican attorneys general, despite the fact that all 50 states kicked off an investigation of Google roughly a year ago.The attorneys general of New York, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah released a statement Monday saying they have not concluded their investigation into Google and would want to consolidate their case with the Justice Department’s if they decide to file.GOOGLE AS THE NEW MICROSOFT The case against Google bears a strong resemblance to one the government brought 22 years ago against the Goliath of the time: Microsoft. But Google’s days as the fledgling startup looking to “do no evil” are long behind it.Back then, Google cast itself as the underdog fighting against a technological bully. The Justice Department’s Google case today revolves around the company bundling products around its dominant position in search — much like the 1998 case against Microsoft revolved around its bundling of other products around Windows.Tuesday’s lawsuit notes that back then, Google claimed Microsoft’s practices were anticompetitive, “and yet now, Google deploys the same playbook to sustain its own monopolies.” Also Read | US says Google breakup may be needed to end violations of antitrust lawGoogle sniped back in its own response to the lawsuit. “This isn’t the dial-up 1990s, when changing services was slow and difficult, and often required you to buy and install software with a CD-ROM,” the company said in a blog post. “Today, you can easily download your choice of apps or change your default settings in a matter of seconds.” ADVERTISERS AS ... THE VICTIMS? Google will hold more than 29 per cent of the U.S. digital advertising market by the end of this year, with Facebook following second with 24 per cent and Amazon third, according to research firm eMarketer. But that’s all digital ads — in search ads only, Google is by far the heavy, holding nearly three-quarters of the market.This, the DOJ argues, unfairly shuts out any would-be competitors, and can leave advertisers themselves with subpar service and few alternatives.The lawsuit charges that Google’s “exclusionary” conduct stifles competition in search advertising, thus harming advertisers. By suppressing competition, Google has more power to manipulate the “quantity of ad inventory auction dynamics” — that is, how much advertisers pay for their ads — in ways that allow the company to charge advertisers more than it could in a competitive market, the lawsuit says.Plus, Google can also offer businesses lower-quality ad services if it wants to, the lawsuit argues — for instance, by restricting the information it provides them on their own marketing campaigns. Without viable competition, who’s to stop it?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-takeaways-from-us-government-s-lawsuit-against-google/story-NaIQBFS8F2vPjXJJRfqu8N.html

In the May 2014 email, Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi asked Hunter Biden to “use [his] influence” to support the Ukrainian company politically. In another email, dated April 2015, he thanked Biden Jr. for arranging a meeting with his father for him.The emails were allegedly sourced from the hard drive of Hunter Biden’s damaged personal laptop that was dropped off for repairs at a local store in his home state of Delaware. If proven to be authentic, they would challenge Joe Biden’s campaign claims that he had never had anything to do with his son’s business dealings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-has-hunter-biden-laptop-does-not-believe-emails-tied-to-russia-reports/story-BU7XX0viZr2j96PPBFzhJP.html

The country received a first batch of the Russian “Sputnik-V” coronavirus vaccine in early October as part of the Phase Three clinical trial, and the government said about 2,000 volunteers would participate. The delivery was the first in Latin America. Maduro in September proposed administering the Russian coronavirus vaccine to nearly 15,000 candidates in upcoming legislative elections so that they could campaign safely.Venezuela has strengthened diplomatic ties with Russia amid an aggressive sanctions program by the United States meant to force Maduro from office.In August, Russia licensed a vaccine for Covid-19 after less than two months of human testing, an achievement celebrated by Moscow but questioned by several experts.But Russia is so confident in its Covid-19 vaccine that it will shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong, rather than requiring buyers to take on the full risk, the head of the state fund bankrolling the project told Reuters. In Venezuela there are more than 87,000 coronavirus cases and about 747 deaths, according to official data. But medical associations say the number of infections is likely higher.

21-10-2020||World||Less carbon, more electric vehicles: Automakers prepare for potential Joe Biden win||Automakers are gearing up for tough new vehicle emissions rules and policies favoring electric vehicles if Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins the White House. Biden and US President Donald Trump both need the votes of auto workers in Midwestern swing states such as Michigan and Ohio, and both say they want automakers to create more auto jobs in the United States, rather than Mexico or China.From there, Trump’s and Biden’s policies for autos and transportation diverge, presenting automakers with very different sets of risks and rewards. If elected, Biden is expected to quickly reinstate the legal basis for California’s zero-emission vehicle rules and begin the process of reversing the Trump administration’s decision to ease fuel efficiency and carbon emission requirements through 2025. Automakers could also face sharply higher penalties for failing to meet fuel-efficiency requirements. The Trump administration rolled back those penalties, which the industry said saved at least $1 billion in annual compliance costs, but a federal appeals court in August reversed the administration action. However, Biden’s positions offer the auto industry some offsetting gains. Under Trump, the White House rejected new tax credits for electric vehicles while making it easier to sell gas-guzzling SUVs. Biden promises new tax incentives including rebates to buy EVs and a dramatic expansion of charging stations for electric vehicles - policy measures automakers have long advocated. Days after Trump won the 2016 election, the trade group representing major automakers in Washington called on him to reconsider fuel-efficiency standards proposed by the outgoing Obama administration, and backed by California and other coastal states. Now, the industry is divided. Ford Motor Co

The organisers of the rally, the joint opposition front Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), had alleged that the arrest came after Pakistan paramilitary abducted Punjab local police chief and made him register cases against Awan and 200 others including Maryam Nawaz for sloganeering at the mausoleum of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.The probe order came after more than 20 senior-most officers of the provincial police force, including the police chief, decided to go on leave to protest against the abduction and the demoralising effect the action had on the police force.After the inquiry was ordered, police chief Mushtaq Mahar said he would be taking back his leave application and urged his colleagues to do the same and instead wait for the outcome of the inquiry.Awan’s arrest came hours after Maryam addressed the PDM’s protest rally, targeting the administration of Prime Minister Imran Khan.“Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt. Safdar,” Maryam had tweeted. Safdar was charged with “violating the sanctity of the mausoleum” of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Karachi. The police action reportedly came after Khurram Sherzaman, a member of Imran Khan’s ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Party, lodged complaints against Maryam and Safdar at a local police station in Karachi.PTI leaders were reportedly angered by “slogans raised at the mausoleum” targeting Khan’s administration. Video clips circulating on social media apparently showed Safdar and several others chanting slogans from the inner circle of the mausoleum. Political activities are banned inside the mausoleum and its immediate surroundings.Earlier on Sunday, Maryam, her husband and PML-N supporters had visited the mausoleum to offer prayers ahead of the PDM’s rally that was held in Karachi’s Jinnah ground, located near the mausoleum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-chief-orders-probe-into-kidnap-of-police-chief-to-force-arrest-of-nawaz-sharif-s-son-in-law/story-9g7Sfb2bFPqp3o0AJjzakN.html
21-10-2020||World||Donald Trump and the strongmen: How US leader fell for autocrats||He “fell in love” with Kim Jong Un, praises Vladimir Putin and calls Recep Tayyip Erdogan “a friend”: President Donald Trump’s flattery of autocrats has confounded US allies and raised questions about his regard for democratic norms.But analysts expect America’s traditional friendships to be restored in a post-Trump era, saying his fascination with unfettered power is a personality quirk that has not translated into an official change in foreign policy.“He’s psychologically terrified by weakness,” Peter Trumbore, professor of political science at Oakland University in Michigan said.Trump’s attraction to power was on display long before he won the White House on a promise to “make America great again.”In a 1990 interview with Playboy magazine, the billionaire property developer declared that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped end the Cold War, had “not a firm enough hand” with pro-democracy demonstrators.Three decades later, he continues to lavish praise on leaders who wield power ruthlessly while bashing longtime democratic allies such as Canada and Germany.In a recording, the US president admitted he was fond of authoritarian leaders, telling journalist Bob Woodward the “tougher and meaner” they are, “the better I get along with them.”‘President for life’ In 2017, he threatened dictator Kim Jong Un with “fire and fury” if “Little Rocket Man” endangered the US, only to shake his hand in a historic visit to North Korea two years later.While Trump’s outreach to Kim won plaudits, his assessment that the mercurial North Korean, who is accused of gross human rights violations, had a “great and beautiful vision for his country” was met with widespread derision. With China too, his message has swung wildly, lurching between tough talking on trade and the spread of Covid-19, to praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping after China’s ruling party abolished term limits in 2018.“He’s now president for life... I think it’s great,” Trump declared.While some surmised the remark was made in jest it chimed with the warm words he has had for Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has also steadily increased his own powers and whom Trump calls a “friend.”But it is the Republican’s relationship with Russia’s Putin that has attracted the most attention, in light of claims that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s chances, allegations which Russia denies.At a summit with Putin in 2018, Trump appeared bowled over by the former secret services chief, saying he believed him over the FBI on the allegations of campaign interference, and describing his counterpart as “very, very strong.”‘Real man’ rule For Trumbore, it’s plain to see: Trump is “envious of the power these strongmen wield”.“When he sees Erdogan or (Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor) Orban he sees democratically elected presidents who have essentially used institutions of democracy to turn their states into soft authoritarian regimes. I think Trump wants that for himself.”Charles Kupchan, professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, also ascribed Trump’s rapport with autocrats to envy, tinged with “a certain macho inclination.” “He probably likes that Putin rides a horse without a shirt on and appears like a ‘real man’,” Kupchan said.The Trump administration argues he has made America safer by cultivating ties with longtime foes.But analysts say his approach has yet to show results.For Maud Quessard, a US specialist at the Institute for Strategic Research in Paris, Trump’s message is chiefly aimed at “showing his electorate that he is a strong president.” The leader who campaigned as a deal maker extraordinaire lacks the patience needed for diplomatic success in Kupchan’s view.“Diplomatic breakthroughs do not come when two leaders sit down together with no preparation. They come through years of hard work and preparation.”“With North Korea, none of that happened. It went nowhere”.Meanwhile, relations with old allies in continental Europe took a beating, with Trump cheering Britain’s decision to quit the EU and claiming the union was created merely “to take advantage of the United States”.For Brooks Spector, a former US diplomat based in South Africa, the main risk of a second Trump term “would be a greater confusion” on the international stage.“What are the goals of the US policy? What are the expectations? What does the US realistically expect from Iran, Russia, with its trade disputes with China? “There’s a lot of head scratching in world capitals about what exactly the US wants to see happen. People look for the strategy or tactics and they don’t seem to find it very easily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-and-the-strongmen-how-us-leader-fell-for-autocrats/story-h8HdkLqboEofRjOBWXBdrN.html
21-10-2020||World||Kamala Harris turns 56, Joe Biden says will celebrate her next birthday at White House||Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris turned 56 on Tuesday, with the party’s presidential nominee Joe Biden greeting her on the big day, saying they would celebrate her next birthday at the White House. Biden took to Twitter to post a photograph showing their hands clasped together. “Happy Birthday, Kamala Harris. Next year, let’s celebrate with some ice cream at the White House,” tweeted Biden, who had in August picked her as his running mate. If elected, she would be the first-ever woman vice president of the United States. Biden will celebrate his 78th birthday next month. Harris in a tweet said her birthday wish is that everybody should go out and vote. “My birthday wish this year? For everyone to go vote,” she said. October 20 also happens to be the birthday of her niece, Meena Harris. “I couldn’t let the day go by without wishing my niece, Meena, a happy birthday too!” she said. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Kamala Harris on her birthday. “In two weeks, we could call this birthday girl Madam Vice President,” said Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate as she asked people to go out and vote. “Happy bday to @KamalaHarris. ! Celebrate this big day by voting for the #BidenHarris ticket and Democrats up and down the ballot,” said Sabrina Singh, the Democratic vice presidential nominee’s spokesperson. “Happy birthday, @KamalaHarris! Hope you’re showered with love on your special day,” tweeted former First Lady Michelle Obama. “The best way to celebrate Kamala is by making sure you’re registered and have a plan to vote at http://iwillvote.com. And once you do, share how you’re voting with us!” she said. Later in the evening, Harris held a virtual fundraiser with Senators Tom Udall, Congressmen Ruben Gallego, Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords. “Joe and I are so proud of the fact that we have built one of the broadest coalitions that we have ever seen, bringing together of course Democrats and independents and Republicans, bringing together leaders across the spectrum including, I have to say the great Cindy McCain, and so many others who are standing up saying. ‘look, we got to fight for our country,” Harris said in her remarks during the virtual fund raiser. Harris also participated in a virtual Milwaukee rally to kick off the first day of in-person early voting in Wisconsin. Former Second Lady Jill Biden tweeted a “happy birthday” graphic overlapping a photo of hers with Harris. Husband Doug Emhoff sent her birthday wish on Instagram. “Blind date, love at first sight, marriage, family, and an incredible life together. Through it all, no matter what, she is ALWAYS there for me and our family without hesitation. Happy Birthday to my amazing wife @kamalaharris!” “And her birthday wish...VOTE EARLY!” Emhoff also reminded people of her wife’s wish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-turns-56-joe-biden-says-will-celebrate-her-next-birthday-at-white-house/story-tU6Mr8I8FkNxaeJef3Z3qN.html
21-10-2020||World||India, US will hold third 2+2 ministerial meeting in New Delhi next week||India and the US will hold their third 2+2 ministerial meeting in New Delhi next week, US secretary of defence Mark Esper said on Tuesday.He did not rule out the possibility that the two sides may sign a widely anticipated maritime information sharing agreement.Esper and secretary of state Mike Pompeo will travel to New Delhi for day-long in-person meetings, a rare but significant departure given the Covid-19 pandemic and the global shift to virtual interactions, with their Indian counterparts Rajnath Singh and S Jaishankar on October 27.Separately, a bipartisan group of 14 US senators jointly expressed “strong support” for India’s decision to formally invite Australia to the upcoming Malabar naval exercises with the US and Japan saying it’s an “invaluable” move from an operational perspective and of “symbolic” importance.“Secretary Pompeo and I will be there next week,” Esper said at Atlantic Council, a think tank, responding to a question about the upcoming 2+2. “It’s our second two plus two with the Indians, the third ever for the United States and India and it’s very important.”When pressed on the maritime information sharing agreement that has been widely reportedly to be on the agenda, Esper said, “We have a number of things we’ve been discussing with the Indians for, for some time w’ve made good progress on a number of them but we’ll release information on that when it’s appropriate.”This will be the third edition of the India-US 2+2 that started with India hosting the first in 2018 in New Delhi; the United States hosted the second in Washington DC in 201.9.An official announcement with details of the meetings and agenda was expected shortly. The two countries are also reported to sign BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) on sharing of geospatial information, considered the fourth and last of the foundational agreements.Speaking broadly of ties with India, Esper said India will be “the most consequential partner for us, I think, in the Indo-Pacific for sure, in the century,” noting “they face off every day, the Chinese aggression in the Himalayas, specifically along that line of actual control”.Of significant developments in the defence sector in the last one year, Esper listed out the first-ever tri-service military exercise – TIGER TRIUMPH – with India, USS Nimitz’s drills with the Indian Navy and the first ever US-India defence cyber dialogue in September.“As we expand our collaboration into new domains. Together, these efforts will strengthen what may become one of the most consequential partnerships of the 21st century,” he said.His strong endorsement of ties with India came as14 US senators jointly commended India’s invitation to Australia, in a jointly signed letter to Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US.“We write in strong support of India’s decision to formally invite Australia to participate in the annual Exercise Malabar,” the senators wrote. “From an operational perspective, the addition of such a uniquely capable and stalwart partner, like Australia, to this naval exercise is invaluable, providing increased interoperability, strengthening threat assessment abilities and enhancing the maritime roles and missions of the four naval powers. Equally important, they said, was the “symbolic nature” of the development marking the first time the four countries will engage collectively at the military level since the formation of the Quad and the Quad-plus-Singapore naval exercises held in September 2007.The signatories were John Corny and Mark Warner, the Republican and Democratic co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus and Republicans Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, David Perdue, James Lankford, Josh Hawley, Dan Sullivan, Marsha Blackburn, Kelly Loeffler, Martha McSally, Thom Tillis and Kevin Cramer and the second Democrat Chris Coon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-will-hold-third-2-2-ministerial-meeting-in-new-delhi-next-week/story-JEeq0GnVdpSiSHajVipHIP.html

21-10-2020||World||India returns Chinese soldier who crossed Line of Actual Control: Chinese military||India on Wednesday handed over the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldier detained after he had crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh on Sunday, the Chinese military said. He was handed over to Chinese border troops early on Wednesday, PLA said in a brief statement.“According to the relevant agreement between China and India, a Chinese soldier who was requested by the herders to help find a lost yak was handed over to the Chinese border troops by the Indian side in the early morning of October 21,” said the statement released by the PLA Daily on social media.The PLA had confirmed late on Monday one of its soldiers had gone “missing” along the LAC on Sunday night and had requested the Indian army to return him according to protocol.The Indian army on Monday said it had apprehended a Chinese soldier, identified as a corporal, in eastern Ladakh’s Demchok sector after he had strayed across the LAC.It had also received a request from the PLA enquiring about the whereabouts of the soldier.The incident comes amid the ongoing border tension with China in eastern Ladakh, where both sides have carried out heavy deployment of soldiers and military equipment.Issuing a statement on the missing PLA soldier on Monday night, spokesperson of the Western Theatre Command, Col Zhang Shuili said the soldier went missing while looking for lost yaks on the evening of October 18 – he did not identify the soldier.“After the incident, Chinese border guards took the initiative to report the situation to the Indian side as soon as possible and hoped that the Indian side would assist in search and rescue,” Zhang said in the statement.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing on Tuesday that China hopes India hands over the soldier as soon as possible and works with China to promote the implementation of the consensus reached at the 7th round of talks.“India’s move (of returning the soldier) is a goodwill gesture ahead of the eighth round talks,” Sun Shihai, an expert at the South Asia Research Center of Sichuan University, told the Global Times.In September, Chinese state media had branded as spies five Indians who had strayed across the border in Arunachal Pradesh and were detained by the PLA. The five civilian porters from the Tagin tribe of Arunachal Pradesh went missing early September.Ahead of their release in the second week of September, state-run nationalistic tabloid, Global Times claimed in a report that five were “spies” working for the Indian army.The five had disguised themselves as “hunters”, the report said, quoting an anonymous source, adding that they were “India’s intelligence staff”.“They recently trespassed the China-India border and entered the Shannan prefecture of Tibet,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-returns-chinese-soldier-who-crossed-line-of-actual-control-chinese-military/story-10x9eZgN3gWXZj4nwa9ERN.html
21-10-2020||World||Canada PM Trudeau puts fate of government on line with call for confidence vote||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday put the fate of his Liberal government on the line, saying an opposition push to probe how Ottawa is tackling the coronavirus would be put to a confidence vote on Wednesday.The Liberals, who only won a minority of seats in an October 2019 election, need backing from another party to survive. Trudeau’s fate depends on the left-leaning New Democrats, whose leader Jagmeet Singh said he had no interest in a vote.“I will not give the Prime Minister an excuse to plunge the country into an election. My goal is to help people and I will continue doing that,” said Singh, who nevertheless did not say how his party would vote on Wednesday.The Liberals are under attack from the official opposition Conservatives, who allege some of the more than C$200 billion ($152.5 billion) handed out in coronavirus aid programs has been misspent.The Conservatives want to create a committee to examine what they call the government’s ethical problems. One area of focus is payments to Trudeau’s wife and mother by a charity chosen to manage a student grant program.Trudeau, who insists he does not want an early election, said the mandate of the proposed committee showed the opposition had lost confidence in him. There is some speculation in Ottawa that he wants to go to voters before some of the expensive aid programs are wound down. But a Canadian Broadcasting Corp aggregate tracker of recent opinion polls put the Liberals at 36.5% public support, with the Conservatives at 30.8%, which strongly suggests another minority for Trudeau.“The opposition is going to have to decide whether they want to make this minority parliament work or whether they have lost confidence in the government,” said Trudeau, who is proposing a committee with a broader mandate to probe the response to a pandemic that has killed 9,778 people in Canada.Singh told reporters he had his own suggestions on how the committee should work and said the two sides were close.But he also blasted Trudeau’s stance as ludicrous and farcical, and accused the Prime Minister of seeking an election while blaming the opposition. The vote is set for around 3:15 p.m. Eastern (1915 GMT).Conservative leader Erin O’Toole - who must decide whether he wants to continue his efforts - earlier told reporters that what he called a misuse of funds should be probed.The Canadian dollar was little changed on the news. It had earlier edged higher against the greenback as investors weighed the prospects for U.S. economic stimulus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-pm-trudeau-puts-fate-of-government-on-line-with-call-for-confidence-vote/story-jVzNqIyKFkwkH5lxdTqQXO.html
21-10-2020||World||What is ‘human challenge’ that UK cleared to speed up Covid-19 vaccine trial?||After mulling over the idea for a few days, the UK government on October 20 has given a go-ahead to start ‘human challenge’ trial so that an effective vaccine can be produced at the earliest. The concept of human challenge trial is not new, but it remains controversial as participants in such a trial are injected with the virus.Here is all you need to know about human challenge trial and UK’s plan:1. Amid the ongoing pandemic, the race for a fast and effective vaccine has now become intense. Russia has become the first country to have announced its vaccine against Covid-19, which has been tested amid a small number of people before its registration, which is why questions over the efficacy of the vaccines remain. The United Kingdom is also leaving no stones unturned to become a frontrunner in this race.2. UK’s human challenge trial plan has an investment of 33.6 million pound from the National Health Services.3. Under this programme, the participants will first be administered a vaccine candidate that has proven safe so far. Then they will be exposed to the Covid-19 virus in a safe and controlled environment. The participants will be monitored by researchers who will thus explore how the vaccine is working, how much virus can infect a group of healthy people etc — aspects that will bolster the vaccine research.4. Since human challenge trial is risky, it will only involve healthy people belonging to the age group of 18 to 30.5. About 90 participants, who will be compensated by the government, will take part in UK’s human challenge trial.6. Human challenge trial will help researchers find out which vaccine is the most promising one.7. The researchers are also hoping to find answers to whether vaccines can prevent only illness or whether vaccine can stop transmission.8. The participants will be monitored for up to a year to find out if there is any long-term illness.9. UK’s plan is subject to the approval of regulators and the ethics committee. Once approved, the study will start in January and the results are expected by May 2021.10. Human challenge studies were conducted for cholera, typhoid, malaria, influenza, tuberculosis, dengue etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-human-challenge-that-uk-cleared-to-speed-up-covid-19-vaccine-trial/story-JcHkpFUcEgDmwgOl5mjPCN.html
21-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Ahead of third debate, Trump holds rally while Biden opts for preparation||President Donald Trump pushed into arguably the most important state on the electoral map on Tuesday, opting for a rally in Pennsylvania instead of formal debate practice two days ahead of the final presidential debate that may be his last, best chance to alter the trajectory of the 2020 campaign.Democrat Joe Biden took the opposite approach, holing up for debate prep in the leadup to Thursday’s faceoff in Nashville. But Trump, trailing in polls in most battleground states, continued his travel blitz in the race’s final fortnight, and delivered what his campaign has wanted to be his closing message.“This is an election between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression. You will have a depression the likes of which you have never seen,” the president said in Erie. “If you want depression, doom and despair, vote for Sleepy Joe. And boredom.”But the president’s pitch that he should lead the rebuilding of an economy ravaged by the pandemic has been overshadowed by a series of fights. In the last two days he has attacked the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and a venerable TV newsmagazine while suggesting that the nation was tired of talking about a virus that has killed more than 220,000 Americans.Before leaving the White House, Trump taped part of an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” that apparently ended acrimoniously. On Twitter, the president declared his interview with Lesley Stahl to be “FAKE and BIASED,” and he threatened to release a White House account of it before its Sunday airtime.Also trailing in fundraising for campaign ads, Trump is increasingly relying on his signature campaign rallies to deliver a closing message to voters and maximize turnout among his GOP base. His trip Tuesday to Pennsylvania was expected to be one of several to the state in the next two weeks, underscoring its electoral importance.“If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” Trump in Erie.Erie County, which includes the aging industrial city in the state’s northwest corner, went for President Barack Obama by five points in 2012 but broke for Trump by two in 2016. That swing, fueled by Trump’s success with white, working class, non-college-educated voters, was replicated in small cities and towns and rural areas and helped him overcome Hillary Clinton’s victories in the state’s big cities.But Trump will likely need to run up the score by more this time around as his prospects have slipped since 2016 in vote-rich suburban Philadelphia, where he underperformed by past Republican measures. This raises the stakes for his campaign’s more aggressive outreach to new rural and small-town voters across the industrial north.His aides worry that his opponent is uniquely situated to prevent that, as Biden not only hails from Scranton, but has built his political persona as a representative of the middle and working class.Three weeks of wrangling over the debate format and structure appeared to have subsided Tuesday after the Commission on Presidential Debates unveiled a rules change meant to reduce the chaotic interruptions that plagued the first Trump-Biden encounter last month.This time, Trump and Biden will each have his microphone cut off while his rival delivers an opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics, the commission announced. The mute button won’t figure in the open discussion portion of the debate.Trump’s team is calling for a more in-depth focus on foreign policy in the debate, believing it to be a strong suit for the incumbent, but there is not expected to be any shift away from the announced topics, which include a segment devoted to national security.Before Thursday’s debate, the president was grumbling that he’d be at a disadvantage to his challenger.“I just think it’s very unfair,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from Arizona on Monday evening. “I will participate, but it’s very unfair that they changed the topics and it’s very unfair that, again, we have an anchor who’s totally biased.”Trump was to have been joined in Erie by first lady Melania Trump, in what was to be her first public appearance since she and the president were sickened with COVID-19, but her chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham, said Tuesday that Mrs. Trump has a lingering cough and would not accompany the president.As Trump was on the road, Biden was huddling at his lakeside home in Wilmington, Delaware, with senior adviser Ron Klain, who is in charge of debate preparation. Also on hand: a group of aides that the campaign has purposely kept small to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.Biden, who taped his own interview with “60 Minutes” on Monday at a theater near his home, has no public events on Tuesday or Wednesday and wasn’t scheduled to travel except to the debate itself on Thursday. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris was out campaigning, and he was expected to receive a late boost from former President Obama, who was to host an event Wednesday in Philadelphia.Biden is now tested about every two days for the coronavirus and has never been found to be positive. He suggested before last week’s planned second debate in Miami that the proceedings shouldn’t happen if Trump was still testing positive for COVID-19 after contracting the virus earlier in the month.The candidates instead held dueling town halls on separate networks after the commission said the debate should occur virtually, citing safety concerns, and Trump rejected the idea.Biden has been tightlipped about his preparation for the Nashville debate, saying only that he has focused on watching Trump’s past statements on key issues. Biden’s advisers see the final debate as a chance to discuss foreign policy, which they, too, see as one of their candidate’s strengths. Biden has praised the Trump administration for helping to broker deals that the Gulf states of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates signed recognizing Israel, but otherwise has accused the president of shunning allies and making foreign relations more volatile at most points around the globe.The debate comes as Trump again defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 Americans and to attack his Democratic rival for pledging to heed the advice of scientific experts.Trump insisted Tuesday that he gets along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist, while also complaining on “Fox & Friends” that the doctor who has clashed with him at times over the coronavirus is not a “team player.”A day earlier, Trump said on a call with campaign aides that “People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” adding of the doctor: “Every time he goes on television, there’s always a bomb. But there’s a bigger bomb if you fire him. But Fauci’s a disaster.”___ Weissert reported from Wilmington, Delaware. Miller reported from Washington.

21-10-2020||World||How Donald Trump plowed through $1 billion, losing cash advantage||President Donald Trump’s sprawling political operation has raised well over $1 billion since he took the White House in 2017 — and set a lot of it on fire.Trump bought a $10 million Super Bowl ad when he didn’t yet have a challenger. He tapped his political organization to cover exorbitant legal fees related to his impeachment. Aides made flashy displays of their newfound wealth — including a fleet of luxury vehicles purchased by Brad Parscale, his former campaign manager.Meanwhile, a web of limited liability companies hid more than $310 million in spending from disclosure, records show.Now, just two weeks out from the election, some campaign aides privately acknowledge they are facing difficult spending decisions at a time when Democratic nominee Joe Biden has flooded the airwaves with advertising. That has put Trump in the position of needing to do more of his signature rallies as a substitute during the coronavirus pandemic while relying on an unproven theory that he can turn out supporters who are infrequent voters at historic levels.“They spent their money on unnecessary overhead, lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous activity by the campaign staff and vanity ads,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican consultant who advised John McCain and Jeb Bush and is an outspoken Trump critic. “You could literally have 10 monkeys with flamethrowers go after the money, and they wouldn’t have burned through it as stupidly.”For Trump, it’s a familiar, if not welcome, position. In 2016, he was vastly outraised by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but still pulled off a come-from-behind win. This time around, though, he was betting on a massive cash advantage to negatively define Biden and to defend his own record.Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien insisted money was no issue. “We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016,” he told reporters Monday.Biden, Stepien added, was “putting it all on TV,” as he eschewed most door-knocking because of the pandemic, while Trump has roughly 2,000 field staffers across the country knocking on doors and making calls for his campaign.“Where we have states that are sort of tipping, could go either way,” Trump told campaign staffers Monday, “I have an ability to go to those states and rally. Biden has no ability. I go to a rally, we have 25,000 people. He goes to a rally, and he has four people.”The campaign and the Republican National Committee will offer a glimpse of their financial situation Tuesday when they file mandatory monthly campaign finance reports.Advertising spending figures, however, offer a bleak picture.While a half-dozen pro-Trump outside groups are coming to the president’s aid, Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to dump $142 million into ads in the closing days of the campaign, outspending Republicans by more than 2-to-1, according to data from the ad tracking firm CMAG/Kantar.On Monday, the firm Medium Buying reported Trump was canceling ad buys in Wisconsin; Minnesota, which Trump had hoped to flip; and Ohio, which went for Trump in 2016 but now appears to be a tight contest.It’s a reversal from May, when Biden’s campaign was strapped for cash and Parscale ominously compared the Trump campaign to a “Death Star” that was about to “start pressing FIRE for the first time.”The ad campaign they unrolled over the next three months cost over $176 million but did little to dent Biden’s lead in public opinion polling.Trump is now in a position that’s virtually unthinkable for an incumbent president, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks advertising spending.“Advertising obviously isn’t everything. But we do think ads matter for a couple percentage points in a presidential race. And it’s just not a good sign for the Trump campaign,” Ridout said.A review of expenditures by Trump’s campaign, as well as the Republican National Committee, lays bare some of the profligate spending.Since 2017, more than $39 million has been paid to firms controlled by Parscale, who was ousted as campaign manager over the summer. An additional $273.2 million was paid to American Made Media Consultants, a Delaware limited liability company, whose owners are not publicly disclosed.Campaigns typically reveal in mandatory disclosures who their primary vendors are. But by routing money to Parscale’s firms, as well as American Made Media Consultants, Trump satisfied the basic disclosure requirements without detailing the ultimate recipients.Other questionable expenditures by Trump and the RNC that are included in campaign finance disclosures:— Nearly $100,000 spent on copies of Donald Trump Jr.’s book “Triggered,” which helped propel it to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list.— Over $7.4 million spent at Trump-branded properties since 2017.— At least $35.2 million spent on Trump merchandise.— $38.7 million in legal and “compliance” fees. In addition to tapping the RNC and his campaign to pay legal costs during his impeachment proceedings, Trump has also relied on his political operation to cover legal costs for some aides.— At least $14.1 million spent on the Republican National Convention. The event was supposed to have been held in Charlotte, North Carolina, but Trump relocated it to Jacksonville, Florida, after a dispute with North Carolina’s Democratic governor over coronavirus safety measures. The Florida event was ultimately cancelled, as well, with a mostly online convention taking its place.— $912,000 spent on ads that ran on the personal Facebook pages of Parscale and Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson.— A $250,000 ad run during Game 7 of the 2019 World Series, which came after Trump was booed by spectators when he attended Game 5.— At least $218,000 for Trump surrogates to travel aboard private jets provided by campaign donors.— $1.6 million on TV ads in the Washington, D.C., media market, an overwhelmingly Democratic area where Trump has little chance of winning but where he is a regular TV watcher.There are signs Trump’s grassroots fundraising operation has slowed, too. Once a driving force, the campaign is now spending about 77 cents for every dollar it raises, typically through online ads asking supporters to chip in a few dollars.Between July and September, it cost the campaign $181 million to raise $235 million through such small contributions. That’s a considerable break from earlier in the year, when it raked in hundreds of millions while spending far less.Some of Trump’s wealthy supporters are also exploring their options.Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, recently donated $75 million to Preserve America, a new pro-Trump super political action committee that is not controlled by Trump World political operatives.One of the reasons the group was founded in August is because there is deep distrust among some GOP donors that the existing pro-Trump organizations would spend the money wisely, according to a Republican strategist with direct knowledge of the matter. The strategist spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive discussions with donors.Dan Eberhart, who has given over $190,000 to Trump’s election efforts, said many Republican donors are now focused on keeping control of the Senate in GOP hands — not Trump’s chances of winning.“The Senate majority is the most important objective right now,” he said. “It’s the bulwark against so much bad policy that the Democrats want to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-donald-trump-plowed-through-1-billion-losing-cash-advantage/story-jBPwUXhIVIdRRh1SoNcKDO.html

It shows the officer wearing a blue, white and red Trump 2020 mask containing a phrase with a curse word.“This is city funded voter intimidation,” Simeonidis tweeted, calling for the officer’s suspension.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez held a press conference Tuesday to address the situation. He said the officer was in line to vote, and the mask violated department and polling place policy because it promoted a political candidate. He said the officer would be disciplined and said a suspension was a possibility.“There were people claiming it was voter intimidation,” Suarez said. “Officers have a responsibility … to protect our residents and they have to do that in an impartial manner and they can’t be making political statements or making political stances while they are wearing a uniform.”Suarez said officers are allowed to vote while in uniform.“Had he not been voting it would have been a much more serious situation,” the mayor added.Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina issued a statement Tuesday calling the behavior “unacceptable” and a violation of departmental policy. He said the action was being “addressed immediately.”It was unknown whether the officer was on duty at the time, Suarez said.Tommy Reyes, president of the officer’s union, said in a statement that police officers have free-speech rights under the U.S. Constitution, and state law allows officers to vote in uniform. Reyes also pointed out that the union, Fraternal Order of Police, has endorsed Trump’s re-election bid at the national level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-miami-police-officer-wears-trump-mask-in-uniform-faces-suspension/story-4EgRWwBDMipsFlIEo6zEkI.html
21-10-2020||World||Pakistan: Sindh Police officials apply for leave after arrest of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law||Several police officers on Tuesday applied for leave in order to “come out of the [...] shock” caused by the registration of an FIR and arrest of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Mohammad Safdar, according to Dawn.The officers include at least two additional inspectors general, seven deputy inspectors general and six senior superintendents of Sindh Police. Among them are Special Branch AIG Imran Yaqoob, Forensic Science Division AIG Dr Samiulah Soomro Counter Terrorism Department DIG Omer Shahid Hamid, Headquarters DIG Saqib Ismail Memon, Hyderabad DIG Naeem Ahmed Shaikh, East Zone (Karachi) DIG Capt (r) Asim Khan, South Zone (Karachi) DIG Javed Akbar Riaz, Larkana DIG Nasir Aftab, Special Branch DIG Qamar-uz-Zaman and SSP Intelligence Tauqeer Muhammad Naeem, Sukkur SSP Irfan Ali Samo, Anti-Violent Crime Cell SSP Abdullah Ahmad, Badin SSP Shabir Ahmed Sethar, SSP Korangi Capt (r) Faisal Abdullah Chachar and East Zone (Karachi) SSP Sajid Amir Sudozai.As per the applications submitted to Sindh Inspector General Mushtaq Mahar, the officials said that it had become hard for them to “discharge [their] duties in a professional manner”.“It is respectfully submitted in the recent episode of registration of FIR against Capt (R) Safdar in which police high command has not only been ridiculed and mishandled but all ranks of Sindh Police have been demoralised and shocked. In such a stressful situation, it is quite difficult for me to discharge my duty in a professional manner, wrote Imran Yaqoob Minhas, Additional Inspector General of Police, Special Branch Sindh wrote in his application.He added, “In order to come out of this shock and settle down, I may kindly be granted 60 days of leave with effect from October 26.”According to Dawn, at least three station house officers (SHO) also applied for a leave of absence, citing similar reasons. The applicants include Korangi SHO Inayatullah, Shahra-i-Noorjehan SHO Imdad Ali Khowaja and Tipu Sultan SHO Shahrafat Khan.PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz appreciated the police “I salute the Sindh Police!” she tweeted, alongside a quote of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.This comes a day after the arrest and subsequent release on bail of Safdar in Karachi.

All of the new infections were imported.The country also reported 24 new asymptomatic patients, compared with 33 a day earlier. As of Monday, mainland China had 85,704 confirmed Covid-19 cases, the health authority said. China’s coronavirus death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.In Italy, the northern Lombardy region prepared to impose a night-time curfew, the most restrictive measure the country has seen since emerging from a national lockdown in the spring. The curfew from 11pm to 5am is expected to begin on Thursday night and last till November 13. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn the vaccine front, Moderna’s chief executive officer Stéphane Bancel said he expects interim results from its vaccine trial in November and the US government could give an emergency use nod in December, The Wall Street Journal reported. Bancel said sufficient interim results from the study takes longer to get and the government’s nod to use the vaccine may not come until next year.A World Health Organization (WHO) expert said on Monday that Europe and North America should follow the example of Asian states by persevering with anti-Covid measures. Mike Ryan, the WHO’s top emergency expert, said, “Too many countries have put an imaginary finishing line... The countries in Asia, south Asia, the western Pacific that have been successful have really continued to follow-through on those key activities.”Healthy, young volunteers aged 18 to 30 years in the UK are to be inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine candidate and then exposed to the virus in a controlled environment to expedite the eventual development of a safe and tested vaccine for the entire population.The Boris Johnson government on Tuesday said that only a vaccine candidate that has proved safe in initial trials - such as the one at the University of Oxford - will be given to some 90 volunteers for the so-called “human challenge” trial.Medics will closely monitor the effect on the volunteers 24 hours to see exactly how the vaccine works and to identify any side effects. The “human challenge” method of trial has long been used, including in colonial India to develop the vaccine for smallpox.The trial is due to begin in January 2021, with results expected by May, officials said, adding that such human challenge studies have been performed safely and have played important roles in accelerating the development of treatments for diseases such as malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus and flu. Deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said, “A safe, fully approved, and meticulously controlled human challenge model for Covid-19 that is conducted by experienced experts may help in the search for safe and effective vaccines.”With inputs from Prasun Sonwalkar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-cases-in-china-europe-tightens-curbs/story-IsGEwHuQ0Qxce5YOqVLPMP.html
21-10-2020||World||US mortality data indicates Covid-19 death toll nearly double reported toll: Report||The true death toll from Covid-19 likely exceeds 400,000, nearly twice the official tally, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based on an analysis of “excess deaths” in the first eight months of the novel coronavirus pandemic.The report defined excess deaths as the number of persons who have died from all causes, compared with average mortality, using data from 2015-2019 as the basis for comparison.“Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66 per cent) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25-44 years and among Hispanic or Latino persons,” the report said on Tuesday (local time).The excess novel coronavirus deaths would be in addition to the official toll of 216,025 published by the CDC on October 15, the report said.The total number of excess deaths ranged from a low of 841 for people under age 25 to a high of 94,646 among adults aged 75-84 years. However, the average percentage change in deaths compared with previous years was largest for adults aged 25-44 years (26.5 per cent), the report said.The report noted that measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of past pandemics, as well as natural disasters, particularly when there are questions about potential undercount.Official tallies of Covid-19-related deaths could be limited by factors such as the use of diagnostic testing, including postmortem testing, and inaccurate cause of death information on death certificates, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mortality-data-indicates-covid-19-death-toll-nearly-double-reported-toll-report/story-54liDsJJnh3KHwQOTYuPCP.html
21-10-2020||World||Focus on action against Pakistan as FATF meet begins||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will begin a three-day virtual plenary meeting on Wednesday that will decide on the next course of action against Pakistan with regard to steps taken by the country to crack down on fund-raising by terror groups. Pakistan’s case The multilateral watchdog, which counters money laundering and terror financing, put Pakistan on its list of “jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or “grey list” in 2018 for not doing enough to curb financial activities of terror groups. The grey list now has 18 countries, ranging from Iceland to Mauritius and Panama, and most of these nations have been cited for lax money laundering regimes and none face as serious charges related to terror financing as Pakistan. After a plenary meeting in February, FATF warned Pakistan that all deadlines set for implementing an action plan against terror financing had expired, and that the country had largely addressed only 14 of 27 action items in the plan. According to a more recent assessment, Pakistan is understood to have largely addressed about 20 action items. However, FATF’s regional affiliate Asia-Pacific Group (APG) concluded last month Pakistan has fully complied with only two out of 40 recommendations to curb money laundering and terror financing. The abuse of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and registered charities by groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba was cited by APG in its latest report as a “significant threat”, and the group retained Pakistan in its “enhanced follow-up” category. Terror financing Combating terror financing has been a priority for FATF since 2001. FATF plays a key role in global efforts to fight terror financing by setting global standards, assisting countries to implement financial provisions of the United Nations Security Council resolutions on terror, and evaluating their ability to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute the financing of terrorism. FATF carries out assessments throughout the year of countries on the grey list, though this work has been curtailed in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of its work in Pakistan has been focused on getting the government to introduce laws to enforce UN sanctions, improve coordination between different government organisations and law enforcement agencies, and prosecution of terrorists involved in fund-raising. Though Pakistan has arrested LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and a handful of other terrorist leaders and successfully prosecuted several of them – Saeed was given a prison term of five-and-a-half years in February – there have been other developments that have been criticised by Western nations. For instance, Pakistani authorities have removed some 3,800 names from a terror watch list this year. Pakistan has also enacted some 10 new laws for freezing and seizing the assets of terror groups and to impose fines and prison terms for terror financing but FATF has said enforcement and prosecution needs to improve further. What’s nextPakistan is widely expected to remain in the grey list, with very little chance of it being included in FATF’s list of “high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action” or “black list” – which currently has only two countries, North Korea and Iran – for a variety of reasons. Some Western countries are reluctant to push for stiffer action against Pakistan at a time when it is perceived as crucial for the trouble peace process in Afghanistan, while the backing of just three of FATF’s 39 members is adequate to keep it out of the black list. Pakistan has China in its corner and its leadership has reached out to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey for support. What remains to be seen is how much leeway FATF will give to Pakistan to deliver on the action plan against terror financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/focus-on-action-against-pakistan-as-fatf-meet-begins/story-R0SH7gQTb67Vtg0DmWjiUM.html

21-10-2020||World||Slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s family sues Saudi Crown Prince||The family of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of personally ordering Khashoggi’s brutal execution in order to silence the high-profile government critic.The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Khashoggi’s fiancee Hatice Cengiz and Democracy for the Arab World Now or DAWN, the human rights organization that Khashoggi founded shortly before his death. It names Prince Mohammed and a host of Saudi Ministry of Interior officials, accusing them of a “brutal and brazen crime” that was the result of “weeks of planning” and premeditation.Also Read | Turkey prepares second indictment on 6 Khashoggi murder suspects: Report“Jamal believed anything was possible in America and I place my trust in the American civil justice system to obtain a measure of justice and accountability,” Cengiz said in a statement Tuesday.Khashoggi disappeared on Oct. 2, 2018 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, seeking documents that would allow him to marry Cengiz, a Turkish national who was waiting outside the building. He never emerged.Turkish officials allege Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw inside the consulate. His body has not been found. Turkey apparently had the consulate bugged and shared audio of the killing with the C.I.A., among others.Western intelligence agencies, as well as the U.S. Congress, have said the crown prince bears ultimate responsibility for the killing and that an operation of this magnitude could not have happened without his knowledge.A prominent government critic, Khashoggi had founded DAWN in order to push for democratic and human rights reform in Saudi Arabia and throughout the Arab world. Tuesday’s suit alleges that the defendants “saw Mr. Khashoggi’s actions in the United States as an existential threat” to their political interests and sought to lure him inside the consulate where a specially dispatched hit squad awaited.“Defendants resolved to put an end to Mr. Khashoggi’s efforts by any means necessary,” the suit states.Saudi officials initially offering conflicting accounts, including claiming that Khashoggi had left the building unharmed. But amid mounting international pressure, they settled on the explanation that Khashoggi’s death was a tragic accident, saying that the team was under orders to merely persuade him to return to the kingdom. The official account is that the meeting unexpectedly turned violent, resulting in Khashoggi’s accidental death.In September, a Saudi court issued a final verdict sentencing five mid-level officials and operatives to 20-year jail sentences. The court had originally ordered the death penalty, but reduced the punishment after Khashoggi’s son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia and has received financial compensation from the royal court for his father’s killing, announced that he forgave the defendants. Three others were sentenced to lesser jail terms. The Saudi court did not implicate Prince Mohammed or other senior Interior Ministry officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slain-saudi-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-s-family-sues-saudi-crown-prince/story-46laUckfiHcZEa26XbCOTM.html

The first lady’s case was described as having been considerably milder.However, last week she revealed details of the illness in an unusual statement entitled “My Personal Experience with Covid-19” in which she said the aftermath had been difficult.“It seemed to be a roller coaster of symptoms in the days after. I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time,” she said.Also Read | Trump promises free Covid-19 treatment at Wisconsin rallyMelania Trump said that in contrast to the president, who took an intense therapy of experimental drugs and received oxygen to assist his breathing, “I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food.”It was only in that statement that she revealed that Barron, 14, had also become infected, although he has since recovered.Trump has been holding at least one election rally a day in the last two weeks before Election Day but he has not appeared on stage with his wife since 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melania-trump-cancels-rare-campaign-appearance-due-to-cough/story-8qeNhqKBS7TCGW2M25Lu3H.html
21-10-2020||World||In new online abuse menace, AI bot turns women’s photos into nudes||Unidentified cyber criminals have rolled out a service that allows anyone to create fake nude images of women from a regular photograph, a cyber research agency tracking deepfakes said in a report released on Tuesday, uncovering a growing ecosystem that has already targeted at least 100,000 women and threatens to open a new front in online sexual abuse. A deepfake is any manipulated media created by an artificial intelligence technique called deep learning. The technology first gained attention in 2017 and evolved rapidly, with experts warning that it can affect democracy and law since, among other things, deepfakes can be used to create convincing fakes about rival politicians and generate false evidence to implicate someone in crime. It has also been used to create deepfake pornography of celebrities, but Netherlands-based Sensity’s report now uncovers its first widespread use in targeting virtually any individual whose images are available. The tool works only on images of women. “Our investigation of this bot and its affiliated channels revealed several key findings. Approximately 104,852 women have been targeted and had their personal “stripped” images shared publicly as of the end of July, 2020. The number of these images grew by 198% in the last 3 months,” said the report.At present, most of the roughly 104,000 users and most of the victims appear to be from Russia, the report added, citing a poll in one of seven Telegram groups linked to the service – the name of which has been withheld in order to avoid publicity. At the core is a bot that lets a person upload a photograph of a woman. The bot feeds back a version with any clothing deleted and replaced by fake but at times authentic, but often evidently fake skin and private parts. The tool is available for free, but the photos will be watermarked. Users can pay $1.5 (about ₹110) to remove it, the report said.“The activity on the bot’s affiliated Telegram channels makes for bleak viewing. On the image sharing galleries, thousands of synthetically stripped images of young women taken from social media and private correspondence are constantly being uploaded,” said Henry Ajder, an expert on deepfakes and the lead author of the report who has since left Sensity. “The bot’s significance, as opposed to other tools for creating deepfakes, is its accessibility, which has enabled tens of thousands of users to non-consensually strip these images,” Ajder said, adding that the most concerning aspect of the investigation was the discovery of images of underage girls. “Up until now, we’ve seen a relatively low amount of activity with deepfakes and paedophilic content, but this investigation provides a stark warning that this trend is definitely over,” he added. According to Sensity’s investigation, the tool appears to be a version of DeepNudes, a software first released anonymously in 2019 before criticism forced its developer to pull it down.But, “on July 19th 2019, the creators sold the DeepNude licence on an online marketplace to an anonymous buyer for $30,000. The software has since been reverse engineered…” Sensity added. The key difference between that the first software and this service is now the fact that people do not need access to powerful graphics processing hardware and some degree of expertise to create such nudes. “In terms of photorealism, the level of the technology is still quite primitive and in many cases, it will be possible to distinguish them (the photographs) as a fake. Still, it does not mean that this material isn’t a reputation threat for people,” said Giorgio Patrini, CEO and chief scientist at Sensity. “Imagine someone posts a naked photo that you didn’t even take — the quality of the image is really not what makes the difference,” he added.According to Patrini, it is not established for certainty who are behind the new service. “We can state confidently that the individuals involved in the bot creation are very likely to be Russian native speakers, given the presence of this language among the users and the fact that a large part of the victim are Russian nationals,” Patrini said.Deepfake nudes do not fall in specific legal definitions in most countries, making it uncharted territory for law enforcement. Experts said it is closest to crimes known as revenge pornography and non-consensual sharing of intimate images. In India, such crimes are usually tried under Section 499 (criminal defamation) and Section 354C of the Indian Penal Code (voyeurism), and Section 66E (depicting private parts of a person) and Section 67A (section against sexually explicit materials) of the Information Technology Act, according to a 2018 analysis by Yesha Paul, then at the Centre for Communication Governance (CCG), National Law University (NLU) Delhi. “It is unlikely to be the case that the punishment using these laws will fit the crime because we are dealing with cyber crime as a service -- particularly cyber crime against women as a service,” said Gunjan Chawla, programme manager, technology and national security at CCG, NLU Delhi. There are also concerns of jurisdiction and evidence, when the illegal material is generated by an algorithm. “The courts might be significantly challenged to analyse the evidence to see whether or not that meets the standard of proof required in criminal trials - to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt,” she said.The use of AI to create fake nudes demonstrates the risk of putting out personal photographs, Patrini added. “People must think twice when sharing visual content online, visible to anyone. Even if the content itself is innocuous, unfortunately one day it might be repurposed and utilised maliciously against you,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-new-online-abuse-menace-ai-bot-turns-women-s-photos-into-nudes/story-BMQ2BTvIuFxB4D4zE9VAFJ.html
21-10-2020||World||Three-day FATF meet begins from Wednesday, Pakistan’s fate hangs in balance||The global terror financing watchdog, Financial Action Task Force (FATF), will hold a meeting from October 21 to 23. In this three-day virtual plenary meeting, the FATF will decide on whether Pakistan will remain in the “grey list” or not based on Islamabad’s commitment towards cracking down on money laundering and terror financing.This meeting was earlier scheduled in June but Islamabad got a breather of four months as the Paris-based watchdog temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines due to the coronavirus pandemic. The FATF is an inter-governmental body that was established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. Currently, it has 39 members including two regional organisations - the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. FATF and PakistanPakistan was put in the grey list in 2018 for not doing enough to curb the financial activities of terror groups. In February, the FATF warned Pakistan that all deadlines set for implementing an action plan against terror financing had expired, and that the country had largely addressed only 14 of 27 action items in the plan. Asia-Pacific Group, the FATF’s regional affiliate, concluded last month that Pakistan had fully complied with only two out of the 40 recommendations that were made. Since it is in the grey list, it has become increasingly difficult for Islamabad to get any financial aid from International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union. In order to get out of the grey list, debt-ridden Pakistan imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.What next for Pakistan?If the FATF in its meeting concludes that Pakistan has failed to meet its requirements, the country could be put in the “Black List” along with North Korea and Iran. In August, Prime Minister Imran Khan had warned that if blacklisted at the FATF, Pakistan’s entire economy will be destroyed due to inflation and a massive fall in Pakistani Rupee. In order to stay out of the black list, Pakistan needs the backing of only three members of FATF’s 39 members. Pakistan has China’s support and has also reached out to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Therefore, it is being expected widely that for now Pakistan will remain in the grey list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-day-fatf-meet-begins-from-wednesday-pakistan-s-fate-hangs-in-balance/story-EeoKBBT4oulxAfELtdKOQL.html
