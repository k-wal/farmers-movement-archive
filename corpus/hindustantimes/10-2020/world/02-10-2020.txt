He says the then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf had attacked Kargil without informing him. “I would have sacked the army chief if Kargil operation was conducted without informing me,” Khan said in an interview to private news channel Samaa TV on Thursday.Also read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his hands | AnalysisKhan also said that he would sack the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief if the latter asked him to resign. The comment was made in the context of three-time prime minister Sharif’s claim that the ISI chief asked him to step down in 2014 when Khan had unleashed a big protest sit-in the national capital.He said the army was keeping the country united and slammed Sharif for targeting the military establishment.“Look at Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen; the entire Muslim world is ablaze [so] why are we safe? If it weren’t for our army, our country would’ve been in three pieces…” Khan said.Sharif recently made two speeches from London, where he has been staying since November 2019 on medical grounds, directly attacking the army for interference in politics and claimed that Khan came to power through its support.Also read: ‘People, not governments, fight wars’: PM Modi on Kargil WarThe powerful Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Khan also said that it was not the army’s job to run the government and failure of a democratically elected government should not be used to impose a martial law.“If a judge gives a wrong decision it means the judiciary has to evolve. The army has evolved as well. Contemporary civil-military relations are the best in history because they are all working in their spheres,” he said.He also claimed that the army was standing by the government in all matters including relations with India, opening of the Kartarpur Corridor and the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/would-have-sacked-army-chief-if-kargil-war-was-conducted-without-informing-me-imran-khan/story-rIoJsZwYP2hQGpEAOnXPZL.html
02-10-2020||World||Covid-19 infected UK MP attended House; told to resign||An MP of the Scottish National Party who tested positive for coronavirus, attended the House of Commons on Wednesday and later travelled on public transport from London to Edinburgh faced persistent calls to resign on Friday.Margaret Ferrier, MP from Rutherglen and Hamilton West, has been suspended by her party. Nicola Sturgeon, party leader and Scotland’s First Minister, said she had spoken to Ferrier and asked her to step down as MP. She also faced strong criticism from speaker Lindsay Hoyle.Ferrier’s actions revived debate about everyone, irrespective of position, following law and quarantine rules after evidence emerged of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Stanley Johnson, father of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, not obeying such rules.Ian Blackford, SNP leader in Westminster, said Ferrier had broken the law and should therefore reflect very carefully on whether she can continue as a Member of Parliament for her constituents. “Nobody is above the law, nobody is above the regulations…I am calling on Margaret to do the right thing.”Ferrier, 60, apologised for her behaviour in a statement: “I apologise unreservedly for breaching Covid-19 restrictions by travelling this week when I shouldn’t have. There is no excuse for my actions.”“I deeply regret my actions. I take full responsibility and I would urge everyone not to make the same mistakes that I have, and do all they can to help limit the spread of Covid-19”, she added.Ferrier spoke for four minutes in the House of Commons in person. The House has been functioning under strict Covid-secure conditions that include few MPs present, with others joining debates through video link.Ferrier’s actions are now a subject of police investigation in London and Scotland, Hoyle said. It could result in a £4,000 fine recently announced by the government for those breaching quarantine regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infected-uk-mp-attended-house-told-to-resign/story-kdeNMihag1gmJKWdKVPYDP.html

All you need to knowA separate study by Reliance Life Sciences has indicated that the death rate for Covid-19 pandemic may significantly reduce by the end of 2020.The study showed mutation occurrence of structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 form more than 7,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from 49 countries.Statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the mutation rates of two proteins NSP6 and Surface glycoprotein (S) with the death rate, according to the study published in the Scientific Journal of Biology.It has been predicted that mutations of these two proteins will grow constantly, while the death rate would drop below 0.5 per cent by end of 2020 in cluster I countries (India and Bangladesh).In the study, it has been observed that the cluster II country (USA) mutation rate of NSP6 and S proteins are lower than cluster I and cluster III (Australia and NZ) countries.Therefore, it has been proposed that in cluster II country the death rate of Covid-19 pandemic will weaken later than cluster I and III countries, the study says.Reliance also got a US patent for genetically modified microalgae that is said to defend/delay death. The United States Patent on September 8 issued the patent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reliance-develops-rt-pcr-kit-that-can-give-covid-19-results-in-2-hrs/story-Vz96WT0DThdpCeyN2CUKeI.html

02-10-2020||World||Some parallels in Covid scripts of Boris Johnson, Donald Trump||Initially denying and playing down the virus, followed by contraction and fever, and eventual self-isolation.There are some parallels in the Covid-19 scripts of US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson; the latter had to be hospitalised and was on a ventilator for several days in April.It was a brush with death, he admitted later. His recovery was close, “it could have gone either way.”Like Trump, who played down the virus and was rarely seen wearing a mask in public, Johnson too had made light of the virus earlier this year.On March 3, the day his scientific and medical advisers cautioned against shaking hands, Johnson declared on live television: “I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients”. “And I shook hands with everybody, you’ll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands,” he had stated with a smile.But by March end, Johnson had contracted the virus and had to be admitted to the St Thomas’ Hospital near Downing Street on April 5. He spent three nights in the intensive care unit before returning to Number 10 a much-sobered man.At the time of contracting the virus, both Johnson and Trump were overweight. After recovery, Johnson implored Britons to take to exercise to shed excess fat as he cited his own struggles while announcing measures to deal with the pandemic.The blanket coverage of Johnson’s illness and recovery generated some sympathy even though there was much criticism of his government’s handling of the pandemic. There are obvious differences in the scripts of the two leaders considered to be of similar political persuasions, but the key variable is that there is an election due across the Atlantic and whether Trump’s situation will generate similar sympathy among the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-parallels-in-covid-scripts-of-boris-johnson-donald-trump/story-28Xux8nIooD7GV3abE4lmJ.html
02-10-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine alone won’t curb spread of virus, report warns||A successful vaccine for Covid-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus and many challenged would have to be overcome to deliver a successful vaccination programme, a recent study has warned. A report of Royal Society’s DELVE (Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics) Initiative suggests that there are serious challenges to developing, evaluating, manufacturing and distributing the vaccine.Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine: Fever, body aches common symptoms. All you need to knowWhy have scientists not been able to develop the vaccine yet?A successful vaccine stimulates immune responses that negate chances of transmission of infection and reduce risk and severity of disease. It also ensures long term protection so that people do not have to be re-vaccinated frequently.Currently, scientists have not been able to put their finger on SARS-CoV-2 infection’s immune responses. They do not even know if the infection has any immune responses. Antibodies and T cells have been detected in those who have recovered from the virus, but it is not clear whether it leads to protection against reinfection, according to the report.Evaluating prospective vaccine candidatesOver 200 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in development, with a handful being in later stages of clinical trials. Some of the candidates that are in later stages of trials, such as the Oxford/Astrazeneca candidate, have used ‘viral vectors’ -- where a part of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code is inserted in another harmless virus through which antibodies are generated.Others, such as Moderna, have used an alternative design, where a viral genetic code is produced as an RNA vaccine, which also leads to the production of viral protein when it enters a cell, the report stated.Even as development of these candidates has been accelerated, vaccines fail at a later level of trails many times due to poor immunogenicity, it added.Challenges in manufacture of a future vaccineOnce a vaccine is available, the choice of vaccination strategies will need to be phased to match manufacturing capacity.Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) estimates that for 2021, a global annual capacity of between 2 to 4 billion doses could be available without disrupting existing vaccine supplies, with much of the capacity being in India and China, the report said.Also Read: Shock, sympathy, mockery: World reacts to Trump being coronavirus positiveIf immunity is short lived and annual vaccine boosters are needed, capacity will be needed to extend coverage whilst maintaining immunity in existing recipients, it added.The challenge of vaccine distributionThe vaccine supply chain consists of a series of transportation and storage steps.Sourcing of raw materials used for drug product manufacturing and distribution of the finished product might be disrupted due to the pandemic itself.Supply chain will be disrupted in case borders are closed due to lockdown, personnel become ill, countries compete for short supply or medical system is overwhelmed. For making transportation easy, manufacturers are working towards improving thermostability of prospective vaccines to reduce the need of the distribution at very low temperatures, the report said.Additional medical staff will need to be trained to immunise the population rapidly, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-alone-won-t-curb-spread-of-virus-report-warns/story-BRT7mDkTALqqYoP2yWf3EK.html
02-10-2020||World||Donald Trump joins growing list of Covid-infected world leaders||President Donald Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus, joining a small group of world leaders who have been infected. Trump is 74, putting him at higher risk of serious complications. Here’s a look at other leaders who have had the virus. Some are sending Trump their wishes for a speedy recovery. Boris JohnsonThe British prime minister was the first major world leader confirmed to have Covid-19, after facing criticism for downplaying the pandemic. He was moved to intensive care in April after his symptoms dramatically worsened a day after he was hospitalized for what were called routine tests. He was given oxygen but did not need a ventilator, officials said. He later expressed his gratitude to National Health Service staff for saving his life when his treatment could have “gone either way.” Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, also tested positive in March and showed mild symptoms.Jair BolsonaroThe Brazilian president announced his illness in July and used it to publicly extol hydroxychloroquine, the unproven malaria drug that he’d been promoting as a treatment for Covid-19 and was taking himself. For months he had flirted with the virus, calling it a “little flu,” as he flouted social distancing at lively demonstrations and encouraged crowds during outings from the presidential residence, often without a mask.Juan Orlando HernandezThe Honduras president announced in June that he had tested positive, along with two other people who worked closely with him. Hernández said he had started what he called the “MAIZ treatment,” an experimental and unproven combination of microdacyn, azithromycin, ivermectin and zinc. He was briefly hospitalized and released. He has added his voice to growing pleas for equitable access to any Covid-19 vaccine, asking the recent UN gathering of world leaders, “Are people to be left to die?”Alexander LukashenkoThe president of Belarus, who dismissed concerns about the virus as “psychosis” and recommended drinking vodka to stay healthy, said in July he had contracted it himself but was asymptomatic. Belarus is one of the few countries that took no comprehensive measures against the virus. Other top officials in former Soviet states who were infected include Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.Prince Albert II of MonacoThe palace of Monaco in March said the ruler of the tiny Mediterranean principality tested positive but his health was not worrying. He was the first head of state who publicly said he was infected.Also Read| Shock, sympathy, mockery: World reacts to Trump being coronavirus positive Alejandro GiammatteiThe Guatemalan president said he tested positive for the virus in September. “My symptoms are very mild. Up to now, I have body aches, it hurt more yesterday than today, like a bad cold,” he said during a televised address. “I don’t have a fever, I have a bit of a cough.” He said he’d be working from home.Jeanine AnezThe virus drove the Bolivian interim president into isolation in July, but she said she was feeling well.Luis AbinaderThe newly elected president of the Dominican Republic contracted and recovered from Covid-19 during his campaign. He spent weeks in isolation before the country’s July election.IranIran, the epicentre of the Mideast’s initial coronavirus outbreak, has seen several top officials test positive. Among them are senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri and Vice President Massoumeh Ebtekar. Cabinet members have tested positive, too.IndiaVice President M. Venkaiah Naidu, 71, recently tested positive but his office said he had no symptoms and was quarantined at home. Home minister Amit Shah, the No. 2 man in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, was hospitalized for Covid-19 last month and has recovered. Junior railways minister Suresh Angadi last week was the first federal minister to die from Covid-19.Also Read: US Prez Trump, Melania test positive for Covid-19; could hit his presidential campaignIsraelIsrael’s then-Health Minister Yaakov Litzman tested positive in April and recovered. Litzman is a leader in Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community, which has seen a high rate of infection as many have defied restrictions on religious gatherings. The minister for Jerusalem affairs, Rafi Peretz, tested positive over the summer as cases surged nationwide and recovered.South AfricaThe country’s defense minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, mineral resources and energy minister, Gwede Mantashe, and labor minister, Thulas Nxesi, were infected as cases surged in June and July.South SudanVice President Riek Machar was among several Cabinet ministers infected.GambiaVice President Isatou Touray tested positive in July along with the ministers of finance, energy and agriculture.Guinea-BissauPrime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam in April said he tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joins-growing-list-of-covid-infected-world-leaders/story-sPn4P9eLvETx6jQ4D4SBOM.html
02-10-2020||World||Donald Trump Covid-19 positive: How vice president Pence could take charge if needed||Like two U.S. presidents before him, Donald Trump could temporarily hand over power to his vice president should he become incapacitated, for example while undergoing a medical procedure as treatment for the coronavirus.Trump said on Friday that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was going into quarantine to begin the recovery process immediately.Under Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution’s 25th Amendment, adopted in 1967 following the 1963 assassination of President John Kennedy, Trump could declare in writing his inability to discharge his duties.Vice President Mike Pence would become acting president, although Trump would remain in office. The president would regain his powers by declaring in writing that he is again ready to discharge them.The 25th Amendment’s Section 4 also offers a path to stripping a president of power if, for instance, his Cabinet believes he has become incapacitated, but this has never been invoked.SECTION 3 PRECEDENTS- On July 13, 1985, President Ronald Reagan elected to have a precancerous lesion removed after it was discovered during a colonoscopy. He signed a letter that, while not specifically invoking Section 3, said he was mindful of its provisions. Vice President George H.W. Bush was acting president for nearly eight hours, from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan issued a letter declaring himself able to resume his duties.- On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush invoked Section 3, temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney before undergoing a colonoscopy. Cheney was acting president from 7:09 a.m. to 9:24 a.m.- On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 before another colonoscopy. Cheney was acting president from 7:16 a.m. to 9:21 a.m.SECTION 4Under Section 4, the vice president and a majority of either Cabinet officials or “such other body as Congress may by law provide” can inform leaders in the two houses of Congress that the president “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”.In such a case, the vice president takes over as acting president. The president resumes office after informing the same two congressional leaders “that no inability exists” unless the Cabinet officials or other body declare otherwise. Congress then must assemble within 48 hours to decide the issue.If two-thirds of the members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate vote in their respective chambers that the president is unable to discharge the duties of office, the vice president remains acting president until after the next scheduled presidential election decides the next White House occupant. Otherwise, the president resumes office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-covid-19-positive-how-vice-president-pence-could-take-charge-if-needed/story-prQ0gXvahyXVDgaLyz1QbK.html
02-10-2020||World||Shock, sympathy, mockery: World reacts to Trump being coronavirus positive||News of the infection of the most powerful man in the world with the most notorious disease in the world drew instant reactions of shock, sympathy, undisguised glee and, of course, the ever-present outrage and curiosity that follow much of what Donald Trump does, even from 10,000 miles away.Trump’s announcement Friday, on Twitter, that he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and the deep uncertainty that accompanied it, permeated the global news cycle, upending countless plans and sparking comment everywhere from presidential offices to the thousands looking to weigh in on social media.The positive test reading for the leader of the world’s largest economy adds more uncertainty to investors’ worries, including, most prominently, how the infection might affect the Nov. 3 election between Trump, a Republican, and Democrat Joe Biden. U.S. stock futures and Asian shares fell in the wake of the news. The future contracts for both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials lost 1.9%. Oil prices also slipped. Stock prices in Japan and Australia tumbled.“To say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,” Rabobank said in a commentary. “Anyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this U.S. election campaign.”World leaders and officials were quick to weigh in, and there was both sympathy and something approaching schadenfreude.“Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.U.S.-India ties have prospered under Trump, and India is seen as a partner to balance China’s growing weight in Asia.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalized for a week in April after he contracted Covid-19, wished Trump a “speedy recovery.”“Our best wishes go to the president and the first lady, but it demonstrates that no one is immune from Covid-19 and catching it. So it shows that no matter the precautions, we are all susceptible to this,” Australian Agriculture Minister David Littleproud, deputy leader of the conservative Nationals party, said on Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV. “A trying time, and it just goes to show that a global pandemic can in fact touch anybody, even the president of the United States.”Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, speaking at a weekly news conference, did not mention Trump’s reluctance to wear masks when asked about his infection, but she said the news “reminded me of how widely masks are worn in Japan.”Major media across the globe also played up the announcement, with bulletins crawling across TV screens in Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, Dubai and Beijing.China’s official Xinhua News Agency flashed the news, and an anchor on state broadcaster CCTV announced it; there was no immediate comment from the government Friday, the second day of an eight-day national holiday.The positive test result for Trump and his wife was the most searched topic in China on the widely used social media app Weibo a few hours after the announcement, with most comments mocking or critical.One user darkly joked that Trump had finally tweeted something positive.The Chinese government has bristled at Trump’s attempts to blame China, where the disease emerged, for the pandemic and called for global cooperation in fighting it, a message that has resonated with the public.Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted in English that “President Trump and the first lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the Covid-19.”Multiple Arab news media outlets on Friday continuously broadcast footage of Trump and his wife after the virus announcement.Al-Arabiya, a Saudi-owned satellite channel based in Dubai, cut to a long live shot of the White House. Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera channel brought in four commentators to discuss the “prevailing state of uncertainty” in the United States, questioning whether Trump could effectively steer a reelection campaign and run the country from quarantine.Iranian state television announced Trump had the virus, an anchor breaking the news with an unflattering image of the U.S. president surrounded by what appeared to be giant coronaviruses. U.S.-Iran ties have suffered since Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed crushing sanctions.Social media platforms were ablaze with quick reaction.Would Trump blame the Chinese? Would he thumb his nose at his critics and enemies by breezing through the quarantine without serious symptoms, tweeting away from the White House? Would he become gravely ill, or worse, and, if he did, what would that mean for the U.S. election, one of the most contentious in recent history?While the uncertainty seemed palpable on a scroll through various nations’ social media, many of the comments seemed to revel in the announcement.“Here comes a chance for him to actually try out his idea of injecting disinfectant into himself and fighting back (against allegations that) it was fake news!” tweeted Hiroyuki Nishimura, a Japanese internet entrepreneur, referring to an idea Trump floated earlier this year for treatment.Keio University economics professor Masaru Kaneko tweeted that populist leaders like British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro “got infected because they tended not to take the coronavirus seriously. The two other leaders seriously tackled (the virus) after they got infected themselves. Will the United States follow their examples?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shock-sympathy-mockery-world-reacts-to-trump-being-coronavirus-positive/story-NfpCDYDkNfaePk6R52KfeM.html
02-10-2020||World||Donald Trump tests positive for Covid-19, upending US election||President Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19, upending the already tense US election, but was described by his doctor on Friday as feeling “well” and able to perform his duties while quarantining.Trump, 74, first announced on Twitter that he and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, had tested positive.“We will get through this TOGETHER!” he wrote.The news detonated a political bombshell a month before election day.The first immediate consequence was cancelation of a Trump campaign rally meant to take place in Florida later Friday.Badly behind in the polls against Democratic challenger Joe Biden ahead of November 3, Trump has been using large rallies -- where most people go without masks -- to try to change the subject from his much criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic.Just Thursday he said in a speech to a New York charity event: “The end of the pandemic is in sight and next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country.”But now the leader who has repeatedly cast doubt on the seriousness of the virus -- despite more than 200,000 Americans already dying -- has become the world’s highest profile patient, proving that all the resources of the White House could not prevent the risk.Biden, who has made criticism of the Republican’s coronavirus response his key issue, made no immediate statement about the president’s health after the news broke.Technically obese and in his 70s, Trump is in a higher-risk category for coronavirus patients.Trump’s official physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement that the president and his wife “are both well at this time.”“They plan to remain home at the White House during their convalescence,” he said. However, “I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.”- Campaign upheaval -Trump’s positive test was more than a PR disaster for a president who has staked everything on trying to persuade Americans that fears of the virus are overblown.There were concrete, instant impacts to his campaign strategy, particularly throwing into doubt the future of his signature rallies.The events, which Trump says prove his true political strength better than the dismal opinion polls, bring together thousands of people, often without masks and sometimes in contravention of local rules.All that is now on hold, at least for the immediate future, and with the clock ticking rapidly down on the election.In addition to canceling the Florida trip, it looked certain that Trump would have to abandon a trip scheduled for this weekend in Wisconsin, another battleground. He had also been expected to travel frequently next week, including longer distances to western states.A second televised debate with Biden is scheduled for October 15.- Close aide gets virus -The news came right after one of Trump’s closest advisors, Hope Hicks, was reported Thursday to have come down with the virus.Hicks, 31, traveled with Trump to Cleveland for his first debate with Biden on Tuesday. She was with him again for a campaign rally in Minnesota on Wednesday.With Hicks sharing Trump’s Air Force One plane and the even more cramped confines of the Marine One helicopter, speculation immediately erupted that Trump and possibly many others in his close entourage were exposed.Despite Hicks’ diagnosis, Trump took another Air Force One trip on Thursday to meet with donors in New Jersey.It was only late Thursday that Trump confirmed media reports about Hicks while giving an interview to Fox News. He announced that he had been tested but did not say whether he had received the results.“You know I spend a lot of time with Hope, and so does the first lady,” Trump said.Hicks is the most senior White House aide announced to have contracted Covid-19.In May, the spokeswoman of Vice President Mike Pence and wife of Trump’s speech writer, Katie Miller, came down with the virus. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien contracted the virus and went into quarantine in July.- Masks controversy -For months, Trump has courted controversy with his insistence that the coronavirus pandemic is as good as over and that lockdowns ordered in an attempt to beat the virus back were too draconian.In what has become an overtly political gesture, Trump almost never wears a mask in public.He argues that he doesn’t need to as he is frequently tested, but the example is followed by his supporters and many of his aides.But Trump’s own health experts have often given less rosy assessments of the state of the pandemic in the world’s richest country.And Trump has been especially criticized by Biden and at times also by local leaders for holding the rallies.Biden is running a deliberately low key campaign with social distancing at most events, no large gatherings, and conspicuous use of his mask wherever he goes.At their first debate on Tuesday, the candidates were tested and spent the angry, often chaotic 90 minutes standing close to each other. Trump’s family and supporters in the audience did not wear masks.White House spokesman Judd Deere earlier said “the president takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously.”Deere said the White House takes care to follow procedures “for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the president is traveling.”sms/mtp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tests-positive-for-covid-upending-us-election/story-PgRwEcvefTuGEB7HdN7b4N.html

However, there is still no information on when the feature would be available for Android users.The announcement comes after a lot of users criticised the company after the feature was not accessible enough since June when it first introduced voice tweets.“Since introducing the feature in June, we’ve taken your feedback seriously and are working to have transcription available to make voice Tweets more accessible,” Twitter support said in a statement on its social media platform.“Transcription for audio and video is part of our larger plan to make Twitter accessible for everyone across all features, both existing and new,” the San Francisco-based company said in another tweet.To access Twitter’s newest feature, iPhone users who have received the update can tap on a button in their tweet compose box to record their audio tweets. It will be shared along with the user’s profile picture. Other Twitter users can just tap on the play button to hear the voice tweet.“Testing voice Tweets earlier this summer made us realize how much work we still need to do as a company, and we made a commitment to make Twitter more inclusive for the disabled community – creating a dedicated team to focus on greater accessibility, tooling, and advocacy across all of our products,” the company said in a statement.Twitter also announced that it is working to add automated captions to audio and video by early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-expands-voice-tweets-feature-to-more-ios-users-no-word-on-android-platform/story-iKtlQXFJDGTffjHZaNpRkM.html
02-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: Democratic nominee Joe Biden shatters fundraising records||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has again shattered fundraising records, topping his already gargantuan August cash haul during the month of September, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.An exact total for the month is not yet clear. But both people, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to reveal internal details, said Thursday that he surpassed the $365 million raised last month through his joint fundraising effort with the Democratic National Committee.Biden’s success raising money speaks to the enthusiasm of Democratic donors to oust President Donald Trump from office. The money will help him continue to dominate the advertising wars and will position the campaign well for the possibility of a protracted legal fight after the Nov. 3 election.The possibility of a court battle over the outcome looms. Trump has repeatedly refused to say whether he will accept the results if he loses. And he has argued repeatedly without offering proof that the election will be plagued by widespread voter fraud, particularly from ballots cast by mail.Democrats have seen a torrent of new money in recent weeks. Candidates up and down the ballot took in more than $100 million donated online following the death of liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as Republicans moved forward to replace her with a conservative justice.And Biden himself raised over $31 million on Wednesday, following a chaotic debate against Trump, who refused to clearly condemn white supremacists who support him and personally insulted Biden’s family.A Biden campaign spokesperson declined to comment when asked about the fundraising totals.The Trump campaign hasn’t yet released their September fundraising numbers.The gobs of cash Biden has raised since securing the Democratic nomination amount to a complete reversal in fortune for the former vice president. During the Democratic primary, he struggled to raise cash and was almost broke by the time he won the South Carolina primary, which catapulted him to a commanding Super Tuesday performance.In the months since, a flood of donations and low spending has enabled him to eclipse Trump’s once-formidable cash reserves.That has allowed Biden to dominate the airwaves with TV advertising in battleground states with just weeks to go before the election.Biden will not have to formally submit his September fundraising numbers to the Federal Election Commission until later this month.

02-10-2020||World||NASA scrubs SS Kalpana Chawla Cygnus launch to ISS||The launch of Northrop Grumman’s Antares rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS) was scrubbed by about 9:40 p.m. due to an unknown problem with a component of ground support equipment. The commercial cargo spacecraft, a Northrop Grumman Cygnus, was set to blast off on Thursday night carrying the name of deceased NASA astronaut Kalpana “K.C.” Chawla, the first Indian-born woman to enter space, for her key contributions to human spaceflight.“Tonight’s launch attempt for @NorthropGrumman’s Antares rocket to send the #Cygnus resupply craft to the @Space_Station was scrubbed about 2 minutes and 40 seconds before liftoff due to an unknown problem with a component of ground support equipment,” NASA tweeted.“We have scrubbed tonight’s #Antares launch attempt after receiving off-nominal data from ground support equipment. Stay tuned for the time of the next launch attempt,” Northern Grumman.This marked the second delay in total for Northrop Grumman’s latest commercial resupply mission. The night launch was already pushed back from its original launch window of Tuesday evening due to weather conditions. NASA has yet to detail specific reasons for the abort, after needing to delay at the original 11-minute mark due to a boat in the range. On the NG-14 mission, the S.S. Kalpana Chawla was supposed to deliver approximately 3,630 kilograms of cargo to the station.Research flying aboard the Cygnus includes the test of a biologic drug that could be used for the treatment of leukaemia, a plant growth study that will cultivate radishes as a model for future crops in space, a compact toilet for astronauts to use on deep-space exploration missions and a 360-degree virtual reality camera that will be used to film during a spacewalk for an immersive cinematic production.Northrop Grumman, an American global aerospace and defence technology company said that this mission is named after Chawla in memory of the mission specialist who died with her six crewmates aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 Northrop Grumman stated that it is proud to celebrate the life of Kalpana Chawla and her dream of flying through the air and in space. “It is the company’s tradition to name each Cygnus after an individual who has played a pivotal role in human spaceflight,” said Northrop Grumman. While Chawla made the ultimate sacrifice in service to the space program, her legacy lives on. She has not only inspired her colleagues but also many back in India, to follow in her footsteps. Her final research conducted onboard Columbia helped understand astronaut health and safety during spaceflight. Born in Haryana, India, Chawla moved to the United States to earn her master’s and doctorate degrees in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas in 1984 and University of Colorado in 1988, respectively. She then began her career at NASA, conducting research in fluid dynamics at the Ames Research Center in California.After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Chawla applied for and became a NASA astronaut as a member of “The Flying Escargot,” NASA’s 15th class of trainees. In 1997, she launched on STS-87, a 15-day shuttle mission that was dedicated to the science flying as part of the fourth United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4).Chawla’s second spaceflight, STS-107, came to a tragic end on February 1, 2003, following 16 days of conducting science onboard the space shuttle Columbia. A small piece of foam that struck the orbiter’s left wing during launch created a hole that went undetected during the mission. Upon Columbia’s return to Earth, hot plasma entered the wing, tearing it apart, and the resulting loss of control led to the vehicle disintegrating and the death of the crew. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-scrubs-ss-kalpana-chawla-cygnus-launch-to-iss/story-UtMa4JDJ3aly3caZDXBicL.html
02-10-2020||World||Mask norms relaxed for Sikhs in Canadian police||Canada’s premier law enforcement agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), has relaxed norms on wearing of medical grade masks that were considered discriminatory and forced many bearded officers, mainly Sikhs, off the frontlines.Those rules were implemented in April following the Covid-19 pandemic. This matter was addressed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons this week. “This is absolutely unacceptable. We asked the RCMP to review its policies to make sure that this example of systemic racism is put aside.”In a statement, RCMP’s Chief Human Resources Officer Gail Johnson announced the relaxation with regard to personal protective equipment (PPE). She said, “Impacted bearded members across Canada may return to operational duties wearing the appropriate PPE assigned to them based on a risk assessment carried out by the commanding officers in their respective provinces.”She added that bearded members will be assigned to operational duties “only if the risk of exposure is low or multiple responding officers will be present. At no time will we accept putting our officers or the public at any undue risk.” The decision will also depend on a risk assessment undertaken by respective commanding officers, while the RCMP will continue to make an accommodation for officers who prefer other policing duties as a safety precaution.“The issue of personal protective equipment (PPE) and impacts on RCMP members with facial hair during the pandemic has been a topic of public debate the last few days. I share the frustrations of our police officers across Canada who are personally affected,” Johnson stated.As yet, appropriate fitting respirators for those with facial hair does not yet exist , she saidBut the RCMP has begun work with Innovations Solutions Canada to explore the research and development of inclusively designed PPE and to ensure regulatory requirements support safe and non-discriminatory practices across Canada. “We are still working to identify or create a mask that meets our front-line needs as well as occupational health and safety regulations.”There had been reports of Sikh officers being taken off the frontlines and given desk assignments as the RCMP had deemed that when it came to respirators, “one of the most common causes of a breached seal is facial hair.”In her statement, Johnson said, “We are committed to resolving this issue as quickly as possible in order to help us further advance the important work that is ongoing in the RCMP to enhance diversity, equity, accountability and trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mask-norms-relaxed-for-sikhs-in-canadian-police/story-TUGEp7sc5qzzwSM51e5LNK.html

Visas for those already enrolled will be revoked if they are deemed to pose a risk,” Fisher reported.According to The Times, the moves comes after widespread concerns around intellectual property (IP) theft by students at the UK’s top research labs.Chinese students have been accused of IP theft in both the UK and the US. A Whitehall source said: “The ATAS (Academic Technology Approval Scheme) system is being expanded as we know that security threats are constantly evolving... We know that there are those who would seek to exploit our position as leaders in science & innovation. Ministers decided to take action earlier this year.”A recent report from a think tank, the Henry Jackson Society, found that 900 graduates of Chinese universities allegedly linked to the People’s Liberation Army are enrolled in postgraduate studies at 33 British universities with serious research arms.In 2018-19 Chinese students accounted for 12 per cent of all postgraduates studying at UK universities. Hundreds could face being blocked from taking up places going forward.In May, a similar move was taken by the United States. The Trump administration had announced that it has banned some Chinese students and researchers from entering the United States after accusing them of stealing intellectual property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-students-may-face-ban-in-uk-amid-security-concerns-says-report/story-klQOZ6B3wqWcmCtWkuHn6K.html

02-10-2020||World||Canada snubs China Day celebrations, anti-China protests held in main cities||From the Mayor of Canada’s largest city boycotting a flag-raising event and a provincial legislature cancelling a scheduled ceremony to multiple protests, there was much to mar China’s National Day celebrations in the country.While the Chinese flag was hoisted near City Hall in Toronto, the event was marked by the city’s Mayor John Tory absence. The outlet Toronto Sun quoted his spokesperson as saying that this was due “to a number of issues between Canada and China which are of great concern to him.” Meanwhile, the Ontario Legislative Assembly was to host a ceremony with China’s Consul General in Toronto but cancelled the event after an outcry. The province’s Premiere Doug Ford said this was “not the appropriate time to be raising this flag” while its education minister Stephen Lecce elaborated in a tweet, “Our legislature is a symbol of our cherished freedoms and our enduring democracy. It is for that reason that we must consistently, principally, and unapologetically stand up for those fundamental Canadian values.”Several groups protesting recent actions by Beijing against Uighurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers and Mongolians, also gathered in Toronto and Vancouver outside the Chinese consulates in these cities. They were part of a Global Day of Action against the “Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s crackdowns against freedom, democracy, and human rights” that intensified across China. “We have witnessed a gross increase on the assault on communities living under its rule,” the organisers said.In Toronto, nearly 300 protestors collected outside the Chinese consulate. Among them was Youdon Tsamotshang, board chair of Students for a Free Tibet Canada. She said this year was “specifically different” from protests held earlier, because “a lot of eyes are on the Chinese government.” “Covid-19 is a big reason why, human rights atrocities are another. There is even more interest because of that.” The coalition that collected included Uighurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Taiwanese and natives of southern Mongolia. An Indian flag was also waved during the protest as a sign of solidarity, as India confronts China over Ladakh.Six main issues were raised at the protest: That Occupied Tibet is one of the least free places in the world, millions of Uighurs are detained in mass internment camps in occupied East Turkestan, loss of fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong, erasure of Southern Mongolian culture and language, intimidation and geopolitical bullying of Taiwan and detention and disappearance of countless Chinese lawyers, feminists and activists.These events also marked how relations between Canada and China have plummeted since the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei in Vancouver in 2018. Since then the Canadian government has accused China of indulging in “hostage diplomacy”. China has arrested two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who remain in Chinese jails for over 660 days. Placards featuring the two detainees were also in display at the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-snubs-china-day-celebrations-anti-china-protests-held-in-main-cities/story-Z7EWPDLacxybrzmGS84WDN.html
02-10-2020||World||Hong Kong police arrest 86 for protesting on China holiday||Hong Kong police arrested at least 86 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China’s National Day holiday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district and other areas chanting pro-democracy slogans.Those arrested included four district councilors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings for them to disperse Thursday.Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting “Disband the police” and “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,” a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments. 74 were arrested in Causeway Bay.A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.Separately, 20 people were also given penalties for breaching social-distancing regulations, which currently prohibit public gatherings of more than four people.National Day, which celebrates the founding of the People’s Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing’s increasing control over the semi-autonomous city. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of social distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist, and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city’s internal affairs. The US and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city’s freedoms, and the US has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said “stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded” under the new law.Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding “double standards” and leveling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law.

02-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s sister reported in public for first time since July||The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first appearance in state media since July, an absence that had fuelled speculation her power was clipped after she led a contentious pressure campaign against South Korea.Kim Yo Jong joined her brother and a handful of other top cadres on a tour to inspect reconstruction work to repair damage caused by massive flooding in recent weeks, the state’s Korean Central News Agency reported Friday.Kim Yo Jong saw her profile rise among political analysts as the likely successor to her brother when a prolonged absence in April raised questions about his health. She was last mentioned in state media when she joined her brother on an inspection tour of a chicken farm, which included a glimpse in state media of her picking up a cigarette butt from her brother.“The listing of the accompanying officials in today’s report indicates that she has not been demoted,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an independent political analyst who used to work for the US government in areas related to North Korea.Kim Yo Jong’s status rose in the first part of the year where she was a key player on policies toward the country’s two biggest adversaries, the US and South Korea. A leading South Korean newspaper, the Chosun, reported in recent days that she might even visit President Donald Trump before the presidential election in a show of support.Kim Yo Jong led a series of threats and provocations against South Korea that culminated with Pyongyang in June blowing up a joint liaison office north of the border built in 2018 as a symbol of reconciliation between the two countries still technically at war. Just as soon as it looked like more was on the way, her brother reversed course in late June and halted plans to step up provocations.In July, she issued a message saying that North Korea had no intention of holding a meeting with Trump, calling on him to change his policy of applying sanctions against the state. After that, she was conspicuously absent from two key meetings in August of the ruling Workers’ Party, raising speculation that she had fallen out of favor.“We will never know what happened during her latest two-month absence, but I do not believe she was punished,” said Lee, who added it would be unthinkable for a national campaign like the one against South Korea to be launched and executed without the top leader’s approval.Choosing a woman to deliver pointed messages is notable for the Kim family, which has ruled the male-dominated society since the 1940s. Kim Yo Jong has become the highest-ranking female member of the family, and a rare sibling allowed to stay in a prominent position or even get mentioned in state media.Siblings have often not fared well in North Korea. Kim Jong Un has been accused of ordering the murder of his older half-brother and most serious rival, Kim Jong Nam, in 2017. Former leader Kim Jong Il’s brother was found drowned when they were children and his half-brother was effectively exiled for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-reported-in-public-for-first-time-since-july/story-Dy125m4EbbA7gGen2k0naK.html
02-10-2020||World||Trump not too keen on debate rule changes||President Donald Trump on Thursday indicated he will be averse to accepting changes in rules for the remaining two presidential debates, saying he “easily won” the first showdown.The rule changes are being considered by the body that conducts the debates to prevent a repeat of the chaos witnessed in the first debate in Ohio, in which Trump had repeatedly interrupted Joe Biden, his Democratic rival, and argued with the moderator Chris Wallace.“Why would I allow the Debate Commission to change the rules for the second and third Debates when I easily won last time?” Trump wrote in a tweet, claiming victory when even his own allies have publicly conceded he may have hurt himself more by his conduct than his intended target, Biden.Trump had repeatedly talked over Biden and heckled him in an apparent bid to dominate the stage, forcing an exasperated Biden to call him a “clown” at one stage and ask him to “shut up” at another. All the while, the president had defied rules of engagement that his campaign had agreed with the commission.Trump’s tweet came after the Commission on Presidential Debates, set up in 1987 to conduct election debates for president and vice-president, said it plans to introduce “additional structure” to ensure “a more orderly discussion of the issues” for the remaining debates, one for vice-president and two for president. This may include cutting the mic of the person who is not speaking.Biden, who has called Trump a “national embarrassment” for this debate behaviour, said he is open to changes in the debate format, though he has neither called for them nor made his participation in the remaining rounds contingent on them. Asked about allowing the moderator to mute speakers, Biden said on Thursday that he was open to it as long as “we have an opportunity to respond to the questions from the people in the audience.”The next presidential debate will be a town hall in which members of the audience question the candidates. “I think it’s appropriate that when a person, a constituent, some considering how they’re going to vote this year, when they ask a question, of whomever they ask that question, gets an opportunity to answer it fully.”Trump has been trailing Biden in polls, even in the six or eight battleground states that will determine the outcome. He was expected to use the first debate to snatch the initiative and turn around the race. He failed on both counts, from all indications and may have ended up alienating potential voters.Biden leads Trump 50.1%-42.9% in the RealClearPolitics average of polls nationally and 50.9%-42.7% in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.Both nominees and their surrogates are stumping in battleground states, with Trump focusing on opening up new pathways to victory and a second term as he trails in the battleground states that won him the 2016 election, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-not-too-keen-on-debate-rule-changes/story-LQETHicpDPNK8DdpL4dVVJ.html
02-10-2020||World||US President Trump, first lady Melania test positive for Covid-19||US president Donald Trump and first lady Melania have tested positive for coronavirus and will go into quarantine, the US president tweeted late on Thursday evening hours after one of his most senior advisers, Hope Hicks, was reported to have contracted the infection. Hicks had travelled with the president on multiple trips this week including abroad Marine One, the presidential helicopter, and Air Force One. It isn’t immediately clear how Trump contracted the virus that has infected over 7 million Americans and killed more than 200,000.Trump announced his health status on Twitter, saying they will “begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!,” he said.Within minutes of Trump’s announcement, Bloomberg reported U.S. stock futures fell more than 1 per cent and 0il prices extended losses to drop around 2 per cent early Friday. Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!New agency Reuters said Trump had kept up a rigorous travel schedule across the country in recent weeks, holding rallies with thousands of people in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, despite warnings from public health professionals against having events with large crowds.Trump had a packed schedule for Friday too including a private fund-raiser at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a campaign rally in Florida and a call with “vulnerable seniors” about the disease, the New York Times reported.The infection would impact Trump’s ability to campaign in person for the presidential elections. There is no clarity from his office if he will continue to address events over video but his new schedule just lists a midday phone call on “Covid-19 support to vulnerable seniors.”‘We will get through this together’: Trump & Melania test positive for Covid-19The president’s physician Sean Conley said Donald Trump and Melania “are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence”.“Rest assured, I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering,” Dr Conley said in a statement.White House spokesman Judd Deere said contact tracing for Trump and Melania Trump was being carried out. Bloomberg said the 74-year-old president’s positive result was likely to sharpen an already intense public attention on his handling of the pandemic as he campaigns for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden, who leads in national polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-melania-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-zey89GSI5SWXNOAv9aRBAM.html
02-10-2020||World||Trump, Melania start quarantine process after top aide Hope Hicks tests positive for Covid-19||US President Donald Trump said late Thursday he and first lady Melania Trump will “begin our quarantine process” after Hope Hicks, one of his closest advisers, tested positive for Covid-19.Hicks, who became the newest White House staffer to test positive, had travelled with Trump several times in the last few days.“Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19,” President Trump tweeted. “Terrible! The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!”Hicks had travelled with Trump and his team on Air Force One to Cleveland, Ohio for the first presidential debate. She also travelled with Trump to his rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Wednesday and was seen in close contact with senior members of the president’s campaign.According to rules made by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who were in close contact with Hicks should quarantine themselves. That would include the president, the first lady and senior members of the president’s re-election campaign.Bloomberg, which first reported Hicks testing positive, said she had felt ill in Minnesota and quarantined herself on the way back on the presidential aircraft.“The president takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously,” White House spokesman Judd Deere has said in a statement. “White House Operations collaborates with the physician to the president and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible, both on complex and when the president is travelling.”Hicks is the fourth White House personnel to test positive for Coronavirus, after a personal military valet of the president, a member of the vice-president’s staff and the National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien. But Hicks has been the closest of them all to the president, who had gone on a 10-day course of Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-melania-start-quarantine-process-after-top-aide-hope-hicks-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-Zx99N4V0GMgSj1gBrE8QdP.html

But, changes in the law are necessary to ensure American workers don’t face replacement by cheap foreign labour in the future, Brooks said.“Due to intense pressure from big business, H-1B reform has been stalled for years, but Americans are hurting, and they cannot wait any longer for relief. Firing American workers only to hire cheap foreign workers to replace them is not only unpatriotic, it’s downright repulsive!” the lawmaker said.Chris Chmielenski, the deputy director of NumbersUSA, said the American Jobs First Act makes a number of much-needed reforms to the H-1B program, including setting a wage floor of USD 110,000 for all H-1B workers so that employers who say they can’t find an American to take a job have to put their money where their mouths are.“It ends the outrageous Optional Practical Training program that actually gives employers a tax break for hiring foreign workers rather than Americans,” he said.The legislation also ends the visa lottery that hands out 50,000 green cards, with work permits, based on a randomized computer drawing, Chmielenski added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmaker-introduces-legislation-to-overhaul-h-1b-visa-system/story-3IHcd9YdaJzcOeOIfDX7OM.html

02-10-2020||World||US House pays tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 151 birth anniversary||Scores of US House of Representatives on Thursday (local time) paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 151st birth anniversary.On the eve of Gandhi Jayanti, Congressman Rohit Khanna posted a message saying: “Gandhi taught us that the best fight for justice was a fight wage with principles of non-violence.”“Mahatma Gandhi changed the course of human history. So many people were inspired by his actions,” said Congressman Tom Suozzi in a tribute to Gandhi.Congressman TJ Coxsa and Mike Fitzpatrick also offered their tributes to Gandhi. While Coxsa encouraged people to embrace their differences to honour his legacy, Fitzpatrick endorsed Gandhi’s idea of selfless service.“I believe we can best honor Gandhi’s legacy by choosing to embrace our differences and dedicating ourselves to creating a world that is equitable for all,” Coxsa said.“Gandhi believed that the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in service of others. As elected officials, we come together to reflect on the achievements and lasting impact he had,” Fitzpatrick said. Several other Congressman offered their tributes to Gandhi via Indian Embassy’s Twitter handle.A special message from Ted Yoho read: “his philosophies inspired many including Dr. Martin Luther King’s peaceful protests that led to our nation’s civil right legislation in the 1960’s.”Congressman Ami Bera said that Gandhi is an “inspiration for all”.

Both August and September of 2020 have matched or surpassed last year’s single-month high.“We have had two months with a lot of fire. It’s already worse than last year,” said Ane Alencar, science director for Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM).“It could get worse if the drought continues. We are at the mercy of the rain.”The Amazon is experiencing a more severe dry season than last year, which scientists attribute in part to warming in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean pulling moisture away from South America.The entire Amazon, which spans nine countries, currently has 28,892 active fires, according to a fire monitoring tool funded in-part by U.S. space agency NASA.The fires in September are not only burning recently deforested areas and farmland, where ranchers set them to clear land, but are also increasingly burning virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire.Roughly 62% of major Amazon fires were in forests in September, compared with only 15% in August, according to an analysis of satellite images by U.S.-based non-profit Amazon Conservation.The warming of the North Atlantic is also helping drive drought in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, which has suffered more fires this year than ever previously recorded, according to Inpe data.A Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis found that 23% of the wetlands, which are home to the densest population of jaguars in the world, has burned.“Brazil is on fire,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaigner for advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil, in a statement.(Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fires-in-brazil-s-amazon-increase-13-from-a-year-ago-data-shows/story-PK4JQQuPtDi19Yb9KsrjVL.html
02-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: After bitter debate, Trump, Biden to speak at charity event||After a week in which they brawled in a debate and flayed each other on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden were making appearances Thursday night at an annual event meant to promote collegiality and good humour.It probably helps that they will be speaking remotely. The two rivals are the entertainment at the 75th Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, which went virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump’s appearance at the dinner four years ago along with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton produced some laughs, but several cringe-worthy moments, too.When Trump described Clinton as corrupt, he crossed the line for many of those in attendance and was booed loudly.Fast forward four years, and now Trump and Biden have the challenge of poking fun at themselves and each other after a debate night in which Biden called the president a “clown” and “the worst president America has ever had” while Trump questioned Biden’s intelligence and attacked his son Hunter.The dinner raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally shown that those vying to lead the nation can get along, or pretend to, for one night.The event has become a tradition for presidential candidates since Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy appeared together in 1960.In 1996, the Archdiocese of New York decided not to invite then-President Bill Clinton and his Republican challenger, Bob Dole, reportedly because of Clinton’s veto of a late-term abortion ban.This year’s dinner comes as Biden and Trump make fierce plays for Catholic voters, a large swath of the electorate that spans the US political spectrum, including a significant slice of swing voters in battleground states.The former vice president talks often of his Irish Catholic roots.He regularly attends Mass, including when he travels, and he talks often of the role that his faith has played in his life, saying that it “gave me purpose” and “hope” after the deaths of his first wife and young daughter in a car accident in 1972 and the death of his son Beau Biden in 2015.Nonetheless, the Smith dinner could present some tensions for Biden, even in virtual form. The host, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, represents the outspoken social conservative base of US Catholicism. Dolan spoke during the Republican National Convention and for years, including when he led the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, was a frequent cable news presence touting the church’s opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.Biden emphasizes other aspects of faith. In one campaign ad, Biden is shown talking about Pope Francis, who has urged Catholics not to focus so vociferously on the church’s opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage at the expense of social justice.Meanwhile, Trump has won favour with many Catholics for his anti-abortion policies and support for “school choice.” (AP) AD||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-after-bitter-debate-trump-biden-to-speak-at-charity-event/story-dTFL4H4a0msjB2JkDmA6bO.html
02-10-2020||World||Top Trump aide Hope Hicks tests positive for coronavirus||Hope Hicks, one of President Donald Trump’s closest aides, has tested positive for the coronavirus.Hicks, who serves as counselor to the president and traveled with him to a rally Wednesday, tested positive Thursday, according to an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private health information. She is the closest aide to Trump to test positive so far.The White House did not immediately respond to multiple questions about the last time Trump was tested and whether he and other staffers who spent time with Hicks in recent days will be asked to quarantine.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump traveled Thursday to New Jersey for a fundraiser. His social media director Dan Scavino and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany were originally set to join him, but were replaced at the last minute by other aides.In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said, “The President takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously.”“White House Operations collaborates with the Physician to the President and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the President is traveling,” Deere said.Hicks traveled with the president multiple times this week, including aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter, to a rally in Minnesota Wednesday, and aboard Air Force One to Tuesday night’s first presidential debate.Hicks, one of the president’s most trusted aides, previously served as White House communications director and rejoined the administration this year ahead of the election. Her positive test was first reported by Bloomberg News.Multiple White House staffers have tested positive for the virus, including Katie Miller, Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, national security adviser Robert O’Brien, and one of the president’s personal valets.After earlier positive cases close to the president, the White House instituted a daily testing regimen for the president’s senior aides. Others who will be in close proximity to the president and vice president, including reporters, are also tested every day.While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have been in close contact with someone with Covid-19 quarantine for 14 days, White House staffers are considered essential workers. CDC’s guidelines for exposed essential workers allows them to return to work if they take precautions, including taking their temperature before going into work, wearing a mask at all times and practicing social distancing.Trump, the White House and his campaign have flouted other CDC guidelines and recommendations from public health officials, and largely refused to wear masks or practice social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-trump-aide-hope-hicks-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-lzax7tusrjM7QvcRWZmQMP.html
02-10-2020||World||Will no longer remain quiet on ‘dual accountability standards’ in Pakistan: Nawaz Sharif||Former Prime Minister and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Thursday said that he would no longer remain quiet on the “dual standards” of accountability in Pakistan. Addressing a PML-N meeting through a video link from London, he said, “Nawaz Sharif is not made of the kind of stuff that can remain quiet on dual standards of accountability.”Sharif said that although Prime Minister Imran Khan is to blame for the country’s current state, “it is those who brought him into power who are truly responsible”.In response to Sharif’s recent speeches criticizing the government, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) on Thursday banned the broadcast and rebroadcast of any speech, interview or public address of absconders or proclaimed offenders.Pakistan’s regulatory body banned the broadcasting of content including commentary, opinions or suggestions about the potential fate of sub-judice matter.“If licensee fails to comply with the aforementioned directives, the authority shall take action under Section 29 and 30 of PEMRA Ordinance which may result in the imposition of fine and suspension/revocation of licence,” the court order was quoted by The Express Tribune.Moreover, a Pakistan court on Thursday ordered authorities to seize Sharif’s assets during a hearing of a case filed by the country’s anti-graft body National Accountability Bureau (NAB).Dawn reported that the accountability watchdog filed a record of Sharif’s “moveable and immoveable properties” as had been earlier directed by the court.These developments come after Islamabad High Court (IHC) had slammed the former Prime Minister on Wednesday over his failure to appear before the court after permission was granted to fly abroad to get medical treatment in November last year.“Accused [Sharif] knows that he went abroad after defeating the system. He must be laughing at the system while sitting abroad. It’s shameful conduct by the accused,” Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune.Pakistan has fast-tracked the process to bring back PML-N leader from London, where he had been staying since November 2019 on medical grounds.PM Imran Khan on Tuesday tasked relevant authorities with bringing back Sharif at the earliest. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister also issued the directive to pursue the matter vigorously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-no-longer-remain-quiet-on-dual-accountability-standards-in-pakistan-nawaz-sharif/story-XgCUhtZqySyARAvBinORpL.html

While the Chinese people have suffered the worst environmental impacts of its actions, Beijing also threatens the global economy and global health by unsustainably exploiting natural resources and exporting its willful disregard for the environment through its One Belt One Road initiative.”Further talking about the OBOR project, more commonly known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the report states that it “aspires to create a network of enhanced overland and maritime trade routes to better link China with the world. However, the implementation of BRI lacks clear environmental guidelines, safety standards, and worker protections”.“Many BRI-funded projects do not meet international standards, leaving countries to deal with the harmful consequences long after a project is completed. Environmental safeguards depend on the laws of host countries, and Beijing is leading nations away from developing their economies sustainably,” the report further added. The report also raised concerns about China’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, as the country has been the world’s largest annual greenhouse gas emitter since 2006. “China’s total emissions are twice that of the United States and nearly one-third of all emissions globally,” it said. Besides, China is also the world’s largest consumer of legal and illegal wildlife, and it has been identified as a Focus Country under the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act, the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-threatens-global-economy-health-by-exploiting-natural-resources-us/story-B14L9yMi9rDdLQnNKkOwEP.html
02-10-2020||World||Trump moves Wisconsin rally amid surge in Covid-19 cases||President Donald Trump moved a planned western Wisconsin appearance to elsewhere in the state amid calls from a city mayor and the state’s governor, both Democrats, that he not hold a rally there due to a surge in coronavirus cases.The director of the La Crosse airport said the event was canceled due to a lease issue, not concerns over the coronavirus.Wisconsin ranks third among states for per-capita increases in cases over the past two weeks. State health officials reported 2,887 newly confirmed cases on Thursday, a new daily record, along with 21 more deaths. The state has now seen 125,161 cases and 1,348 deaths since the pandemic began.Trump replaced the La Crosse rally with one in Janesville about 175 miles away where the virus is not spreading quite as rapidly. He’s also holding a rally Saturday in Green Bay. Both will be outside at airports. Trump’s decision to visit Janesville prompted authorities there to also request that Trump reconsider.Both La Crosse and Green Bay have been identified as a “red zone” for community spread of Covid-19 by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Janesville is not on the list.The coronavirus task force report urged social distancing in “red zones” to the “maximum degree possible.” Trump rallies typically draw many thousands of people, who crowd closely together, shouting and cheering -- the vast majority without masks.A political rally violated the terms of the La Crosse airport’s lease with Colgan Air Service, which planned to host the rally, airport director Ian Turner said.“The tenant was notified of this, disagreed with the City of La Crosse’ position, but opted not to host the event,” Turner said in a statement. Kelly Colgan Hammen, president of the private air service where the rally was to be held, did not immediately return a message.“The tenant was notified of this, disagreed with the City of La Crosse’ position, but opted not to host the event,” Turner said in a statement. He did not identify who the tenant was.Trump made a similar move last month, changing his plans for large airport rallies in Nevada after local officials warned they would violate the state’s ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. There is no statewide limit on gatherings in Wisconsin after Republicans successfully challenged the Democratic governor’s “safer at home” order this spring.State and local health officials in Wisconsin urged attendees to follow local guidelines but stopped short of asking Trump not to come.A collaborative of health care organizations in La Crosse, including Gundersen Health System, Mayo Clinic Health System and La Crosse County, recommends that people avoid anyplace where people aren’t wearing masks or physical distancing. They also recommend limiting outdoor gatherings to no more than 100 people.“Masks and physical distancing should be required,” according to guidance released Wednesday by the health collaborative. “Venues should consider cancelling or rescheduling any large gatherings planned for the next 14 days.”As of Thursday, La Crosse County had reported 3,205 cases and three deaths. The state listed the activity level of Covid-19 as “very high.”Brown County, where Green Bay is located, has had 9,796 cases and 66 deaths. The number of positive cases over the past two weeks was up 24%, according to the state Department of Health Services.In Rock County, where Janesville is located, virus activity is listed as “high,” one level lower than Brown and La Crosse counties.Rock County Board Chairwoman Kara Purviance said in a statement that the county is seeing its highest number of active cases yet, and she hoped Trump would reconsider. But if the rally proceeds, she said, she urges residents to follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks.Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said he hoped Trump would cancel his visit to the state. If Trump holds a rally in Wisconsin he should insist his supporters wear masks and not let them in if they refuse, the governor said.“He can control this,” Evers said.Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt defended the president coming to Wisconsin, saying his supporters get energized by his in-person appearances.“We’re going to take precautions,” Hitt said. “We’re going to make sure we have masks, we’re going to encourage people to wear masks. ... We need to make sure we’re open and tell people, ‘Look if you think you’ve been exposed please do not come.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-moves-wisconsin-rally-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-hnhXPP8RIJlaW4NpODSiTJ.html
02-10-2020||World||Nearly 20,000 Amazon workers in US tested positive for Covid-19||Amazon said Thursday that nearly 20,000 of its front-line US workers have tested positive or been presumed positive for the virus that causes Covid-19.But the online retail behemoth, revealing the data for the first time, said that the infection rate of its employees was well below that seen in the general US population. The disclosure comes after months of pressure from Amazon workers and labour groups calling for the company to divulge the Cpvid-19 numbers.Amazon said in a corporate blog that it provided the data as part of its effort to keep employees informed, and to share details and best practices with governments and other companies.”We hope other large companies will also release their detailed learnings and case rates because doing so will help all of us,” Amazon said. “This is not an arena where companies should compete — this is an arena where companies should help one another.”The Seattle-based company said that it examined data from March 1 to Sept. 19 on 1.37 million workers at Amazon and Whole Foods Market across the US.It said it compared the Covid-19 case rates to the general population, as reported by Johns Hopkins University for the same period. Based on that analysis, if the rate among Amazon and Whole Foods employees were the same as that for the general population, it estimated it would have seen 33,952 cases among its workforce. That is 42% higher that Amazon’s actual rate.The company also said it is conducting thousands of tests a day, which will grow to 50,000 tests a day across 650 sites by November.Companies have no legal obligation to publicly reveal how many of their workers have contracted the virus, and few are doing so.Employers do have to provide a safe working environment, which means they must alert staff if they might have been exposed to the virus, according to guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency that enforces workplace safety. They are also obligated to keep track of Covid-19 infections contracted on the job, and must report to OSHA if there is a hospitalization or death related to the disease.A perceived lack of transparency has left workers at various retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, to become amateur sleuths in their spare time. Unions and advocate groups have taken up the cause, too, creating lists or building online maps of stores where workers can self-report cases they know about.Walmart had said in July that its Covid-19 cases track with the rest of the country, but didn’t explain why it doesn’t provide numbers.Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery and meatpacking workers, called Amazon’s disclosure as “the most damning evidence we have seen that corporate America has completely failed to protect our country’s frontline workers in this pandemic.”UFCW is calling for immediate action by federal regulators and a full congressional investigation.“This titanic safety failure demands the highest level of scrutiny,” Perrone said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-20-000-amazon-workers-in-us-tested-positive-for-covid-19/story-pH2Ofv5RKHOSoP4luFnuYL.html
02-10-2020||World||US Senate panel moves to compel Facebook, Google, Twitter CEOs to testify||A Senate panel voted Thursday to compel testimony from the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter as lawmakers opened a new front in the battle over hate speech, misinformation and perceived political bias on social media a month before the presidential election.The Senate Commerce Committee authorized subpoenas for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey to force them to appear at a planned hearing if they do not agree to do so voluntarily.The executives’ testimony is needed “to reveal the extent of influence that their companies have over American speech during a critical time in our democratic process,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who heads the committee.The committee’s unanimous vote marked the start of a new bipartisan initiative against Big Tech companies, which have been under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from state attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech.Facebook, meanwhile, is expanding restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. The new prohibitions laid out in a blog post come days after President Donald Trump raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process during a debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden.A new review by The Associated Press found that Facebook and Twitter still aren’t enforcing even the limited restrictions they’ve recently put in place to stem the tide of dangerous material from QAnon, with an audience of millions on their platforms. The two companies had promised to stop encouraging the growth of the baseless conspiracy theory, which fashions Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and government officials.A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on the committee’s subpoena action. Representatives of Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.With Trump leading the way, conservative Republicans have kept up a barrage of criticism of Silicon Valley’s social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative views.The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms, putting down a legislative marker in Trump’s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.At a White House event last week, officials said the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Attorney General William Barr said the administration will also seek legislation to let individuals pursue legal claims against online platforms for “bad-faith censorship.”Democrats, on the other hand, have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists.The three CEOs are being summoned to testify as the Justice Department moves toward antitrust action against Google with a focus on the company’s dominance in online search and whether it was used to stifle competition and hurt consumers.A bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also has been investigating Google’s business practices. They have cited “potential monopolistic behavior.”Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell ads.Facebook, Amazon and Apple have also been targets of sweeping antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.In the House, a judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan investigation of Big Tech’s market dominance. Zuckerberg and Pichai as well as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook testified at a highly charged hearing by the panel in July.The subcommittee, which is expected to issue a report on its findings soon, held a hearing Thursday at which experts discussed proposals to strengthen the antitrust laws and promote competition among Big Tech companies.Speaking of the July hearing with the four CEOs, panel chairman Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said, “We pressed them for answers about their business practices, including about the evidence we uncovered that they have exploited, entrenched and expanded their power in anti-competitive and abusive ways.”“To put it simply, their answers were evasive,” Cicilline said. “Änd they raised new questions about whether they believe their companies are beyond oversight.”__Follow Gordon on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mgordonap||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-moves-to-compel-facebook-google-twitter-ceos-to-testify/story-hHns4RkB7jIwhbAjuWC4CJ.html
02-10-2020||World||Critical moment, says PM Johnson, as new Covid-19 cases surge||After months of low numbers of new cases and deaths, a new real-time study showed higher prevalence of the coronavirus across the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing the situation as a “critical moment”. As of Wednesday evening, 7,108 new cases were reported across the UK – more than the daily peaks in April and May, prompting renewed concern and more restrictions in several areas, particularly in north England.Facing criticism from Labour over the government’s handling of the pandemic, Johnson implored people to follow guidelines, as they did earlier this year, when the virus was suppressed for months, before resurging in September.Another national lockdown remains an option, he declared.As government’s top experts cautioned about “things going in the wrong direction”, Johnson said: “(No) matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this, and that’s by showing a collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the safety of others”.“At this critical moment, when I know people will be wanting to know the details, I will be providing regular updates through these press conferences. And I have to be clear, that if the evidence requires it, we will not hesitate to take further measures that would, I’m afraid, be more costly than the ones we have put into effect now”.Johnson adopted a markedly different approach from that of chancellor Rishi Sunak, who last week exhorted Britons to “learn to live with it (coronavirus) and live without fear”, while outlining new measures to protect millions of jobs affected by the pandemic.Johnson said: “I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say, I profoundly disagree”.“And I don’t think it’s what the British people want, I don’t think they want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do,” he added.Researchers at Imperial College London said an interim report from the largest testing programme has found high infection prevalence across the UK and that cases have continued to rise, based on results from swab tests carried out by more than 80,000 people out of a total of 150,000, taken between September 18 and 26.The biggest rise in cases was found in those aged over 65, which saw seven times as many cases as previously. A similar increase was found in those aged between 55-64. Young people continued to have the highest rates of infection, with 1 in 100 estimated to have the virus.The reproduction (R) number decreased from 1.7 to 1.1 but with a wide possible range for the recent value of 0.7 to 1.5. This suggests that the rate of new infections has decreased, but an R above 1 would mean cases will continue to rise if current trends continue.Paul Elliott, director of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT 1) at the college, said: “While our latest findings show some early evidence that the growth of new cases may have slowed, suggesting efforts to control the infection are working, the prevalence of infection is the highest that we have recorded to date”.“This reinforces the need for protective measures to limit the spread of the disease and the public’s adherence to these, which will be vital to minimise further significant illness and loss of life from Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/critical-moment-says-pm-johnson-as-new-covid-19-cases-surge/story-ZHwzGuEPqMWUdMGjc76GzN.html
02-10-2020||World||Navalny blames Putin, Kremlin links him with CIA||The Kremlin on Thursday accused opposition politician Alexei Navalny of working with the CIA after Navalny said he believed President Vladimir Putin was behind the suspected poisoning that put him in a coma in Germany.The accusation from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appears to be the first time the Russian authorities have directly accused Putin’s highest-profile critic of working with a foreign intelligence agency.It raises the stakes should Navalny fulfil a pledge to return to Russia, and may add to pressure on Western leaders, especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to take action over his case.Navalny responded by saying he would sue Peskov over the accusation, challenging him to present evidence to back it up. His aide Lyubov Sobol called the allegation “complete gibberish”.Navalny, 44, emerged in recent weeks from a coma after suddenly falling ill in during a flight in Siberia and being air-lifted to Berlin for treatment. German doctors say he was poisoned with novichok, a rare Russian nerve agent.“I believe that Putin is behind the crime and I don’t have any other versions of what happened,” Navalny told Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine in an interview published on Thursday.Peskov said Navalny’s allegations against Putin were unacceptable, groundless and insulting.“It’s not the patient working with Western intelligence, it’s Western intelligence working with him. That would be more accurate. There is such information. I can even say definitely - specialists of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency are working with him currently,” the Kremlin spokesman said.In response, Navalny wrote on his website: “Firstly, I am suing Peskov.”“And secondly, I demand the publication of proof and facts, demonstrating my ‘work with CIA specialists’. Show it on television at prime time. You have my permission.”You know you are dyingGermany and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Navalny’s illness. Russia says it has seen no firm evidence he was poisoned and denies involvement in any attack on him.In a separate development, Russian news agency RIA said Moscow had invited experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to come to Russia to cooperate on the Navalny case.Germany requested the OPCW’s assistance last month. Russia has criticised both Berlin and the agency for what it says is their refusal to share information.Navalny has posted on social media about his recovery, but the interview with Der Spiegel was the first he has given to a major news organisation since regaining consciousness.He told Der Spiegel he would return to Russia.“My task is now to remain fearless. And I have no fear! If my hands are shaking, it’s because of the poison, not out of fear. I will not give Putin the gift of not returning,” he said.Describing the moment that the poison began to take effect, Navalny said: “You don’t feel any pain but you know you’re dying.” He said he was making a steady recovery and was now relearning how to balance on one leg.Navalny has tormented the Kremlin for years with online videos in which he details the lavish lifestyles and undeclared wealth of senior officials he castigates as “swindlers and thieves”.In a country where opposition figures have little access to traditional politics, his anti-corruption campaign has become one of the few successful outlets for popular discontent. He and his wife are now living in a rented flat in Berlin, but he said he would only resume posting videos once he was back in Russia. “I do not want to be the opposition leader in exile.”The politician, who was visited at his hospital bedside by Merkel, said he felt a personal bond to Germany and was impressed by Merkel’s knowledge of Russia.“My impression is that Merkel needs no advice from me,” he said. “But any Russia strategy must account for the depth of madness that Putin has now reached.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-alexei-navalny-accuses-vladimir-putin-of-being-behind-poisoning/story-QZhNgiKtUs5RGy9K66EH6I.html
