On Thursday US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said the insurgents had agreed to reduce attacks and casualties.Asked about Milley’s comments, O’Brien said that as Trump’s top advisor, he represents the president’s view.“When I’m speaking, I’m speaking for the president,” he said.He said Trump’s call for troops to be home by Christmas was more sentimental, that all presidents have called for the same thing in past wars.“All presidents .... want the troops home by Christmas,” he said.“We’re on a path right now that looks like about 4,500 this fall and a smaller number in January-February. But if the conditions permitted, we’d love to get people out earlier,” he said.“And I think that’s the desire the president was expressing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-afghan-troop-cuts-in-early-2021-says-prez-trump-s-aide/story-gFNgo7Wn8t28zxSi684eJJ.html
16-10-2020||World||Trump, Biden spar on televised town hall events, from afar||US President Donald Trump defended his handling of Covid-19, while his Democratic challenger Joe Biden accused him of panicking, in a split-screen showdown at duelling town hall events that were telecast live simultaneously from two cities.President Trump was in Miami, Florida for his event on Thursday night with NBC News and Biden was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the interaction hosted by ABC News.Trump challenged the moderator Savannah Guthrie, questioning her motivation in several testy exchanges. His campaign slammed her later as a surrogate for Biden. Biden was his usual self — soft-spoken and respectful of the moderator, George Stephanopoulos, and the audience.Trump trails Biden by 8.9 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls and by 10.5 points in the FiveThirtyEight average of polls. With polling set to close — nearly 18 million Americans have already voted — on November 3, the president faces an uphill task.“We have done an amazing job, and it’s rounding the corner,” Trump said, repeating the rosy picture on the pandemic that has killed more than 217,000 Americans and infected nearly 8 million.Asked about his own Covid-19 bout, Trump sounded evasive. “I probably did,” he said when asked if he had tested on the day of his first, in-person, debate with Biden. “Possibly I did, possibly I didn’t.” He and the first lady had tested positive the day after the September 29 debate.At an election rally earlier in the day, Trump lashed out at Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top epidemiologist, who has publicly disagreed with the president many times, calling him a Democrat.An exchange on QAnon, a far right conspiracy theory that the president was battling a global cabal of pedophiles, turned testy during the townhall. “I know nothing about QAnon,” he said at first. When the moderator said she just had told him about it, he shot back, “You told me, but that doesn’t necessarily make it fact.” He went on to say they were against pedophilia.“He said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic,” Biden said referring to an interview Trump gave to Bob Woodward for the book Rage in which he said he knew early on about the severity of the illness but had kept it from Americans as he did not want them to panic.“Americans don’t panic,” said Biden, “He panicked.”The former vice-president was evasive himself, however, on the question of expanding the Supreme Court bench — called court-packing — that has been suggested by some Democrats to offset its overwhelming 6-3 conservative tilt when Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s nominee, joins it after confirmation.“No matter what answer I gave you, if I say it, that’s the headline,” the former vice-president said. Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris have dodged a straight answer to the question before, using the same line of reasoning, that they do not want to distract attention from Republicans ramming Barrett’s nomination in the final weeks of the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-spar-on-televised-tv-town-hall-events-from-afar/story-qgex11ECf9B3S0O4zqiThL.html
16-10-2020||World||Coronavirus at ‘turning point’ in Europe, hitting at-risk groups||Doctors are warning that Europe is at a turning point as the coronavirus surges back across the continent, including among vulnerable people, and governments try to impose restrictions without locking whole economies down.With newly confirmed cases reaching records, the Czech Republic has shut schools and is building a field hospital, Poland has limited restaurant hours and closed gyms and schools, and France is planning a 9 p.m. curfew in Paris and other big cities. In Britain, authorities are closing pubs and bars in areas in the country’s north, while putting limits on socializing in London and other parts of the country.“This is a serious situation that should not be underestimated. It is serious on a European level,’’ Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said Friday.Europe is not alone in seeing a resurgence. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, and deaths per day are climbing in 30.“If we don’t get a handle on this, we run the risk of getting into a situation that’s harder to control,” Bertrand Levrat, the head of Switzerland’s biggest hospital complex, told The Associated Press. “We are really at a turning point — things can go both ways.”But while officials are sounding the alarm on rising cases, they are also wary of imposing the stricter nationwide lockdowns that devastated their economies this spring. Instead, they are trying more targeted restrictions.France is deploying 12,000 extra police to enforce its new curfew; Saturday night will be the first time establishments will be forced to close at 9 p.m. Restaurants, cinemas and theaters are trying to figure out how can survive the forced early closures.Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot told Le Parisien newspaper she is negotiating for exceptions to a monthlong curfew across the Paris region and eight other metropolitan areas.One movie theater chain will start opening at 8 a.m. in hopes of making up evening losses. Since Paris restaurants generally open at 7 or 7:30 p.m. for dinner, some might close altogether because it no longer makes financial sense to stay open for such a short shift.“The French culture world isn’t invincible, it needs help,” author and filmmaker Yoann Sfar, who has a new movie coming out, said Friday on RTL radio.Italy, the first country outside of Asia to detect local transmission of the virus, has banned pickup sports and public gatherings after health officials said the resurgence had reached ‘’an acute phase’’ following a period of relative grace after its particularly strict lockdown.Speranza, the health minister, told reporters that any new measures in Italy, including a curfew, need to be “well-considered.” But the governor of Campania, which was mostly spared in the spring but is seeing infections skyrocket, urged quick action, saying the area around Naples is the most densely populated in the country and therefore especially vulnerable.“Half measures are not worth anything anymore,’‘ Vincenzo de Luca said in a Facebook video. He already announced the closure of schools for the rest of the month, against the wishes of Rome and the protests of parents.Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Milan’s Luigi Sacco hospital, said Italy’s surge — which hit pandemic highs of new daily infections this week — is not the result of record testing, as policy makers have suggested, but a sign of a real return among the population most at risk of developing serious illness if infected.That is a worrying trend since a tide of serious cases has the potential to swamp hospitals, and it’s one that can be seen in other countries on the continent as many see even higher numbers than Italy.France, Spain and Britain recorded more than 300 infections per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks, compared to Italy’s quickening but relatively low 106.The Czech Republic reported over 700 people infected per 100,000, and the country’s military will start to build a field hospital at Prague’s exhibition center this weekend — a reminder of the dark days of spring when many countries put up makeshift facilities to ease pressure on overwhelmed medical centers. The government is also negotiating with neighboring Germany and some other countries for Czechs to be treated abroad if the health system can’t handle them.In Italy, Milan is the epicenter of the resurgence, and it, too, is seeing its hospitals strained. Sacco’s COVID-19 ward was the first in the city to begin filling up.“We have a situation that reminds one quite distressingly of the one that we already have experienced,’’ Galli told The Associated Press, referring to the peak in March and April when Italy hit its record of 969 deaths in one day. The country recorded 83 deaths on Thursday — twice previous days, but far off earlier levels.Already in Milan, Galli said that the number of elderly patients or those with other risk factors is growing, indicating the virus has moved beyond its initial late September’s expansion, when most of the cases were mild or asymptomatic caught by screening and contact tracing.Since then, mixing among families, within companies, and among students outside of school has fueled the spread to more vulnerable people, he said, renewing pressure on Milan’s hospitals.“The trend is already there, and it is frankly alarming,’’ he said, though he noted that not all of Italy was yet experiencing a surge.But that, he said, might only be a matter of time. Galli said Italy ’’will follow in the footsteps″ of its European neighbors unless the transmission chain is blocked in the next two weeks.Galli fears that new nationwide restrictions adopted over the past two weeks — including mandatory masks outdoors, a ban on pickup sports games among friends and restaurant closures at midnight — are not enough. He urged more restrictions be imposed on public transport and leisure activities if authorities want to avoid another lockdown — bad both for the economy and the social fabric.While Italy’s lockdown in the spring bought it more time, Galli said the current resurgence shows “how quickly there is a risk of wasting the results of even a very decisive and very important intervention.’’___Charlton reported from Paris.___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-at-turning-point-in-europe-hitting-at-risk-groups/story-0zVDu9e0UGy9j8D2monwHK.html
16-10-2020||World||Indian-origin men, women face higher death risk from Covid-19 in England: Report||Men and women belonging Indian ethnicity communities in England an d Wales are roughly 50-75% more likely to die of Covid-19 than white men and women, according to a latest statistical analysis released in London on Friday. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which concluded a similar ethnic variation in relation to the impact of coronavirus earlier this year, updated its figures this week and also found that the factors behind the disparity were more linked to living arrangements and the nature of jobs rather than pre-existing health conditions.“Considering deaths up to 28 July 2020, males and females of Black and South Asian ethnic background were shown to have increased risks of death involving the coronavirus (Covid-19) compared with those of white ethnic background; this is similar to our previous findings for deaths up to 15 May 2020,” the ONS report said.“These findings show that ethnic differences in mortality involving Covid-19 are most strongly associated with demographic and socio-economic factors, such as place of residence and occupational exposures, and cannot be explained by pre-existing health conditions using hospital data or self-reported health status,” it adds.The results also reveal that for all ethnicities, males have a higher rate of death from the virus than females, and white people have a lower risk of death than all other ethnic groups apart from Chinese. In its previous analysis, ONS had taken Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic groups as combined and after separating the two ethnicities, it found that males of Bangladeshi ethnic background have a higher risk of death from Covid-19 than those of Pakistani background.“Today’s report confirms that when adjusting for age, rates of death involving Covid-19 remain greater for most ethnic minority groups, and most notably so for people of Black African, Black Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnic background,” said Ben Humberstone, Deputy Director of ONS Health and Life Events Division.The report used hospital data, together with self-reported health or disability, to explore whether differences in mortality rate between people of different ethnicities could be down to differences in the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes, respiratory failure and heart failure.“Our statistical modelling shows that a large proportion of the difference in the risk of Covid-19 mortality between ethnic groups can be explained by demographic, geographical and socioeconomic factors, such as where you live or the occupation you’re in,” Humberstone said.‘It also found that although specific pre-existing conditions place people at greater risk of COVID-19 mortality generally, it does not explain the remaining ethnic background differences in mortality,” said Humberstone.The updated ONS findings reiterate other reports, including by the government-backed Public Health England (PHE), which found similar ethnic disparities in the impact of the deadly virus.“This is yet more evidence of the devastating and disproportionate impact that Covid-19 has on Black African, Black Caribbean and South Asian people in particular,” said Marsha de Cordova, Opposition Labour Party’s Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities.“The government promised action but, over four months since Public Health England (PHE) set out seven clear recommendations on what needs to happen, we still don’t know what has actually been done. The government must act urgently as infections continue to rise rapidly,” she said.A further government-initiated review into the factors behind the ethnic variations in the impact of Covid-19 unearthed by the PHE report back in June remains ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-men-women-face-higher-death-risk-from-covid-19-in-england-report/story-SoEpkX9lTAdjn9qZdxYGWP.html
16-10-2020||World||Donald Trump predicts a red wave for him in US elections||US President Donald Trump has predicted a massive Republican sweep in the November 3 elections, even as multiple polls have shown him trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden nationally and in many swing states. “Polls numbers are looking very strong. Big crowds, great enthusiasm. Massive RED WAVE coming!!!” said the president in a tweet after four days of his re-election campaign this week, when he resumed his campaign rallies that were paused after he tested positive with Covid-19 on October 1.The rallies are drawing a significantly large crowd despite the social distancing measures in place in the country due to Covid-19.“We are going to have a red wave,” Trump told his supporters in the Greenville city of North Carolina, a battleground states where some 10,000 people came to listen to him on a weekday afternoon. “This is a hell of a crowd for 1:30 in the afternoon,” Trump said. “Our people want to go, they want to vote. It’s going to be a big, beautiful, red wave,” he said later in his speech.However, the mainstream media in its polls are predicting a nearly double-digit lead for former vice president Biden. Till a week ago, according to Real Clear Politics, which keeps track of all major national polls, Biden’s national lead was around 11 percentage points, with some of the polls giving the Democratic challenger a lead of more than 15 per cent.Real Clear Politics tracker on Friday said that Biden’s national average lead was 8.9 percentage points against Trump. In the battleground states, Biden is leading by 4.5 percentage points, which is considered to be a significant one ahead of the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-predicts-a-red-wave-for-him-in-us-elections/story-APQrOopYleWlw38NdSnfrO.html
16-10-2020||World||Global economic pain from coronavirus is far from over: IMF||The guardians of the global economy this week confronted a sobering view of the pandemic’s long-term impact six months after it shut down much of the world, though with some reason to be more upbeat.“The story is less dire than we thought three months ago, but dire nonetheless,” International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said during annual meetings with the World Bank that were held virtually. She and her colleagues warned that policy makers must not prematurely end support in order to avoid setbacks.Unprecedented central bank action and $12 trillion of fiscal support helped stave off a deeper collapse, leaving the global economy poised to rebound to pre-pandemic output next year on strong growth forecast for China.Here are some of key takeaways from the proceedings:Economic Pain and ProgressThe IMF forecast a 4.4% global contraction for this year, the deepest since the Great Depression but less than its prior estimate of 5.2% in June. Policy responses around the world have propelled debt to record levels that most governments haven’t yet begun to fully confront.In the US and other advanced economies, that means a couple years of acute pain even with fiscal stimulus and monetary policy easing the blow. Suffering may last longer in Latin America, where the fund sees average per capita income remaining below 2015 levels through 2025.Fiscal and monetary steps have helped cushion the world from an even uglier outcome, but the endgame can’t come until there’s a medical fix.“Until we have a durable exit from the health crisis, we will be faced with difficulties, uncertainty, and uneven recovery,” Georgieva said Wednesday after a meeting with Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers.China Leads the WayChina’s taming the virus has safeguarded its economy and made the nation just about the only bright spot.Overall, the fund sees global output by the end of 2021 being 0.6% higher than at the end of 2019, before the pandemic, but that’s driven almost entirely by China. Most other nations, including the US, will need to wait until at least 2022 to see full recovery to pre-virus levels.The world’s second-largest economy will boost its share of global growth to 27.7% in 2025, almost triple that of the US, according to Bloomberg calculations using IMF data.Meanwhile, the Asian nation is also owed almost 60% of the bilateral debt that the world’s poorest countries are due to repay this year, making Beijing’s participation in debt relief a key factor in the recovery prospects for crisis-stricken nations.Help for the PoorestWhile extending temporary debt relief for the world’s poorest nations until mid-2021 is a good step, the Bretton Woods institutions and some countries see the move as just delaying inevitable write-offs.The debt of the 73 poorest nations eligible for the G-20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative climbed to a record $744 billion last year, according to the World Bank. So far, they’ve had just $5 billion in relief from the program. The European Network on Debt and Development likened the relief to “draining out the Titanic with a bucket” and argued it only pushed debt risk further down the road.World Bank President David Malpass called on banks and investment firms to provide more relief, adding that “private creditors and non-participating bilateral creditors should not be allowed to free-ride on the debt relief of others,” an implicit criticism of China. Georgieva also lamented the lack of progress, while the G-20 planned another meeting to push ahead on the issue and said that it could issue another six-month extension of debt relief next year.Spending to the RescueThe IMF underscored that countries shouldn’t prematurely remove fiscal stimulus and signaled that additional US measures would be welcome. While the IMF forecast 3.1% growth in the world’s largest economy next year, it said another round of stimulus like the package passed in March could add about 2 percentage points to the expansion pace.Still, the IMF warns that soaring debt eventually will challenge policy makers as the global ratio of borrowing to gross domestic product reaches a record 100% this year and is poised to keep climbing. While low interest rates and faster growth will help, the fund says countries must think about how to boost revenues through digital taxes and from high-income earners.Brace for Climate ChangeThe climate crisis also was a key topic of discussion, with Georgieva warning that the virus is just a preview of the looming global challenge.“If you don’t like the pandemic, you’re not going to like the climate crisis one iota,” she said in a panel with Larry Fink. The BlackRock chief executive officer said that the pandemic is accelerating the need to confront climate change, and that the private sector is doing more than governments to tackle the problem.Regulators and corporations are facing greater pressure to set universal standards for the growing sustainable finance industry. Climate solutions are fast becoming a key business for banks and fund managers given the need for trillions of dollars in investment in everything from renewable energy to electric vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-economic-pain-from-coronavirus-is-far-from-over-imf/story-0jD6g1nVf7TmiXgjH4OZSK.html
16-10-2020||World||India ready for further cooperation with Sri Lanka in water, sanitation, agriculture, manufacturing||The Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay, has called on Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa during which he conveyed that New Delhi was ready for further cooperation with Colombo in water, sanitation, agriculture and manufacturing in accordance with Sri Lanka’s requirements.This was the first meeting between Baglay and Rajapaksa after the Virtual Bilateral Summit (VBS) between the Prime Ministers of India and Sri Lanka on September 26. The Thursday’s meeting provided an excellent opportunity to follow up on the implementation of the decisions taken in that high-level interaction last month, Indian High Commission said in a statement.“The Indian High Com. Gopal Baglay and I met as a follow up to the virtual summit I had with PM Modi. I highlighted water & sanitation as priorities for #lka & we explored the possibility of collaborating with PM @narendramodi’s ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ (Water for Life Mission) project,” Rajapaksa tweeted. Jal Jeevan Mission is a project by the Centre to provide safe and adequate drinking tap water connection to every household in the rural areas of the country by 2024 at a service level of 55 litres per capita per day. The mission was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15, 2019.“Furthermore I requested the H.C. to look into the opportunities in the pharmaceutical sector and encourage Indian investors to establish research and manufacturing facilities in Sri Lanka to help the country meet its requirement of medicinal drugs,” he added.In the context of the Government of Sri Lanka’s high priority attached to water, sanitation, agriculture and manufacturing, the High Commissioner referred to India’s recent experience in these areas and stated that India was ready for developing further bilateral cooperation in accordance with Sri Lanka’s requirements.According to the Indian High Commission statement, Baglay responded positively to the suggestions of the Prime Minister Rajapaksa for Indian investment in research and manufacturing in Sri Lanka, including in the pharmaceutical sector.Referring to the tone set by the PM Modi and Rajapaksa in the VBS for expanding existing mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation in a number of areas, the High Commissioner sought the guidance of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister for further steps, including in the spheres of priority to Sri Lanka.“The High Commissioner mentioned to the Prime Minister that he and his colleagues in the High Commission had fruitful discussions in the days since VBS with a number of senior members of Sri Lanka’s Council of Ministers, including in the areas of the economy, connectivity, power and energy, agriculture and animal husbandry, development cooperation, education &capacity building, water and sanitation, health and pharmaceuticals, culture and people-to-people relations,” the statement read. Recalling the importance attached by Prime Minister Modi to promoting people-to-people relations between the two countries, the High Commissioner stressed in this context the significance of the grant assistance of USD 15 million announced by Prime Minister Modi during VBS for promoting Buddhist ties between the two countries.He mentioned that details of its implementation are being discussed with the Sri Lankan authorities concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-ready-for-further-cooperation-with-sri-lanka-in-water-sanitation-agriculture-manufacturing/story-eew7IrpcGtskiNMSx8UUwI.html

Johnson disagreed. “If at all possible I want to avoid another national lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-johnson-threatens-to-force-manchester-into-covid-19-lockdown/story-ye75buKxpSjlaRueUyOYkI.html
16-10-2020||World||WHO study finds remdesivir didn’t help Covid-19 patients||A large study led by the World Health Organization suggests that the antiviral drug remdesivir did not help hospitalized Covid-19 patients, in contrast to an earlier study that made the medicine a standard of care in the United States and many other countries.The results announced Friday do not negate the previous ones, and the WHO study was not as rigorous as the earlier one led by the US National Institutes of Health. But they add to concerns about how much value the pricey drug gives because none of the studies have found it can improve survival.The drug has not been approved for Covid-19 in the US, but it was authorized for emergency use after the previous study found it shortened recovery time by five days on average. It’s approved for use against Covid-19 in the United Kingdom and Europe, and is among the treatments US President Donald Trump received when he was infected earlier this month.The WHO study involved more than 11,000 patients in 30 countries. About 2,750 were randomly assigned to get remdesivir. The rest got either the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, the immune-system booster interferon, the antiviral combo lopinavir-ritonavir, or just usual care. The other drugs have largely been ruled out for Covid-19 by previous studies, but not remdesivir.Death rates after 28 days, the need for breathing machines and time in the hospital were relatively similar for those given remdesivir versus usual care.The results have not been published in a journal or reviewed by independent scientists, but were posted on a site researchers use to share results quickly.“The big story is the finding that remdesivir produces no meaningful impact on survival,” Martin Landray, an Oxford University professor who led other coronavirus treatment research, said in a statement.“This is a drug that has to be given by intravenous infusion for five to 10 days,” and costs about $2,550 per treatment course, he said. “COVID affects millions of people and their families around the world. We need scalable, affordable and equitable treatments.”Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, attributed the difference in the conclusions of the two studies to the fact WHO’s was larger.“It’s just a much higher-powered study,” she said. “It’s quadruple the number of people in all the other studies.”However, Dr. Andre Kalil, a University of Nebraska infectious disease specialist who helped lead the US remdesivir study, said the WHO one was poorly designed, which makes its conclusions less reliable. Patients and doctors knew what treatment they were using, there was no placebo infusion to help avoid biased reporting of risks or benefits, there was little information about the severity of patients’ symptoms when treatments began and a lot of missing data, he said.“Poor quality study design cannot be fixed by a large sample size, no matter how large it is,” Kalil wrote in an email.Furthermore, the WHO study tested 10 days of remdesivir, so some patients may have been hospitalized longer than they needed to be just to finish treatment, making their length of stay look bad in comparison to others getting usual care.Remdesivir’s maker, Gilead Sciences, said in a statement that the results are inconsistent with more rigorous studies and have not been fully reviewed or published.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-study-finds-remdesivir-didn-t-help-covid-19-patients/story-MxSJUHFID8Fz56f8ODhsKI.html

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc still wants a deal, “but not at any price.”But even as they sniped, the two sides refused to shut the door on talks. Von der Leyen said EU negotiators would head to London next week as planned, “to intensify these negotiations.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she still believes it would be in both sides’ interest to have a deal.“No one, neither Britain nor the EU, wants an agreement at any price,” she told reporters in Brussels. “We are prepared to continue negotiating. We have seen light but of course also still shadows in the most recent negotiations, and if it is up to the European Union -- and me personally -- we should simply continue these talks.”The U.K. had threatened to walk away from negotiations if a deal was not struck by the EU summit that ends Friday.Johnson didn’t go that far, but ramped up the tension, saying the EU seemed to have given up on a deal. He said Britain would listen if there was “a fundamental change of approach” from Brussels.“As far as I can see they have abandoned the idea of a free trade deal. … Unless there is a fundamental change of approach we are going to go for the Australia solution,” he said in London.Australia has no comprehensive trade deal with the EU. Johnson’s Conservative government insists Britain can still thrive under those conditions, which would mean tariffs and other barriers between the U.K. and the EU, its biggest trading partner. But many economists say it would be devastating for many British businesses, which are already struggling with a huge economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic.Britain officially left the EU on January 31 but remains part of its economic structures until December 31. The two sides have been trying to strike a deal on trade and other relations before then, and say in practice it must be agreed this month if it is to be ratified by year’s end.Despite Johnson’s intransigent tone, U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Friday that gaps between the two sides were narrow.“There is a deal to be done but there needs to be flexibility on both sides,” he told the BBC. “It feels a little bit lacking from the European Union.”Raab said differences remained on only two issues: EU boats’ access to U.K. fishing waters, and “level playing field” rules to ensure fair economic competition between Britain and the bloc.“The issues are really narrow now,” Raab said.Months of talks have ground to a halt on the issues of fishing — highly symbolic for maritime nations on both sides — and rules to ensure common regulatory standards and fair competition. The EU fears the U.K. will gain an unfair advantage by slashing food, workplace and environmental standards and pumping state money into businesses once it is free of the bloc’s rules.Britain accuses the bloc of seeking to impose demands that it has not placed on other countries it has free trade deals with, such as Canada.“They want the continued ability to control our legislative freedom, our fisheries, in a way that is obviously unacceptable to an independent country,” Johnson said.French President Emmanuel Marcon said a deal “requires effort, particularly from the U.K.”“Let’s keep in mind that it is the U.K. that wanted to leave the EU and needs an agreement much more than we do,” he said in Brussels.Merkel, the veteran diplomat, sought to soothe tempers, saying that “we asked Britain to be willing to compromise. This of course means that we too have to make compromises.”Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said late Thursday that his team would be London-bound for more talks next week and planned to host negotiations in Brussels the week after that. Britain has not commented on that timetable.Trust between the two sides, already frayed by years of Brexit acrimony, took a nosedive last month when Johnson introduced legislation that breaches parts of the withdrawal agreement he himself signed with the EU only last year.The European Parliament, which must approve any deal, has vowed not to approve any trade deal if the U.K. government doesn’t withdraw this legislation. Britain says the bill, which has yet to become law, is needed as an insurance policy in case the EU behaves unreasonably after Brexit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-at-dead-end-again-talks-over-for-us-says-uk/story-tn1QqNuvBNWQiRoWNSf3xH.html
16-10-2020||World||Covid-19 deaths fuelled by ‘perfect storm’ of chronic illnesses: Study||The interaction of Covid-19 with the continued global rise in chronic illnesses and related risk factors such as obesity, high blood sugar and outdoor air pollution over the past 30 years has created a perfect storm, fuelling virus-related deaths in India and elsewhere, a new global study published on Friday says.The latest findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study published in The Lancet provide new insights on how well countries were prepared in terms of underlying health for the Covid-19 pandemic, and set out the scale of the challenge to protect against new pandemic threats.The study’s key findings on India include the country gaining more than a decade of life expectancy since 1990, rising from 59.6 years to 70.8 years in 2019, but there are wide inequalities between states, ranging from 77.3 years in Kerala to 66.9 years in Uttar Pradesh.The increase in healthy life expectancy (life without illness) in India, which was 60.5 years in 2019, has not been as dramatic as the growth of life expectancy, so people are living more years with illness and disability, it says.The largest contributors to increasing health loss in India over the last 30 years, it adds, were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, stroke, and a group of musculoskeletal disorders.The study says: “In 2019, the top-5 risk factors for death in India were air pollution (contributing to an estimated 1.67 million deaths), high blood pressure (1.47 million), tobacco use (1.23 million), poor diet (1.18 million), and high blood sugar (1.12 million)”.“Since 1990, India has made substantial gains in health, but child and maternal malnutrition is still the number-one risk factor for illness and death in India, contributing to more than 20% of the total disease burden in several states in northern India (Bihar and Uttar Pradesh)”. “High blood pressure is the third leading risk factor (after air pollution), responsible for 10-20% of all health loss in eight states in India, primarily in the south”, it adds.According to the study authors, the promise of disease prevention through government actions or incentives that enable healthier behaviours and access to health-care resources is not being realised around the world.“Most of these risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits. We are failing to change unhealthy behaviours, particularly those related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and behavioural research”, says Christopher Murray of the University of Washington, who led the research.Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, adds: “The syndemic nature of the threat we face demands that we not only treat each affliction, but also urgently address the underlying social inequalities that shape them—poverty, housing, education, and race, which are all powerful determinants of health.”“Covid-19 is an acute-on-chronic health emergency. And the chronicity of the present crisis is being ignored at our future peril. Non-communicable diseases have played a critical role in driving the more than 1 million deaths caused by Covid-19 to date, and will continue to shape health in every country after the pandemic subsides.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-deaths-fuelled-by-perfect-storm-of-chronic-illnesses-study/story-0zNvOrlPp4iCjuaoXRwYUO.html
16-10-2020||World||Vladimir Putin proposes yearlong extension of nuclear pact with US||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday made a strong call to save the last existing nuclear arms control pact between his country and the United States, proposing to extend it at least for one year.Putin’s statement comes amid conflicting signals from Russian and US diplomats about the fate of the New START treaty that is set to expire in February unless Moscow and Washington agree on its extension.Speaking at a meeting of his Security Council, Putin said that “it would be extremely sad if the treaty ceases to exist without being replaced by another fundamental document of the kind.”“All those years, the New START has worked, playing its fundamental role of limiting and containing an arms race,” he noted.The New START treaty was signed in 2010 by US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.After both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, New START is the only nuclear arms control deal between the two countries still standing.Russia previously offered its extension for five years without any conditions, while the US administration pushed for a new arms control agreement that would also include China. Moscow has described that idea as unfeasible, pointing at Beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its much-smaller nuclear arsenal.Putin on Friday proposed to “extend the existing treaty without any conditions for at least one year” to allow for “substantive talks.” He emphasized that Russia is ready to discuss the new weapons it deployed in future arms talks with the United States.Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov voiced skepticism about reaching a deal on New START, noting that Russia can’t accept the conditions put forward by the United States for its extension.Lavrov specified that Russia can’t agree to the US proposal to limit battlefield nuclear weapons alongside nuclear warheads that arm strategic missiles and bombers until the US agrees to withdraw its tactical nuclear weapons from Europe.He also noted that Moscow wouldn’t accept the US demand to have intrusive verification measures like those that existed in the 1990s when inspectors were positioned at missile factories.Lavrov’s pessimistic view contrasted with statements from US diplomats, who said that Moscow and Washington were close to a deal.“We would welcome the opportunity to complete an agreement based on understandings that were achieved over the last couple weeks about what the range of possibilities look like for an extension of New START and an outcome that benefits the entire world, increased stability of the most dangerous weapons in the world,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday.Pompeo said that “I am hopeful that the Russians will find a way to agree to an outcome that, frankly, I think is in their best interest and in our best interest,” and voiced hope that China will eventually join the talks too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-proposes-yearlong-extension-of-nuclear-pact-with-us/story-6gwQRZOohGyJTO7qeTINNO.html
16-10-2020||World||Study finds 4 drugs have little to no effect on Covid: WHO||The U.N. health agency says the world’s largest randomized trial of Covid-19 treatments found “conclusive evidence” that remdesivir, a drug used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump when he fell ill, has little or no effect on severe cases.The World Health Organization announced Friday the long-awaited results of its six-month “Solidarity Therapeutics Trial” that endeavored to see if existing drugs might have an effect on the coronavirus.The study, which was not peer-reviewed, found that four treatments tested — remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon — had “ little or no effect” on whether or not patients died within about a month or whether hospitalized patients recovered.Most of those had already been ruled out. But remdesivir, a repurposed malaria drug, has been classified as standard-of-care in the United States, and it has been approved for use against Covid-19 in the UK and EU. Supplies of the drug have been limited, and the European Medicines Agency is now reviewing whether remdesivir is causing kidney problems as reported by some patients.Martin Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University, said the WHO trial results for hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir were in line with a previous British study he co-led.“The big story is the finding that remdesivir produces no meaningful impact on survival,” he said in a statement. He said the drug is now recommended in some countries but there have been significant concerns about supply, cost and access.“This is a drug that has to be given by intravenous infusion for 5 to 10 days,” noting it costs about $2,550 per treatment course. “COVID affects millions of people and their families around the world. We need scalable, affordable, and equitable treatments.”A cocktail of treatments given to President Trump after he tested positive for the coronavirus included remdesivir.WHO said the study, which covered more than 30 countries, looked at the effects of the treatments on overall death rates, whether or not patients need breathing machines, and how much time patients spent recovering in hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-4-drugs-have-little-to-no-effect-on-covid-who/story-mqiKShWnup6JymSnK3D9SO.html

16-10-2020||World||Thailand’s prime minister rejects calls to resign, braces for renewed protest||Thailand’s prime minister rejected calls for his resignation on Friday as his government stepped up efforts to stop student-led protesters from rallying in the capital for a second day in defiance of a strict state of emergency.Police closed roads and put up barricades around a major Bangkok intersection where the protesters have vowed to gather again to push their core demands, including that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha leave office, the constitution be amended and the nation’s monarchy undergo reform.Police in riot gear moved into the area, while malls in the normally busy shopping district were closing early. Nearby mass transit stations were being closed to stop crowds of protesters from getting near the area. In addition to the security measures, heavy monsoon rains threatened to keep crowd numbers lower than the thousands that gathered the night before.The student protesters said they would simply rally just down the street at another large intersection.Prayuth’s government declared a strict new state of emergency for the capital on Thursday, a day after protesters gathered in a different part of the city heckled a royal motorcade. Such actions are unprecedented in Thailand, where those waiting for a royal motorcade regularly sit on the ground or prostrate themselves.Also Read | Thailand declares emergency due to unprecedented student uprisingThe state of emergency outlaws public gatherings of more than five people and bans the dissemination of news that is deemed to threaten national security. It also gives authorities broad powers, including detaining people at length without charge.Some 10,000 protesters defied the decree Thursday to rally at the Bangkok intersection.A number of protest leaders have already been rounded up since the decree went into effect. On Friday another two activists were arrested under a law covering violence against the queen for their alleged part in the heckling of the motorcade. They could face up to life in prison if convicted.The protest movement was launched in March by university students and its original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party.But the movement took a stunning turn in August, when students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and issued calls for its reform. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticised the king’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time outside the country.Thailand’s royal family has long been considered sacrosanct and a pillar of Thai identity. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key member of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.Conservative royalist Thais accuse the protest movement of seeking to end the monarchy, an allegation its leaders deny.Wednesday’s incident with the royal motorcade has stunned many Thais. Video that circulated widely showed members of a small crowd heckling a motorcade carrying Queen Suthida and Prince Dipangkorn as it slowly passed. Security personnel stood between the vehicles and the crowd and there was no visible violence and none was described by witnesses.Prayuth’s declaration of a state of emergency said the measure was necessary because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.” Prayuth said on Friday that he had no plans to resign as he had done nothing wrong. He said his government hopes it can drop the state of emergency ahead of its normal 30-day duration “if the situation improves quickly.” The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said at least 51 people have been arrested since Tuesday in connection with the protests.Police on Friday went to search the offices of the Progressive Movement, a group formed by former lawmakers from a reform-minded political party that was controversially dissolved by the Constitutional Court.The two activists charged over the incident with the queen are Ekachai Hongkangwan and Paothong Bunkueanum.Also Read | Thailand police arrest two students for disrupting Queen’s motorcadeEkachai is a veteran activist who has been physically attacked several times, in apparent response to his criticism of the military. Paothong, a university student, has been involved in organising the protests.The Wednesday incident in which the two were allegedly involved was stunning to most Thais, because by tradition and law, members of the royal family are treated with the utmost respect.The Ministry of Digital Economy, meanwhile, announced it would file complaints with police covering five Twitter accounts and five Facebook accounts inviting people to attend Friday’s rally. Such posting could be deemed illegal under the state of emergency, as well as other laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-s-prime-minister-rejects-calls-to-resign-braces-for-renewed-protest/story-3CaRAvdWvFf8KHyFeROc4M.html
16-10-2020||World||Joe Biden vows to repeal ‘Muslim ban’ imposed by Donald Trump admin if elected||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has vowed to include Muslim Americans in every social and political aspect in his administration as well as repeal President Donald Trump’s “Muslim ban” if voted to power.In a video message to Muslim Advocates, a civil rights organisation, on Thursday, Biden also promised to push lawmakers for legislation to fight the growing spike in hate crimes in the US. “As president, I’ll work with you to rip the poison of hate from our society to honour your contributions and seek your ideas. My administration will look like America, with Muslim Americans serving at every level,” he said. “On day one, I’ll end Trump’s unconstitutional Muslim ban. I’ll push Congress to pass hate crimes legislation. I’ll implement the national strategy I’ve laid out since March to beat Covid. I’ll end the deadly inequities in health care, education, and opportunity that this crisis has amplified. And together, we’ll rebuild the criminal justice system focused on redemption, not retribution,” Biden added.President Trump has imposed a controversial travel ban, often referred to by critics as a “Muslim ban”, on several Muslim majority countries, including Iran and Syria, through a series of executive orders. In February, the travel ban was expanded to include six additional countries, including Nigeria.Observing that Muslim American voices matter to the community and to the country, Biden claimed that the community haven’t always gotten the respect or representation they deserve under the Trump administration. “This is not who we are. Abraham Lincoln told us at Gettysburg, a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Instead of healing, we’re being ripped apart. And I refuse to let that happen. We have two brighter future to leave it shipwrecked on the shores of anger and division,” he said.“I said from the start. I’m running the United States country to embrace hope, not fear, light, not darkness, the future, not the past, and I’m going to appeal to the best of us, not our worst side. I mean, you all know better than anyone it’s in our power to change course, to organise, advocate, and to vote.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-to-repeal-muslim-ban-imposed-by-donald-trump-admin-if-elected/story-TSjTT1QocGllDbGKyhOa0N.html

16-10-2020||World||Twitter changes hacked content rules after Joe Biden story furor||Twitter said late Thursday it was changing its policy on hacked content after an outcry about its handling of an unverified political story that prompted cries of censorship from the right.The social media company will no longer remove hacked material unless it’s directly shared by hackers or those working with them, the company’s head of legal, policy, trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde, said in a Twitter thread.And instead of blocking links from being shared, tweets will be labelled to provide context, Gadde said.“We want to address the concerns that there could be many unintended consequences to journalists, whistleblowers and others in ways that are contrary to Twitter’s purpose of serving the public conversation,” she said.Twitter and Facebook had moved quickly this week to limit the spread of the story published by the conservative-leaning New York Post, which cited unverified emails from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son that were reportedly discovered by President Donald Trump’s allies. The story has not been confirmed by other publications.Twitter initially responded by banning users from sharing links to the article in tweets and direct messages because it violated the company’s policy prohibiting hacked content. But it didn’t alert users about why they couldn’t share the link until hours later.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that it was “unacceptable” the company hadn’t provided more context around its action. A little over 24 hours later, Gadde announced the company was making changes after receiving “significant feedback (from critical to supportive)” about how it enforced the policy.Facebook said it was “reducing” the story’s distribution on its platform while waiting for third-party fact-checkers to verify it, something it regularly does with material that’s not banned outright from its service, though it risks spreading lies or causing harm in other ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-changes-hacked-content-rules-after-joe-biden-story-furor/story-3WyKl3gtqi3jFrlaLESqtN.html
16-10-2020||World||ECTA denounces ban on Chinese vendors, warns about potential rise in costs||A business group representing challenger telecoms operators in Europe warned on Friday against banning Chinese equipment vendors, saying that doing so for political reasons would force up costs and delay network upgrades.In a strongly-worded statement, the European Competitive Telecommunications Association (ECTA), said it “denounces any bans of Chinese 5G suppliers for geopolitical reasons and emphasises that such decisions can only be justified on the basis of well-established facts”.ECTA groups alternative telecoms such as Germany’s 1&1 Drillisch, Iliad of France and Spain’s Masmovil. China’s Huawei Technologies, the global networks market leader, is also on board.Huawei’s position in Europe has come under pressure from a US campaign to purge next-generation networks of kit that Washington says can be used for spying - claims that the Chinese company denies.ECTA’s statement comes after France imposed restrictions on Huawei equipment that sources familiar with the matter said amounted to a de-facto ban.Politics also loomed large over last week’s decision by Orange Belgium and Proximus to replace Huawei with Nokia as provider of radio access network gear for their shared 5G network in Belgium.ECTA’s General Director Luc Hindryckx told Reuters the statement reflected concerns of member CEOs that the adoption of a common EU approach to assessing vendor risk - known as the Toolbox - was leading more and more member countries to impose “actual or de-facto bans” on Chinese vendors.The exclusion of Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese vendor, would leave telecoms with a choice of just three suppliers - the other global players are Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung.“A reduction in the number of worldwide suppliers from five to three will not only impact the telecoms sector by increasing costs, negatively impacting performance, delaying the deployment of 5G networks and constraining innovation potential,” ECTA said.Industry consultant John Strand challenged that view, however, saying that Nordic operators Telenor, Telia and TDC had ripped and replaced Chinese equipment “without increasing cost”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ecta-denounces-ban-on-chinese-vendors-warns-about-potential-rise-in-costs/story-a4aBkyiS1lOX8mjHC4R0AL.html

16-10-2020||World||China rapidly expands use of experimental COVID-19 vaccines||China is rapidly increasing the number of people receiving its experimental coronavirus vaccines, with a city offering one to the general public and a biotech company providing another free to students going abroad.The city of Jiaxing, south of Shanghai, is offering a vaccine under development by Sinovac, it said in an announcement Thursday. It said high-risk groups, including people who are “responsible for the basic operations of the city” will receive priority, but that residents who have emergency needs can also sign up.The vaccine is in the final stage of clinical testing, but has not yet been approved. The city government said it is being provided under an emergency authorization.China National Biotech Group, another Chinese vaccine company, is offering its vaccine free to students who study abroad in a strategy health experts say raises safety and ethical concerns.More than 168,000 people signed up to receive the vaccine via an online survey and more than 91,000 are being considered, CNBG said on its website. That page had been removed by Tuesday.Chinese drug companies have five vaccines in final stages of testing but none is approved for public use. They are part of a global race to develop a vaccine that, if successful, offers the fledgling Chinese industry the potential for prestige and worldwide sales.Top Chinese health officials have promised a vaccine for the general public before the end of this year.CNBG’s vaccine has already been given to medical workers and employees of Chinese companies being sent abroad under an emergency authorization for people in high-risk categories. It has given the vaccine to 350,000 people outside its clinical trials, a company executive said in September. The trials have about 40,000 people enrolled.“Currently, it seems Chinese students going abroad have a strong desire to take the vaccine,” a CNBG employee was quoted as saying by a state-owned newspaper, the Paper, based on the survey results in September.Students in China who are due to start their semesters abroad say they want the vaccine because they are worried about getting sick.“It’s very dangerous over there, the town we study in, it’s a red danger zone,” said a student who goes to school in Poland and gave only her surname, Ouyang. She signed up for the CNBG vaccine in September but hasn’t heard back yet. “We all really want this vaccine.”A student who is due to go to Britain said she signed up via the online link after classmates said they received the vaccine.The student, who would give only her English name, Sally, said she started to hear in September that the vaccine was available to people such as her. She said other students said she might need to travel to Beijing, the national capital, or Wuhan, where the outbreak emerged in December, to receive the vaccine.If the vaccine works, it might help protect students going to Europe or the United States, where the pandemic is still raging, medical experts said. But they said developers need to make clear it is unproven and keep track of what happens to people who receive it.If the vaccine doesn’t work, then “this is giving people a false sense of security,” said Sridhar Venkatapuram, a specialist in bioethics at King’s College London’s Global Health Institute.The ruling Communist Party declared the coronavirus under control in March but has warned that the risk of a new outbreak is high. Travelers and visitors to public buildings still are checked for signs of infection. Those arriving from abroad are required to be quarantined for two weeks. The country has reported 4,634 deaths and 85,622 confirmed cases.This week, 10 million people were tested in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found last weekend, the government said Friday. That ended a nearly two-month period with no local virus transmissions reported within China.It was unclear whether Chinese students were being offered the CNBG vaccine under the same emergency authorization that residents of Jiaxing were.The agency that oversees drug and vaccine approvals, the National Medical Products Administration, did not respond to questions sent by fax. CNBG did not respond to a request for comment.The final stage of clinical trials, conducted on larger groups, is used to find any rare side effects and study the effectiveness of a treatment. The first and second stage trials are meant to determine whether a vaccine or treatment is safe.“The manufacturer has an obligation to obtain follow-up information” from people who receive a vaccine under emergency use, K. Arnold Chan, a National Taiwan University expert on drug regulation, said in an email.Failing to do that “is irresponsible and not compliant with international standards,” he wrote.More than 600,000 Chinese students studied abroad before the pandemic, according to Ministry of Education figures. They make up a large share of the foreign student body in the United States, Britain, Australia and some other countries.Western universities are “not protecting their students,” Venkatapuram said. “The company is basically offering its citizens protection going outside of China, which in essence is what any country would ideally be doing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rapidly-expands-use-of-experimental-covid-19-vaccines/story-UnnpD6ljSvd8XgBGngo8aP.html
16-10-2020||World||Bad weather hampers Vietnam’s search for victims of landslide||Vietnamese rescuers battled driving rain on Friday as they searched for at least 15 construction workers missing and feared dead after a landslide at the start of the week in the mountainous central part of the country.Intense rains since early October have caused floods and mudslides that have killed at least 55 people in central Vietnam, with more heavy rainfall expected until early next week.The landslide took place on Monday at a hydropower dam project in the province of Thua Thien Hue, with two workers confirmed dead up to now.Another landslide later that night killed 13 rescuers, mostly soldiers, while they were on the way to search for the missing workers. Their bodies were recovered on Thursday.“They bravely sacrificed to save people,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in a statement on Friday, describing the deaths as a great loss to the army.Heavy rain and the risk of more landslides was making it difficult to bring badly needed equipment to the site of the hydropower dam to aid the search, the government said in the statement on its website.“The military is determined to continue to send troops and equipment to the site of Rao Trang 3 hydropower plant project for the search and rescue operations,” the government said.State media said on Friday it would take days for the rescuers to reopen a damaged road leading to the site, more than 90 km (56 miles) west of the ancient city of Hue.A tropical depression that is moving towards central Vietnam will bring more heavy rain until next Wednesday and beyond, the government’s weather agency said on Friday.The depression is expected to dump up to 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain in Thua Thien Hue and other parts of central Vietnam, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bad-weather-hampers-vietnam-s-search-for-victims-of-landslide/story-JbiPvFyNzcZRyL0KqDAcyH.html
16-10-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine offered by Chinese city for emergency use costs $60||A city in eastern China is offering an experimental Covid-19 vaccine outside of clinical trials for around $60 to high-risk groups under an emergency inoculation programme.CoronaVac, the Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech’s vaccine, is being offered in Jiaxing in eastern China’s Zhejiang province to care givers, especially epidemic-prevention workers, public service personnel and port inspectors.The experimental vaccine will be eventually offered to ordinary citizens, state media reports said on Friday.“The vaccine, developed by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd, will be provided to people aged between 18 and 59 at a price of 400 yuan ($59.5) for 2 shots,” the Jiaxing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was quoted by state media as saying.The Jiaxing CDC added that as the vaccine hasn’t been “officially approved for marketing”, it is only approved for urgent use.This vaccine contains two doses at an interval of 14-28 days, the CDC told state media.“Its (the company’s) vaccine is in late stage trials in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey, and the company has said that an interim analysis of Phase 3 trial data could come as early as November,” Reuters said in a report Friday.In late June, China’s National Health Commission (NHC), under Chinese vaccine management law, had allowed emergency vaccines to be used on certain people at high risk of contracting the disease, such as medical workers, front-line pandemic control workers and customs workers – a move considered controversial by experts as the vaccines are still at an experimental stage.On September 25, a top health official said Beijing had gained the “understanding and support” from the World Health Organization before starting the emergency use programme.Since July, China has administered experimental vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people under the programme.The WHO had told HT that Beijing’s decision to launch the programme was a domestic authorisation.“WHO has not issued any Covid-19 vaccine Emergency Use Listings (EULs) yet -- yesterday we published draft EUL/PQ criteria for assessment of Covid-19 vaccines and the public is invited to comment,” the WHO had told HT in an emailed statement on September 26.“What China has issued is a domestic emergency use authorisation. These are issued at the discretion of countries and not subject to WHO approval,” it said.Until late September, 11 Chinese Covid-19 vaccines had entered clinical trials, with four in Phase 3.Last week, China announced it will join COVAX, an international initiative aimed at ensuring equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines, becoming the largest economy to support the initiative so far. The number of daily cases of Covid-19, which first emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has fallen drastically in mainland China from peaks seen in February.Confirmed cases in the mainland is at over 85,500, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.More than 3,000 imported cases of Covid-19 have been reported as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-offered-by-chinese-city-for-emergency-use-costs-60/story-kpKQbPYskDVgiygC30J1MJ.html
16-10-2020||World||Racial tensions simmer in South Africa over alleged murder of farmer||Emotions ran high Friday as two black suspects appeared in a South African court over the murder of a white farmer which has sparked racial tensions. A barbed wire fence ringed the court house in the central town of Senekal and police and a water cannon were deployed as opposing groups of white farmers and black activists gathered near the site.Crime in this sleepy area, 300 kilometres (180 miles) south of Johannesburg, is relatively rare. But on October 2, the body of 22-year-old farm manager Brendin Horner was found. He had been strangled and tied to a fence at a farm in Paul Roux near Senekal. A silver cross with his name engraved on it has been erected at the spot where the body was discovered. The killing of white farmers is a highly emotive issue in South Africa. Some conservative groups say the farmers are victims of a genocide and the government is not doing enough to protect them.“This young man is paying with his life, he is going to help us solve the (crime) problem,” Horner’s employer Gilly Scheeper, 58, said.Scheeper has hired private investigators to run a parallel probe into the death “because police here are corrupt”.The motive for the murder has not been established. Half a dozen policemen guarded the court house on Friday, dressed in bulletproof jackets and armed with assault rifles.Inside the court, the judge said only the final arguments and the verdict could be televised.Farmers rioted, stormed the court house and torched a police van when the suspects first appeared in court last week.One of the suspects had been arrested 16 times before the latest arrest.The alleged instigator of last week’s court rioting, businessman Andre Pienaar, is in custody facing charges of public violence, attempted murder and incitement.President Cyril Ramaphosa tried Monday to ease the tensions in post-apartheid South Africa.“Killings on farms are not ethnic cleansing,” he said in a weekly newsletter. “They are not genocidal. They are acts of criminality and must be treated as such.”South Africa, where white minority rule and apartheid only ended in 1994, has one of the world’s highest crime rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/racial-tensions-simmer-in-south-africa-over-alleged-murder-of-farmer/story-gDc40cdYVNZit7WaiMZfQI.html
16-10-2020||World||LeT, JeM backing Taliban in fighting in Helmand, says top Afghan official||Against the backdrop of intense attacks by the Taliban in Helmand province of Afghanistan, a top Afghan official has said that fighters from Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are involved in the fighting. The crucial province has witnessed violent clashes between the Taliban and Afghan forces since the last weekend, and the UN has said some 35,000 people have been displaced by the fighting. Taliban cadres launched offensives to capture cities such as provincial capital of Lashkargah and several districts. Helmand’s governor Yasin Khan has said foreign fighters associated LeT, JeM and al-Qaeda are backing the Taliban in the attacks. Though the Taliban captured several check posts, Afghan forces have mounted counter-attacks to drive them out. Also Read: 16 security personnel killed in Taliban attack in Afghanistan’s Baghlan province: ReportThe Taliban have provided safe havens to foreign fighters from the three terrorist organisations, and they, in turn, are providing military and bomb-making training to Taliban fighters, Khan was quoted as saying by Tolo News channel. “There is the presence of al-Qaeda, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba and terrorists from Central Asia. They collaborated with the Taliban now and in the past,” Khan said. A Taliban spokesman was quoted by Tolo News as rejecting the governor’s remarks. A former Indian intelligence official, who was involved in tracking developments in Afghanistan, said reports suggested the Taliban fighters in Helmand were not under the control of the organisation’s leaders who are involved in the ongoing talks in Doha with the Afghan government. “Reports also suggest that the groups in Helmand are under the influence of Iran and that was the reason why the US swiftly launched counter strikes in Helmand. The province is crucial as it has traditional been the route to capturing power in Kabul,” he said, declining to be identified. Also Read: Why Pakistan is wrong, again | HT EditorialPeople familiar with developments also said the Taliban groups in Helmand were being supported by Pakistan and Iran and were opposed to the talks underway in Doha. Helmand is also one of the main poppy growing areas in Afghanistan and crucial for the illegal narcotics trade, which generates sizeable funds for the Taliban. A UN report issued in May this year had said there are some 6,500 Pakistanis among foreign terrorists operating in Afghanistan, and that the JeM and LeT play a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the war-torn country. The groups have a presence in the eastern Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar and Nuristan, “where they operate under the umbrella of the Afghan Taliban”, according to the report from the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/let-jem-backing-taliban-in-fighting-in-helmand-says-top-afghan-official/story-UdyDgQBd9mb9I7v2GMll4H.html

Prior, manning agencies were “operating on their own and may be lacking in monitoring,” he said.Virus Cases Rise on Ship Stranded Off World’s Key Iron Ore HubThe Western Australia Today reported on Oct. 12 that Australian mining companies won’t use any seafarers from Manila, the epicenter of the Philippine outbreak. The Southeast Asian nation’s maritime agency has not received official notice of this move, said Luisito delos Santos, who heads its information service.Vessels have been diverting to the Philippines to facilitate crew changes after the pandemic shut borders and limited flights. The nation has more than 350,000 Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-to-avoid-ban-on-seafarers-probes-covid-19-outbreaks-in-ships/story-OYf4zPB5WTC7xlshciedUP.html

Those glaciers are already receding thanks to global warming. Chile is grappling with challenges governments worldwide face with growing pressure to curb environmental impacts while trying to generate revenue to prop up the economy amid a pandemic.Proposed reforms to Chile’s water code should safeguard the resource in the country while providing certainty to companies that invest in key industries including agriculture, which has been hit by a years-long drought, Schmidt said. Critics of the existing code say it doesn’t explicitly protect human consumption.An opposition-led bill being debated in a Senate mining and energy commission would provide blanket protections for the country’s glaciers and permafrost areas, though such a law threatens to restrict mining operations and prohibit some development projects. Two divisions of state-owned Codelco and Anglo American Plc’s Los Bronces mine could be affected by the proposed bill, which was introduced to the Senate in July 2018.Chile’s government is also promoting the use of hydrogen and renewable energy in mining operations as a way of reaching carbon neutrality and delivering “green” copper that would fetch a premium, Schmidt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-copper-producer-chile-says-it-can-run-mines-in-the-andes-without-affecting-glaciers/story-6qDdqvpgzlb060giZ8CpRM.html

16-10-2020||World||Thailand police arrest two students for disrupting Queen’s motorcade||Thai police arrested two activists Friday under a rarely-used law banning violence against the queen, after thousands of pro-democracy protesters defied an emergency decree to rally on the streets of Bangkok.The kingdom’s political elite has been jolted by a youth-led movement that has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha and issued a once-taboo call for reforms to Thailand’s powerful monarchy.Ekachai Hongkangwan and Bunkueanun Paothong were among activists who crowded around a royal motorcade carrying Queen Suthida on Wednesday during a large demonstration near the capital’s government house. Bunkueanun said during a Friday morning Facebook broadcast that he was surrendering himself to police.“I am accused of trying to harm the queen,” he said. “I am innocent. That was not my intention.”Ekachai told AFP by phone he had also been charged and police later confirmed he was in their custody.Both men could face life in prison under a law that has not been used for decades and punishes any “act of violence against the queen or her liberty”.It is not clear why the pair were singled out.This is the first time such a serious charge has been levelled against pro-democracy activists, many of whom have already been hit with lesser charges, including sedition and breaking coronavirus rules on gatherings.Their movement’s demands include the abolition of a strict royal defamation law -- which shields the monarchy from criticism -- and for the royal family to stay out of politics.- ‘Free our friends!’ -Police closed down roads in central Bangkok on Friday after protesters vowed to return to the streets in the evening -- a move that would again defy an emergency decree banning gatherings of more than four people.“I warn everyone not to violate the law,” premier Prayut said after holding a special cabinet meeting. Some 10,000 people had rallied Thursday late into the night at the flashpoint junction of Ratchaprasong. Confronting police, they demanded the release of around two dozen arrested activists, chanting “Free our friends!” and “Prayut get out!”.Many displayed a three-fingered salute adopted from the “Hunger Games” movies as a symbol of the burgeoning movement.Prayut said he had no intention of stepping down.“No, I won’t quit,” he said. “What have I done wrong?”Among the top activists arrested Thursday was Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, whose detention was live-streamed on Facebook.Anon Numpa, another leading activist, said he was forcibly taken by helicopter to Chiang Mai in northern Thailand.His lawyer Krisadang Nutcharut told AFP that Anon had been refused bail and was being held in Chiang Mai prison.“Keep on fighting! My freedom is a very small issue compared to the entire struggle for democracy,” Anon posted on Facebook late Thursday.- History of unrest -Thailand’s modern political history is dotted with periods of violent civil unrest and more than a dozen military coups, the most recent of which brought Prayut to power in 2014.Bangkok-based analyst Thitinan Pongsudhirak said the protest movement could heighten the chances of Thailand facing yet another military takeover. “This endgame for Thailand’s future has been building up for years, and it is finally here and now,” he said.“A brutal dispersal of the protest may take place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-police-arrest-two-students-for-disrupting-queen-s-motorcade/story-Wy85TDYRakspCQzQaeT6bP.html
16-10-2020||World||Italy has 2 weeks to control Covid-19 highs, spreads to at-risk population: Virologist||Italy has two weeks to stop the rising rate of transmission of coronavirus or it risks “following in the footsteps” of European neighbours where exponential spreads have ushered back harsh restrictions, a virologist on the front lines says.Italian health officials have declared that the resurgence of Covid-19 has reached an “acute phase.” Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Milan’s Luigi Sacco hospital, said Italy’s surge — which hit pandemic highs of new daily infections this week — is not the result of record testing, as policy makers have suggested, but a sign of a real return among the population most at risk.It only takes a look at Sacco’s Covid-19 ward, a few steps from Galli’s office, to raise the alarm.“We have a situation that reminds one quite distressingly of the one that we already have experienced,’‘ Galli told The Associated Press, referring to the peak in March and April when the surge in infections resulted in a one-day record of 969 deaths.Already in Milan, he said, the number of elderly patients or those with other risk factors is growing, indicating a spread beyond the expansion seen in late September, when most new positives were among people caught by contact tracing and screenings, for example people returning from vacation.‘‘The trend is already there, and it is frankly alarming,’‘ he said, adding that “it is not a generalized situation, it is not all of Italy.” But he fears that new nationwide restrictions adopted over the past two weeks — including mandatory masks outdoors, a ban on pick-up sports and restaurant closures at midnight — are not enough.“If we don’t in 15 days ... have an indication of being able to control all of the major outbreaks, there won’t be a choice but to enter another phase of limiting activities,’‘ Galli said.On Friday, the region of Campania, which includes Naples and which has been under pressure since early September, closed schools until the end of the month — angering the government in Rome.That came after Italy reported a new daily record of confirmed virus cases — 8,804 — on Thursday, including more than 2,000 in Lombardy and 1,000 in Campania. After hovering around 40 for days, the death toll surged to 83, one-third of those in Lombardy.Newly confirmed cases have also reached record levels in the Czech Republic, which also shut schools, and Poland, which has limited restaurant hours and closed gyms and schools. France, meanwhile, has imposed a 9 p.m. curfew in Paris and other big cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-has-2-weeks-to-control-covid-19-highs-spreads-to-at-risk-population-virologist/story-ZDYkY3b9Mpcwgj2v3xqy3M.html
16-10-2020||World||UK government under pressure for Covid-19 strategy||The British government is sticking to its strategy of tiered, regional restrictions to combat Covid-19 amid mounting political and scientific pressure for stronger nationwide measures to prevent the coronavirus pandemic from spiraling out of control.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday reiterated the government’s belief that a regional approach where the toughest restrictions are imposed only in the areas where infection rates are highest is the best way to slow the spread of the virus and protect the economy.“I think the right thing, both on public health grounds but also supporting the economy, supporting jobs, livelihoods, supporting our society and the most vulnerable in it, is to avoid a second national lockdown,” Raab told Sky News.The government has been under fire since Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled his three-tier strategy on Monday amid revelations that scientific advisers had recommended a short nationwide lockdown to slow rapidly rising infection rates. Leaders of northern cities have refused to accept the tightest restrictions unless the government provides more support to cushion the impact on business and individuals.Opposition politicians accuse ministers of doing too little, too late.Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist who sits on the government’s scientific advisory panel, said Friday that restrictions imposed under the three-tier strategy aren’t tough enough to bring the virus under control, and that squabbling over where and when to impose the measures risks confusing the public.Calling the situation the “worst of all worlds” Farrar said the UK needs to quickly implement tighter restrictions nationwide to slow the spread of the virus and limit broader damage to society.“I think we’ve got to come together as a country,” Farrar told the BBC. “The fragmentation and, frankly, making this either a north-south or a party political issue, that’s a very, very dangerous route to go on.”London and seven other areas will move into the second-highest risk tier on Saturday, leading to increased restrictions on more than 11 million people. So far, only the northwestern city of Liverpool has been placed into the top risk tier, which requires the closure of pubs and bars, and bans social gatherings between people from different households.Raab said negotiations are continuing with officials in Manchester, Lancashire about moving those areas into the top tier as well.“We will keep talking and we’ll keep working,” Raab said. “Obviously, in the last resort the government has the powers to proceed in any event, but we would much rather work with the local leaders if at all possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-under-pressure-for-covid-19-strategy/story-NtajtTB20he4a74mV8dlJO.html

Johnson, he said, would set out his response.“We are disappointed and surprised,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said, adding that the two sticking points were fishing and the so-called level playing field - rules aimed at stopping a country gaining a competitive advantage.“Having said that, we are close,” Raab said of a deal. “A deal should be able to be done but it must require goodwill on both sides.”Britain formally left the EU on Jan. 31, but the two sides are haggling over a deal that would govern trade in everything from car parts and salmon, to Camembert and medicines when informal membership known as the transition period, with Britain still in the EU single market and customs union, ends Dec. 31.As he grapples with a accelerating second wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Johnson will ultimately have to make the final call on whether to accept a narrow trade deal or go for a more tumultuous no-deal that he would seek to blame on the EU.After Johnson’s bid to undercut the 2020 Brexit divorce treaty, there are fears that London is employing what one European diplomat said was Madman Theory - a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon’s attempt to convince Moscow that he was irrational during the Cold War in the 1970s.DRAMA OR NO DEAL? Johnson has repeatedly said that his preference is for a deal but that Britain could make a success of a no-deal scenario, which would throw $900 billion in annual bilateral trade into uncertainty and could snarl the border, turning the southeastern county of Kent into a vast truck park.The EU’s 27 members, whose combined $18.4 trillion economy dwarfs the United Kingdom’s $3 trillion economy, say a deal is still possible but that Johnson must give ground.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe’s most powerful leader, said compromise would be needed for a deal. “In some areas, things have progressed well. In others, much work remains to be done. We have asked the United Kingdom to remain open to compromise, so that an agreement can be reached,” Merkel said.“This of course means that we, too, will need to make compromises. Each side has its red lines,” she said adding that top EU aims were to safeguard peace in Ireland and protect the bloc’s single market. On fishing, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc was seeking sustainable access to UK waters, as well as a fair share of fish catch quotas, just as Britain wanted continued access to the bloc’s energy market.On competition, Barnier said the EU needed to know if any British divergence from EU standards would be “reasonable”, who would control that decision within the UK, and would London inform Europe in advance to let it prepare.Goldman Sachs said there could be Brexit drama ahead but that a bare-bones Brexit trade deal was likely to struck by early November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-answer-eu-s-brexit-trade-deal-concerns/story-o3wg11rECDNTUu3b0evv6N.html
16-10-2020||World||Britain moves closer to Covid-19 vaccine trials that infect volunteers||“Human challenge” trials of potential Covid-19 vaccines, where volunteers are deliberately infected with the disease, could become a reality after a British biotech firm said it was in advanced talks with the government to create and provide strains of the virus.Preliminary work for the trials, which aim to speed up the process of determining the efficacy of a vaccine candidate, is being carried out by hVIVO, a unit of pharmaceutical services company Open Orphan, hVIVO said on Friday.If agreed, this would involve creating a human challenge study model that could be used should such trials gain ethical and safety approval from regulators.Supporters of human challenge trials say they are a good way to cut short the often lengthy process of testing potential vaccines on tens of thousands of volunteers in the real world who go about normal life and are monitored to see if they contract the disease or are protected from it.In these tightly-controlled trials, volunteers are given a vaccine and then about a month later are deliberately infected with the disease under controlled conditions. They are then isolated in a quarantine facility and monitored to see if they become sick or if the vaccine protects them.Critics say deliberately infecting someone with a potentially deadly disease for which there is currently no effective treatment is unethical.Any human challenge trials conducted in Britain would have to be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the healthcare regulator that looks into safety, ethics and protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-moves-closer-to-covid-19-vaccine-trials-that-infect-volunteers/story-5LkgQWp6v0FcWCCC2mSkJJ.html
16-10-2020||World||Gilead questions WHO study that cast doubts on drug’s Covid-19 benefits||Gilead Sciences Inc has questioned the findings of a World Health Organization (WHO) study that concluded its Covid-19 drug remdesivir does not help patients who have been admitted to hospital.The American company told Reuters the data appeared inconsistent, the findings were premature and that other studies had validated the drug’s benefits. In a blow to one of the few drugs being used to treat people with Covid-19, the WHO said on Thursday its “Solidarity” trial had concluded that remdesivir appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays among patients with the respiratory disease.The antiviral medication was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection, and has been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery, though the European Union is investigating it for possible kidney injury.The WHO trial was conducted in 11,266 adult patients in more than 30 countries. The evidence was conclusive, the WHO said.Gilead said other trials of remdesivir, including with 1,062 patients that compared it with a placebo, showed the treatment cut Covid-19 recovery time.“The emerging (WHO) data appears inconsistent, with more robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of remdesivir,” Gilead told Reuters.Gilead said it was “unclear if any conclusive findings can be drawn” given what it called differences in how the trial was conducted from site to site and between the patients who received the medicine. In April, the top U.S. infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, predicted remdesivir would become “the standard of care”.Companies such as Gilead are racing to find a treatment for Covid-19. Some 1.1 million people have died and 39.1 million have been reported infected in the pandemic, and the global economy has been thrown into chaos. Remdesivir was developed for Ebola, which causes fever, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea and spreads among humans through bodily fluids.It was quickly repurposed and has offered some hope for patients, though the WHO’s findings may shift the focus of the search for a vaccine to new monoclonal antibodies being developed by companies including Regeneron.The Solidarity trial also evaluated hydroxychloroquine, anti-HIV drug combination lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon, and concluded that they, like remdesivir, did little to help patients survive or leave the hospital more quickly.The WHO trial’s results are yet to be reviewed and were uploaded on the preprint server medRxiv.“PREMATURE”Gilead say the Solidarity conclusions, lacking scrutiny from other scientists, were premature.“We are concerned the data from this open-label global trial has not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion, particularly given the limitations of the trial design,” it said.Remdesivir got emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 1, and has been authorized for use in several countries.During the Solidarity study, trials of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were stopped in June after they proved ineffective, but the studies of Gilead’s drug and interferon continued in more than 500 hospitals and 30 countries. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said this week the U.N. health agency was now looking at other, emerging treatment options such as monoclonal anti-bodies, immunomodulators and some newer anti-viral drugs.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc is developing a monoclonal antibody that Trump received for his Covid-19 infection.Eli Lilly and Co said on Tuesday a trial of its Covid-19 antibody treatment had been paused by the U.S. government because of a safety concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-questions-who-study-that-cast-doubts-on-drug-s-covid-19-benefits/story-WIdSEVCFL0c1MGEBFXDBMN.html
16-10-2020||World||Donald Trump accuses Joe Biden of corruption, says he belongs to political class that enriches self||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and belongs from the political class that enriches self, President Donald Trump has said.Speaking at an election rally on Thursday, Trump also accused Biden of constantly telling lies about his son. “He (Biden) is the embodiment of the political class that enriches self while draining the economic life and soul out of our country. Yesterday, we learned from newly released emails and I want to thank the New York Post for showing real bravery,” Trump said.Trump accused Biden’s son Hunter of making a deal with a wealthy Chinese magnet for USD 10 million a year for introductions only. “That Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings. He is a corrupt politician and has been corrupt for many years and everybody in Washington knew it. And just now a little while ago a new story shows up that Hunter made a deal with a wealthy Chinese magnet for USD 10 million a year for introductions only,” he said.Trump during his speech accused Biden of betraying the workers of North Carolina for the last 47 years through acts of economic treachery.“For the last 47 years, he has betrayed the workers of North Carolina through one act of economic treachery after another and now they got caught stealing, folks,” he said.“Biden’s a servant of the wealthy donors and globalists and special interest who got rich bleeding America dry, taking your jobs from North Carolina and every other place and moving them out of the country and we turned it around you got to remember that,” he said.Trump said for five decades Biden shipped away people’s jobs, shut down factories, threw open borders and ravaged cities while sacrificing American blood and dredger in endless foreign wars, he alleged.Meanwhile, in a video message, Trump’s son Donald J Trump Jr alleged that the Biden family is the most corrupt political family in American history.“Hunter Biden used Air Force 2 to travel to China with his father for business meetings with top communist, Chinese officials,” he said. Biden has repeatedly denied these allegations.Trump Jr said Hunter sat on the board of a private equity firm that raised USD 1.5 billion from the Chinese government through the state-owned bank of China. “Hunter was involved with communist Chinese nationalists who gave the Bidens millions in exchange for access to American companies that produced technology with our military,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-accuses-joe-biden-of-corruption-says-he-belongs-to-political-class-that-enriches-self/story-h3406PAJjQefXcDO8SZijK.html

But he acknowledged that doctors determined that his lungs were “a little bit infected” when he was hospitalised.Trump’s comments came in the opening moments of Thursday night’s town hall-style meeting on NBC. His Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, was appearing at a similar event at the same time on another network.Trump was seated on stage, not wearing a mask, on a set with several voters spaced several feet apart, all of them wearing masks.He said he “probably” took a test the day of the opening debate last week.The duelling events replaced the second presidential debate, which was cancelled because of health concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-lungs-were-a-little-bit-infected-when-he-was-hospitalised/story-io8LmCiJUGgiFiDPNxNlsJ.html

16-10-2020||World||Donald Trump and Joe Biden hold separate town halls in lieu of cancelled second presidential debate||US President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden held simultaneous and separate televised town halls in lieu of the second presidential debate, taking questions from pre-selected individuals at sessions moderated by eminent television journalists.While Trump’s town hall was hosted by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in Miami, Florida, that of Biden was held in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) News. The second presidential debate had originally been scheduled for Thursday night. However, it was cancelled after Trump refused to participate in a virtual format of the presidential debate as amended by the independent debate commission following the president’s Covid-19 diagnosis. A final debate is still scheduled for October 22 in Nashville, Tennessee. The first debate was held on September 29 in Cleveland, Ohio. Trump, 74, has recovered from a brief spell of Covid-19 after he and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, tested positive for the deadly viral infection on October 1. Trump’s doctors have now cleared him for his election campaigns.During the town hall, Trump defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He also reiterated his stand on tax returns. However, Trump refused to denounce the QAnon conspiracy theory.According to QAnon, a far-right group that has been labelled a terror threat by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Democrats are running a secret paedophilia ring.When asked by moderator Savannah Guthrie if he would denounce the QAnon theory and “just say it’s crazy and not true”, Trump said, “I don’t know about QAnon.” When pressed further on whether or not he believed that Democrats were running a pedophile ring, Trump said, “I have no idea.” Biden’s during his town hall said he would soon express his position on court packing, an issue that he has avoided so far.The 77-year-old democratic presidential nominee said he will come out with a clear position before Election Day about where he stands on expanding the Supreme Court, depending how the rest of the confirmation process of Judge Amy Coney Barrett is handled. President Trump has selected Judge Barrett to succeed Supreme Court Justice late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.The Senate Judiciary Committee finished its confirmation hearings for Barrett earlier on Thursday. Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said that the committee will vote on Barrett’s nomination on October 22. If the committee approves her nomination, which is expected, it would be sent to the full Senate floor.  At the town hall with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, Biden said he is “not a fan” of court packing. When asked by Stephanopoulos if he was open to increasing the number of judges on the court if Barrett is confirmed before the election, Biden said, “I’m open to considering what happens from that point on”. Republicans have repeatedly criticised Biden for not directly giving his view on court packing. “They do have a right to know where I’ll stand and they’ll have a right to know where I stand before they vote,” Biden said, when asked whether voters had a right to know where he stands on the issue of expanding the court. Replying to a question on if he would make his position clear before the Election Day, Biden said, “Yes, depending on how they handle this”, referring to the Republicans. Expanding the number of justices on the court would take an act of Congress and approval from the president. The Biden’s townhall had no question on the allegations related to his son Hunter Biden’s corruption. According to a Senate Republican report released last month, during Biden’s tenure as vice president, Hunter, 50, received a USD 3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the widow of Moscow’s former mayor Yury Luzhkov. The report further alleged that Chinese nationals lavished Hunter and other members of the Biden family with money, giving Hunter and Biden’s brother James credit cards for a USD 100,000 international shopping spree.Both Trump and Biden campaigns claimed that their candidates won the shows Thursday night.“Even though the commission cancelled the in-person debate that could have happened tonight, one occurred anyway, and President Trump soundly defeated NBC’s Savannah Guthrie in her role as debate opponent and Joe Biden surrogate,” said Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director.“President Trump masterfully handled Guthrie’s attacks and interacted warmly and effectively with the voters in the room,” he said.“Over on ABC, it was a completely different scene, as once again Biden was kept comfortable and away from any questions that might challenge him,” Murtaugh alleged. Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said that the two town halls showed that there was one leader and one liar.“Joe Biden gave thoughtful answers to voters’ questions about Covid-19, taxes, racial equity, climate change, and more...1,100 miles away, and in a false, alternate reality of his own making, President Trump was combative and lashed out at voters. He refused to denounce QAnon...He lied about the effectiveness of masks,” he said.“Trump has no answers for his failures to contain Covid-19 and manage our economy. And, after nearly four years in office, Trump still has no vision for how he’ll make health care more affordable,” Bedingfield said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-and-joe-biden-hold-separate-town-halls-in-lieu-of-cancelled-second-presidential-debate/story-49JFpAGnYsi2Tgpfamd8DO.html
16-10-2020||World||White House designates two appointees with no experience in public health at CDC in bid to control info||The Trump White House has installed two political operatives at the nation’s top public health agency to try to control the information it releases about the coronavirus pandemic as the administration seeks to paint a positive outlook, sometimes at odds with the scientific evidence.The two appointees assigned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters in June have no public health background. They have been tasked with keeping an eye on Dr. Robert Redfield, the agency director, as well as scientists, according to a half-dozen CDC and administration officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal government affairs.The appointments were part of a push to get more “politicals” into the CDC to help control messaging after a handful of leaks were “upsetting the apple cart,” said an administration official.When the two appointees showed up in Atlanta, their roles were a mystery to senior CDC staff, the people said. They had not even been assigned offices. Eventually one, Nina Witkofsky, became acting chief of staff, an influential role as Redfield’s right hand. The other, her deputy Trey Moeller, began sitting in on scientific meetings, the sources said.It’s not clear to what extent the two appointees have affected the agency’s work, according to interviews with multiple CDC officials. But congressional investigators are examining that very question after evidence has mounted of political interference in CDC scientific publications, guidance documents and web postings.The White House declined to comment. A CDC spokesperson confirmed that Witkofsky and Moeller were working at the agency reporting to Redfield, but did not comment further.Moeller said in an email to The AP, “I work for Dr. Redfield who is 100% committed to the science and the thousands of incredibly dedicated employees at the CDC.”During previous pandemics such as Ebola, the CDC was the public face of the US response, offering scientifically driven advice. The agency played the same role at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but stumbled in February when a test for the virus sent to the states proved flawed. Then, in late February, a top CDC infectious disease expert, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, upset the administration by speaking frankly at a news conference about the dangers of the virus when the president was downplaying it.Within weeks, the agency was pushed offstage.Still, CDC persisted in assembling science-based information that conflicted with the White House narrative. In May, a series of leaked emails and scientific documents obtained by The AP detailed how the White House had buried CDC’s detailed guidelines for communities reopening during a still-surging pandemic. The resulting news stories angered the administration, and sparked renewed efforts to exert control over CDC, according to current and former officials.On a Monday in June, the new faces arrived unexpectedly at Redfield’s Atlanta offices, said a former CDC official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency affairs.One was Witkofsky, who according to federal election records had a minor role in Trump’s presidential campaign. She was installed initially as a senior adviser to Redfield. In a few weeks, she would take over as the agency’s acting chief of staff and become the person at CDC headquarters who has the most daily interactions with him, the CDC officials said.Presidential administrations appoint CDC directors. And there’s nothing new about a White House seeking a better handle on information released by the agency, said Glen Nowak, a University of Georgia professor who ran CDC’s media relations. But past administrations placed overtly political appointees in Washington; the Trump administration has taken it to a new level by placing people in CDC’s Atlanta headquarters, Nowak said.Before Witkofsky and Moeller, the Trump administration had appointed others at CDC in Atlanta who were viewed by staff with some suspicion. But none of the predecessors were there to report internal agency business up to Washington, according to the officials.Witkofsky seemed a particularly strange fit for the nation’s top public health agency. She studied finance and business administration in college and graduate school, and at one point worked as a publicist and talent booker for Turner Broadcasting’s Cartoon Network. Her political work included being an events director during the George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign.Though Witkofsky was largely unknown, she had met a few CDC workers months earlier. In March, on behalf of the administration, she had worked communications when Trump visited a CDC lab.In her new role, Witkofsky communicated regularly with Michael Caputo, chief of communications for CDC’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, an administration official said. At the time Caputo’s office was attempting to gain control over the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, or MMWR, a CDC scientific weekly known for publishing authoritative and unvarnished information about disease-fighting efforts, according to multiple accounts.Witkofsky’s deputy, Moeller, is a longtime GOP supporter who worked on the Bush-Cheney presidential campaign in 2004. The most recent post on his Facebook page was a “Make America Great Again” Trump campaign banner.They wanted him to sit in meetings and “listen to scientists,” said one health official.An HHS spokesperson said Witkifsky and Moeller both report to Redfield.Witkofsky and Moeller are among officials the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis is seeking to interview as part of a probe it launched in mid-September into allegations that Caputo and others in the Trump administration blocked the CDC from publishing accurate scientific reports during the pandemic.The apparent meddling and political pressure from the Trump White House, and from HHS, have caused even scientific experts to question some CDC decisions.“I don’t trust the (political appointees) that they’ve dropped into the CDC,” said Dr. Rick Bright, a federal vaccine expert who filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was reassigned to a lesser job because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug pushed by Trump as a COVID-19 treatment.“That is absolutely frightening,” he said. “(It) leads to the mixed signals to the public. And I think that is increasing the magnitude and duration of this entire pandemic.”___Lardner reported from Washington.___To contact AP’s investigative team, email investigative@ap.org||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-designates-two-appointees-with-no-experience-in-public-health-at-cdc-in-bid-to-control-info/story-q6tQY3odk3lXWJ1YxGJUJP.html
16-10-2020||World||US Elections 2020: Joe Biden campaign finds 3rd virus link, Kamala Harris suspends travel||At least three people connected to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign have tested positive for the coronavirus, leading the campaign to suspend in-person events for vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris through Monday.Biden is not altering his public schedule, his campaign said Thursday, because he had no direct exposure to the individuals who tested positive, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.(CDC).The travel suspension interrupts the Biden campaign’s aggressive push across a wide battleground map, including North Carolina and Ohio, with less than three weeks to go until Election Day.It’s the campaign’s first major coronavirus scare, after months of enforcing safety precautions that drew mockery from President Donald Trump, even after he, first lady Melania Trump, and others contracted the virus themselves. The Democratic campaign’s cautious reaction underscores the differences in how the rival camps have approached the pandemic, both in terms of preferred government response and in the candidates’ personal protocols.Biden’s campaign announced two positive cases Thursday morning, identifying Harris’ communications director Liz Allen and an unnamed member of the flight crew for one of Harris’ recent campaign trips. The campaign announced a third case Thursday afternoon as part of its contact tracing efforts from the first two cases.The third individual is an aviation company employee who was on Biden’s plane for trips to Ohio and Florida earlier this week but who entered the back of the plane and sat far away from Biden, according to the campaign.Harris and Biden, meanwhile, spent several hours campaigning together in Arizona on Oct. 8, when the first two people who tested positive were on a flight with Harris. Both candidates have tested negative for the coronavirus multiple times since then, including on Thursday. Everyone travelling on the Biden campaign’s aircraft is required to wear a mask.Trump, speaking without a mask at a crowded outdoor rally in North Carolina on Thursday afternoon, offered his best wishes to Harris and reiterated his skepticism of wearing masks.“We worry about her. I’m very concerned about her,” he said, later adding: “Masks, no masks, everything, you can do all you want, but you know, you still need help.”Harris was set to encourage early voting on Thursday in North Carolina. Her Friday trip to Cleveland would have been her first to Ohio as the vice presidential nominee and would have taken her into the metropolitan area with the state’s largest concentration of Black voters.Harris will continue virtual campaigning, including fundraisers previously scheduled for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.The senator’s brief hiatus from the trail comes as Trump ramps up his own travel after he, the first lady, their son, his campaign manager, and several White House staffers contracted the virus.Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon told reporters Thursday morning that under CDC guidelines, there was no need for the candidates to quarantine, although she said Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, would suspend travel for several days “out of an abundance of caution.” “Neither of these individuals had any contact with Vice President Biden, with Sen. Harris or any other staff member since testing positive or in the 48-hour period prior to their positive test results,” O’Malley Dillon said.Harris followed up in a statement saying she’d be “transparent with you about any test results that I do receive. In the meantime, remember: wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands regularly. It is possible to stop the spread.” O’Malley Dillon announced the third case late Thursday afternoon. She said Biden’s medical advisers recommended against a quarantine because of the distance between Biden and the third individual who tested positive.Harris and Biden spent several hours together on Oct. 8 through multiple campaign stops, private meetings and a joint appearance in front of reporters at an airport. They were masked at all times in public, and aides said they were masked in private, as well, including on all flights.O’Malley Dillon said all campaign staff members on the Oct. 8 flight have been tested at least twice since then. All tests have been negative, she said.The campaign became aware of the first two positive tests Wednesday night, O’Malley Dillon said. Harris had opted earlier this week to attend virtually — rather than in person — the Senate Judiciary Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, after some of her GOP Senate colleagues tested positive for the coronavirus or disclosed their exposure to others who had tested positive.The Democratic ticket’s campaign events are socially distanced and require participants to wear masks. Staff often set chairs inside white plastic circles to denote 6 feet (1.8 meters) of distance. During a recent indoor speech at a North Carolina event for Harris, reporters were given and asked to wear KN95 masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-campaign-finds-3rd-virus-link-kamala-harris-suspends-travel/story-3gtr2gpiPlBUKxillB5UaN.html

Guangzhou-based Nanfang Daily cited Zhong Nanshan as saying Baiyunshan’s “banlangen” product was effective in a series of in-vitro studies. Zhong is a senior medical adviser to Beijing who confirmed the risk of human-to-human Covid-19 infection on Jan. 20.Zhong was speaking at a Oct. 13 ceremony in Guangzhou to launch a Baiyunshan banlangen project. Zhong will lead a team working on development and upgrades of the drug, according to the paper. Zhong’s team had worked with Baiyunshan in research on the product’s properties after the SARS outbreak, it added.Banlangen is a traditional Chinese medicine made from isatis root and often used as a common cure for cold and flu. In 2013 the product sold out in various parts of China during a fatal avian flu virus outbreak. Baiyunshan, which has a market value of around $7.7 billion, also retails Western pharmaceutical products. Its Hong Kong shares are down 19% this year.Tests cited in the report are still early stage and it remains unclear whether the medicine is effective beyond a test tube.Traders sent the stock’s trading volume in Hong Kong to 21 times above its 30-day average. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. which also makes a version of banlangen, dropped as much as 5.3% in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-drug-company-announces-potential-drug-to-inhibit-covid-19/story-OULrjy0wwMLZkQtBIcCY6J.html
16-10-2020||World||Improper disinfection at China’s Qingdao hospital causes new Covid-19 cluster||Improper disinfection at a hospital in China’s Qingdao has caused new COVID-19 cluster infections, prompting the city to test over 10 million people, a senior local health official said on Friday.No new positive cases were reported from over 10 million tests in the city.“Inappropriate disinfection in the CT room at the Qingdao Chest Hospital has led to the new cluster of COVID-19 infections in Qingdao,” Ma Lixin, the deputy party chief of the provincial health commission, said at a press conference.The possibility that the new cluster infections were caused by cross-infection in the community was also ruled out, state-run Xinhua news agency, quoted him as saying.He said no community transmission has occurred.The Qingdao cluster has created nationwide concern as thousands visited the tourist city during the recent National Day holidays. Beijing officials announced strict management of international arrivals to the capital, including three tests — before departure, at Chinese customs and after finishing a quarantine period.Some 34 hotels have been opened for medical observation for people who entered the capital after September 3, when the city resumed some international flights. As of Thursday, the Qingdao city had collected and tested more than 10.4 million samples and had released more than 8.8 million results, state-run China Daily reported.Sui Ruwen, the city’s vice-mayor and chief of the public security bureau, said there were no additional positive results beyond those already under quarantine. The testing effort, which aims to cover the total population of 11 million residents, is expected to be finished on Friday, he said.On Thursday morning, the city reported one new confirmed COVID-19 case. The case is an independent virus infection of a 40-year-old port worker whose test was positive but had showed no symptoms three weeks ago.“Generally, the incubation period of the virus ranges from one to 14 days, but there are also reported cases whose incubation period lasted four weeks,” said Sun Yunbo, director of a medical experts team organised to treat the city’s novel coronavirus, adding that the dock worker is an individual case. The new case was in addition to 12 infections reported earlier, which were closely linked to the city’s pulmonary hospital. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that efforts in the coming days should be focused on the close contacts of cases in the pulmonary hospital, especially if there are close contacts that have not been found out and isolated.“Priorities for prevention should be on wards in hospitals, especially those receiving overseas confirmed cases, and the use of major medical equipment should also be isolated,” said Wu.“Wearing face masks, keeping social distances and washing hands frequently should become a daily routine,” he added, the China Daily reported.In response to the recent outbreak in Qingdao, Sui Zhenhua, director of the Qingdao health commission, was suspended from his post and is being investigated, and Deng Kai, dean of the pulmonary hospital, was removed, according to the statements from the city government on Thursday. Meanwhile China’s National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Friday a total of 24 confirmed cases arriving from outside the mainland were reported on Friday.One new suspected COVID-19 case from outside the mainland was reported in Shanghai, the commission said.Of the new imported cases, 11 were reported in Shanghai, five in Inner Mongolia, two in Tianjin, Jiangsu and Guangdong each, and one in Fujian and Chongqing each, according to the commission.By the end of Thursday, 240 people, who came from abroad were being treated in hospitals. The Commission said 376 asymptomatic cases, including 375 from outside the mainland, were still under medical observation. As of Thursday, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 85,646, of whom 253 patients are still being treated, with four in severe condition.Altogether 80,759 patients had been discharged after recovery, and the death toll due to coronavirus stood at 4,634, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/improper-disinfection-at-china-s-qingdao-hospital-causes-new-covid-19-cluster/story-eAR9XqKZQQWB4XfNhWi7JK.html
16-10-2020||World||At least 20 killed in two militant attacks in Pakistan||At least 20 people including soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in Pakistan on Thursday, including an assault on a convoy of oil workers. The first attack took place in Balochistan, where at least seven assailants armed with rocket launchers and other heavy weapons attacked a convoy of the state-owned Oil and Gas Development Corporation, the military said.Seven soldiers of Frontier Corps and seven private security guards escorting the oil workers were killed in the encounter, which took place on the Coastal Highway near Ormara. The staff of the company remained unharmed. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but it is believed that the attack may have been carried out by one of two major groups which are fighting for an independent Balochistan.ISPR, the Pakistan Army’s public relations department, said that such cowardly acts by inimical elements to sabotage peace, stability and economic development in Balochistan shall never be allowed to succeed.“Moreover, these acts cannot subdue the resolve of our forces which are determined to defend the motherland, even at the cost of their lives,” said the ISPR.In another incident on the same day, six soldiers, including an officer, were killed by an improvised explosive device attack on a convoy near Razmak in North Waziristan. The latest incidents come four days after two soldiers were killed and three injured in an attack on a security post in Shawal valley of North Waziristan.In September, Pakistan security forces had killed four terrorists, including militant commander Ihsanullah alias Ihsan Sanray, in an intelligence-based operation. The ISPR had termed the killing as a “major breakthrough” in its fight against militants in North Waziristan. That operation had come days after wanted terrorist Waseem Zakeria was killed during an intelligence operation in North Waziristan along with four accomplices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-20-killed-in-two-militant-attacks-in-pakistan/story-yUubSpT8OrqBdyR6XSCKmO.html

In the meantime, China, Russia, India all these countries they’re spewing stuff into the air,” he alleged during the rally.He said the US has achieved energy independence while protecting its pristine environment. Trump in June, 2017 announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris deal, saying the accord would have cost America trillions of dollars, killed jobs, and hindered the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.He has continuously argued that countries like China and India are benefiting the most from the Paris agreement and the agreement itself was unfair to the US, as it badly hit its businesses and jobs.During Thursday’s rally too, Trump said to the cheering crowd that it were a few nations that were contributing to global pollution.     “I keep telling my people you know, I love clean air but Russia and China, you look at a map you have all these spots and India and many others are spewing it in. What do you suggest?” he asked his thousands of supporters who had gathered at a city airport here to listen to his election speech.Trump also mocked at those who call for replacing plastic with paper.“Well, we don’t think you should sell straws anymore. Oh great ok. You ever hear that, the straw, right? I say ok the straw is good, what about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that’s out of plastic? Well we’ll get to that later. These people are crazy,” he said.In his speech, Trump also talked about jobs for the Americans and mentioned that he recently fired the head of a semi-private company for replacing American workers with foreign workers. “The chairman of Tennessee Valley Authority was fired because he replaced American workforce with foreign workers. I told the board chairman, chairman, you’re fired. Out. You’re fired, chairman,” he said.“And what happened is as soon as I said that they hired all the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. They’re all back and they were great. They were great. So we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great,” he said.Trump alleged that the immigration plan of his Democratic opponent Joe Biden is the most extreme in the history of the country.“Biden’s plan would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release that’s catch, murderer comes over you catch him. What do you do? Well, not much. Most of them don’t say they kill people right? You catch them. You take their name and you release them into our country. It was a big deal, it sounds easy,” he said, adding that he ended catch and release.“One of the worst things. Now we release them. You know where we release them? We release them back into their country. We don’t release them into our country anymore. We say congratulations we got them,” he said.

Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the chief of the Jamiat-Ulema Islam (F), who is also heading the 11-party Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), will lead a rally from Lahore to Gujranwala ahead of the public meeting, which will be attended by leaders of almost all opposition political parties.PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and PML-N leaders Maryam Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif will also be attending the meeting. In a bid to pressurise the opposition, the government through its anti corruption watchdog the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Thursday issued arrest warrants for former president Asif Ali Zardari in a corruption case. Zardari is currently in hospital in Karachi. Party leader Bilawal Bhutto commented that these were “common tactics used to pressurise the opposition.”For its part, the government has threatened to shut down parts of the country, citing the rise in coronavirus cases. Minister for planning Asad Umar said on Thursday there are “unmistakable signs of the rise of corona” in the country and the government may have to take “restrictive actions” to curb the spread, which will have “negative effects” on the livelihoods of people.Umar said in a number of tweets that the national positivity of Covid-19 cases was 2.37% on Wednesday, the highest in more than 50 days. The minister, who also oversees Pakistan’s response to the pandemic, said 11 virus deaths on average have been reported during the first four days of this week, the highest since August 10.Despite the onset of winter, analysts say that the political temperature had started to rise in Pakistan. One expert said if the opposition parties managed to hold successive rallies and meetings in Pakistan in the coming week and are able to pull large crowds, “the Imran Khan government is in real danger.”Opposition leader and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif led the charge against Prime Minister Imran Khan in September, when he told an All Parties Conference that he had nothing to do with Khan, who was a selected prime minister and more to ask those who selected him, a hint at the country’s powerful military leadership. Describing it as a “state above the state”, Sharif had accused the Army of interfering in the politics of Pakistan and sabotaging democracy and democratic institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-rally-of-pakistan-oppn-parties-against-imran-khan-govt-today-to-kick-off-protest-movement/story-o51A28wSC0jRywdCFfd7jK.html

16-10-2020||World||Mexico’s ex-defense minister detained in US on DEA orders||Mexico’s former defense minister, General Salvador Cienfuegos, was detained by U.S. authorities on the Drug Enforcement Administration’s orders, the country’s most senior military official involved in an investigation by the narcotics-fighting agency.Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said in a tweet Thursday night he expects to be informed of the charges against Cienfuegos in the coming hours, having been told of the detention by US Ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau. Cienfuegos was held after arriving at an L.A. airport on orders of the DEA, according to the Foreign Ministry’s North America director Robert Velasco.Cienfuegos, 72, was the top military official during the six years of former President Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration, whose 2012 to 2018 government has come under intense scrutiny from current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.The president delights in railing against corruption under past administrations. Yet graft in the military could prove delicate territory for Lopez Obrador, who has drastically expanded the army’s role in Mexican life, from protecting oil facilities and ports to undertaking public works including airports and even government bank branches.Read More: Mexico Minister Resigns in Protest Over Militarization of PortsMike Vigil, a former head of DEA international operations, said he was informed by current officials that the charges against Cienfuegos include drug trafficking and money laundering related to a case in New York. Bloomberg News hasn’t been able to confirm the information, and a former press official for Cienfuegos didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.“Given the army’s current prominence in Mexico, the arrest will have disastrous consequences,” Vigil said in an interview. “Mexico has always held the army on a pedestal as being incorruptible.”Before stepping down in 2018, Cienfuegos had publicly praised Lopez Obrador’s pick to replace him, current Defense Minister Luis Crescencio Sandoval, who has become a close ally of the president.Cienfuegos is now the second major Mexican ex-security official being held by U.S. law enforcement. Former federal police chief Genaro Garcia Luna is on trial in New York for allegedly taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect convicted kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman’s Sinaloa drug cartel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-s-ex-defense-minister-detained-in-us-on-dea-orders/story-O83rBPRmQhXcF7rnQ4Iq7H.html
16-10-2020||World||DEA arrests Former Mexican defense minister on drug trafficking charges||Former Mexican defense secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, who led the country’s army for six years under ex-President Enrique Peña Nieto, has been arrested on drug trafficking and money laundering charges at Los Angeles International Airport, US and Mexican sources said Thursday.Two people with knowledge of the arrest said Cienfuegos was taken into custody on a US Drug Enforcement Administration warrant. One of the people said the warrant was for drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly.The DEA declined to comment Thursday night.Mexico’s Foreign Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, wrote on his Twitter account that US Ambassador Christopher Landau had informed him of the retired general’s arrest and that Cienfuegos had a right to receive consular assistance.A senior Mexican official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to give details of the case, said Cienfuegos was arrested when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport with his family. His family members were released and he was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center.Cienfuegos served from 2012 to 2018 as secretary of defense under Peña Nieto. He is the highest-ranking former Cabinet official arrested since the top Mexican security official Genaro Garcia Luna was arrested in Texas in 2019. Garcia Luna, who served under former President Felipe Calderón, has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges.Cienfuegos is 72 years old and has retired from active duty. Mexico’s Defense Department had no immediate reaction to the arrest.Mike Vigil, the DEA’s former chief of international operations, said when he was in Mexico in 2012 he heard corruption allegations about Cienfuegos.“There were always allegations of corruption, nothing we could sink our teeth into. That was kind of unheard of because Mexico has always put the military on a pedestal,” said Vigil, author of the book “The Land of Enchantment Cartel.”“The corruption is just coming to roost, because individuals who were once untouchable are now getting arrested,” Vigil said. “If they cooperate (with US prosecutors) there are others who are going to be falling, noting US officials “usually don’t want to trade down, they usually trade up,” seeking evidence against equal or higher-ranking officials. “It’s really a precarious situation for Mexico to have two Cabinet-level officials arrested in the US”Whatever the charges, it will be a tough blow for Mexico, where the army and navy are some of the few remaining respected public institutions.While current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to go after corruption and lawbreaking under past administrations, he has also relied more heavily on the army — and charged it with more tasks, ranging from building infrastructure projects to distributing medical supplies — than any other president in recent history.Under Cienfuegos, the Mexican army was accused of frequent human rights abuses, but that was true of both his predecessors and his successor in the post.The worst scandal in Cienfuegos’ tenure involved the 2014 army killings of suspects in a grain warehouse.The June 2014 massacre involved soldiers who killed 22 suspects at the warehouse in the town of Tlatlaya. While some died in an initial shootout with the army patrol — in which one soldier was wounded — a human rights investigation later showed that at least eight and perhaps as many as a dozen suspects were executed after they surrendered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dea-arrests-former-mexican-defense-minister-on-drug-trafficking-charges/story-e8dyEAJJnD4IHGuwa2UNVO.html
16-10-2020||World||‘I’m not afraid’: Thai protesters defy ban on protest gatherings||From shops, offices and schools they spilled onto a Bangkok street in their tens of thousands, voicing shock and anger and above all defiance.Thailand’s government had announced emergency measures to ban gatherings of five or more people to try to end three months of protests. The response was one of the biggest demonstrations so far, in the heart of the capital.“I’m not afraid. Emergency or not, I have no freedom,” said 26-year-old illustrator Thanatpohn Dejkunchorn, who left work early to attend the protest with friends. “I want freedom to exist in this country. I want it to be free from this vicious cycle.”Protests have built since mid-July in the biggest challenge in years to the political establishment - seeking the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.“We have to create understanding with the protesters,” government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters, complaining that protest leaders were not giving protesters “complete information.”Police said they would arrest all protesters, though they did not explain how they would charge tens of thousands of people.The Royal Palace has declined all comment on the protesters or their demands.Until Wednesday, the government had largely allowed demonstrations to happen, while making no sign of meeting protesters’ demands.But that changed after an incident in which protesters jeered Queen Suthida’s motorcade as she and the king were paying a rare visit from Europe, where they spend most of their time.The government cited that as well as the risks to national security and the economy from protests and the danger of spreading coronavirus as reasons for imposing emergency measures.The government then launched a crackdown, sweeping away a camp set up outside Prayuth’s office and arresting three protest leaders - among around 40 arrests in the past week.“EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY POWER”“It’s obvious that the state wants to exercise excessive and unnecessary power on people,” said 22-year-old student Pattanun Arunpreechawat, who joined Thursday’s protest after studies.Protesters want to oust Prayuth, who first took power in a 2014 coup, saying he engineered election rules last year to keep his position - an accusation he denies. Breaking a longstanding taboo, protesters have also challenged the monarchy - saying it has helped entrench decades of military influence.They gathered in the shadow of upmarket shopping malls and shiny tower blocks that are home to multinationals and other businesses in Southeast Asia’s second biggest economy.But the Ratchaprasong Intersection also has a historic resonance for protesters. In 2010, it was the scene of bloodshed as security forces cracked down on Red Shirts who battled pro-establishment Yellow Shirts during a decade of turmoil.“I’m not afraid. I’ve been chased by guns,” said beef noodle seller Thawat Kijkunasatien, 57, a veteran of the bloody crackdown a decade ago and another in 1992. “Wherever the kids go, I go,” he said at the protest while sipping a can of beer.One characteristic of the latest Thai protests has been the extent to which they are led by students and other young people. Most protest leaders are in their 20s, but an even younger generation is following.From giving the three-finger salute of protest when the national anthem plays at school to tying white ribbons in their hair and on school bags as symbols of protest, high school students have rallied to the campaign.Many left school to join Thursday’s protest - among them 18-year-old Tan, who came along after finishing school exams. He declined to give his full name for fear of reprisals.“I make sure I’m prepared for exams before I go to protests. I have to give importance to both things,” he said. “We can’t let it go on like this, or it will never end.” (Additional reporting by Matthew Tostevin and Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing by Toby Chopra)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-m-not-afraid-thai-protesters-defy-ban-on-protest-gatherings/story-YH6lUKIwX3dAEEPVy7v8RI.html
16-10-2020||World||‘History is made today’: Head of Tibetan government-in-exile meets US’ Tibet envoy||The head of the Tibetan government-in-exile Lobsang Sangay met special coordinator for Tibetan issues, Robert Destro, on Thursday marking the first meeting between the president of the Central Tibetan Administration with that of the US state department.Sangay shared a picture with Destro on Facebook. “Great honor to meet with the Special Coordinator on Tibetan Issues Robert A Destro. This is the first time in six decades, a Sikyong (President) of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) was formally invited inside the State Department,” Sangay said in the post.Sangay also thanked US secretary of state Mike Pompeo for appointing Destro, who is also a human rights official. He said, “I want to thank the State Department for acknowledging the democratically elected leader of CTA and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for approving the visit. History is made today!”The United States had on Thursday confirmed the appointment of Robert Destro as the special coordinator for Tibetan issues. The move is aimed to create pressure on China regarding the autonomy of Tibet and bring issues concerning human rights and forced labour in the region to the fore.Following Destro’s appointment, Pompeo criticised the Chinese government in a statement, which was accessed by Bloomberg. “The United States remains concerned with the PRC’s repression of the Tibetan community, including the lack of meaningful autonomy, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on Tibetans’ religious freedom and cultural traditions within China,” Pompeo said.China lashed out at the US and called the appointment as an attempt to interfere in China’s domestic affairs. Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian alleged that the appointment is a case of political manipulation. “Tibet affairs are China’s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. The setting up of the so-called coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China’s internal affairs and destabilise Tibet. China firmly opposes that,” Zhao said.The appointment’s timing has angered China as it tries to stifle Hong Kong’s growing demands for larger autonomy and independence. Taiwan continues to claim that it is an independent nation and have never been part of China which has led to tensions between both nations.Destro was also part of the committee along with Keith Krach, the undersecretary of state for economic growth, who visited Taiwan last month to sign new trade deals. The US is looking to boost its relations with Taiwan and Tibet to increase pressure on China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/history-is-made-today-head-of-tibetan-government-in-exile-meets-us-tibet-envoy/story-Oobm1GUwGuLijP8pXmbNyL.html
16-10-2020||World||‘If you care about safety of 300,000 Canadian passport holders...’: China warns Canada over granting Hong Kongers asylum||A top Chinese diplomat warned Canada Thursday against granting asylum to Hong Kong democracy protesters, adding that doing so could jeopardize the “health and safety” of Canadians living in the southern Chinese financial hub.The remarks by Cong Peiwu, Beijing’s Ottawa envoy, prompted a rebuke from Canada’s foreign minister, further escalating tensions between the two countries.Cong was responding to reports that a Hong Kong couple who took part in last year’s huge and sometimes violent protests had been granted refugee status.The landmark decision makes it likely other Hong Kongers will be given sanctuary in Canada, which has emerged as a top destination for those fleeing Beijing’s crackdown.“We strongly urge the Canadian side not (to) grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong because it is the interference in China’s domestic affairs. And certainly, it will embolden those violent criminals,” Cong said in a video press conference.“So if the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,” Cong said.When asked by reporters if that latter comment was a threat, Cong replied: “That’s your interpretation.”Canada’s Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne described Cong’s comments as “totally unacceptable and disturbing”.“I have instructed Global Affairs to call the ambassador in to make clear in no uncertain terms that Canada will always stand up for human rights and the rights of Canadians around the world,” he said in a statement carried by the Globe and Mail and other Canadian news outlets.China and Canada are marking 50 years since they forged diplomatic ties -- but those relations are deeply strained.Ties plummeted following Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and daughter of its founder.Meng was arrested on a US warrant in December 2018 during a stopover in Vancouver and is charged with bank fraud related to violations of US sanctions against Iran. She has been fighting extradition ever since.Canadian former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were arrested in China on spying charges soon afterwards, disappearing into Beijing’s opaque judicial system.Western governments see the detention of the two Canadians as direct retaliation by Beijing. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit out at Beijing for what he said was its “coercive diplomacy” as well as the ongoing crackdowns in Hong Kong and on Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Cong rejected Trudeau’s comments at his Thursday press conference. “There is no coercive diplomacy on the Chinese side,” he said.“The Hong Kong issue and the Xinjiang-related issue are not about the issue of human rights. They are purely about internal affairs of China, which brooks no interference from the outside,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-you-care-about-safety-of-300-000-canadian-passport-holders-china-warns-canada-over-granting-hong-kongers-asylum/story-wvoZk9mkBA67JgzdgXhhMK.html
16-10-2020||World||China warns Canada against granting asylum to Hong Kong protestors||The Chinese ambassador to Canada warned the Trudeau government on Thursday not to grant asylum to Hong Kong residents fleeing a widely criticized National Security Law imposed by Beijing.Ambassador Cong Peiwu branded pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong as violent criminals and said if Canada grants them asylum that amounts to interference in China’s internal affairs.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect on June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist, and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city’s internal affairs. The US, Britain, and Canada accused China of infringing on the city’s freedoms.“If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,” Cong said.Cherie Wong, the executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong, said Cong’s comment is a “direct threat” to all Canadians.“Their actions are the reason that many Hong Kongers are seeking asylum in Canada, because they no longer feel safe in Hong Kong or their human rights will be protected in Hong Kong under control of the new National Security Law,” she said in a statement.“It should not be lost on Canadians living in Hong Kong or China, they could be next. Ambassador Cong suggested so himself.” Cong also flatly rejected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s assertion that China is engaging in coercive diplomacy by imprisoning two Canadian men in retaliation for the arrest of a Chinese Huawei executive on an American extradition warrant. Meng Wanzhou is living under house arrest in Vancouver while her case wends through a British Columbia court.In December 2018, China imprisoned two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and charged them with undermining the country’s national security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-canada-against-granting-asylum-to-hong-kong-protestors/story-XEtYJDvGGZIat4OeymFOLL.html
16-10-2020||World||Jacinda Ardern set for another term as New Zealanders reward her response towards Covid-19||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern looks set for a resounding election victory on Saturday as voters applaud her masterful handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Ardern’s Labour Party had 46% support in the latest opinion poll while the main opposition National Party had 31%. With its ally the Green Party on 8%, Labour is on track for a comfortable majority in parliament.New Zealand’s success in crushing community transmission of Covid-19 stands in stark contrast to countries like the UK, US and even neighboring Australia, where authorities are still battling to contain the virus. That hasn’t been lost on voters, who have mobbed Ardern on the campaign trail in a repeat of the “Jacinda-mania” that accompanied her rise to power three years ago.“For so many voters it comes down to Ardern,” said Bryce Edwards, a political analyst at Victoria University in Wellington. “Her leadership during this crisis has led to what we’re seeing, which is a landslide for Labour.”Polling stations in the nation of five million people close at 7 p.m. local time Saturday and a provisional result is due around midnight.Ardern, 40, has captured the hallowed center ground in New Zealand politics with a blend of empathetic leadership and skilled crisis management that has also won her fame abroad. The pandemic has given her a stage on which to display those strengths, drowning out criticism that she hasn’t delivered on some key promises during her first term in office.Ardern has put the government’s pandemic response at the forefront of her bid for a second term, urging voters to trust it to keep the virus out and navigate an economic recovery.Her opponent, National Party leader Judith Collins, has offered temporary tax cuts to spur growth while attacking Ardern for policy failures.Both major parties are pledging massive spending on infrastructure to boost the economy. With government debt set to spiral, Labour would impose a higher tax rate on income over NZ$180,000 ($120,000) a year to raise more revenue.In their final televised debate before the election, Ardern reminded viewers “how lucky we are” to be free of Covid-19 and asked for more time to enact change, while Collins warned of dark economic times ahead and appealed to undecided voters for their support.The challenges ahead are enormous. The border remains closed to foreigners, crippling the key tourism industry, and unemployment is forecast to rise. But Collins, 61, hasn’t been able to gain traction with voters still focused on Ardern’s pandemic success.In the battle against Covid-19, Ardern was alone among her western peers in pursuing an explicit elimination strategy and imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world.The economy suffered its most severe contraction since the Great Depression, slumping 12.2% in the second quarter, but the lockdown wiped out community spread of the virus and restrictions were removed sooner than in many other countries. After more than 100 days without community transmission, an outbreak flared in largest city Auckland, but that was also quickly stamped out.New Zealand has now gone three weeks without any cases in the community, with all new infections limited to returned overseas travelers undergoing mandatory quarantine. The nation has recorded just 25 coronavirus deaths.Under Ardern, New Zealand has taken a nuanced foreign-policy stance toward China, trying not to antagonize its largest trading partner while staying in line with the U.S. and its other western allies in the Five Eyes alliance. This approach has so far helped it to avoid the souring of relations Australia is currently experiencing with Beijing.Labour’s ascendancy under Ardern has overshadowed her current coalition partner New Zealand First, which at 3% is polling below the 5% it needs to be returned to parliament. The election may therefore bring the curtain down on the political career of its leader, Winston Peters, a maverick who’s often held the balance of power.The libertarian ACT Party has seen its fortunes rise at the expense of both New Zealand First and National. ACT had 8% support in the latest poll.New Zealand’s proportional representation electoral system lends itself to coalitions, with no party managing to secure an outright majority since its introduction in 1996. Labour is expected to govern with the Greens, which may see the next administration address issues such as poverty and climate change more actively.Ardern has been criticized for failing to deliver the transformational government she promised at the outset of her first term.She ditched plans for a capital gains tax that might have addressed the widening gap between rich and poor. A program to build tens of thousands of new homes to help fix a housing crises fell well short of goals, and environmental groups say her climate-change policies are too tame.“They have been timid in pushing things through on poverty and housing,” said Shamubeel Eaqub, an economist and public policy consultant at Sense Partners in Auckland. “But if you think there are risks on the horizon and there will be more crises to deal with, you want someone you think is going to be a good leader under pressure. I think Ardern has earned that trust and confidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ardern-set-for-another-term-as-new-zealanders-reward-her-response-towards-covid-19/story-41TsB4EB1xPXayHu3TL8BO.html
16-10-2020||World||‘US has allowed China’s CCP to walk all over us,’ says secretary of state Pompeo||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Thursday said that the threat from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “is real” and added that the US has allowed the CCP to “walk all over us”.“Look, this risk from the Chinese Communist Party is real. For 40 years - and this isn’t political, remotely - Republican presidents, Republican congresses, Democrat, it didn’t make a difference - we went on bended knee. We allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us. And President Trump is working to right that ship. It’ll be good for American jobs, it’ll be good for American security,” Pompeo said in an interview with Erick Erickson of The Erick Erickson Show on WSB Atlanta.Pompeo further said that the CCP is “under the veil of these things called Confucius Institutes impacting our kids, putting their propaganda on top of our children.”Pompeo further called taking money from the CCP in order to keep schools afloat as an “unacceptable tradeoff” adding that the people need to “face up” to the fact that the money provided by the CCP is to ‘subvert our democracy’.“It’s often about money, whether it was the desire of our companies to sell products in China, or in this case for universities to take grant money from the Chinese Communist Party. It’s often about economics. We need to just face up to the fact that this money is being used to subvert our democracy, to undermine our way of life, and we should simply say it’s unacceptable, we’ll find another way to underwrite our schools, to pay for our kids to go where they need to go,” added the US Secretary of State.President Donald Trump has raised the issue repeatedly that China is not considered a developed nation in the World Trade Organization as it enjoys the benefits of a developing nation despite having an “advanced military” to which, Pompeo said that there are not many countries who find it ‘plausible’ that China claims itself of being a developing country.“President Trump and our team have built out a real coalition on this issue, Erick. It was the President who flagged this first, but now we can see that the world has come to understand China the same way that the United States does. Only the poorest countries in the world are supposed to get trade deals, and the whole world I think is united,” Pompeo said.“It will take some real work to fix what happens at the World Trade Organization on this. But I don’t think there are many defenders left that think it’s plausible for China to claim that it’s a developing country when it has one of the most advanced militaries,” he added.Trump has repeatedly labelled China’s entry into the World Trade Organization most disastrous trade deals” in history.

16-10-2020||World||Imran Khan tries to dodge FATF’s ‘grey list’ on 3 counts. It won’t work||The Imran Khan government, which has missed another deadline to deliver on action plan outlined by anti-terror financing watchdog for Islamabad, is trying hard to get off the Financial Action Task Force’s ‘grey list’, telling the world that it should reward Pakistan for the steps taken to curb terror financing and money laundering.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi reflected the optimism in Islamabad when he recently declared that Pakistan would “very soon” get out of the grey list. Qureshi told a gathering in Pakistan’s seventh-largest city of Multan that Islamabad had complied with 80 per cent of the FATF recommendations and “very soon Pakistan will be on the white list of the FATF”.Counter-terror officials in New Delhi who have been tracking the implementation of steps by Pakistan said Islamabad appeared to be heavily relying on lobbying firm Linden Strategies to sell its narrative that Pakistan was on track to deliver on its obligations and had earned a reprieve.Much of this campaign is designed to identify and influence at least 12 out of the 39 member states to back up its request at the plenary meeting of Paris-based global dirty money watchdog.This pitch, one of them said, was primarily based on three arguments that Pakistan had been putting forth.One, the Imran Khan government will attempt to showcase the arrest and conviction of some Lashkar-e-Tayyiba leaders to claim that it had cracked down on terrorists. Second, it is expected to highlight the action taken under the anti-money laundering regime against entities of concern including those linked with terrorist outfits. Third, Pakistan is also expected to underline that it has complied with 21 out of the 27 action plan points and is about to clear the bar in the remaining six items.“These arguments are essentially jugglery of facts… a deception,” a senior Indian official said. It is highly unlikely that anyone will fall for them.For instance, it misses the fact that Pakistan is yet to act against the 6,500 Pakistani terrorists mentioned in the UN monitoring team’s report of May 2020 who have been deployed in Afghanistan to fulfil Pakistani objectives.Pakistan had tried to impress the meeting of the Asia pacific Joint Group last month telling them about the arrest and conviction of a select group of the terrorist leader. But Pakistan was grilled, diplomats familiar with the proceedings said, over the prosecution of UN-designated terrorists under ancillary charges and not for terror financing. A prominent example was the verdict of an anti-terror court in Lahore that convicted three members of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and its front organisation, Jamaat-ud-Dawa and awarded them minor punishments. Like Abdul Rehman Makki, brother-in-law of Lashkar co-founder Hafiz Saeed was handed an 18-month jail term which was later suspended by the Lahore high court. It is not clear if Makki, who had designated a terrorist by the US in 2010 and carries a $ 2 million (Pakistani Rs 32.6 crore) bounty - had to pay the Pakistani Rs 20,000 fine imposed on him by Pakistan’s anti-terror court. A few months earlier, Pakistani courts had ordered release of 196 terrorists convicted by military courts.Pakistan also had to face some embarrassing moments at the September meeting of the Asia Pacific - Joint Group where it was pointed out that Islamabad had failed to act against eight entities of concern mentioned in the FATF-approved action plan and non-profit organisations notorious for channelling funds to terror groups.Officials also question the effectiveness of the three laws pushed through parliament at a joint session. The laws, which were ostensibly aimed at plugging the possibility of terror financing, were riddled with loopholes and did not even have a provision to penalise government officials who support terror, a Pakistan watcher said.Pakistan has a long history of taking cosmetic steps that it uses to persuade the international community to ease the pressure, he said, recalling how Islamabad had produced a list of 7,600 individuals notified as terrorists to the FATF in October 2018 to signal that it meant business.

Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The study found the regimens appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the length of the in-hospital course among patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the WHO said on Thursday. The results of the trial are yet to be reviewed and were uploaded on the preprint server medRxiv. (https://bit.ly/3nViYIf)Earlier this month, data from a US study of remdesivir by Gilead showed the treatment cut Covid-19 recovery time by five days compared with patients who got a placebo in a trial comprising 1,062 patients.“The emerging (WHO) data appears inconsistent, with more robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of remdesivir,” Gilead told Reuters.“We are concerned the data from this open-label global trial has not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion, particularly given the limitations of the trial design.” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Wednesday that during the study, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were stopped in June after they proved ineffective, but other trials continued in more than 500 hospitals and 30 countries.

We’re looking at monoclonal anti-bodies, we’re looking at immunomodulators and some of the newer anti-viral drugs that have been developed in the last few months,” Swaminathan said.Remdesivir received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration on May 1, and has since been authorized for use in several countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remdesivir-hydroxychloroquine-did-not-cut-hospital-stay-or-mortality-in-covid-19-patients-who/story-VZgUfU8T4n14g589jufbNM.html
16-10-2020||World||In split-screen town halls, Joe Biden accuses Trump administration of ‘panicking’ during pandemic||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday criticized what he called President Donald Trump’s “panicked” response to the coronavirus pandemic, while Trump defended his handling of a crisis that has killed more than 216,000 Americans.The rivals spoke in simultaneous town halls broadcast on separate television networks after a debate originally scheduled for Thursday was called off following Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis. The split-screen showdown offered a stark reminder of the many ways the campaign season has been changed by a pandemic that has prompted more than 18 million people to cast ballots more than two weeks before Election Day on Nov. 3.Biden, speaking to voters in Philadelphia on ABC, blamed the Republican president for concealing the deadliness of the virus. “He said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic,” Biden said. “Americans don’t panic. He panicked.”Trump defended both his response to the pandemic as well as his own personal conduct, including staging a Rose Garden event at the White House where few wore masks or practiced social distancing, which resulted in numerous attendees contracting the disease.“Hey, I’m president - I have to see people, I can’t be in a basement,” Trump said on NBC in front of an outdoor audience of voters in Miami, implicitly criticizing Biden for spending months off the campaign trail as the pandemic raged.He did not answer questions about the last time he tested negative before contracting the virus, saying he did not recall precisely.Trump, who aggressively interrupted Biden during a chaotic debate two weeks ago, showed little interest in altering his belligerent tone, sparring frequently with moderator Samantha Guthrie.He said he “heard different stories” about the efficacy of masks, even though his own administration’s public health experts have said wearing them is key to stopping the spread of the virus.The president declined to denounce QAnon, the false conspiracy theory that Democrats are part of a global pedophile ring, first praising its adherents for opposing pedophilia before saying he knew nothing about the movement. Trump also dodged questions about a New York Times investigation of two decades of his tax returns, which he has refused to release publicly despite decades of precedent for presidential candidates.He appeared to confirm the paper’s report that he has some $400 million in personally guaranteed loans, arguing that the amount was a “peanut” compared with his worth. He also did not deny the Times’ report that he paid only $750 in federal income tax during his first year in the White House, although he said at one point the paper’s numbers were “wrong.”Early voting surgeThe second presidential debate had originally been scheduled for Thursday, but Trump pulled out of the event after organizers decided to turn it into a virtual affair following his diagnosis two weeks ago. A final debate is still scheduled for Oct. 22 in Nashville, Tennessee.Trump, who spent three days in a military hospital but has since returned to the campaign trail, is trying to alter the dynamics of the race. Reuters/Ipsos polls show Biden has a significant national lead, although his advantage in battleground states is less pronounced.North Carolina, a highly competitive state, saw huge lines as it began more than two weeks of in-person early voting on Thursday, following record turnout in Georgia and Texas earlier in the week.Some 18.3 million Americans have voted either in person or by mail so far, representing 12.9% of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida. Voters are seeking to avoid in-person lines on Election Day to stay safe as coronavirus infections and hospitalizations continue to rise, but also to make sure their ballots will count. Many are concerned that Trump will challenge widely used mail-in ballots, after his repeated claims without evidence that they were fraudulent.Supreme court battleThe Senate confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat, prompted careful answers from both candidates. Republicans have pushed to seat Barrett before the election after refusing to do so for former Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee in 2016, saying it was inappropriate in an election year.Biden said he was not a “fan” of court-packing, the idea promoted by some Democrats of adding justices to countermand what they view as a stolen seat. But he declined to rule it out after moderator George Stephanopoulos pressed him, saying: “It depends on how this turns out.”Trump would not say whether he would like to see abortion rights invalidated, an outcome that many legal scholars believe is more likely with the conservative Barrett on the court.“I think that she’s going to make a great decision,” he said. “I did not tell her what decision to make.”$1.5 billionIn a sign of Democratic determination to defeat Trump, a massive amount of money has poured into the party’s coffers in recent months.Democratic fundraising organization ActBlue said on Thursday it collected $1.5 billion online from July to September, the most it had ever raised in one quarter. By comparison, major Republican fundraising platform WinRed said on Monday that it collected $623.5 million in the same period.Biden’s campaign collected $383 million in September, setting a new record for a U.S. campaign for the second consecutive month. The Trump campaign has not released its monthly figures.Both candidates have been visiting battleground states this week, with Trump holding rallies in Florida, Pennsylvania and Iowa and Biden traveling to Ohio and Florida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-split-screen-town-halls-joe-biden-accuses-trump-administration-of-panicking-during-pandemic/story-W03kKWRGJCO8cmm2gAYOfJ.html
16-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump ‘panicked’ about Covid-19, says Joe Biden||Former US vice president Joe Biden hit out at the Donald Trump administration saying that the president panicked about the Coronavirus outbreak in the country.“The president was informed about how dangerous this virus was. We learned that he knew well how serious it was when he did an interview with Bob Woodward and at the time he said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic--Americans don’t panic, he panicked and didn’t say a word to anybody,” Biden said during his town hall at Philadelphia.“He didn’t talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market. He worried if he talked about how bad this could be, unless we took these precautionary actions, then, in fact, the market would go down. And his barometer of the success of the economy is the market,” he added.Speaking about the vaccine, he responded saying, “Trump talks about things that are not accurate.”“If the body of scientists say (it’s ready) and it’s been tested, it’s gone through the three phases - yes, I would take and I would encourage people to take it. But President Trump is saying things like injecting bleach on your arms,” the former US vice president said in response to a vaccine-related question. As per the latest updates by Johns Hopkins University, the US -- which is the worst affected country from the virus -- has a total of 7,975,725 Covid-19 cases and the highest death toll in the world with 217,746 deaths.

16-10-2020||World||China sees red as US names officer for Tibet affairs||China on Thursday accused the US of trying to destabilise Tibet, hours after Washington appointed a senior official to oversee Tibetan affairs as it mounts pressure on Beijing on human rights issues. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Wednesday named Robert Destro as the new special coordinator for Tibetan issues. The US remains concerned with China’s “repression of the Tibetan community, including the lack of meaningful autonomy, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on Tibetans’ religious freedom and cultural traditions within China,” Pompeo said in statement. Reacting sharply, the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing will not allow foreign interference in its internal affairs. “Setting up of the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China’s internal affairs and destabilise Tibet,” said ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. “China firmly opposes this (the interference) and has never recognised this,” Zhao said at the briefing when asked to comment on the appointment. China also said on Thursday the US was seriously undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait after a US Navy destroyer sailed through the waters amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Taipei. The spokesperson for its Eastern Theatre Command, Zhang Chunxuan, said air and sea forces were mobilised to keep tabs on Wednesday on the USS Barry, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.Zhang said the US has been sending “the wrong signal” to proponents of independence for Taiwan, a pro-US self-governing democracy that China claims as its own territory.

It means half of England’s population is now under local lockdowns.MPs and local leaders from Manchester were in talks with Downing Street over placing the Greater Manchester area in the highest Tier 3 level, which would mean closing pubs, restaurants and other venues. Liverpool and some areas of Leicester are under toughest curbs in Tier 3.There was alarm in Germany as the country reported more than 6,600 new cases, its highest recorded daily total since the pandemic began. On Thursday, 6,638 infections were reported over the past 24 hours. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen was forced to leave an EU summit on Thursday shortly after it opened because one of her close staffers tested positive for Covid-19.

16-10-2020||World||GBD report shows world affected by ‘syndemic’ of chronic diseases, Covid-19||The world is caught in a perfect storm of rising rates of chronic disease, persistent infectious diseases and public health failures that have fuelled deaths in the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a major global study of human health.The emergence and overlap of the coronavirus pandemic with a continued global rise in chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes - with added environmental risks such as air pollution - have exacerbated the coronavirus death toll, it said.The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is the most comprehensive of its kind. Published in The Lancet medical journal, it analysed 286 causes of death, 369 diseases and injuries and 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories to offer a view on the underlying health of the global population and the impact of Covid-19.“Covid-19 is an acute-on-chronic health emergency,” said Richard Horton, the Lancet’s editor-in-chief. He described the coronavirus pandemic combined with high global rates of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases as a “syndemic”.The study found that leading causes of ill health in people aged 50 and older worldwide were ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. In younger people - aged 10 to 49 - road injuries, HIV/AIDS, lower back pain and depressive disorders were dominant.It also found that the rise in chronic diseases, combined with a failure of public health to tackle preventable risk factors, had left populations vulnerable to health emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic.“The ‘syndemic’ nature of the threat we face demands that we not only treat each affliction, but also urgently address the underlying social inequalities that shape them,” Horton said.He said chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity and high cholesterol suffered by millions around the world had played a critical role in driving the more than 1 million deaths caused by Covid-19 to date.Such conditions - driven by unhealthy diets and inadequate levels of exercise - “will continue to shape health in every country after the pandemic subsides”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gbd-report-shows-world-affected-by-syndemic-of-chronic-diseases-covid-19/story-GSmuQwsAaBG3MnlEjztMPK.html
16-10-2020||World||US coronavirus cases cross eight million as highest spike in nearly 2 months recorded||US cases of the novel coronavirus crossed 8 million on Thursday, rising by 1 million in less than a month, as another surge in cases hits the nation at the onset of cooler weather.Since the pandemic started, over 217,000 people have died in the United States.The United States reported 60,000 new infections on Wednesday, the highest since August 14, with rising cases in every region, especially the Midwest.Health experts have long warned that colder temperatures driving people inside could promote the spread of the virus. They have not pinpointed the reason for the rise but point to fatigue with Covid-19 precautions and students returning to schools and colleges.According to a Reuters analysis, 25 states have so far set records for increases in new cases in October. All Midwest and Northeast states have reported more cases in the past four weeks than in the prior four weeks, with the number of new cases doubling in states like Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Hampshire.In the Midwest, daily new cases hit a record on Wednesday with over 22,000 new infections. The positive test rate tops 30% in South Dakota and 20% in Idaho and Wisconsin.Ten states on Thursday reported record increases in new cases, including Wisconsin with 4,000 new cases. “Our numbers are high and they’re growing rapidly,” state Health Secretary-Designate Andrea Palm told a news conference.“We have now surpassed 1,000 Covid-19 patients who are in the hospital. In some regions of our state, our ICU beds are 90% or more full. Over the course of the past six weeks, our average daily deaths have more than tripled,” Palm added.California remains the state with the most total cases followed by Texas, Florida, New York and Georgia. Those five states account for over 40% of all reported Covid-19 cases in the nation.With both cases and positive test rates rising in recent weeks, New York City has closed businesses and schools in neighborhood hot spots despite protests from a small contingent of Orthodox Jews.In addition to rising cases, hospitals in several states are straining to handle an influx of patients.In the Midwest, Covid-19 hospitalizations hit a record high for a tenth day in a row on Wednesday. Nationally, the United States reported nearly 37,000 hospitalizations, the highest since August 28.Wisconsin, which reported record hospitalization on Wednesday, has opened a field hospital outside of Milwaukee to handle Covid-19 patients.

16-10-2020||World||Donald Trump says mail-in extension may harm ‘procrastinating voters’||President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee filed an emergency request to delay a North Carolina court ruling allowing mail-in ballots to be accepted as many as nine days after Election Day, arguing the extension could confuse “procrastinating voters.”US District Judge William Osteen’s ruling late Wednesday extending the deadline will cause “mass confusion” and could result in voters failing to send their ballots in on time, the Trump campaign and the RNC said in a filing Thursday in Greensboro.The ruling “gives procrastinating voters another excuse to wait, and perhaps miss the postmark deadline, or may mislead voters if it turns out that the extension is overturned on appeal before Election Day,” they said.North Carolina voters have already requested 1.3 million absentee ballots, and more than 500,000 have been cast under the existing rules, which allow votes to be counted as many as three days after the Nov. 3 contest, according to the plaintiffs, who are appealing the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.State election officials extended the deadline last month. Osteen ruled that returning to the earlier deadline now would violate Supreme Court precedent because it’s too close to the election to make that change. The Republicans argue it’s the judge’s decision that’s changing the status quo late in the game. They asked Osteen to place a hold on his ruling pending their appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-mail-in-extension-may-harm-procrastinating-voters/story-5bUa5h7PK0WOf98RIfSM7I.html
16-10-2020||World||GOP pushes Amy Coney Barrett toward court as Democrats decry ‘sham’||Republicans powered Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett closer to confirmation Thursday, pushing past Democratic objections and other priorities during the Covid-19 crisis in the drive to seat President Donald Trump’s pick before the November 3 election.The Senate Judiciary Committee set Oct. 22 for its vote to recommend Barrett’s nomination to the full Senate, with a final confirmation vote expected by month’s end.“A sham,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. “Power grab,” protested Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “Not normal,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.“You don’t convene a Supreme Court confirmation hearing, in the middle of a pandemic, when the Senate’s on recess, when voting has already started in the presidential election in a majority of states,” declared Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.Republicans eager to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg countered that Trump is well within bounds to fill the vacancy, and they have the votes to do it. Relying on a slim Senate majority, Trump’s Republicans are poised to lock a 6-3 conservative court majority for years to come.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he understands Democrats’ “disappointment.” He said, “Their loss is the American people’s gain.” Barrett’s confirmation would bring the most pronounced ideological change on the court in 30 years, from the liberal icon Ginsberg to the conservative appeals court judge from Indiana. The shift is poised to launch a new era of court rulings on abortion, voting rights and other matters that are now open to new uncertainty.The 48-year-old Barrett was careful during two days of public testimony not to tip her views on many issues, or take on the president who nominated her. Facing almost 20 hours of questions from senators, she declined to offer specifics beyond a vow to keep an open mind and take the cases as they come.“It’s not the law of Amy,” the mother of seven told the senators at various times.Barrett wasn’t present for Thursday’s hearing, the last of the week’s sessions as the coronavirus pandemic hangs over the country. Two GOP senators on the committee tested positive for the virus and two campaign staff members for Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, the vice presidential nominee, also tested positive, grounding her travel Thursday, the campaign announced.Stakes are high for all sides. Liberals pounced when top Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California hugged the chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., as days of hearings closed, praising his handling of the process. They called for her immediate removal from leadership.Among those testifying Thursday in support of Barrett’s nomination, retired appellate court Judge Thomas Griffith assured senators that Barrett would be among justices who “can and do put aside party and politics.” But a coalition of civil rights groups opposed her nomination. Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights, said the judge’s unwillingness to speak forcefully for the Voting Rights Act and other issues should “sound an alarm” for Americans with a case heading to the high court.“Our nation deserves a justice who is committed to preserving the hard-earned rights of all Americans, particularly the most vulnerable,” Clarke testified.Trump’s Republican allies, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are reshaping the judiciary, having changed Senate rules at the start of the president’s term to allow 51 votes, rather than the traditional 60, to advance Supreme Court nominees. With a slim 53-47 majority, her confirmation is almost assured. Two Republican senators, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Maine’s Susan Collins, are opposed to voting before the election, but no others objected. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said Thursday he will vote to confirm Barrett. She would be Trump’s third justice on the high court.A former Notre Dame Law School professor, Barrett would be the only one of her Supreme Court colleagues not groomed in the Ivy League. She had little courtroom experience when the Senate confirmed her to the federal bench in 2017, but quickly became a rising conservative star.At the high court, she may be quickly called on, if confirmed, to consider the GOP-backed challenge to the Affordable Care Act in a case coming before the court Nov. 10, as well as any election-related challenges between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden in the heated presidential campaign.“Amy’s doing a fantastic job,” Trump said at the White House before heading out to a Wednesday night campaign rally.Trump has publicly stated he wants a justice swiftly seated for both situations. The president has said on Twitter he wants a justice who would rule differently than Chief Justice John Roberts, who helped preserve the law in previous cases. And he said he wants a justice in place for any disputes arising from the election, particularly concerning the surge of mail-in ballots expected during the pandemic.Barrett frustrated senators during two days of public hearings by declining to disclose views on those matters, and many others, despite a collection of public statements and writings against abortion and the court’s decisions on the health care law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-pushes-amy-coney-barrett-toward-court-as-democrats-decry-sham/story-HmM7UnaJATHcTLicuJrARJ.html

We were beating China at a level they haven’t been beaten before. I was charging them tariffs and they didn’t know what to do. In 2019, we became much bigger and we were way overtaking them and they weren’t even close,” Trump said at a rally in North Carolina.Trump further said everybody was coming together but “the plague” (Covid-19) came along adding that under his administration, the US is number one in terms of the economic comeback.“Under my leadership, we are developing vaccines, therapies, and all those other things. It’s happening so fast, no one can believe it. We are the number one country by far for an economic comeback than any other country,” he said.Trump further said that he took the “toughest action” over the “rampant theft” by China over jobs adding that the US has the “best environmental numbers. The US President also went on to accuse China, Russia, and India of “spewing stuff’ into the air.“I took the toughest-ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. We have achieved energy independence and we have the best environmental numbers. China, India, and Russia -- all of these countries are spewing stuff in the air.

16-10-2020||World||Low risk of Covid-19 infection on planes if masks worn: US military||The risk of being infected with the coronavirus on an airliner is very low if passengers wear masks, according to a study carried out aboard Boeing long-haul jets by the US military and published Thursday.Researchers using sensors and fluorescent tracers measured the volume of airborne contagious matter emitted by a dummy simulating an infected person breathing normally.The passengers most exposed to the infected person -- those just in front of, behind or beside the dummy -- were represented in the study by the sensors.Some 300 test rounds were carried out on the ground and in flight over the course of eight straight days in August in cooperation with United Airlines on Boeing 767 and 777 jetliners.The study concluded that 99.7 percent of Covid contaminant particles were eliminated by the sophisticated ventilation systems on the planes before they reached the passengers seated closest to the dummy.Expanding outward to the 40 seats closest to the infected person, the elimination rate is 99.99 percent, the study said.The results prompted US military transport officials to conclude that even on a full plane, the level of transmission over 12 hours of flight was negligible.However, the tests only looked at a scenario involving a single infected passenger. They also assumed that everyone on the plane wore a mask continuously, and did not address a scenario in which an infected person walks around the cabin of the plane.“While the tests did have some limitations,” said Commander Joe Pope, the US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) operations directorate liaison for the testing, “the results are encouraging.”“For both the 777 and 767 airframes, the calculations show about 54 flight hours are required for cumulative inhalation of an assumed infectious dose,” Pope said.The study was conducted by USTRANSCOM and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).Since the start of the pandemic, the US military has suspended most movement of its troops and their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/low-risk-of-covid-infection-on-planes-if-masks-worn-us-military/story-JxzkUhPrdEVe0NUiBfRK3J.html

16-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Donald Trump says Joe Biden will face ‘soft’ questions in dueling town hall||President Donald Trump suggested that he’s likely to face tougher questions during a televised town hall meeting on Thursday night than Democrat Joe Biden, who will appear concurrently on another network.“I’d like to watch him because I want to see if he can make it through the program,” Trump said at a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Thursday. “And, honestly, they’ll be so soft.”The candidates’ appearances -- each starting at 8 p.m. New York time with Trump on NBC from Miami and Biden on ABC from Philadelphia-- will make for one of the stranger moments of the 2020 campaign, fracturing television viewership as the candidates deliver their messages without the added tension and drama of a debate.Even so, the event will give Trump one of his highest-profile opportunities before the Nov. 3 election to reverse his slide in polls that show Biden ahead.The two candidates originally were supposed to debate Thursday night. Instead of sparring with each other over topics such as the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and health care, the town hall format typically gives the candidates a less contentious opportunity to lay out their positions, and engage one-on-one with voters about issues they care about.Trump backed out of the originally scheduled town hall format debate after his campaign rejected revised plans by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates for the candidates to appear remotely due to his infection with Covid-19. The campaign insisted that the president and his aides, a number of whom have also tested positive for coronavirus, posed no health risk.Complaint to NBCA group of more than 100 actors, writers and producers complained in a letter to Comcast Corp. and NBCUniversal about its decision to air Trump’s town hall opposite the Biden event. The letter, reprinted in publications such as Variety, called it “a disservice to the American public.”“We believe this kind of indifference to the norms and rules of our democracy are what have brought our country to this perilous state,” according to the letter, signed by director J.J. Abrams, actor Jon Hamm and writer-director Aaron Sorkin.NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde said in a statement: ”We share in the frustration that our event will initially air alongside the first half of ABC’s broadcast with Vice President Biden. Our decision is motivated only by fairness, not business considerations.”Biden’s town hall will last 90 minutes.Trump often complains that journalists ask easy questions of Biden, an assertion he reiterated on Thursday, pointing to a recent town hall on NBC. “They asked him questions that a child could answer,” Trump said, even though it was largely voters doing the questioning.Early VotingWith 19 days until the election, early voting is already underway in two-dozen states. In-person and mail-in voting are surpassing records amid concerns about Covid-19 transmission at polling places and what strategists in both parties say is heightened interest in the race.The pandemic, which has killed more than 217,000 in the U.S. and left millions infected, is sure to be a top topic among voters’ questions for each of the candidates.Two-thirds of registered voters say the president failed to take appropriate precautions against the virus, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released over the weekend. Biden has hammered Trump for his cavalier approach toward the pandemic.The president has spent recent days downplaying the threat posed by the virus, touting an experimental antibody treatment he received while hospitalized and saying social-distancing measures advocated by Democrats did more harm than good.“The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself,” Trump said Wednesday in remarks to the Economic Club of New York.Vaccine TimingWhile Trump had hoped to unveil a vaccine for coronavirus before Election Day, he’s acknowledged more recently that isn’t likely to happen after the Food and Drug Administration released safety guidelines, over objections from the White House, requiring a more strenuous safety review.Similarly, the president’s pledge to quickly and widely distribute the experimental treatment he received – and provide it free to American coronavirus patients – has been held up as the FDA evaluates emergency use authorizations.Both candidates are also likely to face questions about the Supreme Court. The town halls are taking place during the confirmation process for Trump’s high court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett.Democrats argue that the nomination shouldn’t be considered while voting for the next president is under way. They’re warning that Barrett could cast a deciding vote to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which has become increasingly popular. The president and his campaign aides, meanwhile, see the nomination as a way to activate conservative and religious voters who care deeply about the court’s composition.‘Court Packing’Trump and other Republicans have been pressing Biden to say whether he supports adding seats to the court, or “court packing,” an idea that has support from progressives who see it as the only way to regain a majority as conservatives appear on track to hold six of the court’s current nine seats.After weeks of ducking the question, Biden said Monday that he’s “not a fan of court packing” but still left open the possibility. Trump has argued that Biden’s refusal to answer is evidence that the former vice president is a puppet of the more extreme elements of the Democratic Party.Trump may be especially eager to discuss a report from the New York Post saying emails purportedly from Hunter Biden show he introduced his father, who was vice president at the time, to an executive at a Ukrainian energy firm. The paper claims the communication contradicts an assertion by Joe Biden that he hasn’t spoken to his son about his business dealings.But the email doesn’t detail the extent of the meeting or whether Biden spoke to his son about it. It also doesn’t say definitively whether Biden actually met the executive. The Biden campaign said the former vice president never met the executive.The Biden campaign has refuted the story, saying that Biden’s schedules do not include a meeting with the official, Vadym Pozharskyi. Biden has more broadly challenged his opponents’ claims that his son was able to influence Biden’s actions toward Ukraine, arguing he never discussed work with Hunter and also stressing that his views of the country aligned with the policy positions taken by the U.S. government and key allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-biden-will-face-soft-questions-in-dueling-town-hall/story-rqT05Hjtc3RI45yc8OqAsK.html

Some service was restored and tweets began appearing again at about 7 pm New York time.The company earlier said it saw no evidence of a security breach or hack, but was investigating internal causes for the problems. San Francisco-based Twitter had said on its status website it was looking into an “irregularity” with its APIs, the technology that lets different software systems interact with each other.Downdetector.com, which tracks outages, received at least 50,000 reports about problems with the social media platform, starting at about 5:15 pm. The number of Twitter reports on the site had declined to less than 6,000 as of 7:03 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-s-service-mostly-restored-after-apparent-global-outage/story-704aX78IVgPErAJnKO095K.html

Chico Rodrigues as part of a probe into the alleged misappropriation of Covid-19 funds, according to the 90-day suspension issued by Luís Roberto Barroso, a justice on Brazil’s Supreme Court.Police initially found 10,000 reais ($1,780) and $6,000 inside a safe in Rodrigues’ house Wednesday, at which point the lawmaker asked if he could go to the bathroom, according to the police report, part of which is included in Barroso’s ruling. As Rodrigues walked away, a police officer noticed a large, rectangular bulge under the senator’s shorts.“Found inside his underwear, near his buttocks, were stacks of money that totaled 15,000 reais ($2,675),” the report says. The ruling was reviewed by The Associated Press.Asked three times whether he had any additional cash stowed, the senator angrily shoved his hand into his underwear to retrieve more stacks of bills, which totaled 17,900 reais ($3,200), according to the report.A subsequent police search turned up another 250 reais ($45) from inside his underwear. There is video of that search, which Barroso wrote in his ruling he was declining to provide to the senate as it was “well within his (Rodrigues’) intimate clothing″ and could cause ″greater discomfort.″Barroso wrote that Rodrigues’ decision to hide the money indicated impropriety and had raised the possibility of decreeing preventative imprisonment. The senate can vote to reverse the suspension.“My home was invaded for having done my job as a lawmaker, getting resources for the state to combat Covid-19,” Rodrigues said in a statement. “I believe in justice and I will prove that I have nothing to do with any illicit act.”Earlier Thursday, Rodrigues resigned as deputy leader of Bolsonaro’s government in the senate, according to the nation’s official gazette.Bolsonaro won the presidency in large part due to his vow to take on crime and corruption. However, his dedication to crimefighting has faced skepticism after his justice minister, Sergio Moro, resigned earlier this year, alleging Bolsonaro had sought to intervene improperly in the federal police. There are also investigations underway that target Bolsonaro’s sons, who are lawmakers.Late Wednesday, shortly before the first news report from online site Crusoe appeared about the police raid on Rodrigues’ house, Bolsonaro said he would deliver a kick to the neck of anyone in his government found to be corrupt.In the capital, Brasilia, Bolsonaro repeated his claim Thursday that his government hasn’t been marred by the scandals as have previous administrations. He also said that, unlike ministers and heads of state-owned enterprises, Rodrigues doesn’t form part of his government.“We are combating corruption; it makes no difference who the person is,” Bolsonaro said when asked about Rodrigues’ case, adding the investigation was a point of pride.Rodrigues is a member of the joint congressional committee tasked with executing the budget for Covid-19 measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-s-ally-suspended-after-cops-find-cash-in-his-undergarments/story-uq29Kn89vY39ztzYdcb9iK.html

16-10-2020||World||YouTube follows Twitter and Facebook with QAnon crackdown||YouTube is following the lead of Twitter and Facebook, saying that it is taking more steps to limit QAnon and other baseless conspiracy theories that can lead to real-world violence.The Google-owned video platform said Thursday it will now prohibit material targeting a person or group with conspiracy theories that have been used to justify violence.One example would be videos that threaten or harass someone by suggesting they are complicit in a conspiracy such as QAnon, which paints President Donald Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and “deep state” government officials.Pizzagate is another internet conspiracy theory — essentially a predecessor to QAnon — that would fall in the banned category. Its promoters claimed children were being harmed at a pizza restaurant in Washington D.C. A man who believed in the conspiracy entered the restaurant in December 2016 and fired an assault rifle. He was sentenced to prison in 2017.YouTube is the third of the major social platforms to announce policies intended rein in QAnon, a conspiracy theory they all helped spread.Twitter announced in July a crackdown on QAnon, though it did not ban its supporters from its platform. It did ban thousands of accounts associated with QAnon content and blocked URLs associated with it from being shared. Twitter also said that it would stop highlighting and recommending tweets associated with QAnon.Facebook, meanwhile, announced last week that it was banning groups that openly support QAnon. It said it would remove pages, groups and Instagram accounts for representing QAnon — even if they don’t promote violence.The social network said it will consider a variety of factors in deciding whether a group meets its criteria for a ban. Those include the group’s name, its biography or “about” section, and discussions within the page or group on Facebook, or account on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.Facebook’s move came two months after it announced softer crackdown, saying said it would stop promoting the group and its adherents. But that effort faltered due to spotty enforcement.YouTube said it had already removed tens of thousands of QAnon-videos and eliminated hundreds of channels under its existing policies — especially those that explicitly threaten violence or deny the existence of major violent events.“All of this work has been pivotal in curbing the reach of harmful conspiracies, but there’s even more we can do to address certain conspiracy theories that are used to justify real-world violence, like QAnon,” the company said in Thursday’s blog post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-follows-twitter-and-facebook-with-qanon-crackdown/story-fw1O5mw811zXIrrq4QJIGK.html
16-10-2020||World||European Union leaders divided over new climate goals for 2030||European Union leaders agreed Thursday they need to raise their climate ambition above the existing target but stopped short of endorsing a proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels.Leaders discussed the proposal from the bloc’s executive arm on the first day of an EU summit in Brussels, and came to the conclusion that the updated goal should be achieved “collectively” to take into account the different energy mixes of member states.According to the meeting’s conclusions, leaders will try to find a consensus during another meeting to be held in December, ahead of the adoption of the first-ever European climate law.“All Member States will participate in this effort, taking into account national circumstances and considerations of fairness and solidarity,” the conclusions read.The text was sufficiently vague to find a consensus and could open the door to tailor-made arrangements capable of clinching the approval of all 27 member states.While the European Parliament pushes for an even greater 60% reduction in emissions, eastern EU countries that depend on coal for much of their energy needs are less enthusiastic. They worry about the social, environmental and economic costs of the transition to a greener economy. Poland last year did not commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal and has asked for more details about the measures.Speaking upon arrival at the summit, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis pleaded in favor of a collective target, saying that his country could not reach it alone.“I think every country has a different energy mix, and we have to take it into consideration,” he said. “If we agree on 55% average in the EU, the Czech Republic (does not) have any problem.”In proposing a reduction of at least 55%, compared with the current target of a 40% reduction by 2030, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen predicted in September that the new target would be “too much for some and not enough for others.”Also Read: European Commission chief self-isolates as Covid makes its mark at a summitSo far the cuts have been slightly more than 20% over the past 30 years. Reducing emissions by another 20% or even 35% within the next decade poses a big challenge to many countries.Supported by Germany, Von der Leyen’s revised target needs to be endorsed by the 27 member states in order to make it legally binding. On Wednesday, a group of 11 countries including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden embraced her ambition in a joint statement published ahead of the summit in Brussels.Von der Leyen has said she wants 37% of the 750 billion euros in the coronavirus recovery fund to be given to EU countries to spend on environmental objectives, while 30% of the bloc’s regular budget should be used for tackling climate change.World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 F) by the end of the century.Scientists say countries will miss both of those goals by a wide margin unless drastic steps are taken to begin cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are due to submit updated climate targets by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-leaders-divided-over-new-climate-goals-for-2030/story-zc6CUpiRtgtThQ8pMEZLhP.html
16-10-2020||World||European Commission chief self-isolates as Covid makes its mark at a summit||As a fresh wave of the coronavirus sweeps across much of Europe, the reality of the disease struck a summit of European Union leaders on Thursday when one of the 27-nation bloc’s top officials abandoned the meeting to go into self-imposed quarantine.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen left the summit venue in Brussels shortly after the meeting began because one of her close staffers tested positive for Covid-19.“I myself have tested negative,” von der Leyen, a doctor by training, tweeted. “However, as a precaution I am immediately leaving the European Council to go into self-isolation.”In its latest update on Thursday, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that more than 4.4 million cases of the virus have been reported in the 27 EU nations, plus Britain, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland since the pandemic began. More than 198,000 people have died. Several nations are tightening preventive measures.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicImages from inside the venue, which is off limits to reporters, showed von der Leyen mingling with several other heads of government and officials, including the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal and the Netherlands, and the president of the European Parliament.Like the others, she mostly wore a mask except when sitting, and appeared to be observing adequate social distancing. The sprawling summit round table was generously spaced, and a few leaders could be seen washing their hands with gel as they entered. The usual hugs and kisses so common last year were replaced by elbow bumps.French President Emmanuel Macron notably engaged in a close-contact talk with Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who is also representing Poland because its premier, Mateusz Morawiecki is under quarantine after coming into contact with a coronavirus-infected bodyguard. A first test showed Morawiecki was not infected. He was to take another test later Thursday.Tackling the virus — which was due to be debated on Friday — tense post-Brexit trade talks with Britain, climate change and EU-Africa relations were the main items on the agenda.“The debate on Brexit today required a physical presence and a number of leaders were in favor of a physical presence,” European Council President Charles Michel, who is chairing the two-day summit, told reporters. “We have to adapt in the case of Covid-19.”“As far as the future goes, we will systematically assess and take into account the different elements and consult the delegations about what the best way of working is,” Michel said.Since the pandemic first surfaced in Europe in February, EU leaders have held several summits via videoconference. But they held their last meeting in person just two weeks ago. Officials say it’s often the only way to get really sensitive business done. However, not everyone was happy about travelling back to Brussels so soon.“This summit should be held as a video conference. I have on several occasions proposed holding video conferences instead of meeting in person,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters on arrival in Brussels. “There are some discussions where one needs to be brought a little closer to each other. And then there are other meetings where you can do it as a video conference.”Also Read: London and Paris clamp down as Europe hits Covid-19 recordsThe question remains whether this might be the last in-person meeting for a while if the coronavirus continues to spread at rates not seen for months. The next official summit in Brussels is scheduled for Dec. 10-11. On Thursday, the European Parliament said its next plenary session scheduled next week in the French city of Strasbourg would be held remotely.Parliament President David Sassoli said the virus has already infected a number of EU lawmakers, staffers and their associates. “Travelling is very dangerous. The situation in Strasbourg is critical and in Brussels it’s very serious,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-commission-chief-self-isolates-as-covid-makes-its-mark-at-a-summit/story-vErYmUqJf5ZH1UPEEFv3jM.html
16-10-2020||World||Pope taps cardinal from Congo to join group of key advisors||Pope Francis named the archbishop of Kinshasa, Congo, to his core group of cardinal advisers Thursday, giving the African prelate an influential new role in helping shape Vatican policy.Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu joins a geographically diverse group of seven cardinals who are helping Francis run the church and reorganize the Vatican bureaucracy.Besungu, a Cappuchin friar, was named archbishop of one of Africa’s biggest archdioceses in 2018 and was made a cardinal a year later.His predecessor in Kinshasa, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, was also a member of Francis’ cabinet of advisors but stepped down in 2018 when he retired.Francis created the group soon after he was elected in 2013 to give him a core group of advisers from outside the Vatican who could provide perspectives from the church around the world.They meet every three or four months, most recently this week via a conference call due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-taps-cardinal-from-congo-to-join-group-of-key-advisors/story-vqWalCAsXIsJvUas22ZWQK.html
16-10-2020||World||Dueling town halls for Trump, Biden after debate plan nixed||President Donald Trump and challenger Joe Biden will compete for TV audiences in dueling town halls on Thursday night instead of meeting face-to-face for their second debate as originally planned.The two will take questions in different cities on different networks: Trump on NBC from Miami, Biden on ABC from Philadelphia. Trump backed out of plans for the presidential faceoff originally scheduled for the evening after debate organizers said it would be held virtually following Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis.The town halls offer a different format for the two candidates to present themselves to voters, after they held a chaotic and combative first debate late last month. But Trump, speaking on Fox Business on Thursday morning, kept up his same tone, calling Biden “mentally shot,” a “liar” and a “corrupt politician.”He said that “some people said I was rude” in the first debate, “but you have to be rude. The guy’s a liar.”He said NBC asked him to do the town hall.“It’s a different audience and it’s good for me to have a different audience,” he said.As the pace of the campaign speeds up in its final weeks, the two candidates first are taking care of other electoral necessities Thursday: Trump had a midday rally in battleground North Carolina, and Biden was raising campaign cash at a virtual event.During his fundraiser, Biden warned supporters that Trump is “going to throw everything but the kitchen sink at me” and will deliver “an overwhelming torrent of lies.”Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, came under scrutiny this week following a New York Post report outlining an email Hunter allegedly received from a Ukrainian businessman discussing a meeting with the elder Biden. Biden’s campaign has said the meeting never happened, and experts have raised questions about the veracity of the emails.Also Read: Trump slams Facebook, Twitter as ‘third arm’ of the Democratic partyIndeed, with just 19 days until Election Day, there remains ample time for unexpected developments to throw off the candidates’ plans — like they did Thursday, when Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon announced the campaign was canceling running mate Sen. Kamala Harris’ in-person campaign events through Sunday “out of an abundance of caution” after two staffers tied to the campaign tested positive for the coronavirus.The campaign told reporters Thursday morning that Harris’ communications director and a flight crew member tested positive after a campaign trip to Arizona last week, during which Harris and Biden campaigned together throughout the state.Biden and Harris both have tested negative multiple times since then. The campaign said Thursday morning that Biden had again tested negative for the virus and that Harris was never in close contact with the staffers. But in an effort to draw a contrast with Trump, the campaign has emphasized its strict protocols in dealing with the virus and said it’d be moving Harris’ campaign events online whenever possible in the next few days.Meanwhile Trump, after recovering from his own bout with the coronavirus, has been trying to shore up support from constituencies that not so long ago he thought he had in the bag: big business and voters in the red state of Iowa.In a Wednesday morning address to business leaders, he expressed puzzlement that they would even consider supporting Biden, arguing that his own leadership was a better bet for a strong economy. Later, the president held his third campaign rally in three nights, this time in Iowa, a state he won handily in 2016 but where Biden is making a late push.“I know I’m speaking to some Democrats, and some of you are friends of mine,” Trump said in a virtual address to the Economic Clubs of New York, Florida, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Pittsburgh and Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Should Biden be elected, he continued, “you will see things happen that will not make you happy. I don’t understand your thinking.”During his decades in the Senate representing Delaware, a center for the credit card and banking industries, Biden built relationships and a voting record in the business sector that has raised suspicion on the left but provides Wall Street with a measure of ease at the prospect of a Biden administration.After being sidelined by the coronavirus, Trump resumed a breakneck schedule this week, with aides saying he is expected to travel and host campaign rallies every day through Nov. 3. Trump has appeared hale in his public appearances since reemerging from quarantine, though at moments during his economic address on Wednesday his voice was raspy.In Iowa, Trump tossed away his tie and donned a red hat to fight off the stiff breeze on the airport tarmac. He made a direct appeal to the state’s farmers, saying that he was responsible for $28 billion in aid designed to help offset damage stemming from his trade war with China. “I hope you remember that on Nov. 3,” Trump said.But after years of farmers supporting him despite the trade war, some Republicans say Trump’s renewable fuel policy has sown some doubt.Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency granted dozens of waivers to petroleum companies seeking to bypass congressional rules requiring the level of the corn-based fuel additive ethanol that gasoline must contain. He has recently denied more waiver requests, but the EPA’s previous action removed about 4 billion gallons of ethanol demand, resulting in the closure — at least temporarily — of more than a dozen ethanol plants in Iowa.Biden has stepped up campaign travel in the past week, with visits to Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Pennsylvania, where he drove his consistent campaign message that Trump has mishandled the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dueling-town-halls-for-trump-biden-after-debate-plan-nixed/story-HCg8jTc6g8XdRMn5CVFZaL.html
