Satellite pictures of Natanz analysed by experts have yet to show any obvious signs of construction at the site in Iran’s central Isfahan province.Also Read | Iran’s foreign minister urges UN to unite against US unilateral actions“They have started, but it’s not completed,” Grossi said. “It’s a long process.” He would not give further details, saying it’s “confidential information”. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Natanz hosts the country’s main uranium enrichment facility. In its long underground halls, centrifuges rapidly spin uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium.Natanz became a flashpoint for Western fears about Iran’s nuclear programme in 2002, when satellite photos showed Iran building an underground facility at the site, some 200 km (125 miles) south of the capital, Tehran. In 2003, the IAEA visited Natanz, which Iran said would house centrifuges for its nuclear programme, buried under some 7.6 metres (25 feet) of concrete. That offers protection from potential airstrikes on the site, which also is guarded by anti-aircraft positions.Natanz had been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus previously, which was believed to be a creation of the US and Israel. Iran has yet to say who it suspects of carrying out the sabotage in the July incident. Suspicion has fallen on Israel as well, despite a claim of responsibility by a previously unheard-of group at the time.Under the provisions of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran is allowed to produce a certain amount of enriched uranium for non-military purposes.In return, Iran was offered economic incentives by the countries involved.Since President Donald Trump pulled the US unilaterally out of the deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, however, the other signatories — Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China — have been struggling to keep the deal alive.Meanwhile, Iran has been steadily exceeding the deal’s limits on how much uranium it can stockpile, the purity to which it can enrich uranium and other restrictions to pressure those countries to come up with a plan to offset US sanctions.Still though, Iran has continued to allow IAEA inspectors full access to its nuclear facilities, including Natanz, Grossi said.In the latest IAEA quarterly report, the agency reported Iran as of August 25 had stockpiled 2,105.4 kg (4,641.6 pounds) of low-enriched uranium, well above the 202.8 kg (447.1 pounds) allowed under the JCPOA. It was also enriching uranium to a purity of 4.5%, higher than the 3.67% allowed under the deal.In the next report, due in coming weeks, Grossi said: “We continue to see the same trend that we have seen so far.” According to a widely cited analysis by the Washington-based Arms Control Association, Iran would need roughly 1,050 kilograms (1.16 tons) of low-enriched uranium — under 5% purity — in gas form and would then need to enrich it further to weapons-grade, or more than 90% purity, to make a nuclear weapon.The IAEA’s current assessment is, however, that Iran does not at the moment possess a “significant quantity” of uranium — defined by the agency as enough to produce a bomb — according to Grossi.“At the moment, I’m not in contact with my inspectors, but by memory, I wouldn’t say so,” he said.“All of these are projections and the IAEA is not into speculation” he added. “What may happen? What could happen? We are inspectors, we say the amounts that we see.” Iran insists it has no interest in producing a bomb, and Grossi noted that before the JCPOA, Iran had enriched its uranium up to 20% purity, which is just a short technical step away from the weapons-grade level of 90%. And in 2013, Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was already more than 7,000 kg (7.72 tons) with higher enrichment, but it didn’t pursue a bomb.“The idea of a ‘significant quantity’ is a technical parameter...that applies in the context of the safeguards agreement to indicate amounts which could be theoretically used for the development of a nuclear weapon,” he said.“The fact that there could be such an amount would not indicate automatically that a nuclear weapon is being fabricated, so I think we have to be very careful when we use these terms.” Grossi personally visited Tehran in late August for meetings with top officials, and managed to break a months-long impasse over two locations thought to be from the early 2000s where Iran was suspected of having stored or used undeclared nuclear material and possibly conducted nuclear-related activities. Inspectors have now taken samples from both of those sites, and Grossi said they are still undergoing lab analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-building-at-underground-nuclear-facility-says-un-watchdog/story-zOylANsnqmTZzcT2IFwDIK.html
27-10-2020||World||Pfizer says no Covid-19 vaccine data yet, could be week or more before it reports||Drugmaker Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it does not yet have data from the late-stage trial of the Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany’s BioNTech SE, and provided a timeline that makes its release unlikely ahead of the November 3 US presidential election.Pfizer said there had not yet been enough infections in the 44,000-volunteer trial to trigger an analysis of whether or not the vaccine works. An independent panel will conduct the first analysis when it reaches 32 infections.Chief Executive Albert Bourla said after it has enough data for the analysis, it typically takes 5 to 7 days before the company can publicly release the data, meaning it is likely to happen after the election.US President Donald Trump had said a vaccine could be available before the Nov. 3 election, but in recent weeks his administration has emphasized that one will be ready this year.Bourla has previously said the company could release data on whether or not the vaccine works as early as this month. “For us, the election is an artificial milestone,” Bourla said on a conference call for the company’s earnings. “This is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democrat vaccine. It will be a vaccine for the citizens of the world.”Pfizer shares were flat at $37.92.Pfizer hopes to be the first US drugmaker to unveil successful data from a late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trial, ahead of rival Moderna Inc. Pfizer and BioNTech launched their phase 3 study in late July.The data monitoring board is scheduled to make its first assessment of the vaccine’s performance after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus. Healthcare investor Brad Loncar said it was difficult to draw a positive or negative conclusion from the fact that the trial has not yet had its first interim analysis.“I think this means that the overall infection rate is a lot lower than Pfizer initially estimated,” Loncar said. Dr. David Boulware, professor of medicine at University of Minnesota, said the study’s participants may be more adherent to social distancing guidelines than the general population. “Who the vaccine trials really need are the people who don’t wear masks, who are going out to bars, who go to crowded events, who are singing in church choirs - those are the high risk people,” he said.Boulware said that a data monitoring board could still review the data relatively quickly - perhaps in less than a day - once the trial hits its first interim point.As the pandemic crimps demand for certain Pfizer therapies and damages global economies, investors are keenly focused on seeing the late-stage study data of the vaccine candidate being developed with BioNTech. The company also said that if the trial is successful, it still expects to file for emergency authorization of the vaccine candidate from US regulators shortly after it has enough safety data in late November. It expects to have manufacturing data ready to submit to those regulators before then.Pfizer reported quarterly earnings that beat estimates by one cent, helped by lower-than-expected costs. Sales fell 4.3% to $12.13 billion in the third quarter due to a sharp drop in revenue from its off-patent pain drug Lyrica, as well as a $500-million hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. Excluding items, Pfizer earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts estimates of 71 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-no-covid-19-vaccine-data-yet-could-be-week-or-more-before-it-reports/story-VRbdQrTQESqQ2JuSWhgvoN.html
27-10-2020||World||Eli Lilly strikes optimistic tone on Covid-19 therapy after trial failure||Eli Lilly and Co on Tuesday aimed to ease investor concerns about its Covid-19 antibody treatment after a trial of the therapy failed to show a benefit in hospitalized patients.Lilly said it remains optimistic about ongoing trials for the experimental Covid-19 antibody therapy. The drugmaker also said issues raised by US regulators after an inspection of one of its manufacturing facilities do not effect the quality or safety of the treatment. Reuters reported earlier this month that US Food and Drug Administration inspectors found serious quality control problems at the plant preparing to manufacture the antibody therapies.The company said it remains confident in the ability of the single antibody treatment to prevent progression of disease for those earlier in the course of Covid-19.“While the results in hospitalized patients were disappointing, we don’t expect this to affect our chances of success in prophylaxis (prevention) or in early treatment,” Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said on a conference call.Lilly said it intends to request emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for its dual antibody therapy as soon as November. It has already applied for an EUA for the single antibody treatment for use in mild to moderate Covid-19 patients and for its arthritis drug baricitinib.US President Donald Trump has been touting the antibody therapies after receiving a similar treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc during his own recent bout with Covid-19.The Indianapolis-based drugmaker also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit in part due to pricing pressure on some of its major drugs, including diabetes treatment Trulicity, and its shares fell more than 5%.Third-quarter earnings of $1.54 per share missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.71, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv. The company pointed to higher rebates to insurers to ensure Trulicity’s market share and a larger portion of sales coming from the U.S. Medicaid program, which pays less than commercial insurers for the medicine. But Lilly maintained its earnings forecast for the full year.Trulicity sales of $1.11 billion for the quarter was below the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.27 billion, according to brokerage Mizuho. Lilly said it expects 2020 Covid-19 research and development expense to be roughly $400 million. Revenue rose 5% to $5.74 billion in the quarter, below analyst forecasts of $5.88 billion.Lilly said it still anticipates 2020 revenue of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion.It cautioned that achieving the higher end of the range would likely require moderate revenue from potential Covid-19 treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eli-lilly-strikes-optimistic-tone-on-covid-19-therapy-after-trial-failure/story-rekpkrOO3zasP93ucQeTXL.html

27-10-2020||World||‘We’re working on it:’ Pope’s Covid-19 advisers and the mask||Pope Francis’ decision to forgo wearing a mask has been noticed, with some concern, by the commission of Vatican experts he appointed to help chart the Catholic Church’s path through the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath.The Rev. Augusto Zampini, one of the key members of the pope’s Covid-19 commission, acknowledged Tuesday that at age 83 and with part of his lung removed after an illness in his youth, Francis would be at high risk for complications if he were to become infected with Covid-19.“He has started to use the mask now,” Zampini said in response to reporters’ questions. “And I hope he will use it in the general audiences, when he is close to the people. If you’re in an open space, we know that it’s different. But well, we are working on that.”Francis has courted some criticism for declining to wear a mask when indoors, even though Vatican regulations call for masks indoors and out when social distancing cannot be guaranteed. While Francis’ lung condition could help explain his decision to forego the mask, he donned one for more than two hours last week when he presided over an indoor and outdoor interreligious prayer service in downtown Rome.Yet the following day, Francis went maskless during his indoor general audience in the Vatican auditorium, including when he shook hands with a handful of similarly maskless bishops and leaned in to speak privately to each one. On Saturday, he met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who arrived wearing a mask only to take it off for the audience in the pope’s library.Photos of the maskless leaders caused a mild stir in Spain over the weekend, but the prime minister’s office dismissed it by saying the delegation was following Vatican protocol rules. Spain last week became the first country in Western Europe with more than 1 million confirmed virus cases.The Vatican has declined to respond to questions about Francis and masks.Zampini said the recent rise in infections in the tiny city state have commission members and the Vatican as a whole concerned. Thirteen Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Francis lives have recently tested positive.“We are very worried,” Zampini said, noting that the Vatican has strong regulations about keeping social distancing and washing hands within the territory. “We have all protocols in place, but still we have cases.”He acknowledged, though, that the contagion within the Vatican has merely driven home the danger of the virus so that the Vatican itself can be witness to what the rest of the world is experiencing and help be part of the solution.The commission is working to address the current needs of the church around the world with concrete acts of assistance, while also developing policy recommendations for how governments and institutions can re-think global economic, environmental, social, health care and other structures to be more equitable and sustainable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-re-working-on-it-pope-s-covid-19-advisers-and-the-mask/story-lFrcdPU0tHJ4NSTUnLcGvN.html
27-10-2020||World||MIT names campus theatre after alumni Swraj Paul, son||The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has named a theatre in the dome-shaped Kresge auditorium on its campus after industrialist Swraj Paul and his late son, Angad Paul, both of whom gained qualifications there: the former in 1952 and latter in 1992.Paul, 89, who donated $5 million to MIT earlier this year, studied mechanical engineering at MIT and later went on to found the Caparo Group that straddles various sectors, including value-added steel products. Angad Paul, who studied economics at MIT, passed away in 2015 aged 45.In recognition of Paul’s gift, the large hall in the Kresge Auditorium has been named as the Lord Swraj Paul PC ’52 and Angad Paul ’92 Theatre; more generally known as the Swraj Paul Theatre at Kresge Auditorium, Paul’s office said on Tuesday.Designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, the Kresge Auditorium in the central area of the MIT campus is architecturally significant as a leading example of a minimalist thin-shell concrete structure. It was inaugurated in 1955 and has played an important role in the life of the MIT community.Paul, a member of the House of Lords, said, “I first came to MIT from India in 1949 at a time when there were very few Indian students in the United States, and the experience changed my life”.“Because of my time at MIT, I decided to expand my Caparo companies into the US, and for more than 30 years, we have made significant investments across the country in our Bull Moose Tube and XL Trailers businesses”.“I have always had a great respect for MIT as a world centre of technical excellence, and was delighted when my sons followed me there in the 1970s and 80s. MIT means a lot to our family, and I am honoured that we are able to support the continuation of its values and way of life through this iconic building,” he added.The Kresge auditorium also serves as a venue for a variety of community activities including MIT events, symposia, student activities, and performances by the Cambridge Symphony Orchestra and New England Philharmonic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mit-names-campus-theatre-after-alumni-swraj-paul-son/story-eq6JqLjJns62EaQDeyfzRM.html
27-10-2020||World||Trump, Biden blitz Pennsylvania, the state that ‘decides’ US presidents||President Donald Trump addressed three rallies in Pennsylvania on Monday and his Democratic rival Joe Biden chose the state for his solitary campaign event of the day.In America’s unique presidential election system based on electoral college numbers, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as the state calls itself officially, has emerged as the “tipping-point” state for the 2020 White House race: whoever wins Pennsylvania wins the presidency.“We get Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” Trump said to cheering supporters in Allentown, at the first of the day’s three rallies, on a cold and rainy morning. Framing the election as a choice between his “super-recovery” and Biden’s “depression”, Trump went on to say he was confident he will be re-elected “almost easily”.An hour’s drive south in Chester, Biden told reporters later in the afternoon at an election centre that he hoped to carry Pennsylvania “by the grace of god”.Here is how FiveThirtyEight, one of the most trusted poll-forecasters, saw Pennsylvania’s centrality to the 2020 race way back in September, which has now been affirmed and reaffirmed by others: “Pennsylvania is so important that our model gives Trump an 84% chance of winning the presidency if he carries the state — and it gives Biden a 96% chance of winning if Pennsylvania goes blue.”Biden is leading Trump by 5.1 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls in Pennsylvania now, and by 4.8 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls.With just eight days to the close of polling on November 3, FiveThirtyEight has Biden in the lead by 9.4 percentage points (52.3% to Trump’s 42.9%) nationally; and RealClearPolitics has the former vice-president also in the lead but at 7.8 percentage points (50.8%-43%). More than 63 million Americans have already cast their votes through early in-person and mail balloting.“It’s good, it’s good to be part of the big, big pitch,” said Louise Pyle, a Trump supporter at the president’s Allentown rally, when asked how it felt to be in the state that everyone says will decide the 2020 race. “Yeah, I think, Pennsylvania’s going to come right up to the end to be the one that makes the final decision.” Does she feel weighed down by the responsibility? She shook her head.Ian Chapman, another Pennsylvanian, is not very impressed by this talk of the state being a tipping point. “I don’t think so,” he said, dismissively, “Every election that’s the political verbiage — toss-up states, tipping point, every election is the election of the century. I don’t buy into it. Issues are important and that’s what matters.” He is an independent who voted for Trump in 2016 and will vote for him again based “on my gut”.Trump beat Hillary Clinton narrowly in 2016 to pick up all 20 electoral college votes of Pennsylvania in the winner-takes-all system. Together with even narrower victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, also battleground states, Pennsylvania put Trump in the White House in an upset victory.Over the remaining days to the end of polling, the two candidates and their surrogates will be in jetting in and out and across battleground states that will decide the electoral college math such as Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan essentially, and Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and others.Biden, who says he is too superstitious to pre-judge the race, is seeking to expand the battle ground with two rallies at this late stage in the race in solidly Republican Georgia on Tuesday. This state has not voted Democratic in a presidential election since 1992, President Bill Clinton’s first term win.“I’m going to Iowa, I’m going to Wisconsin, I’m going to Georgia, I am going to Florida and may be other places as well,” said Biden in Chester, previewing a packed schedule for the next few days. Pennsylvania? Biden was born there — Scranton city — and has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia, the capital.And Trump is sending his wife Melania Trump to Chester, where Biden was on Monday, later in the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-blitz-pennsylvania-the-state-that-decides-us-presidents/story-YXa9yXoie6hIMEGt5vlZiO.html
27-10-2020||World||Covid-19 antibody response wanes over time: UK study||The antibody response to Covid-19 virus wanes over time, said a new analysis released on Tuesday based on finger-prick tests on more than 365,000 randomly selected people in England. The tests carried out at home between June 20 and September 28 found that the number of people testing positive dropped by 26.5% across the study period, said the researchers led by Imperial College London.The downward trend was observed in all areas and age groups, but not in health workers, which could indicate repeated or higher initial exposure to the virus, the authors suggested.The decline was largest in people aged 75 and above compared to younger people, and also in people with suspected rather than confirmed infection, indicating that the antibody response varies by age and with the severity of illness, the college said.Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial College, said: “Our study shows that over time there is a reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies. Testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to Covid-19.” “It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab test if they have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required,” he added.The study used finger-prick testing to detect coronavirus antibodies in the blood. When present, they indicate that a person has been previously infected with the virus. The testing kits, called Lateral Flow Tests, detect antibodies above a particular concentration in the blood, and do not measure the amount of antibodies in a particular person.The conclusions include findings from three rounds of testing carried out over a three-month period. There were 17,576 positive results across all three rounds, around 30% of whom did not report any symptoms.After accounting for the accuracy of the test, confirmed by laboratory evaluation, and England’s population characteristics, the study found that antibody prevalence declined from 6.0% to 4.8% and then 4.4% over the three months.This was found across all ages but the smallest drop was found in the youngest age group, aged 18-24, falling from 7.9% to 6.7% (14.9%), while the largest was found in the oldest group, aged 75 and above, declining from 3.3% to 2.0% (39%).Helen Ward, one of the lead authors of the research report, said: “This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time. We don’t yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes Covid-19, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-antibody-response-wanes-over-time-uk-study/story-GGO7leQKyDsZScZRyuMDyM.html
27-10-2020||World||Thousands in Bangladesh protest against French president’s comments||Around 10,000 people in Bangladesh rallied in the South Asian nation’s capital on Tuesday to protest France’s president and his staunch support of secular laws that deem caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad as protected under freedom of speech.Protesters from the conservative Islami Andolon Bangladesh group, which supports the introduction of Islamic law in the Muslim-majority country, carried banners and placards reading: “All Muslims of the world, unite” and “Boycott France.” It was the largest protest yet against the cartoons in recent days.Some carried portraits of French President Emmanuel Macron with an “X” on his face. One protester carried a cutout image of the French president with shoes around his neck as a sign of insult.The issue has once again come to light in recent days following a gruesome beheading near Paris of a French teacher who showed caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class. The 18-year-old Chechen refugee who carried out the attack was later shot dead by police.The teacher, Samuel Paty, has been heralded as a symbol of France’s staunch secular ideals and its rejection of religious intrusion in public spheres. Macron and members of his government have vowed to continue supporting such caricatures as protected under freedom of expression.Muslim politicians, religious scholars and everyday people have condemned such depictions as a form of hate speech and view them as sacrilegious and insulting to Islam. Muslims have been calling for both protests and a boycott of French goods in response to France’s stance on caricatures of Islam’s most revered prophet.Five years ago, French-born al-Qaida extremists killed 12 employees of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in response to its publication of caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Those cartoons also sparked mass protests in Muslim-majority countries, with some turning deadly.Elsewhere, Iran summoned a French diplomat to protest France’s stance on the caricatures. A report by state TV on Tuesday said an Iranian official in the country’s Foreign Ministry told the French diplomat that Paris’ response in the aftermath of Paty’s killing was “unwise” and that France was permitting hatred against Islam under the guise of support for freedom of expression.A powerful association of clerics in the Iranian city of Qom also urged the government to condemn Macron. Iranian hard-line newspaper Vatan-e Emrooz depicted Macron as the devil and called him Satan in a cartoon on its front page Tuesday.Pakistan’s parliament passed a resolution condemning the publication of cartoons of the prophet.In Saudi Arabia, the country’s state-run Saudi Press Agency on Tuesday put out a statement from the Foreign Ministry saying the kingdom “rejects any attempt to link Islam and terrorism, and denounces the offensive cartoons of the prophet.” Saudi clerics have too condemned the caricatures, but have also cited the prophet’s “mercy, justice, tolerance”. Another prominent sheikh called on Muslims not to overreact.The Arab Gulf state of Qatar also condemned what it described as “the dramatic escalation of populist rhetoric” inciting religious abuse. In a statement, the government said inflammatory speech is fueling calls for the repeated targeting of nearly 2 billion Muslims around the world through the deliberate offending of the Prophet Muhammad and has led to an increase in hostility toward Muslims.Bangladeshi protesters gathered in front of the main Baitul Mokarram Mosque in downtown Dhaka Tuesday morning. The group walked toward the French Embassy, but police intercepted the march, which ended without violence.Protests have also been held recently in Iraq, Turkey the Gaza Strip and in opposition areas of northwestern Syria controlled by Turkey-backed rebels.Rezaul Karim, the head of the Islami Andolon group in Bangladesh, called on France to refrain from displaying caricatures of the prophet.“We, the Muslims, never did caricatures of other religious leaders,” he said.“Allah sent the Prophet Muhammad as an ambassador of peace ... Macron and his associates did not learn anything from history,” he added, before calling on Muslims to boycott French goods.Karim also said Macron should be treated for his “mental illness,” remarks similar to those made days earlier by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who’s been the most vociferous in his criticism among political leaders in saying Macron needed his head examined and had lost his way. France has since recalled its ambassador to Turkey and other European nations have defended Macron.Bangladesh’s leadership, however, has not come out in criticism of France, as Turkey, Pakistan and other Muslim-majority nations have done. Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million mostly Muslim people, is governed by a secular constitution.In the Middle East, Kuwaiti stores have pulled French yogurts, cheese and bottles of sparkling water from their shelves, Qatar University canceled a French culture week, and calls to stay away from the French-owned Carrefour grocery store chain were trending on social media in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-bangladesh-protest-against-french-president-s-comments/story-0jh9eCwHFkEVo73X9ZpWXN.html
27-10-2020||World||Philadelphia police shooting of Black man sparks unrest||Police shot and killed a 27-year-old Black man on a Philadelphia street after yelling at him to drop his knife, sparking violent protests that police said injured 30 officers and led to dozens of arrests.The shooting occurred before 4 p.m. Monday as officers responded to a report of a person with a weapon, police spokesperson Tanya Little said.Officers were called to the Cobbs Creek neighborhood and encountered the man, later identified as Walter Wallace, who was holding a knife, Little said. Officers ordered Wallace to drop the knife, but he instead “advanced towards” them. Both officers then fired “several times,” Little said.Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest. One of the officers then put him in a police vehicle and drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, Little said.Hundreds of people took to the streets to protest the shooting late Monday into early Tuesday, with interactions between protesters and police turning violent at times, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Video showed many yelling at officers and crying.Police cars and dumpsters were set on fire as police struggled to contain the crowds. More than a dozen officers, many with batons in hand, formed a line as they ran down 52nd Street chasing protesters away from the main thoroughfare. The crowd largely dispersed then.Thirty officers were injured, most of them from being struck by projectiles such as bricks and rocks, according to preliminary information from police. One officer was hospitalized in stable condition with a broken leg and other injuries after she was struck by a pickup truck, police said, while the other injured officers were treated and released.Video of the fatal confrontation recorded by a bystander and posted on social media shows officers pointing their guns at Wallace as he walks in the street and around a car. He walks toward the officers as they back away from him in the street, guns still aimed at him. They yell at him to put his knife down.Both then fire several shots and Wallace collapses in the street. A woman runs up to him screaming. Several bystanders then approach him.It is unclear in the video if he had a knife. Witnesses said he was holding one.No officers or bystanders were injured in the confrontation, Little said. The names of the officers who fired the shots were not immediately disclosed. Both were wearing body cameras and were taken of street duty pending the investigation.Some people spoke with city Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, who arrived at the scene a short time after the shooting occurred.“I heard and felt the anger of the community,” Outlaw said in a statement, adding that the video “raises many questions” and that “those questions will be fully addressed by the investigation.”Wallace’s father, Walter Wallace Sr., told the Inquirer that his son was also a father, was on medication and struggled with mental health issues.“Why didn’t they use a taser?” he asked.The races of the police officers weren’t immediately confirmed. The shooting occurred in a predominantly Black neighborhood in west Philadelphia. The Inquirer reported that dozens of protesters gathered at a nearby park and chanted “Black lives matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philadelphia-police-shooting-of-black-man-sparks-unrest/story-zAB0IYWjjtQ70cARkWpuqI.html
27-10-2020||World||Indian-origin man convicted of murder in UK spitting row||Gurjeet Singh Lall, who stabbed to death a man during a row over Lall’s spitting on the street in Southall, was convicted of manslaughter on Monday and is due to be sentenced on December 14.Lall, 36, stabbed 69-year-old ex-rugby player and builder Allan Isichei several times after a brief verbal row over Lall’s spitting on the street on August 24 last year.Recalling the incident, Scotland Yard said that Isichei went to a pub before 6 pm on the day, and left around 6.30 pm. Moments later he encountered Lall as he walked towards his home on St Mary’s Avenue South.Lall was leaning against a wall and the two had a brief verbal disagreement over Lall’s spitting in the street. Words were exchanged and as Isichei walked away, Lall spat on the ground again, at which point Isichei turned. More words were exchanged.Lall produced a knife and used it to stab Isichei in a struggle in which the latter managed to disarm him. Apparently not realising how badly he was injured, Isichei got up and walked down the street before stopping. He then staggered to a neighbour’s address and rang the doorbell, pleading for help.Police and paramedics treated him at the scene before being placed in an ambulance that was forced to stop shortly after it left as his condition deteriorated; he was pronounced dead around 8pm.The police traced Lall to his home address after following a blood trail from injuries he sustained in the incident. A post-mortem found that Isichei had suffered multiple knife injuries. A cause of death was given as an incised wound to the abdomen.During police interview, Lall claimed in a prepared statement that he had been acting in self-defence. Following a review of Lall’s mental health, he was deemed fit to stand trial and he was subsequently convicted of manslaughter by the Inner London Crown Court.Detective inspector Jamie Stevenson said: “It beggars belief that a man could go to his local pub for a quick drink on a Saturday evening and not return home, but that is the terrible reality that Allan’s family have been left with.”“Allan was a creative and constructive man, living a full and active life through his sport and music. His loss is immeasurable, and is of course most felt by his loving family, who still grieve for him and will do so for a very long time to come”.“There was no good reason for Lall to have had a knife in his possession that day, and no good reason for him to use it. I am glad that he has been convicted and the jury rejected his claim that he was acting in self-defence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-man-convicted-of-murder-in-uk-spitting-row/story-QHgpVDK4FgMjr4y0C51r5H.html

The US will stand with India as they confront threats to their sovereignty, liberty,” Pompeo said in a joint statement after the 2+2 India-US Ministerial Dialogue.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry was specifically asked to comment on Pompeo’s visit, given that he had said earlier that it will focus on threats posed by China.In his response, ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin did not specifically mention India, but attacked Pompeo’s anti-China statements.“Pompeo’s attacks and accusations against China are nothing new,” Wang said.“These are groundless accusations which reflect that he is clinging to the Cold War mentality and ideological biases. We urge him to abandon the Cold War and the zero-sum game mentality and stop sowing discord between China and regional countries as well as undermining the regional peace and stability.”Wang’s remarks were made in the backdrop of India and the US signing the landmark Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) that will allow sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information between the two countries.Pompeo further said in New Delhi on Tuesday: “The US and India are taking steps to strengthen our cooperation against all manner of threats and not just those posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Last year, we expanded our cooperation on cyber issues, our navies have held joint exercises in the Indian Ocean.”China will be closely monitoring the Malabar naval exercise among the navies of the US, Japan, India and Australia in November – the thinking in Beijing is that an anti-China Indo-Pacific maritime security structure is gradually taking shape.In July, Pompeo had criticised China for its aggressive moves against its neighbours, including “instigating” a deadly confrontation with India in eastern Ladakh.“The recent clashes initiated by the PLA are just the latest examples of the Chinese Communist Party’s unacceptable behaviour. It is important that democracies like ours work together, especially as we see more clearer than ever the true scope of the challenge posed by the Chinese Communist Party,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-sowing-discord-between-china-regional-countries-beijing-on-pompeo-s-india-trip/story-GsHmBsd4s16VCO0rbrSr2O.html
27-10-2020||World||Long-term immunity in doubt as UK study finds Covid-19 antibodies fall rapidly||The hope for long-term immunity from Covid-19 was thrown into doubt on Tuesday as a large UK study concluded that protective antibodies in people fall “quite rapidly” after a coronavirus infection.Imperial College London’s research, which tested more than 365,000 people in England, found that antibody response to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 wanes over time, which indicates that any level of immunity could last only a few months.“Seasonal coronaviruses that circulate every winter and cause common colds can re-infect people after six to 12 months,” said professor Wendy Barclay, a virologist who was one of the researchers on the study.“We suspect that the way the body reacts to infection with this new coronavirus is similar to that,” she said.Antibodies are a key part of the body’s immune defences and stop viruses from getting inside the body’s cells. The Imperial College London team found the number of people testing positive with a finger-prick test for antibodies has fallen by 26 per cent between June and September.“Our study shows that over time there is a reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies,” said professor Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial College London.“Testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to Covid-19. It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab test if they have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required,” he said.The downward trend was observed in all areas of England and age groups, but not in health workers, which could indicate repeated or higher initial exposure to the virus, the authors suggest.“This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time. We don’t yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes Covdi-19, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others,” said professor Helen Ward, one of the lead authors.The decline was largest in people aged 75 and above compared to younger people, and also in people with suspected rather than confirmed infection, indicating that the antibody response varies by age and with the severity of illness.The decline was largest in people who didn’t report a history of Covid-19, dropping by almost two-thirds (64 per cent) between rounds one and three, compared to a decrease of 22.3 per cent in people who had an infection confirmed by lab testing.UK Health Minister Lord Bethell said the research would help inform the government’s continued response to the disease.“It is also important that everyone knows what this means for them – this study will help in our fight against the virus, but testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to Covid-19,” said Lord James Bethell.“Regardless of the result of an antibody test, everyone must continue to comply with government guidelines including social distancing, self-isolating and getting a test if you have symptoms and always remember Hands, Face, Space,” he said.People in London had the highest proportion of positive tests across the country, at around twice the national average. Health and care workers, ethnic minority groups, and those living in deprived areas and large households also had the greatest burden of past infection.The latest findings, part of the government-backed Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) studies, suggest a decline in the level of immunity in the population in the months following the first wave of the pandemic, leading to the second wave currently underway across the UK.However, experts believe more work is still needed before any conclusive evidence on long-term immunity and also how the novel coronavirus would react to a viable vaccine that clears clinical trials to be rolled out against Covid-19. Some high-risk sections of the population may require additional follow-up booster doses to boost levels of immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-term-immunity-in-doubt-as-uk-study-finds-covid-19-antibodies-fall-rapidly/story-KK7nApDI74BKMK6RdgQAEI.html
27-10-2020||World||Hindu-American women root for Republicans, Trump||Donald Trump’s market-friendly policies, tough stance against China and acknowledgement of the contributions of the Hindu community in the US have struck a chord with a group of Hindu-American women who are rooting for the Republicans to ensure that he wins the November 3 presidential election.Participating in an online session, a panel of Hindu-American women, from different walks of life, expressed their strong views in favour of President Trump.Karishma Himatsinghani, a media entrepreneur from Dallas, said that she is neither a Leftist, nor a Rightist, but a moderate centrist who finds Trump treading a centrist path in programmes and policies.It is the Leftist media that has affixed an image of Right-wing on Trump as a matter of political expediency. Trump’s focus is on keeping the economy going during the uncertain Covid-19 crisis. The president’s commitment is reflected in tax-cuts for businesses and removal of regressive government regulations that impeded economic activity, she said.“Look at the way the Democrats have responded to the recent riots in Oakland, Seattle and elsewhere, where they are seen as endorsing the rioters, which should ring alarm bells for all voters. How are we supposed to survive with lawlessness on the streets, where law enforcement agencies are undermined and attacked by a certain political class?” she asked.The Democrats were brainwashing the youth in subscribing to anarchy and violence as a solution to the social justice issues, Himatsinghani claimed, asserting that it will further exacerbate the depravity of the affected, instead of providing relief and resolution.“Trump is the only President in US history to have openly acknowledged the Hindu community and appreciate their contributions at the ‘Howdy Modi’ event. Democrats have always vilified the Hindu community and religion with pejorative terms, and have even excluded them this time from the election manifesto completely,” she claimed.Srilekha Palle, a healthcare administrator, took a dig at the Democratic Party’s ideology.“Do you want education for your children dictated by the big government, or by you as a parent; do you want healthcare to be decided by doctors and healthcare professionals and costs driven by the market, or to be decided by the unaccountable big government; if you want your lives to be governed by government bureaucrats vote for Democrats, but if you want to live in a free society, vote for Republicans,” she asked the panelists.Palle said President Trump had strengthened Indo-US relations where he has taken unprecedented steps to recognise India’s concerns on terrorism and the threat posed by China.By renaming the whole region as Indo-Pacific, the US President has finally recognised India’s stabilising role in global affairs, she said.In recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Trump administration in 2018 renamed the US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command. The move is reflective of the growing importance of the Indian Ocean in US strategic thinking.Vandana Mangalick, a lifelong Democrat from Minneapolis who voted five times for that party, highlighted the Democrats stance on Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).“The Democrats are supposed to stand for human rights for the persecuted. But why have six Democrat-controlled city councils, passed anti-India resolutions, opposed CAA? What business do city councils have meddling in a sovereign country’s affairs?” she asked.Raman Bhaumik, an entrepreneur in Dallas said, “The Republicans have always supported small businesses and reduced government regulations to manageable levels. Their policies reflect in the way businesses have gotten quick loan approvals even during challenging Covid-19 times. We would not have survived Covid-19 without the support of Republicans”.“I am a product of a stereotypical Bengali intellectual family environment, where social welfare, social reform, and liberal thought is worshipped, but what is going on in the US today is that a noble purpose of social justice, has been hijacked to serve a partisan political purpose, and extremists are masquerading behind social justice to spread mayhem in the society,” said Dr Paramita Sarkar, a scientist.Radhika Garimella, another recent Democrat, said there was a vast gap between what the Democrats promise and what they actually deliver.Democrats have been a big failure in checking the growth of extremism in their party, reflecting how governments are run under their administration. The Democrats have decided to harbour and nurture socialists like Bernie Sanders, she claimed, adding that there is no choice but to leave the party and join the Republicans to ensure a massive victory for Trump.Sangeeta Dua, Chairperson Indo- American Republicans of Greater Houston, moved a resolution in favour of the Republicans and President Trump on account of strong defence, law and order on the streets, free-market based healthcare, jobs for Americans, rebuilding American Industry, and a strong presence of America in global affairs to maintain peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-american-women-root-for-republicans-trump/story-wxbSiwvo4snAscdurK3eEN.html

He said both the Muslim countries had vast potential for investment and economic activities, which would bring regional prosperity and development.Both Afghanistan and Pakistan could benefit from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and become hubs of trade and business, he remarked.Khan made it clear that the Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process was the chief concern of his government and no other country in the world could take credit equal to Pakistan in its efforts to maintain peace in Afghanistan.Speaker of Afghan Wolesi Jirga Mir Rahman Rahmani said Afghanistan valued Pakistan’s contributions to the Afghan peace process.He said the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan was deep-rooted in common culture, faith, and values. He also stressed the need for enhancing parliamentary contacts between the two countries.While appreciating the steps taken by Pakistan to facilitate Afghan transit trade, which had reduced the time of shipment clearance on the border, Rahmani said opening new border points for trade would facilitate the trade further.Pakistan’s Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaisar said that 2,640 kilometres Pak-Afghan border was not only the longest border that Pakistan shared with any of its neighbours, but it was also the thread that weaves the two nations into a historic tapestry of “social, cultural, linguistic, economic, religious and fraternal ties”.He proposed the formation of a task force to oversee the terms of negotiation of Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), which was going to expire next year and needed input from parliamentarians and institutional stakeholders from both sides of borders for a comprehensive future trade agreement.The two-day seminar was organised by National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser at a time when trade and political relations between the neighbouring countries have improved lately. Wolesi Jirga (Afghan Parliament) Speaker Mir Rahman Rahmani, heading an Afghan delegation, arrived here on Qaiser’s invitation to attend the seminar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-strengthen-ties-with-afghanistan-pm-imran/story-Ad101VeknrTtmUyaAjYIfK.html
27-10-2020||World||Barrett swearing-in differs markedly from ‘superspreader’||It’s been only a month since President Donald Trump’s Rose Garden event to announce he was nominating Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the Supreme Court. That packed celebration for friends and allies of the president and his high court nominee turned into a coronavirus superspreader event.When the just-confirmed Barrett returned to the White House on Monday to take her constitutional oath, the celebration was moved to the broader South Lawn, chairs for more than 200 guests were spread about six feet apart, and the mask-wearers greatly outnumbered those who declined to cover their faces.Some participants — including Trump and Barrett — were unmasked.But the event had a markedly different feel than the September 26 Rose Garden gathering. More than two dozen attendees — including Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Thom Tillis — tested positive after attending the earlier White House celebration.Back then, the attendees showed a measure of ease — exchanging handshakes and hugs and standing close together as they conversed — that belied the reality that the nation was in the midst of a pandemic. The crowd was then ushered indoors for a reception.Hours before Monday’s ceremony, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser questioned the wisdom of holding another large gathering at a moment when coronavirus cases were spiking in the U.S. She accused the president of flouting “scientific evidence and common sense.” “I know that there were a number of people who attended that Rose Garden event who became sick, who are quite embarrassed by their participation, who had to go back to their constituencies and communities and explain their behavior,” Bowser said. “And so we don’t want any folks, our residents, certainly from D.C. or in our surrounding region, to be in that situation.” After Barrett was administered the oath by Justice Clarence Thomas and delivered brief remarks, the assembled crowd stood to cheer and take photos from afar as the new justice posed with Trump, their spouses and Thomas.Many guests stood for a few minutes in small groups, chatting with their masks secure before heading for the exits minutes after the guest of honor departed.Some Republican senators invited to attend to the event decided it was better to watch from afar.Indiana Sen. Todd Young told reporters that he had told the White House he would attend, but was reconsidering. Asked why, he said “no reason” and that it “had to do with a lot of factors.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had been expected at the event, but the South Carolina lawmaker — locked in a tough re-election fight — instead made an appearance on Fox News.Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was “staying away” because she was headed to Alaska and cases have been increasing there. She said people need to be careful about gatherings as illnesses have been rising, but stopped short of calling the White House event a mistake.“It just seems like it’s just been a slow tsunami,” Murkowski said. “And I think that we all need to be very cautious and very careful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barrett-swearing-in-differs-markedly-from-superspreader/story-4v6Nt3vgoBZLNbXDNid35I.html
27-10-2020||World||Taiwan says new arms purchases to boost credible defense||Taiwan said Tuesday that the recent proposal of U.S. sale of missiles and other arms systems will boost the island’s ability to credibly defend itself, amid rising threats from China.The comments from defense ministry spokesperson Shih Shun-wen came a day after China said it would exact unspecified retaliation against companies that make the weapons systems, including Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Boeing Co.’s defense division, the lead contractor on a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan.Facing a potential Chinese foe with overwhelming superiority in missiles, soldiers, ships and planes, Taiwan has struggled to assure its own people and key ally the U.S. that it is capable of and willing to see to its own defense. The sides split amid a civil war in 1949 and China considers Taiwan its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.“The purchase of these weapons will enhance Taiwan’s credible combat capabilities and asymmetric combat capabilities,” Shih told reporters at a briefing, using a term for countering a much stronger foe with precision weapons and advanced tactics. “This will also enhance our overall combat capabilities to contribute to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”The Trump administration on Monday notified Congress of plans for the Harpoon system, whose missiles are capable of striking ships and land targets. Boeing says the missile uses GPS-aided inertial navigation and delivers a 500-pound blast warhead. It can target coastal defense sites, surface-to-air missile sites, exposed aircraft, ships in port, and port and industrial facilities.That followed another proposed sale announced Oct. 21 to provide $1.8 billion worth of weaponry, including missile and rocket systems, and upgraded equipment for Taiwan’s F-16 jet fighters.Taiwan has long been an irritant in U.S.-China relations. Washington has no formal relations with the island’s democratically elected government but is its main ally. U.S. law requires the government to ensure Taiwan can defend itself. In recent years, weapons sales to the island have increased in quantity and quality, as China builds the world’s second most powerful military dedicated largely to defeating Taiwan and achieving its goal of annexation.Stepped-up patrols by Chinese warplanes this year have put Taiwan’s forces under increasingly strain, increasing the importance of developing new weapons systems or buying them from abroad.Beijing regularly pressures American companies including Boeing in an effort to influence U.S. policy. China is one of Boeing’s biggest markets for commercial aircraft, which might make it vulnerable to a boycott, but China’s defense ministry mentioned only Boeing’s military arm, Boeing Defense, not its civilian jetliner business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-new-arms-purchases-to-boost-credible-defense/story-QdP7v7lfyCSODokwXxbiDO.html

We have a lot to discuss today: Our cooperation on the pandemic that originated in Wuhan, to confronting the Chinese Communist Party’s threats to security and freedom to promoting peace and stability throughout the region.”US President Donald Trump has made being tough on China a key part of his campaign to secure a second term in next week’s presidential election and Pompeo has been trying to bolster allies to counter China’s growing influence in the region.India has its own problems with a more assertive China.In June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops on their high-altitude border, hardening the mood in India against China and driving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to seek closer military ties with the United States.This month, India invited Australia to join naval drills it holds each year with the United States and Japan, brushing off Chinese concerns that the exercises destabilise the region.“Our focus now must be on institutionalising and regularising our cooperation to meet the challenges of the day and uphold the principles of a free and open Indo-Pacific well into the future,” Esper said.The two sides will later on Tuesday sign a military agreement that will give India access to advanced U.S. satellite and map data for better accuracy of its missiles and drones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-says-us-india-must-focus-on-threat-posed-by-china/story-oHEm5u90F4Kfeag8QM2QUI.html

Huawei’s browser unit said in a statement on Tuesday it would conduct a comprehensive self-examination and clean-up in line with the regulator’s requests, and would also place strict controls over ‘self media’ accounts. Xiaomi and UCWeb declined to comment, while Tencent, Oppo, Sogou and 360 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Legislation introduced in recent years by China include measures to restrict media outlets, surveillance measures for media sites and rolling campaigns to remove content deemed unacceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-regulate-chaos-of-information-available-in-mobile-browsers/story-pLLzvw1tvB9YopkSPlYO7M.html
27-10-2020||World||Dalai Lama hails UN treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons||Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Monday welcomed the ratification of the United Nations’ Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, saying that the ‘historic’ treaty would contribute to even more concerted efforts to do away with dreadful weapons and secure genuine and lasting peace in the world. In a statement, Dalai Lama deemed the treaty ratification as the first positive step towards a more peaceful future by calling it a “historic” step in the right direction to find more enlightened and civilised arrangements for resolving conflicts.Fifty countries have ratified an international treaty to ban nuclear weapons, the United Nations (UN) has announced, allowing the “historic” text to enter into force in 90 days.Honduras became the 50th country to ratify the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), the UN said on Saturday, in a move hailed by anti-nuclear activists but strongly opposed by the United States and the other major nuclear powers.“I welcome the fact that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has now been ratified by fifty countries and will come into force from January next year. This is indeed historic and augurs well for the future of humanity. It is a step in the right direction to finding more enlightened and civilised arrangements for resolving conflicts,” Dalai Lama said.“I have no doubt that this treaty’s coming into force will contribute to even more concerted efforts to do away with these dreadful weapons and secure genuine and lasting peace in our world. The world has now taken the first positive step towards a more peaceful future, but our ultimate goal should be the demilitarisation of the entire planet,” he added. The spiritual leader said that the nuclear-free world is in everyone’s interest.“The reality today is we need to rely on mutual understanding and dialogue to resolve conflicts. Therefore, I take the opportunity to urge all governments to work to implement this treaty, so that the world becomes a safer place for us all,” he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commended the 50 states and saluted “the instrumental work” of civil society in facilitating negotiations and pushing for ratification, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric had said on Saturday.The UN chief said the treaty’s entry into force on January 22, 2021, crowns a worldwide movement “to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons” and “is a tribute to the survivors of nuclear explosions and tests, many of whom advocated for this treaty”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-hails-un-treaty-to-prohibit-nuclear-weapons/story-pBMOdtFLG6S8HTeW4t1GbL.html

Western governments and international human rights groups have expressed concern the law will crush freedoms in Hong Kong. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have said the law is necessary to bring stability to the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-chief-executive-carrie-lam-to-visit-beijing-to-discuss-plans-to-revive-economy/story-YTuUALMCjPOlS8BYYQtqTO.html

Since these patients are at an early stage of infection, they exhibit no symptoms,” Wang Xijiang, deputy director of Kashgar’s disease control and prevention centre was quoted by state-controlled China Daily newspaper as saying.China does not count asymptomatic cases as confirmed cases of Covid-19. Even though the infected – who do not show symptoms – can spread the disease, asymptomatic patients are counted separately.Local authorities, meanwhile, have imposed travel restrictions including the cancellation of some flights.Schools have been ordered shut to avoid cross-infection and residents have been asked to stay in their neighbourhoods to allow medical staff to carry out nucleic acid tests.In July, the Chinese government had declared a “wartime state” in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, after a spike in locally transmitted cases of coronavirus.Separately, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Tuesday that 50 new asymptomatic cases, including 24 arriving from outside the mainland, were reported for Monday. The commission said in its daily report that 16 confirmed cases arriving from outside the mainland were also reported on the same day.Of the new imported cases, three each were reported in Shanghai and Shaanxi, two each in Hebei and Sichuan, and one each in Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Fujian, Shandong and Guangdong, official news agency Xinhua quoted the NHC as saying.“As of Monday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 85,826.

Earlier on Monday, Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues: “Ten days after Secretary Mnuchin went on CNBC to declare that he was accepting our testing plan, the administration still refuses to do so.” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House that talks have slowed but were continuing on Monday. “There are still a number of areas in her plan that the president cannot accept, just can’t accept it,” Kudlow said of Pelosi. “I will also say, there are a number of targeted areas that we really think would help the economy.” Pelosi and President Donald Trump have been trading accusations for days about who needed to act in order to cement another round of Covid-19 aid before Election Day, with Trump’s fellow Senate Republicans off to the sidelines.Sticking points remain around aid for state and local governments grappling with the devastating economic fallout of the pandemic and provisions around immigration and healthcare, Kudlow said.Kudlow would not speculate on chances for a deal before the election. “I am not here to be either optimistic or pessimistic,” he said.

27-10-2020||World||Twitter flags Donald Trump’s tweet on mail-in ballots over ‘disputed’ content||Social media company Twitter Inc on Monday flagged a tweet by US President Donald Trump about mail-in ballots, adding a disclaimer describing the post’s content as “disputed” and potentially misleading.“Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd”, Trump tweeted late on Monday, with the tweet giving no evidence for his assertion.“Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about how to participate in an election or another civic process”, Twitter’s disclaimer said. The disclaimer included a link to a page highlighting how mail voting was legal and safe.Many states have expanded early voting and the use of mail-in ballots ahead of the Nov. 3 election, as some Americans try to avoid crowded polls during the coronavirus pandemic.Trump has repeatedly attacked mail-in voting, claiming without evidence that it will lead to widespread fraud. Democrats have argued it is a safe and reliable alternative to in-person voting. Twitter has also previously flagged posts from Trump, including a tweet earlier this month in which Trump claimed he was immune to the coronavirus, with the social media company saying the tweet had made “misleading health claims”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-flags-donald-trump-s-tweet-on-mail-in-ballots-over-disputed-content/story-Mr7lVhG1qELT8qUyb5xieO.html

27-10-2020||World||Not doing many rallies to prevent spread of Covid-19, says Joe Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has justified his decision not to hold public rallies and restrict his travel, arguing that he does not want to be a Covid-19 super spreader.The US had more than 481,372 new cases of Covid-19 last week, setting a record for the most new infections reported in a week since the pandemic began. Nearly half the country set records for new Covid-19 cases in a week while five states had a record number of deaths in a week: Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The US reports a new Covid-19 case every 1.26 seconds, according to a USA Today analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Worldwide, there have been more than 43 million coronavirus infections. “The big difference between us - and reason why it looks like we’re not traveling -we’re not putting on super spreaders. We are doing what we’re doing here,” Biden, 77, told reporters in his home State of Delaware on Monday. “Everybody’s wearing a mask and trying as best we can to be socially distanced. And that’s what we’re doing. You’ve attended a number of our press conferences as well. It’s important to be responsible,” Biden said. The former vice president, who is leading in national polls against his Republican rival incumbent President Donald Trump, exuded confidence of winning the November 3 election. “You know me. I am not overconfident about anything. I just wanna make sure we can earn every vote possible. That’s why we’re here. And you know that- that blue wall has to be re-established. With the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbours, I’m gonna win Pennsylvania. It’s a matter of a great deal to me personally as well as politically,” he said. “I think we’re gonna win Michigan. I think we’re gonna win Wisconsin. I think we’re gonna win Minnesota. I think we have a fighting chance in Ohio. I think we have a fighting chance in North Carolina. We have a fighting chance in Georgia. A fighting chance in Iowa. So fortunately because of over six million individual voters average contributors - average contribution USD 49 we’re able to compete. Like we haven’t been able to compete before in all these different states,” he said. Biden said he will trave to Iowa, Wisconsin, Georgia, Florida and maybe other places as well. “There’s a lot we’ve been doing as well in terms of being online and social ..everything from fundraising efforts to making sure we meet. I met today with a group of leaders in the Democratic Party laying out where we’re gonna go. Getting their input and the like,” he asserted. Biden slammed Trump for his alleged failure to control coronavirus. “The bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to try to lead us through this pandemic. He either doesn’t have any idea what to do or he just doesn’t care. On Friday, Dr. Tony Fauci, the nation’s most respected infectious disease expert, publicly acknowledged that the president has not even met with his Covid-19 team for months,” he said. On Monday evening, his campaign announced that Biden would be travelling to the battleground state of Michigan later this week to “discuss bringing Americans together to address the crises facing the country.” Trump had won the 2016 elections in Michigan by just 10,000 votes, the lowest in presidential elections. Both Trump and his vice president Mike Pence are campaigning in Michigan this week. Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris was in Michigan over the weekend. Jill Biden is also planning to campaign in Michigan on behalf of her husband this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-doing-many-rallies-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19-says-joe-biden/story-Gw1sjv8QniUsvhUhSKV9qN.html
27-10-2020||World||India calls for Middle East countries to stop support for terrorist forces||Underlining that political instability, long-festering conflicts, sectarian divides, issue of refugees and terrorism continue to plague the Middle East, India on Monday called on concerned parties in the region to completely stop support to terrorist forces like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and others.In a statement during the United Nations Security Council Open Debate on ‘The Situation in the Middle East’, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative at the UN, highlighted New Delhi’s stand on “interlinked and mutually reinforcing challenges” faced by the people of the Middle East and noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has only “exacerbated the threats posed by these challenges”.India has invested much in the peace and stability of the region by deploying its personnel as part of UN peacekeeping forces, through humanitarian assistance, development cooperation and capacity building, and will continue its contribution towards peace-building in the Middle East, Tirumurti said.“It is an unfortunate reality that the interlinked and mutually reinforcing challenges faced by the people of the Middle East have not yet been resolved. Political instability, long-festering conflicts, sectarian divides, issue of refugees and terrorism continue to plague the region. The covid-pandemic has only exacerbated the threats posed by these challenges,” the statement read.“India calls on concerned parties to completely stop support to terrorist forces like ISIL and others. India also urges all parties in the region to work constructively and in good faith to promote peace, stability and development for the benefit of all people in the Middle East,” it added.Stressing that Palestinian aspirations for a sovereign and independent state are yet to be fulfilled, Tirumurti said India urges Israel and Palestine to resume direct negotiations at the earliest and asked the international community to take concrete steps towards resuming and facilitating these negotiations quickly.“India has been unwavering in its commitment to the Palestinian cause and continues to remain supportive of a peaceful negotiated resolution of the Palestinian issue. India has supported the two-State solution as a just and acceptable solution to the conflict. Establishment of a Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel, within mutually agreed borders should be achieved through negotiations directly by the two parties,” the statement read.Tirumurti asserted that any “stalemate could strengthen the hands of extremists and shut the door to cooperation thereby jeopardising the security, stability and prosperity of the people on both sides and the region”.He noted that India supports Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s call for an international conference organised by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to engage all concerned parties in a meaningful peace process.New Delhi also appreciated the agreement between the two main Palestinian political parties--Fatah and Hamas--for holding Parliamentary and Presidential elections and also elections for the Palestinian National Council, which will help fulfil the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people“Similarly, the truce between Israel and Hamas has eased the humanitarian situation in Gaza. India hopes that the temporary truce is converted into a permanent ceasefire, which can save precious human lives on both sides and create a conducive environment for talks,” the statement read.India also welcomed the agreements for normalisation of relations between Israel and UAE and Bahrain. Tirumurti said that India has always supported peace and stability in West Asia, which is its extended neighbourhood.On the armed conflict in Syria, India said that surging inflation, near halt in economic activities and severe sanctions, have accentuated the humanitarian crisis in the country marred by decade long conflict which has claimed over 400,000 lives, displaced 6.2 million people internally and compelled another 6.3 million people to seek shelter in neighbouring countries.“2.5 million children have been deprived of schooling and 50 per cent of infrastructure has been destroyed. Surging inflation, near halt in economic activities and severe sanctions, have accentuated the humanitarian crisis. While we are heartened to see a return of normalcy to major parts of the country, we are also reminded of the enormous resources that would be required to provide urgent humanitarian aid, rebuild infrastructure, enable the return of the refugees and restore a normal and dignified life of all Syrians,” the statement read.New Delhi said it is not only contributing to the return of normalcy and rebuilding of Syria but has also consistently called for a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict through a Syrian-led dialogue.“India is not only contributing to the return of normalcy and rebuilding of Syria but has also consistently called for a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict through a Syrian-led dialogue, taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the people of Syria. In that context, we remain supportive of both the Geneva and Astana processes,” it added.The envoy stated that India remains concerned about the security and humanitarian situation in Yemen and encourages all parties to engage constructively with the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for early finalisation of the Joint Declaration paving the way for a peaceful political transition in Yemen.“The recent exchange of prisoners by the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah, who had been detained in connection with the conflict, is a welcome development. India hopes that the parties will take more confidence-building measures to provide the necessary impetus for the full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement. India also encourages all parties to engage constructively with the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for early finalisation of the Joint Declaration paving the way for a peaceful political transition in Yemen. India also hopes for peace and stability in Iraq with full respect for Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the envoy noted.In the aftermath of the August 4 blast that brought destruction to vast swathes of Beirut and inflicted heavy loss of lives, Tirumurti said India stood in solidarity with Lebanon.“We sent emergency humanitarian aid of over 58 MT to Beirut. We look forward to the swift formation of a new government that can offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN said.“The commencement of discussions on the disputed border between Israel and Lebanon is a significant development. I am hopeful that this will provide an opportunity to resolve the longstanding issue between the two countries,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-for-middle-east-countries-to-stop-support-for-terrorist-forces/story-tbSzlL5DmIKe6G8ohv42VL.html

27-10-2020||World||Barrett sworn in, becoming youngest justice of US Supreme Court||Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in on Monday as the US Supreme Court’s new justice, filling a vacancy left by the passing of the legendary Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and further bolstering the nine-member bench’s conservative majority.Barrett was confirmed by the US Senate earlier in a 52-48 vote, with one Republican voting against.“A judge declares independence not only from Congress and the president, but also from the private beliefs that might otherwise move her,” Barrett said in brief remarks after being sworn in at a late evening White House ceremony with President Donald Trump.Barrett’s admission to the court gave conservatives a 6-3 majority on the nine-judge bench, which, many Democrats fear, puts in peril key issues such as abortion and affordable health care.Democrats also worry that Barrett could tilt the scale in favour of the president if he were to challenge the outcome of the November 3 election. He has been raising false alarms about large-scale fraud in anticipation of an adverse outcome and he has refused to commit himself to accepting the verdict.At the swearing-in ceremony, President Trump said, “It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the seat of a true pioneer for women: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Tonight, Justice Barrett becomes not only the fifth woman to serve on our nation’s highest court, but the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice.”Barrett is the mother of seven children, many of them still in school. At 48, she will be the youngest justice on the court and has been a judge on the seventh circuit court of appeals since 2017, also as a Trump nominee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barrett-sworn-in-becoming-youngest-justice-of-us-surpreme-court/story-Nr0ANqpSoQkmnpzzsRxxpO.html
27-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump eyes hosting election night party at his hotel in Washington DC||President Donald Trump has his eye on hosting an election night party at his own hotel in the nation’s capital.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage)Over the past several days, the campaign has pushed out fundraising emails in the president’s name offering donors the chance to enter a drawing “to join Team Trump at the Election Night Party in my favorite hotel,” in Washington, suggesting he will use his luxury hotel as the backdrop for reacting to election results. The campaign has also spotlighted plans for the party in fundraising blasts from the president’s son Donald Trump. Jr.“November 3rd will go down in history as the night we won FOUR MORE YEARS. It will be absolutely EPIC, and the only thing that could make it better is having YOU there,” Trump said in a fundraising solicitation.(Read: Donald Trump, Joe Biden hit battleground Pennsylvania amid Covid crisis)For Trump, an election night party at his own hotel is symbolic for a businessman who leveraged his celebrity as a reality star and New York real estate magnate to win the nation’s highest office.Critics see it as one more reminder of how the president has used his office to personally profit as foreign leaders, conservative supporters and administration officials use the lobby of Washington’s Trump International Hotel as an unofficial clubhouse for the Trump presidency.Since 2017, the president and Republican National Committee have held several fundraisers at the president’s Washington hotel in the historic Old Post Office building, which the president’s company leases from the federal government.Over the course of his presidency, the Trump campaign, the RNC and their joint-fundraising committees have spent over $7.4 million at Trump-branded properties.The Washington hotel, which is blocks from the White House, has been sold out for weeks for Election Day as well as the days before and after Nov. 3. A basic room then is going for $1,200 a night, nearly triple the $476 room rate on Monday.“Donald Trump has spent his entire presidency funneling taxpayer, campaign, special interest and foreign government money into the business that he still owns,” said Donald Sherman, deputy director of the nonprofit government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “In some ways, election night is going to be the pinnacle of his self dealing.”The White House referred questions on the president’s election night plans to the Trump campaign, which did not respond to requests for comment.It’s unclear how big Trump’s election night party will be. The District of Columbia, under coronavirus protocols, has capped mass gatherings at 50 people.The president has sidestepped the district’s rules, which hold no weight on federal property, at other recent events. The president hosted hundreds of people on the White House grounds for an Independence Day weekend celebration, for his Republican National Convention speech in August and again at last month’s Rose Garden announcement of the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.Several attendees, including Trump, tested positive for the coronavirus in the days following Barrett’s event. Few guests wore masks.District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters on Monday that she had heard of plans for an election night party and added, “We will be in touch with our licensee, which is the hotel.”Bowser also more broadly questioned Trump’s wisdom in holding large gatherings at a moment when cases are spiking in the U.S. Shortly after Barrett won Senate confirmation, Trump hosted a ceremony Monday evening on the South Lawn of the White House during which Barrett took the oath of office.“You can believe that you can go to the White House and get Covid and that nothing’s going to happen to you. Perhaps,” Bowser said. “Or you can die from it.”Trump held his 2016 election party in his then-hometown of New York. But he booked his victory party at New York’s Hilton in Midtown Manhattan because his own nearby Trump International Hotel & Tower didn’t have a big enough room.It’s unclear how much of a presence Trump himself will be in the election night festivities this time. With a significant portion of the electorate opting to mail in their ballots, that could delay tabulation of results.Sherman noted that Trump, whenever he leaves office, will have a Secret Service detail for the rest of his life like other past presidents. With every Trump trip to one of his properties, taxpayers will cover the tab of agents protecting the 45th president.“I have a high level of confidence that Donald Trump will find a way to have government or special interest money go to his hotels regardless of the outcome of next week’s election,” Sherman said.___Associated Press writer Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-trump-eyes-hosting-election-night-party-at-his-hotel-in-washington-dc/story-EdkmWyjj65kkLyJwThjI1M.html

27-10-2020||World||Thai protesters shun parliament, ask Germany to probe king||Pro-democracy demonstrators in Thailand have expanded their protests internationally, marching to the German Embassy to appeal to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to investigate whether Thailand’s king has exercised political power during his extended stays in Bavaria.The protesters acted while criticizing their own Parliament, which began a special two-day session earlier Monday to address political tensions resulting from the near-daily pro-democracy protests demanding the prime minister’s resignation, constitutional changes and reforms to the monarchy.They believe the king wields an inordinate amount of power in what is nominally a democracy under a constitutional monarchy.The scrutiny and public criticism of the monarchy displayed by some of the protesters is unprecedented in a country where the royal institution has been considered sacrosanct. It has also led royalists to stage counter-rallies and to denounce the protesters for raising the issue, increasing the risk of confrontation.The protesters, estimated by an Associated Press journalist to number between 5,000 and 10,000, defied police warnings that they constituted an illegal assembly and marched to the embassy in an effort to bring attention to the time King Maha Vajiralongkorn spends in Germany. The king in recent weeks has been in Thailand with a busy schedule of ceremonial events.A statement from the protest group said they presented a letter to embassy officials asking that Germany investigate whether the king “has conducted Thai politics using his royal prerogative from German soil or not.”It said such action could be considered a violation of Germany’s territorial sovereignty, and suggested that its government consider the protesters’ request with the aim of bringing the king back to Thailand to restore the country “to the path of the truthful constitutional monarchy.”In addition to asking whether the king is carrying out his official royal duties in Germany, the letter provocatively echoed points on which the protesters have previously criticized the king.Germany is seen as receptive to their entreaties.The German government already brought up the issue in early October, when Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, responding to a question in Parliament, expressed concern over any political activities the king might be conducting in the country.On Monday in Berlin, Maas spoke again, telling reporters the government was following developments in Thailand and was aware of the demonstrations and “people taking to the streets for their rights.” He added that he also was watching the king’s activities in Germany.“We have been examining this not only in recent weeks, but we are continuing to examine it in the long term, and if there are things we feel to be unlawful, then that will have immediate consequences,” Maas said.Vajiralongkorn has for years spent significant time in Germany, but it only became an issue after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016.Bhumibol was king for seven decades, and though he traveled extensively on state visits in the early years of his reign — including being welcomed with a ticker tape parade in New York City — he left the country only once after the 1960s, and that was an overnight stay in neighboring Laos.Vajiralongkorn’s ability to spend time abroad has been made easier by changes his office sought and received to the current constitution that no longer require him to appoint a regent when away from the kingdom.Defaming the monarchy can be punished by up to 15 years in prison under Thailand’s tough lese majeste law.Speaker of the House Chuan Leekpai cautioned at Monday’s special Parliament session that it was not to discuss the role of the monarchy.In his opening speech, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said he and his government are aware that this is an era of change, pushed by technology.“But we have to admit that in Thailand, millions, tens of millions of people do not want to see change through chaos,” he said, referring to different points of view toward the protesters and their demands. “Everyone has their own beliefs.”He called for Parliament to “creatively find a balance” between competing views.The protesters believe Prayuth, who led a coup ousting an elected government in 2014 when he was army chief, retained power unfairly in last year’s election because laws were changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters also say the constitution, written and enacted under military rule, is undemocratic.The protesters consider the government’s response insincere, noting the agenda for the non-voting session of Parliament does not include the protesters’ concerns but instead has thinly disguised criticism of the protests themselves.The points of discussion released by Prayuth’s government concern the risk of the coronavirus spreading at rallies, alleged interference with a royal motorcade by a small crowd earlier this month, illegal gatherings, and the destruction of images of the royal family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-shun-parliament-ask-germany-to-probe-king/story-yU4KZIDROH4XOSLpKEM6sL.html
27-10-2020||World||Southern California: Growing wildfires force evacuation orders for over 100,000||Fast-moving wildfires forced evacuation orders for more than 100,000 people and seriously injured two firefighters in Southern California on Monday as powerful winds across the state prompted power to be cut to hundreds of thousands to prevent utility equipment from sparking new blazes.A smoky fire exploded in size to over 11 square miles (29 square kilometers) after breaking out around dawn in Orange County, south of Los Angeles. Gusts pushed flames along brushy ridges in Silverado Canyon and near houses in the sprawling city of Irvine, home to about 280,000 residents. There was no containment.Two firefighters, one 26 and the other 31 years old, were critically injured while battling the blaze, according to the county’s Fire Authority, which didn’t provide details on how the injuries occurred. They each suffered second- and third-degree burns over large portions of their bodies and were intubated at a hospital, officials said.Nearby, a much smaller fire in the Yorba Linda area prompted the evacuation of at least 10,000 people, officials said.At the Irvine-area fire, Kelsey Brewer and her three roommates decided to leave their townhouse before the evacuation order came in. The question was where to go in the pandemic. They decided on the home of her girlfriend’s mother, who has ample space and lives alone.“We literally talked about it this morning,” Brewer said, adding that she feels lucky to have a safe place to go. “We can only imagine how screwed everyone else feels. There’s nowhere you can go to feel safe.”Helicopters dropping water and fire retardant were grounded for much of the afternoon because strong winds made it unsafe to fly. However, a large air tanker and other aircraft began making drops again several hours before sunset.Officials didn’t immediately know the cause of the fires.Southern California Edison shut off power to nearly 40,000 customers in six counties — which includes the wildfire areas — as a precaution against the gusts knocking down equipment or tossing tree branches into power lines and sparking blazes.In the northern part of the state, Pacific Gas & Electric began restoring power to some of the 350,000 customers — an estimated 1 million people — in 34 counties that were left in the dark Sunday because of some of the fiercest winds of the fire season.PG&E said it had restored power to nearly 100,000 customers as winds eased in some areas, with electricity to be back on at the other homes and buildings by Tuesday night after crews make air and ground inspections to make repairs and ensure it’s safe.A dozen reports of damage had been received, PG&E said.However, the fire threat was far from over in many parts of PG&E’s vast service area.“We’re already starting to see winds pick back up,” hitting 50 mph (80.4 kph) in some regions with bone-dry humidity leading to extreme fire danger Monday evening, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E’s head of meteorology.The winds were expected to calm Monday night before renewing again Tuesday, the National Weather Service warned. Officials extended a red flag extreme fire danger warning through 5 p.m. Tuesday for the region’s eastern and northern mountainous areas.The safety shut-offs “probably did prevent dangerous fires last night. It’s almost impossible to imagine that winds of this magnitude would not have sparked major conflagrations in years past,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said on Twitter.A second round of gusts is predicted to sweep through the same areas Monday night,Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable. October and November are traditionally the worst months for fires, but already this year 8,600 wildfires in the state have scorched a record 6,400 square miles (16,600 square kilometers) and destroyed about 9,200 homes, businesses and other buildings. There have been 31 deaths.The electricity shutdowns marked the fifth time this year that Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation’s largest utility, has cut power to customers to reduce the risk of downed or fouled power lines or other equipment that could ignite blazes amid bone-dry weather conditions and gusty winds.The conditions could equal those during devastating fires in California’s wine country in 2017 and last year’s Kincade Fire that devastated Sonoma County north of San Francisco last October, the National Weather Service said. Fire officials said PG&E transmission lines sparked that fire, which destroyed hundreds of homes and caused nearly 100,000 people to flee.Many of this year’s devastating fires were started by thousands of dry lightning strikes, but some remain under investigation for potential electrical causes. While the biggest fires in California have been fully or significantly contained, more than 5,000 firefighters remain committed to 20 blazes, state fire officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/southern-california-growing-wildfires-force-evacuation-orders-for-over-100-000/story-iUurXdPx2bIrdHKUtc60cJ.html
27-10-2020||World||Protests in Italy over new coronavirus crackdown turn violent||Protesters turned out by the hundreds in Turin, Milan and other Italian cities and towns Monday to vent their anger, sometimes violently, at the latest pandemic restrictions that force restaurants and cafes to close early and shutter cinemas, gyms and other leisure venues.In the northern city of Turin, some demonstrators broke off from a peaceful protest, smashing store windows on an elegant shopping street, setting smoke bombs and hurling bottles at police in a main city square where the Piedmont regional government is headquartered, RAI state TV said.A photographer was injured by a hurled bottle, RAI said. Police fired tear gas to clear the protesters in Piazza del Castello.In that same square, hours earlier, some 300 taxis peacefully lined up in neat rows to draw attention to their economic losses from the implosion of tourism and disappearance of workers from the city center as they do their jobs remotely during the pandemic.Triggering the violence in Turin were a group of “ultras,” as violent soccer fans are known, the LaPresse news agency said. It said five of the protesters were detained by authorities.In Italy’s business capital, Milan, police used tear gas to scatter protesters Monday night, and an Associated Press journalist saw at least two people detained.The protests began shortly after the national government’s order took effect requiring bars, cafes and restaurants to close their doors at 6 pm for the next 30 days as Italy tries to rein the resurgence of coronavirus infections in recent weeks.Since most Italians don’t dine out before 7:30 pm at the earliest, the decree effectively wiped out most of the restaurants’ already reduced revenue in the pandemic, although takeout and delivery can continue until midnight.The crackdown was announced Sunday, a day after Italy registered more than a half million confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic’s outbreak.Last week, a peaceful march by shopkeepers and other business owners in Naples, upset about a regional curfew that orders citizens off the streets at 11 pm, turned violent near the Campania region’s headquarters. Investigators were quoted in Italian media as saying the violence, in which police officers were injured, bore the hand of the Camorra, the local organized crime group.A day later, an extreme right political group staged a violent demonstration in downtown Rome.Smaller cities, including Catania in Sicily, and towns also saw protests Monday. In Cremona, a town in northern Lombardy, restaurant owners turned out in front of the local interior ministry’s office. After banging pots and bans, they left them piled up in the street to highlight their economic woes worsened by the latest early-shutdown decree, the ANSA news agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-in-italy-over-new-coronavirus-crackdown-turn-violent/story-eox1Iu17v6cE9AM1bezYqO.html
27-10-2020||World||Iran’s foreign minister urges UN to unite against US unilateral actions||Iran’s foreign minister used his speech for the 75th anniversary of the United Nations to accuse the United States of initiating or joining eight wars since 200 that displaced 37 million people and resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of innocent lives and “unprecedented extremism.”Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a virtual speech to the UN General Assembly that it was time for the 193-member world body “to recommit itself to stand up -- united -- against unilateralism and war” promoted by the United States.Zarif’s speech had scheduled to be broadcast on Sept. 21 when world leaders commemorated the UN’s 75th anniversary. But there were so many speakers that the speeches of 58 leaders and ministers were carried over and only shown Monday, two days after UN Day, which commemorates the entry into force of the UN Charter that officially established the United Nations on Oct. 24, 1945.Zarif quoted a study released last month by Brown University’s Costs of War project that estimated the United States’ wars since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 have forced at least 37 million people to flee their homes in the eight most violent conflicts -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and the Philippines.“How can we counter the unilateralism and disdain for international law by a bully that only knows wielding a big stick and speaking arrogantly?” Zarif asked, also citing US with battles American Indian tribes, the Civil War that ended slavery, and what he called “economic wars” resulting from US sanctions.“In fact, no one wins in a war,” the Iranian minister said. “It’s time to change tack -- saving American blood and treasure and sparing the world from further misery.”Zarif’s speech was shown on a screen in the General Assembly Hall as the Security Council was holding a virtual meeting on the Middle East at which Israel’s new UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, said “Iran and its terrorist proxies remain the biggest threats to peace and security in the region.”Ironically, he said, “Iran’s extreme and murderous ways” have brought moderate forces in the Middle East closer together, leading to Israel’s recent peace agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and new ties with Sudan. “It’s surprising, but I actually want to thank Iran” for the role it played in those agreements, he said.Erdan called on the Security Council to prevent Iran from continuing to develop its nuclear capabilities, obtaining advanced weapons and violating human rights. He called Iran “one of the biggest human rights violators in the world,” citing 4,300 executions during President Hassan Rouhani’s tenure, including minors, women, gays, journalists and anti-government protesters.Iran was also the agenda of the General Assembly’s human rights committee Monday where the UN independent investigator on the country’s human rights, Javaid Rehman, said the Iranian government must conduct an independent and transparent investigation into the crackdown on protests in November 2019 and January 2020 and bring violators to justice.Rehman, a professor of human rights and Islamic law at London’s Brunel University, said Iran has failed to conduct an investigation meeting international standards “despite clear evidence that Iranian security forces used excessive and lethal force, which caused the deaths of over 300 people, including women and children.”“The government and judiciary appear to be implementing death sentences against protesters to prevent peaceful dissent and restrict civic space,” he said. “The recent arbitrary execution of Navid Afkari for his participation in August 2018 protests is emblematic of this concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-foreign-minister-urges-un-to-unite-against-us-unilateral-actions/story-u8DhtPv0KJesFLSZvu0qXN.html
27-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden hit battleground Pennsylvania amid Covid crisis||President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden zeroed in on the critical battleground of Pennsylvania on Monday, demonstrating starkly different approaches to rallying voters just eight days before polls close during the worst public health crisis in a century.Trump drew thousands of largely mask-less supporters as he began a final-week charge through nearly a dozen states ahead of the election. Biden, taking a more cautious approach in effort to show that he’s taking the pandemic seriously, greeted a few dozen supporters outside a Chester, Pennsylvania, campaign field office.“Bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this pandemic,” Biden said as he sharpened his closing message into an indictment of Trump’s handling of the virus. Trump, meanwhile, stoked fears about Biden’s plans to address the outbreak.“It’s a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown,” Trump claimed at a rally in Allentown, focusing on the economy and the possibility of lost jobs.Trump was returning to the White House later to celebrate the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, expected Monday evening. Trump has sought to use the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last month to animate conservative evangelical and Catholic voters to his candidacy, but the high court fight has been overshadowed by virus concerns.In Pennsylvania, Trump also touted the appointment of another conservative justice as potentially giving him an edge in election-related litigation surrounding a surge in absentee and mail ballots due to the pandemic.For each candidate, the differing campaign approaches carry risks.For Trump, the full-speed-ahead strategy could spread the virus in places that are already setting new records and leave him appearing aloof to the consequences. And if Biden comes up short in the election, his lower-key travel schedule will surely come under scrutiny as a missed opportunity.Trump’s campaign schedule suggested he’s on the defensive in Pennsylvania, viewed by his aides as critical to his path to 270 electoral votes. Biden, meanwhile, is demonstrating more confidence with signals that he’s hoping to expand his campaign map.In the closing days Biden plans to visit Georgia, a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992, and Iowa, which Trump carried by more than 9 percentage points in 2016. He’s dispatching his running mate, Kamala Harris, later this week to Texas, which hasn’t backed a Democrat for the White House since Jimmy Carter in 1976.With more than a third of the expected ballots in the election already cast, it could become increasingly challenging for Trump and Biden to reshape the contours of the race. But both men are fighting for any endgame advantage. Biden is leading Trump in most national polls and has an advantage, though narrower, in many key battlegrounds.While the final week of the campaign is colliding with deepening concerns about the Covid crisis in far-flung parts of the US, Trump is anxious for voters to focus on almost anything else. He’s worried that he will lose if the election becomes a referendum on his handling of the pandemic. Biden, meanwhile, is working to ensure the race is just that, hitting Trump on the virus and presenting himself as a safer, more stable alternative.The stakes were clear this past weekend as the White House became the locus for a second outbreak of the virus in a month. Several close aides to Vice President Mike Pence tested positive, including his chief of staff, Marc Short. Pence, though, was insistent on maintaining his aggressive political calendar, even though he was deemed a “close contact,” claiming the status of an “essential employee.”Pence arrived at a rally in Hibbing, Minnesota, wearing a mask Monday but removed it as he reached the podium to speak to a crowd of supporters who were largely not wearing face coverings or social distancing. Hibbing police confirmed more than 650 people in attendance, exceeding Minnesota health guidelines to restrict crowds to 250 people.With Election Day just over a week away, average deaths per day across the country are up 10% over the past two weeks, from 721 to nearly 794 as of Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed infections per day are rising in 47 states, and deaths are up in 34.The latest national outbreak has provided a potent sign of the divergent approaches the Trump and Biden campaigns have taken to the virus. On Sunday, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said that “we’re not going to control the pandemic” and the focus should be on containment and treatment.Biden, in a statement, said Meadows’ comments continued with the Trump administration waving “the white flag of defeat” in the face of the virus.Trump fired back Monday as he arrived in Pennsylvania, saying Biden, with his concerns about the virus spread, has “waved a white flag on life.”He rejected Biden’s comments that the nation is facing a “dark winter,” saying, “No it’s not going to be a dark winter. It’s going to be a great winter. It’s going to be a great spring.”Biden’s team argues the coronavirus is likely to blot out any other issues that might come up in the final days of the campaign — including his recent debate-stage comment in which he affirmed he’d transition away from oil, later walking that back as a transition away from federal subsidies. That strategy appeared to pay off as the outbreak in Pence’s staff refocused the national conversation once again on the pandemic.Trump and his team, meanwhile, have struggled to settle on a closing message, with the undisciplined candidate increasingly trusting his instincts over his advisers. He’s grasped for dirt on his Democratic rival and used apocalyptic terms to describe a Biden presidency, but Biden has thus far proven more resistant to such attacks than Trump’s 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.Anticipating a razor-thin Electoral College margin, Trump has an aggressive schedule including a visit Omaha, Nebraska, Tuesday after a Sunday visit to Maine, aiming to lock up one electoral vote in each of the states that award them by congressional district. Trump is scheduled hold a dizzying 11 rallies in the final 48 hours before polls close.Biden is sitting on more campaign cash than Trump and is putting it to use, blanketing airwaves with a nearly 2-to-1 advantage over the final two weeks. The incessant campaign ads feature both upbeat messages and blistering criticism of Trump’s handling of the pandemic.Democrats have been heartened by their lead in the record numbers of early votes that have been cast across a number of battleground states — though they caution that Republicans are more likely to turn out on Election Day and certain to make up ground.Four years ago, Clinton also enjoyed a lead in national and some state polls, and Democrats say their complacency doomed their candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-hit-battleground-pennsylvania-amid-covid-crisis/story-uMPtKFy4gXPZpYXv8M00gM.html
27-10-2020||World||Senate confirms Amy Coney Barrett to US Supreme Court||The Senate voted 52-48 Monday to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court, giving the court a 6-3 conservative majority that could determine the future of the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights.All Democrats in the chamber voted against Barrett’s confirmation, as did Republican Susan Collins of Maine, who agreed with Democratic objections to confirming a justice so close to the Nov. 3 election.President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in the Senate pushed for a quick confirmation of Barrett, and it came just 38 days after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who for 27 years anchored the court’s liberal wing. Trump had said he wanted his replacement for Ginsburg in place to avoid a deadlocked court should the outcome of the presidential election depend on a ruling, as was the case in 2000.A White House swearing-in ceremony for Barrett is being planned for Monday evening with Justice Clarence Thomas set to administer the oath of office.The highly partisan vote on the confirmation mirrors the divisions in the country leading up to the election and on some of the issues that will be before the high court in the near future. Those issues include the validity of the Affordable Care Act and the status of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion rights nationwide, as well as voting and civil rights.The court is scheduled to hear arguments on the ACA, the law known as Obamacare, a week after the election. The Trump administration is urging the court to declare the law invalid, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.The Mississippi attorney general, meanwhile, has pitched the court to take up her state’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks in a case that could sharply limit Roe and for the first time let states outlaw the procedure before a fetus becomes viable.Trump has said he wants the justices he’s selected for the court -- there are now three of them -- to invalidate Obamacare and overturn Roe v. Wade.The court is already addressing pre-election skirmishes over the rules for casting and counting ballots in the contest between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.Just last week, the court deadlocked 4-4 on how many days Pennsylvania could wait after Election Eay for mail-in votes to arrive, leaving in force a three-day extension for the receipt of absentee ballots in the pivotal state. Barrett could provide the fifth vote to overturn any state court ruling that expands voting, or otherwise favors Democrats.The court also is scheduled to hear arguments Nov. 30 on Trump’s attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 census, a case that could determine the allocation of House seats and federal dollars.Barrett, 48, has served on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals since 2017 and taught at Notre Dame Law School. In three days of testimony during her confirmation hearings, Barrett stressed she would be independent, while asserting she had no agenda but to follow the Constitution and the law. She deflected questions on how she might rule on issues such as abortion, despite having the clearest anti-abortion record of any nominee in decades.Barrett’s nomination so close to the election and the rapid confirmation process drew an angry response from Democrats, who pointed to the refusal of Senate Republicans to even give a hearing to President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill a vacancy that arose in February 2016 because it was an election year.While the number of justices has been set at nine since 1869, that experience and the Barrett nomination has ignited a campaign by Democratic activists to expand the court in retaliation, though that idea hasn’t been embraced by Biden or Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.Biden has said he would appoint a commission to consider court reform, while Schumer has said everything would be on the table next year if Democrats take back the Senate.Republicans have long seen court battles as a key motivator for turning out their base, and Republican senators including Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are pinning their re-election hopes in large part on their successful efforts to shift to the courts to the right.They won’t have to wait long see whether their efforts bear fruit at the ballot box.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-confirms-amy-coney-barrett-to-us-supreme-court/story-yW5s4Ny0ciHVQ7LBIY0K6K.html
27-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett to seal SC confirmation||The Republican-controlled US Senate is poised to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, as the next justice to the Supreme Court on Monday, a move that will tilt the country’s highest court further to the right for years to come.No nominee to the Supreme Court has ever been confirmed by the Senate this close to a presidential election.The rush to confirm Barrett, 48, has bitterly divided Democrats and Republicans, who are expected to split along party lines on the final vote. Trump has said repeatedly he wants her in place to vote on any election-related cases that go to the court.With Republicans controlling the chamber 53-47 and no indication of an internal revolt against the conservative appeals court judge succeeding liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett looks almost certain to take up a lifetime appointment on the bench over universal Democratic opposition.Several Republicans who previously expressed concerns about rushing the process, including Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, are expected to approve Barrett’s nomination.With Barrett confirmed, the Supreme Court will have a solid 6-3 conservative majority.The White House planned a Monday night celebration of the expected confirmation, a month after a similar event was linked to a Covid-19 outbreak that preceded President Donald Trump’s own infection.White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters the event planned for Monday evening likely would be held outdoors. “Tonight, we’ll be doing the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible,” Meadows said.Barrett is expected to participate in a crucial hearing on November 10, where Trump and his fellow Republicans will ask the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act. The 2010 healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare, has helped millions of Americans obtain medical insurance and protected those with pre-existing conditions.During her confirmation hearing before the Senate judiciary committee this month, Barrett, a favourite of Christian conservatives, sidestepped questions on abortion, presidential powers, climate change, voting rights, Obamacare and other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-to-seal-sc-confirmation/story-bu2EUnXUoXRNpTvVNbQ40M.html
27-10-2020||World||‘Facebook gearing for post-poll unrest in US’||Facebook is preparing for possible unrest after polls close on the November 3 presidential elections, with its internal tools used for “at-risk” countries likely to be deployed for the US, The Wall Street Journal reported.The measures include slowing the spread of viral content and lowering the bar for suppressing potentially inflammatory posts, WSJ quoted people familiar with the developments as saying.These tools were used in the past for Sri Lanka and Myanmar and are part of a larger tool kit developed by Facebook to prepare for the US election, it said.“We’ve spent years building for safer, more secure elections,” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone was quoted as saying. “We’ve applied lessons from previous elections, hired experts, and built new teams with experience across different areas to prepare for various scenarios.”The tools will be deployed only in dire circumstances such as election-related violence. The likely steps include tweaking the news feed to change what types of content users see, the report said. The Kremlin said on Monday that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s assessment of Russia as the biggest threat to US national security was wrong and encouraged hatred of Russia.“We absolutely do not agree,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call, when asked to comment on Biden’s assessment. “We can only regret that absolute hatred of the Russian Federation is spread in this way.” On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he saw nothing criminal in Hunter Biden’s past business ties with Ukraine or Russia, marking out his disagreement with one of Donald Trump’s attack lines in the presidential election. He was responding to comments made by Trump during televised debates. Trump has used the debates to make accusations that Biden and his son Hunter engaged in unethical practices in Ukraine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-gearing-for-post-poll-unrest-in-us/story-Z3lVs2JBpZOKTRtiFcJlXP.html
27-10-2020||World||Oxford vaccine tests raise hopes||One of the world’s leading Covid-19 experimental vaccines produces an immune response in both young and old adults, raising hopes of a path out of the gloom and economic destruction wrought by the novel coronavirus.The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people. The global cases have crossed 43 million.“It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher,” an AstraZeneca spokesman said. “The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,” the spokesman said, referring to the vaccine’s technical name.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate.The news that older people get an immune response is positive because the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus. If it works, a vaccine would allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic.British health secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible roll-out mostly in the first half of 2021.Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: “I don’t rule that out but that is not my central expectation.”“The programme is progressing well, (but) we’re not there yet,” Hancock said.Meanwhile, The Sun newspaper reported that staff at George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in London have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the Oxford vaccine. The hospital was told to prepare for the vaccine from the “week commencing the November 2”, it said.The newspaper said clinical trials at the hospital have been paused as all resources have been diverted to prepare vaccination of thousands of doctors, nurses and other front-line staff.China is testing millions of people in Xinjiang region, with 137 asymptomatic cases detected so far, the highest number of such infections in seven months. The tests followed the discovery of a cluster linked to a garment factory.The new cases were found on Sunday during a drive to test 4.75 million people in the Kashgar area triggered by an asymptomatic infection in a 17-year-old female factory worker.France has “lost control of the epidemic,” said Prof Jean-François Delfraissy, who heads the scientific council that advises the government, a day after health authorities reported more than 52,000 new cases in the country.Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her party colleagues that Germany is on the verge of losing control of its fight against the virus. With 12,500 cases per week, Belgium’s intensive care units are at risk of being overrun.Meanwhile, Australia’s second-biggest city Melbourne will exit its coronavirus lockdown after nearly four months, with no new daily cases or deaths recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-vaccine-tests-raise-hopes/story-p58aMuoSi7ppYL6PGQgAcJ.html
