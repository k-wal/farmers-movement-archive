However, we have to be careful to not get stuck looking for a second Earth because there could be planets that might be more suitable for life than ours,” Schulze-Makuch said.The researchers identified superhabitability criteria and searched among the 4,500 known exoplanets beyond our solar system for good candidates.Habitability does not mean these planets definitely have life, merely the conditions that would be conducive to life, they noted.The researchers selected planet-star systems with probable terrestrial planets orbiting within the host star’s liquid water habitable zone from the Kepler Object of Interest Exoplanet Archive of transiting exoplanets.While the Sun is the centre of our solar system, it has a relatively short lifespan of less than 10 billion years, they said.Since it took nearly 4 billion years before any form of complex life appeared on Earth, many similar stars to our sun, called G stars, might run out of fuel before complex life can develop, according to the researchers.In addition to looking at systems with cooler G stars, they also looked at systems with K dwarf stars, which are somewhat cooler, less massive and less luminous than the Sun.The researchers said K stars have the advantage of long lifespans of 20 billion to 70 billion years.This would allow orbiting planets to be older as well as giving life more time to advance to the complexity currently found on Earth, they said.However, to be habitable, planets should not be so old that they have exhausted their geothermal heat and lack protective geomagnetic fields.Earth is around 4.5 billion years old, but the researchers argue that the sweet spot for life is a planet that is between 5 billion to 8 billion years old. Size and mass also matter.A planet that is 10 per cent larger than the Earth should have more habitable land, the researchers said.One that is about 1.5 times Earth’s mass would be expected to retain its interior heating through radioactive decay longer and would also have a stronger gravity to retain an atmosphere over a longer time period, they said.Water is key to life and the researchers argue that a little more of it would help, especially in the form of moisture, clouds and humidity.They noted that a slightly overall warmer temperature, a mean surface temperature of about 5 degrees Celsius greater than Earth, together with the additional moisture, would be also better for life.Among the 24 top planet candidates none of them meet all the criteria for superhabitable planets, but one has four of the critical characteristics, making it possibly much more comfortable for life than our home planet, the researchers added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-says-of-24-superhabitable-planets-may-exist-outside-solar-system/story-4iO4wZ2X21vtKYYTZSsbiN.html

The president immediately objected to that format, and he said he wouldn’t take part.Trump’s campaign manager Bill Stepien says in a statement that the “American people should not be deprived of the chance to see the two candidates for president debate face to face two more times” before the election.Stepien says the campaign would like to see the town hall postponed by one week, to Oct. 22, and the third debate held on Oct. 29.Democrat Joe Biden’s campaign had also asked that town hall be moved back a week “so the president is not able to evade accountability.”___12 p.m.Joe Biden’s presidential campaign says because of President Donald Trump’s rejection of a virtual presidential debate on Oct. 15, the Democratic challenger will hold his own town hall event the same night.Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said in a statement late Thursday morning that the Commission on Presidential Debates should reschedule the town hall debate for Oct. 22. That’s the night a third debate was to take place.The commission earlier Thursday had announced that any Oct. 15 debate would be virtual because of Trump’s recent COVID-19 diagnosis. Biden said he was willing to abide by the format change, but Trump blasted the decision and argued without evidence that the commission was trying to help Biden.Bedingfield said in her statement that Trump is trying to “evade accountability” by avoiding facing voters directly.“The voters should have a chance to ask questions of both candidates, directly,” she said. “Every presidential candidate since 1992 has participated in such an event, and it would be a shame if Donald Trump was the first to refuse.”—-8:10 a.m.President Donald Trump, who has the coronavirus, says he will not participate in next week’s presidential debate if it’s held virtually.Trump says in a Fox Business interview that that arrangement is “not acceptable to us.”And he’s accusing moderators of trying to protect his Democratic rival Joe Biden.The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates had announced moments earlier that the second debate between Trump and Biden will take place virtually because of the president’s diagnosis of COVID-19.The commission cited a need “to protect the health and safety of all involved with the second presidential debate” and said the candidates would “participate from separate remote locations” while the participants and moderator remain in Miami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-for-two-in-person-debates-with-joe-biden-before-election/story-M1XopPJbzMPjm6CDtm7EJL.html

She is the 16th woman to win the Nobel prize, and the first American woman since Toni Morrison took the prize in 1993.The academy gave the award to Glück for her “candid and uncompromising” work and praised the writer “for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal.”She has written 12 collections of poetry and two books of essays over the career span of six decades. Currently, Glück is a professor of English at Yale University and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She made her debut in 1968 with “Firstborn,” and “was soon acclaimed as one of the most prominent poets in American contemporary literature,” the Nobel Academy said.Here is the list of her notable work:The Triumph of Achilles: In this collection, divided into three-parts, the Glück explores many themesThe Wild Iris: It was published in 1992, and led her to the Pulitzer award in 1993. It is a collection of beautifully written poems which revolves around universal themes of time and mortality.Averno: It was published in 2006 and was a National Book Award Finalist for Poetry that year. The academy described the book as “a masterly collection, a visionary interpretation of the myth of Persephone’s descent into hell in the captivity of Hades, the god of death,” on its Twitter handle.Faithful and Virtuous Night: It was published in 2014 and is considered to be one of the finest work of Glück. It won National Book Award for Poetry in the same year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-wild-iris-averno-nobel-laureate-louise-gluck-s-notable-work/story-a0nGFsq8Qx29snDqE9ONIL.html

They gain trust over a number of weeks or months and have the victims believe that they are in a loving, caring relationship. Fraudsters may be based anywhere across the globe.However, the criminal’s end goal is only to get the victims’ money or personal information, Action Fraud said. The centre launched a multi-agency campaign throughout October to raise awareness of romance fraud and provide clear and unambiguous protection advice to the public, following a 26% rise in reports in the past year.Alex Rothwell of the City of London Police (the UK lead force on fraud) said: “Romance fraud is a devastating crime that impacts victims both financially and emotionally…Criminals are experts at impersonating people.” “They spend hours researching you for their scams, especially when committing romance fraud. We’re reminding everyone to stop and think: fall for the person, not the profile, it could protect you and your money,” he added.Diana Fawcett of charity organisation Victim Support added: “Lockdown restrictions meant people could not meet in person for a number of months, which led to many seeking to form new connections online. While using the internet can be a great way to meet people and form relationships, there’s also a great risk of being lured into a romance scam as fraudsters know how to take advantage of people’s desire for human contact.”“Unfortunately, we’ve seen that circumstances caused by coronavirus were in fact used by fraudsters as a ‘hook’ to extort money. For example, some have invented lies about needing medical treatment, or urgent travel expenses to leave a country, or funds to keep afloat after a bogus job loss caused by the pandemic,” she added.The City of London Police said that during October it will co-ordinate enforcement activity across the UK and overseas to target and arrest criminals suspected of committing romance fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/romance-fraud-on-the-rise-in-uk-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-SkR6HQ098d7LCbHl5gW1OL.html

It comes after Trump was hospitalized with Covid-19 over the weekend and the White House has reported that a dozen staffers have become infected with the virus, which has killed more than 210,000 people in the US.The Biden and Trump campaigns didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Moderator Steve Scully, C-SPAN’s political editor, will be live from the planned location of the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County, and the commission says the White House press pool will “provide coverage.”Trump tested positive for Covid on Oct. 1, two weeks before the next scheduled debate. He was hospitalized Friday before returning to the White House on Monday.The president’s doctor has said he is feeling better but has refused to release key details since Monday, such as Trump’s specific vital signs, when he last tested negative, when he actually fell ill, and whether he’s still receiving a steroid, dexamethasone.The virus has circulated widely throughout the White House. Aside from Trump and the first lady, aides Hope Hicks, Nick Luna, Stephen Miller and Kayleigh McEnany have all tested positive, as has campaign manager Bill Stepien and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who helped with debate prep.Trump is pushing to return to normal, having gone to the Oval Office on Wednesday, despite still being in the active phase of the virus. The campaigns had haggled over rule changes after the first debate, which was marked by a series of interruptions from Trump in particular. The campaign has said that Trump “intends to be ready to debate” by Oct. 15, and had opposed rule changes, such as a mute button that would allow moderators to cut off the microphone of a candidate.The idea of having the candidates debate each other from separate locations is not new. In the third debate of the famous 1960 debates between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, the candidates sparred remotely with Kennedy in New York City and Nixon in Los Angeles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-going-to-waste-my-time-on-a-virtual-debate-trump-pulls-out-of-october-15-presidential-debate/story-Yk9573OjIZA5uIPaW20NNJ.html

The researchers, including those from the University of York in the UK, noted that most vaccines under development worldwide have been modelled on the original ‘D-strain’ of the virus, which were more common amongst sequences published early in the pandemic. Since then, the virus has evolved to the globally dominant ‘G-strain’, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of published SARS-CoV-2 genomes, they said. There had been fears the G-strain, within the main protein on the surface of the virus, would negatively impact on vaccines under development. However, the research by Australia’s national science agency the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), found no evidence the change would adversely impact the efficacy of vaccine candidates. The study, published in the journal npj Vaccines, tested blood samples from ferrets given a candidate vaccine against virus strains that either possessed or lacked this mutation known as ‘D614G’. “This is good news for the hundreds of vaccines in development around the world, with the majority targeting the spike protein as this binds to the ACE2 receptors in our lungs and airways, which are the entry point to infect cells,” said Professor Seshadri Vasan, who holds an honorary chair in Health Sciences at the University of York. “Despite this D614G mutation to the spike protein, we confirmed through experiments and modelling that vaccine candidates are still effective,” Vasan said in a statement. “We’ve also found the G-strain is unlikely to require frequent ‘vaccine matching’ where new vaccines need to be developed seasonally to combat the virus strains in circulation, as is the case with influenza,” he said. CSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall said the research was critically important in the race to develop a vaccine. “This brings the world one step closer to a safe and effective vaccine to protect people and save lives,” Marshall said. he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/potential-covid-19-vaccines-not-affected-by-recent-mutations-study/story-qy6qFAV2FhA2ebhNrhpyoL.html

But it looks like communist #China is hoping to march into the subcontinent by imposing censorship. #Taiwan’s Indian friends will have one reply: GET LOST!” he said in a tweet.New Delhi has no formal diplomatic relations with Taipei, but both sides have close business and cultural ties.India’s government has carefully avoided upsetting China over Taiwan. But relations became fraught after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in June, and there have been calls from some Indian nationalist groups for a boycott of Chinese goods. “The Chinese government behaves like a street goon, not like an aspiring super-power. It threatens us,” said Nitin Gokhale, the editor of a defence and security website, after receiving the Chinese embassy’s email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-get-lost-over-china-s-note-to-indian-media/story-mifIvtgFLDo4I7Xr0u1x8K.html

08-10-2020||World||Amid anti-Netanyahu protests, Israel extends ban that limits public protests||The Israeli government has extended an emergency provision that bars public gatherings, including widespread protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for an additional week.Government ministers approved the measure until Oct. 13 by a telephone vote, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement late Wednesday.Israel imposed a nationwide lockdown ahead of the Jewish High Holidays last month to rein in the country’s surging coronavirus outbreak. The Knesset, Israel’s parliament, passed a law last week allowing the government to declare a special week-long state of emergency to limit participation in assemblies because of the pandemic. The government then declared the state of emergency, limiting all public gatherings to within a kilometer (0.6 miles) of a person’s home.Netanyahu has said the restrictions are driven by safety concerns as the country battles a runaway pandemic, but critics and protesters accuse him of tightening the lockdown to muzzle their movement and expression of dissent.Thousands of Israelis have participated in weekly demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem for months this summer, calling on the longtime prime minister to resign while on trial for corruption.Since the restriction was approved last month, tens of thousands of Israelis have staged protests on street corners and public squares near their homes against the government’s perceived mishandling of the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout.On Thursday, an Israeli protester painted the Hebrew word “Go” — an increasingly popular slogan among anti-Netanyahu protesters — in large letters across Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square.Israel was initially praised for its swift imposition of restrictions in February to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But after reopening the economy and schools in May, new cases increased quickly. It imposed a second lockdown on Sept. 18 as the infection rate skyrocketed to one of the highest per capita in the world.The Health Ministry has recorded over 282,000 confirmed cases of the disease and over 1,800 deaths in the country of around 9 million people.After nearly three weeks of lockdown, the number of new cases is gradually decreasing, but infections are still spreading, particularly among the country’s hard-hit ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community, which makes up around 10% of the country’s population, accounts for more than a third of Israel’s virus cases. Some members of the community have flouted the rules and held prayers in enclosed spaces, large festive gatherings and clashed with police over their enforcement of regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-anti-netanyahu-protests-israel-extends-ban-that-limits-public-protests/story-cTSiaDZISKUKGhIoKaQ3ZP.html

But Pence has an albatross around his neck -- and that’s Trump,” Balachandran Gopalan, 79, told AFP in New Delhi after the US election debate in Salt Lake City.“I felt a little sorry for Pence.

We don’t need a massive $2 trillion Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families.”Harris, who co-sponsored the bill backed by the Democrats, in late July told Pence that the money will be used to build renewable energy resources. Reiterating the Democrat commitment towards increasing dependency towards green energy, Harris said, “Joe is about saying we’re going to invest that in renewable energy. We’re going to be about the creation of millions of jobs. We will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035. Joe has a plan.”Democrats allege that the Republican lawmakers are not committed towards the Green New Deal because they do not want to reduce carbon emissions since US President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 after winning the elections.The Republicans also continue to allege that these measures will impose rules on the US families and new measures would cost the taxpayer dearly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-presidential-debate-what-is-the-green-new-deal-climate-plan/story-6Pw6aLTQfdYzGhkGPFBxkJ.html

Reacting to the great achievement his former student conferred, Doudna’s Harvard professor said, “The only thing better winning the Nobel Prize yourself is having one of your former students win it.”“You were always a star” Jack Szostak, who mentored Doudna for her PhD at Harvard University also said.On Wednesday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for chemistry to two women. It was the first time a Nobel prize was shared by two women.Doudna celebrated her win at her lab in University of California, Berkely. Doudna is Professor in the department of chemistry and the department of molecular and cell biology.“My greatest hope is that it’s used for good, to uncover new mysteries in biology and to benefit humankind,” news agency AP quoted Doudna as saying after her win in Stockholm.“I’m always excited about doing science because I love the people I work with and I love the discoveries,” she also said Jennifer Doudna in a virtual address on Zoom.The breakthrough research done by Charpentier and Doudna was published in 2012, making the discovery very recent compared with a lot of other Nobel-winning research, which is often honoured only after decades have passed.CRISPR is a very simple technique for cutting a gene at a specific spot, allowing scientists to operate on flaws that are the root cause of many diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-thing-better-winning-nobel-prize-yourself-is-jennifer-a-doudna-s-professor-reacts-to-her-win/story-uMSqGuH89uOd2XeC7nmUGO.html
08-10-2020||World||North Korea likely to unveil weapons at weekend military parade, says South Korea||For months, North Korea has been relatively uncombative, as leader Kim Jong Un grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, natural disasters and the deepening economic pain under years of tough US-led sanctions.But ahead of the 75th founding anniversary of his ruling party this weekend, speculation has risen that Kim may hold a massive military parade and unveil newly developed, powerful missiles. The goal, experts say, would be to bolster internal unity and draw US attention amid deadlocked nuclear diplomacy between the countries.“His people are considerably wearied and his economy is in trouble ... so Kim Jong Un would want to mobilise his people and stress a self-reliant policy to quell their complaints and draw their loyalty,” Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University in South Korea. “To do so, he would need new weapons, powerful weapons that would send a message to the entire world.” Recent satellite images showed thousands of troops assembling in formation along with vehicles in an apparent rehearsal at an airfield on the outskirts of Pyongyang, where the North Koreans have practiced past parades. South Korean Defence Minister Suh Wook told lawmakers Wednesday that North Korea is expected to unveil unspecified “strategic weapons” during a military parade marking the October 10 anniversary.North Korea typically celebrates major state anniversaries with big military parades during years that end in zero and five. But it has sometimes made those parades less provocative when it was seeking better relations with the outside world.During a parade marking the 70th birthday of its socialist government in September 2018, Kim didn’t speak and avoided displaying any of his long-range missiles, as the event came three months after he held his first summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore on the future of his nuclear arsenal. In celebrations marking his late grandfather’s birthday in 2012 and 2017, Kim still paraded his intercontinental ballistic missiles in a display of military might as he raised the stakes in the standoff with the United States.Kim met Trump two more times, but their nuclear diplomacy has been stalled for more than a year because of disputes over exchanging sanctions relief and disarmament steps.Kim entered 2020 declaring his intent to strengthen his nuclear deterrent and achieve a “frontal breakthrough” against US-led economic pressure. But the North’s broken economy was further ravaged by border closures amid the coronavirus pandemic, which significantly reduced its trade with China, its major ally and economic lifeline. The heavy floods and strong typhoons that battered the North’s major farming regions this summer will certainly worsen the country’s chronic food shortages, outside observers say.“It’s clear that the North is running out of foreign currency and the country could be approaching a point where it leads to instability in exchange rates and market prices, which would make people’s everyday lives harder and thus create a political burden for Kim,” Lim Soo-ho, an analyst at Seoul’s Institute for National Security Strategy, said.The National Assembly Budget Office in Seoul, a South Korean parliamentary research arm, said in a recent report that North Korea’s imports from China declined by nearly 67 % and its exports to China about 72 % during the first half of this year. The report said China accounted for more than 95 % of North Korea’s external trade last year.North Korea has steadfastly argued it hasn’t had a single coronavirus case, a claim widely disputed by foreign experts. The South Korean and U.S. militaries said Kim ordered troops to shoot smugglers and others illegally crossing its border as part of anti-virus measures. Last month, North Korean soldiers fatally shot a South Korean found in its waters, an incident that prompted Kim to apologize to Seoul.“Kim has nothing show to his people on the 75th anniversary. Can he say his economy is doing well, his people are being fed well or his government is overcoming the coronavirus?” said Kim Yeol Soo, an analyst with South Korea’s Korea Institute for Military Affairs. “So he will stage a parade to unite his people who are demoralised.” The new weapons systems that North Korea could unveil this weekend could be a new solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile, a missile with multiple warheads, an upgraded submarine-launched ballistic missile or a sophisticated missile launcher, Kim Yeol Soo said.It’s unclear whether Kim would make a public speech during the event at Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square. If he does, there won’t be much for Kim to say other than calling for his people to stay united and resilient in the fight to overcome national hardship.“Kim is trying to manage relations with the United States so that they don’t get worse, but he isn’t in an ideal position to do more than that and issue a new external message toward rivals right now,” said Moon Seong Mook, a retired South Korean army brigadier general who participated in inter-Korean military talks.Moon said North Korea may conduct a mid-range SLBM test around the anniversary as such a missile won’t pose a direct threat to the U.S. homeland. But other experts say North Korea will likely perform major weapons tests after the U.S. presidential election in November to boost its leverage in possible new negotiations with the US, whoever wins the election.“They would think firing a missile now won’t benefit them because they want Trump to be reelected,” Nam said. “But after the election, whether it’s Trump or (Democratic candidate Joe) Biden, they’d want to send a message: ‘Don’t forget me. We need your sincere attention and a summit.’” (AP) PMS PMS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-likely-to-unveil-weapons-at-weekend-military-parade-says-south-korea/story-o5qKYJ1fjLft8pNt8XsjXP.html
08-10-2020||World||Former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin charged in George Floyd’s death freed on $1mn bond||The former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd posted bail Wednesday and was released from jail, leading Minnesota’s governor to activate the National Guard to help keep the peace in the event of protests.According to court documents, Derek Chauvin posted a $1 million bond and was released from the state’s facility in Oak Park Heights, where he had been detained. Hennepin County jail records show he was released shortly before 11:30 a.m.Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd said he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death was captured in widely seen bystander video that set off protests around the world. Chauvin and three other officers were fired. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter; Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.Upon news of Chauvin’s release, Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard to help local law enforcement. Walz said the Guard was mobilizing 100 soldiers and providing equipment and facilities “out of an abundance of caution” in light of public safety concerns. Walz said 100 state troopers and 75 Department of Natural Resources conservation officers were also mobilized to help local authorities.As darkness fell Wednesday evening, hundreds of people took to the streets in south Minneapolis where protests were centered in the days after George Floyd’s death. They marched several blocks and blocked an intersection for a time, with chants including, “No Justice, No Peace — Prosecute the Police.”Floyd family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci released a statement saying Chauvin’s release “is a painful reminder” that the family is far from getting justice.“The system of due process worked for Chauvin and afforded him his freedom while he awaits trial. In contrast, George Floyd was denied due process, when his life was ended over a $20 bill. There was no charge, no arrest, no hearing, no bail. Just execution,” the attorneys wrote.Floyd’s aunt, Angela Harrelson, told FOX-9 that she was still trying to process the news.“It’s something that I’m not happy with. I’m not pleased with it. But I know I have to accept it because this is what the judge allowed to happen. ... I know our family is not happy with this decision,” Harrelson said.It was not immediately clear where Chauvin got the money to pay his bond. In Minnesota, someone who posts bond is required to pay 10%, in this case $100,000, to the bail bond company. Then, the company and the defendant work out an arrangement for collateral to back all or part of the rest of the bond amount, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who is not connected to the case.A message left with the company that posted the bond, Allegheny Casualty Company, was not immediately returned.The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which has a legal defense fund, did not provide any money for bail, a spokeswoman said. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis Police Officers Federation, said his union was not involved.The website GiveSendGo.com, which says it is a free Christian crowdfunding site, has a Derek Chauvin Bail Fund that says it was created by his family. According to the site, as of midday Wednesday that fund raised $4,198 of its $125,000 goal, with donations from more than 35 people. A posting on the site dated Sept. 12 said it took time to set up a fundraising effort due to the high-profile nature of the case.Chauvin had the option of posting bail for $1.25 million without conditions or $1 million with conditions. Under the conditions of his release, he must attend all court appearances, cannot have any direct or indirect contact — including social media contact — with any members of Floyd’s family, cannot work in law enforcement or security, and must not possess any firearms or ammunition.Chauvin’s attorney had no comment Wednesday.Chauvin’s wife, Kellie Chauvin, filed for divorce shortly after Floyd’s death. The records in that case have since been sealed and Kellie Chauvin’s divorce attorney didn’t immediately reply to a message seeking comment.In July, the Chauvins were charged with multiple felony counts of tax evasion for allegedly failing to report income from various jobs, including more than $95,000 from Derek Chauvin’s off-duty security work. The criminal complaints in that case allege that from 2014 through 2019, the Chauvins underreported their joint income by $464,433 and owe the state $37,868 in unpaid taxes, interest and fees.The tax evasion case also listed other assets, including the couple’s second home in Florida and a $100,000 BMW.The Chauvin home in the St. Paul suburb of Oakdale was sold on Aug. 28 for $279,000, which was $26,000 less than the price it was listed at a month after Floyd’s death, according to online real estate records. It was not clear where Chauvin was staying after his release, but one of the conditions of his bail was that he not leave Minnesota without permission.The other three officers charged in Floyd’s death had previously posted bond amounts of $750,000 and have been free pending trial. Currently, all four men are scheduled to face trial together in March, but the judge is weighing a request to have them tried separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-minneapolis-cop-derek-chauvin-charged-in-george-floyd-s-death-freed-on-1mn-bond/story-GxIRbJ3qppxGmt1QGCmm3M.html

He said, “This is for the soul of the world. This is about whether this will be a world that operates in this sense that we’re on a rules-based international order system or one that’s dominated by a coercive totalitarian regime like the one in China.”The Quad members have also reiterated their support to Pompeo. “If you look at the single thing that’s driving all this, it’s a sudden turn toward gross aggression by the Chinese government in its entire periphery,” the senior State Department official said.The development has made the Dragon anxious that the bloc would develop into a “mini-NATO,” but US officials put an emphasis on other forms of cooperation, reported Washington Examiner.Meanwhile, the ministerial revealed a consensus that the Quad should be broadened to include other democratic nations when possible. Such an expansion could change the perception of the Quad as “a military grouping”.“When one talks about security, one’s talking about economic capacity and the rule of law, the ability to protect intellectual property, trade agreements, and diplomatic relationships. It’s not just military. ... It’s the kind of power that democracies have that authoritarian regime can never deliver on,” told Pompeo.The initiative will put an end to the economic coercion tactics of China and cooperation with Japan and other allies will checkmate Chinese development assistance and its hegemony in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-denounces-china-s-exploitation-corruption-coercion-of-neighboring-countries/story-0PUV5n9SArnlZ4umliygSM.html
08-10-2020||World||Europe battles to contain Covid-19 as cases spike in Spain, France||France, Spain and the Czech Republic posted record increases in coronavirus cases, underscoring growing alarm in Europe as it struggles to control the pandemic.Politicians at the national level are leaning on local authorities to take the lead in limiting late-night activity in cities and towns, as they fear the economic impact of more wide-ranging measures. That’s led to more severe restrictions in several European cities.In France, President Emmanuel Macron’s government ordered bars in Paris to close for a two-week period and said more curbs will be announced on Thursday. The Czech Republic is considering additional steps to prevent the disease from spreading.“There must be more restrictions such as the ones put in place” in the region of Marseille, where bars and restaurants were shut, Macron said in a TF1 interview.Daily infections in France increased by 18,746, health authorities said on Wednesday, bringing the seven-day rolling average to the highest level yet. Spain reported a record 5,075 new cases, while infections in Germany in the past 24 hours exceeded 4,000 for the first time since early April.France’s health minister will announce measures on Thursday that will focus on places where the virus is circulating faster among elderly people and where hospitals are the fullest, Macron said. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care in Paris hospitals has tripled since the start of September, similar to the situation in the Marseille region.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicLike Paris, Berlin is fighting against a surge in infections and will close bars at 11 p.m., starting on Saturday.The German capital has the worst outbreak among the country’s 16 states, with 40.5 cases per 100,000 people over the last seven days, according to the public health authority. The city’s residents would be restricted from domestic travel if the figure rises above 50 -- some districts already exceed this threshold.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government and state leaders reaffirmed the rules during a conference call on Wednesday.Coronavirus infections across the whole of Germany climbed by 4,010 in the 24 hours through Thursday morning, the highest since April 10, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That brought the total to 311,137.Also Read: UK considering more local curbs as Covid-19 spreads, says ministerNew EpicenterAcross the border from Europe’s largest economy, the Czech Republic on Thursday posted a record 5,335 new cases for the previous day. The country’s 14-day cumulative number of cases per capita is now the highest in the EU, surpassing Spain.The government will announce “more significant” measures to stem the outbreak at the end of the week, Health Minister Roman Prymula said Wednesday, reaffirming a pledge not to impose another full-scale nationwide lockdown.The virus’s resurgence in Italy -- where numbers have been more contained than in some neighboring countries -- twice prevented parliamentary votes earlier this week on new measures to combat the pandemic, as a number of lawmakers were in quarantine.A cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte extended emergency powers to counter the pandemic to Jan. 31. The government again made wearing face masks outdoors compulsory nationwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-battles-to-contain-covid-19-as-cases-spike-in-spain-france/story-eapM2FCD07uvI0TznuAoJP.html

Sajjan, who appeared from Ottawa via video link, also accused China of indulging in “hostage diplomacy” by taking two Canadians, including a former diplomat, into detention in retaliation for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, in Vancouver in 2018.“This type of hostage diplomacy is not what good rules-based-order nations do. So, if you want to be part of the global rules-based order, we need to have greater predictability,” Sajjan said, as per the agency Canadian Press.Sajjan also said that such actions raised questions about China’s “true ambitions”, during the discussion hosted by the Slovakian think tank GLOBSEC. “These are some of the things that we will continue to monitor, and we need to monitor in NATO,” he said, adding, “This is not just about being reactionary to a problem. It’s about making sure any nation out there sees the collective will of what NATO brings to the table, and that’s the strong message of defence and deterrence.”These remarks came as relations between Canada and China continue to deteriorate. It started after Wanzhou was detained in a case related to bank fraud that could see her being extradited to the US. That resulted in a sharp response from Beijing, including the arrest of the two Canadians and the sentencing of others to death. Canada has abandoned the possibility of a free trade deal with China as ties have worsened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-defence-minister-urges-nato-to-monitor-china-s-activities/story-0r2dgHQnchRTNFaBKa4emL.html
08-10-2020||World||Hurricane Delta lashes Mexico, heads towards United States||Hurricane Delta regained strength as it headed towards the United States early Thursday after lashing Mexico’s Caribbean coast, where some tourists complained about conditions in crowded emergency shelters during a pandemic.There were widespread power outages after Delta slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula in southeast Mexico as a Category 2 storm, toppling trees and ripping down power lines.The region appeared to have escaped major destruction and there were no reports of deaths as the storm headed out into the Gulf of Mexico where it weakened to Category 1 as it churned towards the US Gulf Coast, before regaining its Category 2 status.In an update at 0600 GMT Thursday, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Delta was packing maximum sustained winds of 100 miles (155 kilometers) per hour and moving at about 17 mph (28 kph) about 485 miles (780 kms) off the coast of Louisiana.Earlier strong winds whipped Cancun, one of Mexico’s most popular tourist destinations, where cars were hit by falling trees, street signs were blown over and stores were damaged, according to AFP reporters.‘Not safe’Thousands of tourists hunkered down in emergency shelters along the Riviera Maya coastline as the storm blew through, prompting concerns about the risk of exposure to the coronavirus.“They took us into an abandoned building, no heat, no air conditioning, no fans, no kind of ventilation at all,” said 42-year-old American tourist Nick Fifis.“The staff are trying to help everybody, but there’s a mess. No masks, no social distancing. It’s just not safe,” he said.Mandy Sears, however, said she was just glad to be out of danger from the storm.“Were we comfortable? No, but we were safe. Our experience has not been excellent, it has been miserable. But this is a catastrophe. We knew we were coming during hurricane season,” said the 47-year-old from the United States.Delta was downgraded from an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 as it neared the peninsula, but is expected to become a major hurricane again as it moves over the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC said.On Friday the storm is expected to approach the northern Gulf Coast of the United States, where a hurricane watch has been issued for an area from High Island, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana, it said.A “life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds” are increasingly likely along parts of the northern Gulf Coast, it added.Soldiers deployedAt least 6,500 soldiers were deployed across the region to help affected communities, authorities reported.Troops were seen removing tree branches and other debris, while residents used machetes to clear roads.More than 40,000 mostly Mexican tourists in Cancun and neighboring resorts were evacuated as the hurricane approached, the head of the area’s hotel association, Roberto Citron, told AFP.In Cancun alone, more than 160 shelters were set up.The authorities said the emergency shelters had been sanitized and masks were being used to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 81,000 people in Mexico and led to a sharp drop in visitor numbers.But some tourists said that was not the case.“Nobody is wearing masks, (everyone is) laying on floors, there’s no air conditioning, no fans, there’s no circulation of air,” said Janet, a 67-year-old from the United States who declined to give her last name.Delta is the 26th named storm of an unusually active Atlantic hurricane season.Over the weekend, six people died and thousands were forced from their homes as Tropical Storm Gamma triggered floods and landslides in southeastern Mexico.In September, meteorologists were forced to break out the Greek alphabet to name Atlantic storms for only the second time ever, after the 2020 hurricane season blew through their usual list, ending on Tropical Storm Wilfred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-delta-lashes-mexico-heads-towards-united-states/story-kncjmJpMEfQm1k5IAogD3H.html
08-10-2020||World||Nobel Literature prize to be awarded after years of tumult||The Nobel Prize for Literature is set to be awarded Thursday after several years of controversy and scandal for the world’s pre-eminent literary accolade.In 2018 the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, the secretive body that chooses the winners, and sparked a mass exodus of members.After the academy revamped itself in a bid to regain the trust of the Nobel Foundation, two laureates were named last year, with the 2018 prize going to Poland’s Olga Tokarczuk and the 2019 award to Austria’s Peter Handke.Handke’s prize caused a storm of protest: a strong supporter of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkan wars, he has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes. Several countries including Albania, Bosnia and Turkey boycotted the Nobel awards ceremony in protest, and a member of the committee that nominates candidates for the literature prize resigned.This year the academy is likely to seek a more harmonious choice for the 10 million kronor (more than $1.1 million) prize.Authors often mentioned as contenders include Kenya’s Ngugi Wa Thiong’o, Canadian poet Anne Carson and Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami.British bookmakers Ladbrokes have ranked Carson as the 5-1 favorite, followed by Russian novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Canadian author Margaret Atwood and Guadeloupe-born writer Maryse Conde.On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. Tuesday’s prize for physics honored breakthroughs in understanding the mysteries of cosmic black holes, and the chemistry prize on Wednesday went to scientists behind a powerful gene-editing tool.Still to come are prizes are for outstanding work in the fields of peace and economics.___Read more stories about Nobel Prizes past and present by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/NobelPrizes||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-literature-prize-to-be-awarded-after-years-of-tumult/story-0pJl5QhT05LYv5ByQ1b3oJ.html

08-10-2020||World||India among targets of shadowy cyber espionage group uncovered by Canada-based Blackberry||A group behind a sophisticated hackers-for-hire operation that has been targeting India among other South Asian countries, as well as some West Asian nations, has been uncovered by the Canadian cyber security company Blackberry.Blackberry, based in Waterloo in Ontario province and once famous for its smartphones, published a 92-page report in which it dubbed the unnamed cyber espionage group “BAHAMUT: Hack-for-Hire Masters of Phishing, Fake News and Fake Apps”. BlackBerry’s research and intelligence team linked the “cyber espionage threat group to a staggering number of ongoing attacks against government officials and industry titans, while also unveiling the group’s vast network of disinformation assets aimed at furthering particular political causes and hampering NGOs”, according to a statement from the company that accompanied the report.The shadowy group ran fake news websites and harmful smartphone apps, according to Blackberry. “The sophistication and sheer scope of malicious activity that our team was able to link to BAHAMUT is staggering,” said Eric Milam, vice-president, research operations at BlackBerry.Blackberry said in its report, what “emerged from the past research was clustered targeting around two primary areas: South Asia (particularly India and Pakistan), and the Middle East (particularly the UAE and Qatar)”.Some of the activities of the group may have been aimed at bringing down the digital presence of separatist groups such as Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), and those engaged in terror activities in Kashmir, such as Jamaat-ul-Islami and Jaish-e-Mohammad.In its South Asia operations, Blackberry said, the “phishing targets are focused on individuals of greater importance in private industry, in contrast to the heavy government-themed phishing in the Gulf”. It added that it did “not find any Indian government agencies or individuals among its current target sets”.According to a Reuters report based on Blackberry’s findings, Reliance was among the Indian companies targeted, as the group attempted to compromise an employee there “around the time that the company was negotiating the sale of a stake in its oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco”. Reuters said Apple and Google removed several of the apps mentioned in the report. Among them was one called Doctor Health, which was first released in India and accessed location information and health data, and a password app that not only saved credentials for accessing email but could also hack into accounts.Gurpatwant Pannun, legal counsel for the SFJ, one of the targets of the shadowy group, said, “We have been the subject of cyber attacks, on an individual as well as group level, since the July 4 launch of Referendum Voter Registration for people living in Punjab.”Blackberry said the “range of tools, tactics and targets suggest the group is well-funded, well-resourced and well-versed in security research”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-among-targets-of-shadowy-cyber-espionage-group-uncovered-by-canada-based-blackberry/story-OciycN7fo3UbiZDoNWM9PM.html
08-10-2020||World||Alvin Cole killing: No charges for Wisconsin police officer||A Black Wisconsin police officer who fatally shot a Black teenager outside a suburban Milwaukee mall in February won’t be charged because he had reasonable belief that deadly force was necessary, a prosecutor said Wednesday.Wauwatosa Officer Joseph Mensah shot 17-year-old Alvin Cole outside Mayfair Mall on Feb. 2 after police responded to a reported disturbance at the shopping center.Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, in a 14-page letter laying out his rationale, said evidence showed Cole fled from police carrying a stolen 9 mm handgun. He cited squad car audio evidence, along with testimony from Mensah and two fellow officers, that he said showed Cole had fired a shot while fleeing and refused commands to drop the gun.“He did not surrender the weapon and was fired upon by Officer Mensah causing his death,” Chisholm wrote. He concluded: “(T)here is sufficient evidence that Officer Mensah had an actual subjective belief that deadly force was necessary and that belief was objectively reasonable.”Cole was the third person Mensah has fatally shot since becoming an officer, and his death has sparked periodic protests in Wauwatosa and the Milwaukee area. Gov. Tony Evers announced earlier Wednesday that he had activated National Guard members as a precaution, though he didn’t say how many or how they were being used. Guard spokesman Maj. Joe Trovato later said “hundreds” of troops were at the ready.The city of Wauwatosa issued a nightly 7 p.m. curfew after Chisholm’s decision was announced, to run until next Monday. Late Wednesday evening and well past the curfew, a group of a few hundred protesters marching in the city confronted a police line. Police tweeted that some in the group were throwing rocks at law enforcement and buildings and that they used “gas” to disperse the protesters. Footage posted on social media showed the gas and the crowd retreating.Scores of people surrounded the Milwaukee County Public Safety Building as Cole’s attorney and family members met with Chisholm, some chanting, “Say his name! Alvin Cole!” and “Justice! When do we want it? Now!”Chisholm’s report noted that Cole’s gun had a spent round in the chamber — the one that investigators believe he fired while running, possibly striking himself in the arm — and that the magazine was recovered in his sling bag, meaning the gun had no more bullets in it when he was shot. Mensah and two other officers at the scene said Cole pointed the gun at them.Cole’s sister, Taleavia Cole, insisted the shooting wasn’t justified because her brother could not have fired at Mensah. She said he should not be allowed to continue working as an officer.“The fight continues. It doesn’t end here,” said his sister, Taleavia Cole. ”... It’s time for DA Chisholm to retire or step down.Chisholm also said that he didn’t believe the state had enough evidence to disprove that Mensah was defending himself or others, so he couldn’t meet the burden required to bring charges. Kimberley Motley, a family attorney for the Coles, seized on Chisholm’s wording.“Chisholm did not say that the shooting was justified,” Motley said. “And that’s really important.”Motley, who also represents the families of the two other people killed by Mensah, said if he had been fired earlier then Cole would still be alive.“We are not done fighting,” she said. “We are still going to fight for a conviction of Officer Joseph Mensah.”Chisholm told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview that he understood some people would be angry or disappointed by his decision, but he said he wouldn’t change his “objective review” because of it. He said that although Mensah had been cleared in all three of his shootings, Chisholm was concerned about his involvement in so many.“This creates an incredible dilemma for the city of Wauwatosa and the Wauwatosa Police Department and the community,” he told the newspaper. “I’ve never been cavalier about that.”… What is unique about this case is that it just creates such a liability for (shooting) number four. Everybody recognizes that.”The Wauwatosa Police and Fire Commission suspended Mensah with pay in July, and he has appealed that suspension. The commission hired former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic to investigate the case with an eye toward what discipline Mensah might face. In a report released earlier Wednesday, Biskupic recommended that Mensah be fired, saying the risk he might shoot a fourth person is too great.Biskupic also wrote that Mensah violated department policy when he spoke to the media about the shooting in July.An attorney for Mensah didn’t respond to a phone message from The Associated Press.There’s no body-camera video of the Cole shooting because Wauwatosa’s officers aren’t equipped with them. The city did release squad car dashcam video that shed little light on what happened.Cole’s death sparked protests in Wauwatosa throughout the summer, including in and around the mall and outside a house where Mensah was staying. Two men were charged in an August altercation at the house after a shotgun was fired.Mensah was not charged in the 2016 death of Jay Anderson Jr. or the 2015 death of Antonio Gonzales. Police have said Mensah shot Gonzales eight times after he refused to drop a sword. In Anderson’s case, Mensah approached a parked car where Anderson was sleeping and said he saw a gun and thought Anderson was reaching for it, so he shot him six times.Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Webber said in a recorded message that his department “concurs’ with the decision but “hears the message” from the public. He said the department has taken steps to improve policing, such as providing added training, posting department police and procedures online and requiring body cameras for all officers by January.Evers also activated the state’s National Guard in August, the morning after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back. The shooting sparked three days of protests over police actions and racism, and caused an estimated $50 million in damage to roughly 100 downtown businesses. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also activated Guard members after George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis set off protests and damaging riots and arson in that state.In anticipation of protests after the announcement of the charging decision, Wauwatosa officials shut down City Hall and the library for about three days, beginning at noon Wednesday. News of the decision comes after high-profile deaths of Black people during interactions with police sparked protests that spread around the world over the summer and led to a national reckoning on race in America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alvin-cole-killing-no-charges-for-wisconsin-police-officer/story-EDUmDRignfnSbPaAdnA7AK.html
08-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: A fact check as Pence echoes Trump misfires in vice presidential debate||Although more buttoned-up on the stage than his boss, Vice President Mike Pence nevertheless echoed many of President Donald Trump’s falsehoods Wednesday in the one and only debate with Democratic rival Kamala Harris.Pence muddied the reality on the pandemic, asserted Trump respects the science on climate change when actually the president mocks it, overstated the threat of voting fraud and misrepresented the Russia investigation in the Salt Lake City debate.Harris got tangled in tax policy at one point and misleadingly suggested that Trump branded the coronavirus a hoax.Altogether, the debate wasn’t the madhouse matchup of Trump vs. Joe Biden last week. But there were plenty of distortions. A sampling:ECONOMYPENCE: “Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China, that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers.”THE FACTS: The tariffs were not the win claimed by Pence.For starters, tariffs are taxes that consumers and businesses pay through higher prices. So Pence is defending tax increases. The tariffs against China did cause the trade deficit in goods with China to fall in 2019. But that’s a pyrrhic victory at best as overall U.S. economic growth slowed from 3% to 2.2% because of the trade uncertainty.More important, the Trump administration has not decreased the overall trade imbalance. For all trading partners, the Census Bureau said the trade deficit was $576.9 billion last year, nearly $100 billion higher than during the last year of Barack Obama’s presidency.___HARRIS, on Trump’s tax cuts: “On Day 1, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill.”THE FACTS: No, that’s not what Biden proposes. He would repeal some of it. Nor can he repeal a law on his own, much less on his first day in office. Harris also said Biden will not raise taxes on people making under $400,000. If he were to repeal the Trump tax cuts across the board, he would be breaking that promise.___CORONAVIRUSPENCE, on the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event after which more than 11 attendees tested positive for COVID-19: “It was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise.”THE FACTS: His suggestion that the event followed public-health safety recommendations is false. The event, introducing Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, drew more than 150 people and flouted safety recommendations in multiple ways. And it was not all outside.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says large gatherings of people who have traveled from outside the area and aren’t spaced at least 6 feet apart pose the greatest risk for spreading the virus.That’s exactly the type of high-risk event the White House hosted.Guests were seated close together, not 6 feet apart, in rows of chairs outside. Many were captured on camera clapping backs, shaking hands and talking, barely at arm’s length.The CDC also “strongly encourages” people to wear masks, but few in the Rose Garden wore them. There was also a private reception inside the White House following the Rose Garden ceremony, where some politicians, including North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who has since tested positive, were pictured not wearing masks.___HARRIS on the virus: “The president said it was a hoax.”THE FACTS: That’s misleading.She’s referring to a Feb. 28 campaign rally in South Carolina in which Trump said the phrases “the coronavirus” and “this is their new hoax” at separate points. Although his meaning is difficult to discern, the broader context of his words shows he was railing against Democrats for their denunciations of his administration’s coronavirus response.“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,” he said at the rally. “You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it.” He meandered briefly to the subject of the messy Democratic primary in Iowa, then the Russia investigation before returning to the pandemic. “They tried the impeachment hoax. ... And this is their new hoax.”Asked at a news conference the day after the rally to clarify his remarks, Trump said he was not referring to the coronavirus itself as a hoax.“No, no, no.” he said. ”‘Hoax’ referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not — I’m not talking about what’s happening here. I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax.”___ENVIRONMENTPENCE: “The both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking … President Trump has made clear we’re going to continue to listen to the science” on climate change.THE FACTS: Pence is correct when he says Harris supported banning fracking, incorrect when he says Biden does, and false when he says Trump follows the science on climate change.At a CNN climate change town hall for Democratic presidential candidates last year, Harris said, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking. Starting with what we can do from Day One on public lands.” Now, as Biden’s running mate, she is bound to his agenda, which is different.Biden has an ambitious climate plan that seeks to rapidly reduce use of fossil fuels. He says he does not support banning hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, however, and says he doubts such a ban is possible.As far as Trump and climate change, Trump’s public comments as president all dismiss the science on climate change — that it’s caused by people burning fossil fuels, and it’s worsening sharply. As recently as last month, Trump said, “I don’t think science knows” what it’s talking about regarding global warming and the resulting worsening of wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. He’s ridiculed the science in many public comments and tweets.His regulation-cutting has eliminated key Obama-era efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions.___HEALTH CAREPENCE: “President Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and to protect preexisting conditions for all Americans.”THE FACTS: No, there is no clear plan. People with preexisting conditions are already protected by the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, and if the Trump administration succeeds in persuading the Supreme Court to overturn it, those protections will be jeopardy.Trump has signed an executive order declaring it the policy of the U.S. government to protect people with preexisting conditions, but Trump would have to go back to Congress to work out legislation to replace those in “Obamacare.”Various Republican approaches offered in 2017 would have undermined the protections in the ACA, and Trump has not offered details of how his plan would work. Although Trump has been in office nearly four years, he has yet to roll out the comprehensive health proposal he once promised.___MORE ON THE VIRUSPENCE: “He suspended all travel from China, the second-largest economy in the world. Joe Biden opposed that decision, he said it was xenophobic and hysterical.”THE FACTS: Trump’s order did not suspend “all travel from China.” He restricted it, and Biden never branded the decision “xenophobic.” Dozens of countries took similar steps to control travel from hot spots before or around the same time the U.S. did.The U.S. restrictions that took effect Feb. 2 continued to allow travel to the U.S. from China’s Hong Kong and Macao territories for months. The Associated Press reported that more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals based in those territories entered the U.S. in the first three months after the travel restrictions were imposed.Additionally, more than 27,000 Americans returned from mainland China in the first month after the restrictions took effect. U.S. officials lost track of more than 1,600 of them who were supposed to be monitored for virus exposure.Biden has accused Trump of having a record of xenophobia but not explicitly in the context of the president’s decision to limit travel from China during the pandemic. Trump took to calling the virus the “China virus” and the “foreign virus” at one point, prompting Biden to urge the country not to take a turn toward xenophobia or racism in the pandemic.___HARRIS, on the effects of the pandemic: “One in five businesses, closed.”THE FACTS: That’s not accurate, as of now. We don’t know yet how many businesses have permanently closed — or could do so in the months ahead.What we do know is that the National Federation of Independent Business said in August that 1 in 5 small businesses will close if economic conditions don’t improve in the next six months.Many small businesses survived in part through the forgivable loans from the Payroll Protection Program. Larger employers such as Disney and Allstate insurance have announced layoffs, as have major airlines. Restaurants that survived the pandemic with outdoor eating will soon face the challenge of cold weather. So it’s too soon to tell how many businesses have closed or will.___RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONPENCE, on the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation: “It was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion. Case closed. And then Senator Harris you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call.”THE FACTS: That’s a mischaracterization of Mueller’s nearly 450-page report and its core findings.Mueller did not absolve the president of obstructing the investigation into ties between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. Instead, his team examined roughly a dozen episodes in which the president sought to exert his will on the probe, including by firing his FBI director and seeking the ouster of Mueller himself. Ultimately, Mueller declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had committed a crime, citing Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president. But that’s different than finding “no obstruction.”Mueller also didn’t quite find “no collusion.” His investigation identified multiple contacts between Russians and Trump associates and outlined sweeping Russian interference that he said the Trump campaign welcomed and expected to benefit from. Mueller said that he did not have enough to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia; collusion is not a precise legal term.___VOTINGPENCE: “President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting that will create a massive opportunity for voter fraud.”THE FACTS: Pence is vastly overstating the potential for fraud with mail-in ballots, just as Trump frequently does.Broadly speaking, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. A 2017 report from the Brennan Center for Justice ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections. A panel commissioned by the Trump administration to explore the issue uncovered no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud.Trump and his allies have tried to argue that absentee balloting is fine — when someone has to request a ballot as opposed to automatically getting one in the mail — while universal mail-in balloting is open to fraud because all the state’s registered voters receive a ballot through the mail. It’s true that some election studies have shown a slightly higher incidence of mail-in voting fraud compared with in-person voting, but the overall risk is extremely low.There is ongoing litigation in several states over a host of election issues, including absentee ballots. States nationwide expect a surge in mail-in voting due to the ongoing risk posed by the coronavirus.Five states routinely send ballots to all registered voters, allowing them to choose to vote through the mail or in person. In November, four other states — California, New Jersey, Nevada and Vermont — and the District of Columbia will be adopting that system, as will almost every county in Montana.___Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Colleen Long, Amanda Seitz, Michael Balsamo and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.___EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.___Find AP Fact Checks at http://apnews.com/APFactCheckFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-a-fact-check-as-pence-echoes-trump-misfires-in-vice-presidential-debate/story-ETSJfpoyKuqjOwdklKIgaK.html

08-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Fly on Pence’s head generates buzz in vice presidential debate||The vice presidential debate featured plexiglass barriers to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They were no match for the night’s most talked-about intruder — a fly that briefly buzzed around the stage before landing and staying on Mike Pence’s head.The incident went unmentioned onstage, with the Republican vice president and Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris continuing to focus on the discussion of systemic racism in the justice system.But as the insect took up residence on Pence’s white hair, the social media firestorm was immediate — and intense. It easily created more, well, buzz than nearly anything else that occurred.“That’s not on your TV. It’s on his head,” tweeted MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. “The fly knows,” tweeted author Stephen King. Others joked about the creature perhaps getting stuck in hair spray — or possibly now being a prime candidate for coronavirus testing.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden immediately got in on the act, tweeting a photo of himself clutching an orange flyswatter under the heading “Pitch in $5 to help this campaign fly.” Moments later, he tweeted again, this time highlighting “Flywillvote.com,” which took users to a website set up for his campaign to help supporters make plans to vote.Pence had spent much of the night shaking his head in response to Harris’ answers. But the vice president didn’t appear to notice the fly’s arrival. Despite his talking and normal body movements, the hot stage lights and those virus-fighting barriers, the fly was unperturbed. It finally flew away on its own.Wednesday night’s visitor wasn’t the first fly to take center stage at a presidential debate. In 2016, one briefly landed between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s eyes during a town hall-style debate with now-President Donald Trump. Clinton didn’t flinch.President Barack Obama, however, took action when confronted with an airborne distraction during the taping of a television interview in 2009. Obama stopped speaking to swat at a buzzing fly and tell it to “get out of here.” As interviewer John Harwood quipped, “That’s the most persistent fly I’ve ever seen,” Obama concentrated on its path and swatted it dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-fly-on-pence-s-head-generates-buzz-in-vice-presidential-debate/story-YjvCPULupjACyNeRy7CzSO.html
08-10-2020||World||Nobel for the creators of genetic scissors||Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for developing “molecular scissors” to edit genes, offering the promise of one day curing a host of inherited diseases.Working on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Frenchwoman Emmanuelle Charpentier and American Jennifer A. Doudna developed a method known as CRISPR-cas9 that can be used to alter the DNA of animals, plants and microorganisms.The award marked only the fourth time in the 119-year history of the prizes that a Nobel in the sciences was given exclusively to women.Charpentier and Doudna’s work allows for laser-sharp snips in the long strings of DNA that make up the code of life, enabling scientists to precisely edit specific genes to remove errors that lead to diseases.Dr. Francis Collins, who led the drive to map the human genome, said the technology “has changed everything” about how to approach diseases with a genetic cause. “You can draw a direct line from the success of the human genome project to the power of CRISPR-cas to make changes in the instruction book,” said Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which helped fund Doudna’s work.But many also cautioned that the technology raises serious ethical questions and must be used carefully.Much of the world became more aware of CRISPR in 2018, when Chinese scientist He Jiankui revealed he had helped make the world’s first gene-edited babies, to try to engineer resistance to infection with the AIDS virus. In September, an international panel of experts said it is still too soon to try to make genetically edited babies because the science isn’t advanced enough to ensure safety.“Being able to selectively edit genes means that you are playing God in a way,” said American Chemistry Society President Luis Echegoyen, a chemistry professor at the University of Texas El Paso.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-for-the-creators-of-genetic-scissors/story-QFkRKehqTrSl2Nzp5j2Y0J.html
08-10-2020||World||Pandemic effect: India’s economy set to contract 9.6%, says World Bank||The World Bank on Wednesday said the Indian economy was projected to contract by 9.6% in fiscal year 2020-21 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it was in a far graver situation than it was during the balance of payment crisis of the 1980s leading up to 1991.South Asia as a region is set to plunge into its worst ever recession with a sharper than expected contraction of 7.7%, the World Bank said in its half-yearly South Asia Focus update released on Thursday.“The situation is much worse in India than we have ever seen before,” Hans Timmer, World Bank’s chief economist for the South Asia region, told reporters. He added that it was “much worse” than the balance of payment crisis, which had marked a record low for India and the region.India was forced to pledge parts of its gold reserves in 1991 - physically shipped to the Bank of England and Bank of Japan - to secure a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to avoid defaulting on overseas payment obligations. The year 1991 also marked the start of economic reforms.Timmer said one reason why India was hit hard was the “lockdown that was imposed initially (that) was very strict”. It was reflected in the quarterly growth of -25%, he added.Akhil Berry of Eurasia Group, a global consultancy, said, “The estimated contraction is shocking but is in line with other projections, given that India imposed one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns and the caseload in major economic centres such as Mumbai and Delhi are still high.”Fitch has projected India’s economy will contract by -10.5%, Goldman predicts a contraction of -14.8% and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at -9%.The World Bank said Covid-19 caught India as its economy was already slowing down and it was weakened by financial sector problems, and commended the Modi government’s “swift and comprehensive” response: a strict lockdown, complemented by social protection measures for the poor and support for businesses.“Nonetheless, there was a massive contraction in output and poor and vulnerable households experienced significant social hardship - specifically urban migrants and workers in the informal economy,” the report said. It added, “Overall, the pandemic has likely raised urban poverty, creating a set of ‘new poor’ characterised by non-farm employment and secondary or tertiary education.”The bank has projected growth will rebound to 5.4% in the financial year 2021-22. But Timmer said what has been made clear by this crisis is that India “has to rethink federal policies, especially the policies related to the informal sector… there are no systems in place to support those people”.While the poor suffered due to rising food prices, Covid-19 delivered “a further blow to many informal workers” who experienced a sharp drop in earnings and didn’t have social insurance or savings to fall back on, the report said, urging governments in the South Asia region to “design universal social protection as well as policies that support greater productivity, skills development, and human capital”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-effect-india-s-economy-set-to-contract-9-6-says-world-bank/story-8NLwyerMKzoxqbxebvDRXJ.html
08-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Catching Covid-19 was ‘blessing from God,’ says Donald Trump||U.S. President Donald Trump declared that catching the coronavirus was a “blessing from God” that exposed him to experimental treatments he vowed would become free for all Americans, in a video address released on Wednesday.Trump, eager to revitalize his ailing re-election campaign two days after his release from Walter Reed military hospital, repeatedly stressed how well he felt so far in his recovery from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

08-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Five takeaways from the only vice presidential debate||Wednesday night’s matchup between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Senator Kamala Harris opened without the fireworks that marred last week’s chaotic debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.But Trump’s Covid-19 infection, and his and Biden’s advanced age, makes this perhaps the most consequential U.S. vice presidential debate in living memory. Here are a few things to watch:COLORING INSIDE THE LINESFollowing last week’s chaotic, insult-laden debate between Biden and Trump, moderator Susan Page warned both candidates that she would strictly enforce rules designed to ensure decorum. “We want a debate that is lively. But Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil,” she said. Both candidates were on their best behavior at the outset and wrapped up their statements when warned by Page.“Senator Harris, it’s a privilege to be on the stage with you,” Pence said - after Harris said that the Trump administration’s coronavirus response was “the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.”DINGING BIDEN ON PLAGARISMCandidates typically show up with a quiver of prepared one-liners, and Pence loosed one early. He accused Biden of copying the Trump administration’s plan to fight the coronavirus, dredging up charges of plagiarism that helped sink Biden’s first presidential run in 1988.“It looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about,” he said.OUTSIZED IMPORTANCEIn 2008, when he was Barack Obama’s running mate, Biden said that “no one decides who they’re going to vote for based on the vice president.” Yet this debate has outsized importance. Biden, 77, would be the oldest president in U.S. history if he were to win the election, and he has hinted he might only serve one term.Trump, only slightly younger at 74, spent the weekend at a military hospital outside Washington after contracting the novel coronavirus.From purely an actuarial standpoint, Pence, 61, and Harris, 55, would be more likely to step into the presidency than other vice presidential candidates. That is sure to be a major subtext on Wednesday night. Pence also carries an additional burden as he has been tasked with campaigning for the ticket as Trump has been sidelined because of his COVID-19 infection. BARRIERS AND MASKSEager for every advantage, campaigns often battle over everything from the format of the debate to the height of the podiums.This time around, they have been at odds over coronavirus protections. The Salt Lake City debate stage will feature a Plexiglas barrier between the two candidates, which was installed over the objections of Pence’s aides. They also will stand more than 12 feet (3.6 m) apart on stage.Debate organizers handed out salmon-colored masks to all debate attendees and cordoned off alternative rows in the theater where the debate will be held to promote social distancing.It will be a potent reminder that opinion polls show the coronavirus is the most important issue for voters, outstripping traditional concerns like the economy and national security. Pence has headed the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force as the pandemic has killed more than 210,000 Americans and shut down wide swaths of the economy.Members of Trump’s entourage refused to wear masks at last week’s debate in Cleveland, just two days before he and his wife, Melania, tested positive. The Commission on Presidential Debates has said anyone who does not wear a mask will be “escorted out.”GUEST LISTAlong with the usual campaign insiders and VIPs, both candidates have invited a handful of guests as a symbol of their priorities.Pence has invited the parents of Kayla Mueller, who U.S. authorities say was tortured and sexually abused by Islamic State militants before being killed in 2014. The Justice Department said on Wednesday that two suspects in her death had arrived in the United States to face trial.Carl and Marsha Mueller have said Obama’s administration should have done more to rescue her and spoke in support of Trump at the Republican nomination in August.Pence also invited business owner Flora Westbrooks, whose hair studio was destroyed in riots in Minneapolis following the police killing of Black man George Floyd, and Ann Dorn, the widow of a retired police officer who was killed during protests in St. Louis.Harris has invited Utah Democratic state Representative Angela Romero and Deborah Gatrell, a candidate for Salt Lake City Council and former military helicopter pilot who currently works as a teacher. The campaign said in a press release that “they both showcase the resolve hard-working Americans have shown as Donald Trump has failed to control the virus and save the economy.” (Reporting by Andy Sullivan; Additional reporting by Michael Martina in Salt Lake City; Editing by Scott Malone and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-five-takeaways-from-the-only-vice-presidential-debate/story-UzgI8QGLRzOexrFyYhOqML.html
08-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: If Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I’m not taking vaccine, says Kamala Harris||United States Vice president Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris kicked off their first and only debate on Wednesday night in Salt Lake city, Utah — in what also marked the debut of an Indian origin person on the podium for the vice presidential debate. The debate was moderated by USA Today’s Susan Page who said the format of the debate will include nine segments of 10 minutes in length, with time for questions to each candidate. Discussion over the ongoing pandemic and an effective vaccine against Covid-19 dominated a large part of the debate. “If the public health professionals, if Dr Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I will be the first in line to take it, absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I’m not taking it,” Kamala Harris said in distain as the topic of vaccine came up. “That fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine, if a vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable,” Mike Pence retorted.Here are the top quotes from Kamala Harris’ first vice presidential debate1. The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. Whatever the vice president is claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn’t worked, when you’re looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country.Watch l ‘Not if Trump asks me to..’: Kamala Harris’ jibe over Covid vaccine l US VP debate 2. They knew what was happening (Coronavirus) and they didn’t tell you. They knew, and they covered it up. They said they didn’t tell you because the President wanted Americans to be calm. Now tell me, how calm you were when your children were sent back home.3. We believe in transparency in disclosing both health and tax details. It will be good to know whom President Donald Trump owes money. Americans should know what is influencing his decisions. 4. Joe and I share a purpose of lifting up the American people. We were brought up by same values. It was best day in my life when I got a call from him. 5. Joe Biden believes the health of economy should be measured by the health of the American workers. But Donald Trump believed the economy should be measured by how rich people are. Joe will invest in innovation, education, clean energy, infrastructure. He believes in investing into the people of America. 6. Joe Biden will never raise the taxes. He has been very clear about that. Biden was responsible to bring America back from Recession. 7. If the public health professionals, if Dr Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I will be the first in line to take it, absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I’m not taking it8. Donald Trump betrayed friendships and embraced the dictators of the world. Take for example, Russia. 9. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition we built around our campaign. Seven members of George W Bush’s cabinet are supporting our campaign. They are doing that because they know Joe Biden is fighting for integrity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-if-donald-trump-tells-us-we-should-take-it-i-m-not-taking-vaccine-says-kamala-harris/story-w9gNaeMpNThk3xMSa12z2M.html

Both measures are aimed at preventing this programme from being used to displace Americans.The White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump wanted to improve work visa programmes to “prioritise the highest-skilled workers and protect American jobs and wages” and intended H-1B visas to “be reserved for specialised talent that helps support a strong economy”. Indian professionals are the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 issued every year.“These regulations seem to be based on misinformation about the programme and runs counterproductive to their very objective of saving the American economy and jobs,” said Nasscom, a trade body of India IT businesses. The changes will be introduced as “interim final rules” and will go into effect separately, issued by separate federal agencies. The rule on higher wages goes into effect from Thursday. It will be aimed at “strengthening wage protections, addressing abuses in these visa programs, and ensuring American workers are not undercut by cheaper foreign labour”, said secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia. US employers hiring foreign workers on H-1B and other work visas will be required to pay foreign workers prevailing wages or the actual wage paid to other employees with similar experience and qualifications. “The prevailing wage rates in these programs thus play an integral role in protecting US workers from unfair competition posed by the entry of lower cost foreign labour into the US labour market,” said the department. Critics have long argued it has been used to displace American workers. The Department of Homeland Security’s IFR changing the definition of “speciality occupation” is expected to become effective in 60 days. The department said its interim rule will narrow the definition of specialty occupation by “closing the overbroad definition that allowed companies to game the system”.A basic college degree will not be sufficient any longer to quality for an H1-B. An applicant for a job in electrical engineering, for instance, will be required to have a degree in electrical engineering, not computers. “We have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security. We must do everything... to make sure the American worker is put first,” said DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf. The new rule is expected to cut the number of H-1B petitions filed every year — around 200,000 — by a third, according to a senior DHS official. The department will also monitor closely third-party employers, who hire H-1B workers and contract them out to work for US companies. The rules are expected to be challenged in courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-rules-to-raise-pay-for-workers-on-h-1b-will-narrow-eligibility/story-MuDKey3bpaQdvR3yBH7KWO.html
08-10-2020||World||Donald Trump back in Oval Office days after positive Covid test||US President Donald Trump was on Wednesday back at work in the Oval Office just six days after testing Covid-19 positive, despite warnings that his return could put others at risk.The behavior of the president -- who has faced fierce criticism for his handling of the outbreak -- is under scrutiny as the number of positive cases climbs among people working at the White House.After contradictory statements whether the president was back at work on Tuesday, a senior administration official told AFP that Trump was present Wednesday with an “extremely limited” number of staff in his office.Trump, who was hospitalized Friday with the virus that has killed over 210,000 in the US, arrived by an outside door to avoid passing through the crowded corridors of his residence, the official said.“Was just briefed on Hurricane Delta,” the president tweeted, eager to project his return as a personal triumph over the disease as he trails badly in polls against Democratic challenger Joe Biden.Trump’s illness, like his dismissive stance on the virus, has fueled multiple controversies, including his made-for-television exit from the hospital on Monday.Just after stepping off a helicopter at the White House, he climbed the stairs of his residence and pulled off his face mask -- a tool against the virus that he has frequently downplayed.“Don’t let (Covid-19) dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” he urged Americans in his homecoming speech, despite the US having the largest total number of coronavirus infections and deaths in the world. - ‘Wacko for years’ -By Wednesday, doctors reported the president had been free of Covid-19 symptoms for 24 hours and has not had a fever in four days.“The president this morning says ‘I feel great,’“ doctor Sean Conley said in a brief update. In an apparent attempt to provide greater clarity over how the disease has progressed, the update also detailed that Covid antibodies were found in Trump’s blood tests on Monday.Florian Krammer, professor at Icahn School of Medicine in New York, told AFP those results don’t mean much at this stage.“It could well be that the majority of what is detected came from the transfusion,” he said referring to the experimental antibody treatment Trump got Friday.Trump has vowed to return to campaigning shortly and to participate in the second presidential debate against Biden in Miami on October 15.As Trump seeks to revive his reelection campaign in the face of weak polling data just four weeks away from the November 3 election, he labeled Biden “a wacko”.Latest polls forecast a clear victory for Biden, with CNN giving the Democrat a national advantage of 57 percent to 41 percent among likely voters, and women voters going 66 to 32 percent in his favor.“He’s been a wacko for years, and everyone knows it,” Trump tweeted. “Notice how all of the bad things, like his very low IQ, are no longer reported? Fake News!”Biden traded blows with Trump in last week’s chaotic debate, but the former vice president has also appealed to a broad-based yearning for calm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-back-in-oval-office-days-after-positive-covid-test/story-epUOSqYcvItL0dFlg5ftdN.html
08-10-2020||World||Medical journal calls for Donald Trump’s removal over coronavirus||The New England Journal of Medicine says President Donald Trump’s administration should be voted out of office. In a jab at Kamala Harris, Vice President Mike Pence’s campaign said it had set aside a ticket for dead rapper Tupac Shakur at the debate Wednesday. And Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is resuming negative advertising now that Trump is out of the hospital.There are 27 days until the election and 68 days until the Electoral College meets.Other Developments:New England Journal of Medicine Calls for Trump Administration’s RemovalThe New England Journal of Medicine is calling for Trump’s administration to be voted out of office for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the first time in the prestigious publication’s 208-year history that it has denounced a political candidate.In an editorial titled “Dying in a Leadership Vacuum,” the journal’s editors say U.S. leaders “have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.” While it doesn’t explicitly endorse Biden, the editorial clearly ascribes blame to the Trump administration and calls for a change of government. “When it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent,” the editors wrote. “We should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs.”The editorial itemizes failures that it says are of “astonishing” magnitude, comparing the U.S. response to those of countries that implemented early testing and were able to contain the virus.“Our current leaders have undercut trust in science and in government, causing damage that will certainly outlast them,” the editorial says. “Instead of relying on expertise, the administration has turned to uninformed ‘opinion leaders’ and charlatans who obscure the truth and facilitate the promulgation of outright lies. -- Max Berley||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-journal-calls-for-donald-trump-s-removal-over-coronavirus/story-mftchCw1JsNgaB1lW92g3M.html
08-10-2020||World||‘As far as the candidate from Democrats is concerned’: Putin takes note of Biden’s anti-Russia rhetoric||Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he had noted what he called “sharp anti-Russian rhetoric” from US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, but that he had been encouraged by Biden’s comments on arms control. Putin, in comments on state television ahead of the US presidential election on Nov. 3, said Russia would work with any US leader, but praised Republican incumbent Donald Trump for saying he wanted better ties with Moscow.“Of course we value this,” said Putin, who also denied once again Washington’s charge of Russian meddling in US elections. He said that a bipartisan US consensus on the need to restrain Russia had held back the possibility of that happening, but that a lot had nonetheless been done and that bilateral trade had grown despite US sanctions and the pandemic. “As far as the candidate from the Democratic Party is concerned ... we also see quite sharp anti-Russian rhetoric. Unfortunately, we are used to this,” Putin said in an appearance on state television. But he added that Biden had made what he regarded as encouraging statements on New START, the last major nuclear arms pact between Russia and the United States, which is due to expire in February. Moscow and Washington have so far been unable to agree a new treaty or an extension, though Trump’s envoy for arms control said on Tuesday that “important progress” had been made at bilateral talks. “Candidate Biden publicly said he was ready for an extension of New START or to reach a new treaty to limit strategic ... weapons, and this is a very serious element of our cooperation in the future,” Putin said.Last month, Putin proposed a cyber reset in ties with Washington and called for a bilateral agreement that they would not engage in cyber-meddling in each other’s elections.On Wednesday he said Washington had ignored that proposal.“Unfortunately... there has been no answer on this... very important issue, although there are continuing claims against us about our apparent hyperactivity... in interfering in elections ... which are completely groundless.” (Reporting by Moscow newsroom; Writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Gareth Jones)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-far-as-the-candidate-from-democrats-is-concerned-putin-takes-note-of-biden-s-anti-russia-rhetoric/story-goERrGvf8C1FfhoViKZcZM.html
