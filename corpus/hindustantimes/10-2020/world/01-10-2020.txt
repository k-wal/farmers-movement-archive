This is in accordance with legal practice in other jurisdictions as well,” Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said while replying to a question during his weekly press briefing here.He further said that the Indian Supreme Court, in one of its judgments, has also ruled that foreign lawyers cannot practice law within the country.India’s Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava last month said the government of Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit.“It has not yet addressed the core issues, which include provision of all documents related to the case, providing unconditional and unimpeded consular access to Kulbhusan Jadhav and appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel to ensure a free and fair trial,” he said.Queen’s Counsel is a barrister or advocate, appointed Counsel to the UK Crown on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor.Last month, the Islamabad High Court directed the Pakistan government to give India another chance to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav and adjourned hearing for a month.Pakistan’s Parliament last month extended for four months an ordinance that allowed Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in a high court as required by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).Responding to a question on Pakistan’s offer of arranging a meeting of Jadhav with his father and wife, Chaudhri said the offer “remains valid.” “However, we have not received any response from the Indian side as yet,” he added.In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a “farcical” approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order.Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.During the briefing, Chaudhri also said that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has once again written to the President of the UN Security Council, raising the Kashmir issue.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcating it into two Union territories. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-only-allow-lawyers-with-license-to-practice-in-pakistan-kulbhushan-jadhav-denied-queen-s-counsel/story-GOGH3gl8lIXsPuGYhieS5I.html

The app will alert users if they have recently been near someone who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Many of the 20 hot spots include Orthodox Jewish communities. Cuomo said he talked to community leaders about enforcing social distancing measures.“A cluster today can become community spread tomorrow,” Cuomo said on a briefing call with reporters. “These ZIP codes are not hermetically sealed.”He implored local authorities to increase enforcement measures. “If they’re not wearing masks, they should be fined,” Cuomo said.Wisconsin health officials are urging residents to stay home and avoid large gatherings ahead of Trump’s weekend rallies in La Crosse and Green Bay in the run up to the Nov. 3 election.“This spike we’re seeing in Brown County, Wisconsin should be a wakeup call to anyone who lives here that our community is facing a crisis,” Dr. Paul Casey, medical director of the emergency department at Bellin Hospital, told CNN.Cases, hospitalizations, positive test rates and deaths are all climbing in Wisconsin, according to a Reuters analysis.Last week 19% of tests came back positive for Covid-19 and have steadily risen for five weeks in a row from 8% in late August. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients has doubled in the last two weeks hitting a record of 646 on Wednesday. On Wednesday, the state reported its biggest one-day increase in deaths since the pandemic started with 27 lives lost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-worries-over-20-covid-19-hot-spots-wisconsin-sees-troubling-trends/story-43EkomJl4aA5On88NJQNxL.html
01-10-2020||World||Donald Trump biggest driver of Covid-19 misinformation: Report||US President Donald Trump has been the world’s biggest driver of Covid-19 misinformation during the pandemic, a study from Cornell University said Thursday.A team from the Cornell Alliance for Science evaluated 38 million articles published by English-language, traditional media worldwide between January 1 and May 26 of this year.The database they used aggregates coverage from countries such as the United States, Britain, India, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and other African and Asian nations.They identified 522,472 news articles that reproduced or amplified misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic, or what the World Health Organization has called the “infodemic.”These were categorized into 11 main sub-topics, ranging from conspiracy theories to attacks on top scientist Anthony Fauci to the idea that the virus is a bioweapon unleashed by China.But the most popular topic by far was what the study authors termed “miracle cures,” which appeared in 295,351 articles -- more than the other 10 topics combined.The authors found that comments by President Trump drove major spikes in the “miracle cures” topic, led by his April 24 press briefing where he mused on the possibility of using disinfectants inside the body to cure the coronavirus.Similar spikes were seen when he promoted unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.“We conclude therefore that the president of the United States was likely the largest driver of the COVID-19 misinformation ‘infodemic,’“ the team wrote.Sara Evanega, who led the study and is director of the Cornell Alliance for Science, said: “If people are misled by unscientific and unsubstantiated claims about the disease, they may be less likely to observe official guidance and thus risk spreading the virus.”Co-author Jordan Adams, a data analyst at Cision Insights that provided the database, added: “One of the more interesting aspects of the data collection process was discovering the staggering amount of misinformation coverage directly linked to the public comments of a small number of individuals.”After miracle cures, the second-most prevalent misinformation topic was that the pandemic was created to advance a “new world order.”Next came the claim that the pandemic was a hoax for political gain by the US Democratic Party, followed by conspiracies alleging the virus was a bioweapon released by a laboratory in Wuhan, China.Conspiracy theories linking the pandemic to philanthropist Bill Gates came next, then the hoax that Covid-19 symptoms are caused by 5G phone networks, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and the notion that the virus is a form of population control.Attacks on US government scientist Fauci, references to the debunked “Plandemic” video, and blaming the virus on Chinese people consuming bat soup rounded off the list.The study authors also tracked how the stories were shared on social media, finding that the posts elicited 36 million engagements, three-quarters of them on Facebook. The research was partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-biggest-driver-of-covid-19-misinformation-report/story-IrmQTGibOMQSFHh96GwjKK.html

01-10-2020||World||US judge blocks fee hike for H-1B, L-1 visas, Green Cards||A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from raising filing fees for a range of immigrant and non-immigrant services, including Green Cards and H-1B and L-1 visas used by US companies to hire foreign workers, as well as work authorisation for international students.The fee hikes were to go into effect on Friday.The fee for H-1B petitions filed by US employers was set to rise from $460 to $555 and for L visas from $460 to $805. Other charges related to H-1Bs were also slated to go up.Filing fee for international students for Optional Practical Training, which allows them to work as part for their courses, would have gone up from $410 to $550.The cost of filing for US citizenship was to rise from $640 to $1,160. Asylum application fee was set to be $50 for each applicant, which would have made the United States the only country in the world to charge asylum seekers.US district judge Jeffrey S White of the Northern District of California issued the nationwide injunction on Tuesday in response to a lawsuit brought by eight organisations challenging the fee hikes on the ground that top officials heading the Department of Homeland Security at the time did not meet their service requirements — Secretary Kevin McAleenan and his successor Chad Wolf were not confirmed by US Senate.“Plaintiffs have met their burden to show they are likely to succeed on their claim that Mr McAleenan and Mr Wolf were not lawfully serving under the HSA (Homeland Security Act),” White wrote. “Defendants conceded at the hearing that if this court rejects their arguments on this issue, which it does, the final rule would have been promulgated without lawful authority.”The Trump administration is expected to appeal the injunction.“Not only is it unfair and fiscally foolish for the Trump administration to make H-1B visas, green cards, and citizenship too costly for many immigrants, but now a federal judge has ruled it lawless,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Obama White House, and is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.The H-1B petition fees are paid by American employers, who have mostly turned to India to hire highly skilled workers in IT and other specialised professions. Indians hired from India and those enrolled in US colleges and universities have accounted for more than 70% of H-1B visas granted every year.The short-term non-immigrant visa programme has faced relentless pressure from the Trump administration, which believes it is being used to displace American workers. And the administration has issued a slew of orders tightening and changing rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-blocks-fee-hike-for-h-1b-l-1-visas-green-cards/story-LMz4nydR7sDooXCVgYzBRL.html

01-10-2020||World||2 British PMs benefited from slavery, admits Westminster||Two British prime ministers – Robert Peel and William Gladstone – are among top politicians who directly benefited from slave trade and indentured labour in India, America, West Indies and elsewhere, according to a major review of parliamentary art in Westminster released on Thursday.Initial findings in the ongoing review supported by House of Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle reveal that at least 232 items of over 9,500 works in the Parliamentary Art Collection have links to the transatlantic slave trade over the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Spurred by the Black Lives Movement, the parliamentary art review is part of similar efforts by several museums, art galleries and other large collections in the UK in recent months to reconsider the approach to managing the collection and how to broaden its diversity and inclusion.The Speaker’s Advisory Committee on Works of Art said: “British involvement in the transatlantic slave trade began in 1562, and by the 1730s Britain was the biggest slave-trading nation in the world”. “The abolition movement in Britain, and the acts of resistance and rebellion by enslaved Africans in the Colonies, led to the abolition of first the trade, and then the use of enslaved labour in British colonies by Acts of Parliament in 1807 and 1833”. “However, many British people continued to have direct financial gain from the trading and use of enslaved labour and indentured labour in the West Indies, America, India and elsewhere”, it added.Of the 232 items identified so far, 189 depict 24 people who had ties to the slave trade and 40 pieces depict 14 people who worked to abolish slavery. Peel was twice prime minister (1834-35 and 1841-46), while Gladstone held the office over four terms between 1868 and 1894.Besides Peel and Gladstone, the list of MPs who had financial or family interests in transatlantic slave trade and slavery includes Henry Dundas (1742-1811), who was president of the Board of Control of the East India Company.Items linked to those who campaigned to abolish slavery include William Wilberforce (1759-1833), who also pushed for Christian evangelism in colonial India in parliamentary debates during the renewal of the East India Company’s charter in 1793 and 1813.The small number of artworks linked to non-white MPs include a painting and images of the first three Indian MPs in the House of Commons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Dadabhai Naoroji (Finsbury Central), Mancherjee Bhownagree (Bethnal Green North East) and Shapurji Saklatvala (Battersea North).The committee said: “There is no definitive list of MPs with close connections to the transatlantic trade, or those who had financial interests in the use of enslaved labour and indentured labour in the West Indies, America, India and elsewhere”. “However, they will be numerous, and some will be included in artworks on display in Parliament. There are also instances of MPs whose views changed over their time in Parliament, for example those with economic interests in the use of enslaved peoples and the slave trade who later fought for abolition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-british-pms-benefited-from-slavery-admits-westminster/story-rq8dHlj8TvvTOHzkBmGZjI.html

The move came just days after an opposition alliance was formed against the government.Addressing the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s first major meeting via video link late last month, Sharif had severely criticised the military as “a state above the state”.But while talking to media in London later, Sharif said he had supported the country’s armed forces a lot. He went on to claim that his government reverse-engineered a missile launched against Afghanistan by the US in strikes ordered against al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan in 1998. “One of these missiles landed undamaged in Balochistan and we used back-engineering (sic) to develop our own missile programme,” Sharif said.“It was during my tenure as PM that Pakistan became a nuclear power, developed the JF-17 aircraft along with China and I can also claim that half of the missiles that Pakistan has developed were done with my support.”The former PM said he had all love and respect for both military officers and soldiers. “There are very few people in the armed forces who I have a problem with,” he said. Talking about the opposition alliance, Sharif said it is a matter of time that the present government will go. “If the country stands up, change will come in a few months,” he said.He also took the opportunity to attack Khan whom he called “selected...incompetent...mad.” He said Khan did not know how to govern and his government was failing. Nawaz Sharif said that he will hold to account those people who brought Imran Khan to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-pak-pm-recalls-reverse-engineering-of-us-missile-to-demonstrate-his-ties-to-military/story-VTVAViCLcELnWoi3dX9xhP.html
01-10-2020||World||Mike Pompeo meets with Vatican after US-China tensions spill over||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived Thursday at the Vatican to meet with top Holy See officials, a day after tensions over American opposition to the Vatican’s China policy spilled out in public.Pompeo was meeting with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher. The Vatican declined his request to see Pope Francis, citing Holy See policy to not grant papal audiences during election campaigns, Parolin said.Pompeo was in Rome to participate in a conference on religious freedom organized by the US Embassy to the Holy See, and to meet with Italian and Vatican officials.During the Wednesday conference, Pompeo urged the Vatican to join the US in denouncing violations of religious freedom in China, part of the US campaign to criticize Beijing’s crackdown on religious and ethnic minorities that has increased amid the coronavirus pandemic and before the Nov. 3 election.The conference was organized at the same time the Vatican is entering into delicate negotiations with Beijing on extending their controversial 2018 agreement on nominating bishops for China.The Vatican is seeking to extend the accord, which envisages a process of dialogue in selecting bishops. It signed it in 2018 in hopes it would help unite China’s Catholics, who for seven decades have been split between those belonging to an official, state-sanctioned church and an underground church loyal to Rome.Pompeo has strongly criticized the accord, penning an essay earlier this month suggesting that the Vatican had compromised its moral authority by signing it. His article greatly irritated the Vatican, which saw it as interference in the church’s internal affairs for the sake of scoring domestic political points.The Vatican secretary of state, Parolin, said the Holy See was “surprised” by Pompeo’s article. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference, Parolin said the private meetings Pompeo had scheduled at the Vatican would have been the more appropriate setting to express his concerns, Italian news agency ANSA reported.Pompeo started his day Thursday visiting the Rome-based Sant’Egidio Community, a Catholic charity active in caring for refugees in Italy and providing HIV-AIDS care in Africa. Arriving at Sant’Egidio’s headquarters, Pompeo praised the group’s efforts as “the Lord’s work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-meets-with-vatican-after-us-china-tensions-spill-over/story-JlNUeL0SkG4ImlggisOB7N.html

01-10-2020||World||Hong Kong police enforce ‘Stability’ on a tense National Day||Riot police flooded Hong Kong streets on a tense National Day, a show of force intended to back up leader Carrie Lam’s morning declaration that stability had returned to the Asian financial center.“The plain truth is and it is obvious to see that stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded, and our people can continue to enjoy their basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law,” Lam said Thursday morning after the annual outdoor flag-raising ceremony.With some 6,000 riot police on standby, the display offered a marked contrast from a year ago, when calls for protests forced officials from the special administrative region to take shelter inside.The Oct. 1 holiday marking the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 is the latest test of Hong Kong’s efforts to quash the unrest that helped spark a historic recession last year, even before the coronavirus pandemic. Mass arrests and, in June, the passage of a powerful and controversial security law have helped Hong Kong’s leaders suppress dissenters. Covid control measures that limit the size of public gatherings have also chilled protest action.Earlier this week, an appeals panel upheld a police ban on a protest sought by the Civil Human Rights Front, which last year organized largely peaceful marches that drew more than a million people. Police announced the arrests of five activists this week on allegations that they incited people to attend unlawful gatherings.Some protesters turned out anyway. In the Mong Kok shopping district, a small group chanted the popular slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,” which has been banned by the government for months. Across the harbor in Causeway Bay, police warned protesters taking part in unauthorized assemblies to leave the area. Earlier in the day, veteran activist Leung “Long Hair” Kwok-hung led a small protest near the flag-raising event at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.“We have been fighting for over a year,” a Hong Kong University of Science & Technology student named Tse said. “If people do turn up, they will be there to express their concerns or express their non-compliance to the national security law. Many young people don’t like how the government is treating its people.”Massive protests a year ago undercut President Xi Jinping’s efforts to convey national strength on the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule, as demonstrators clashed with police and one protester was shot by a riot officer. Xi took unprecedented action to impose the security law without local debate, giving authorities the power to jail for life those convicted of crimes including subversion and collusion with foreign powers.The Group of Seven nations denounced the security law as a breach of China’s promise to preserve the financial hub’s autonomy, and the US levelled sanctions against Lam and other top officials. Lam, who has previously complained about how the measures have caused problems with her credit cards, criticized unnamed foreign governments Thursday for “unjustified accusations.”“I and my relevant colleagues will continue to discharge our duty to safeguard national security in accordance with the law without fear or anxiety,” Lam said. She was joined at the ceremony by China’s most senior officials in Hong Kong, including Liaison Office Director Luo Huining and former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who’s now vice chairman of the country’s top political advisory body.Support for several of the protest movement’s goals increased over two months, according to a Reuters/Hong Kong Opinion Research Institute poll released in August. The share in favor of Lam’s resignation rose to 58% and direct elections for her replacement were backed by 63%. Some 51% said they “very much oppose” the national security law.Nick Or, an assistant professor of public policy at the City University of Hong Kong, said the government would be better off trying to resolve the underlying disputes. “The potential social unrest that may happen on Oct. 1 is a manifestation of the fact that the political system in Hong Kong fails to set up an institution to address the demands and grievances in society,” Or said.The plight of a dozen Hong Kong activists ages 16 to 33, who have been held on the mainland since attempting to flee to Taiwan by boat in August was among the concerns protesters wanted to highlight. China approved the arrests of 12 people matching their description on allegations of organizing or participating in an illegal border crossing, according to district prosecutors from the mainland city of Shenzhen in a statement late Wednesday.Those who attend an unauthorized protest are liable for crimes ranging from inciting an unlawful assembly to rioting, a colonial-era charge that carries a sentence of as long as 10 years in prison. Still, thousands of Hong Kong residents defied warnings to return to the streets on Sept. 6, in a show of anger over the government’s decision to postpone the election by a year over the pandemic. Hundreds were arrested.Earlier this week, the Liaison Office warned that “the sword” of the security law was hanging over those who attempt to protest on the holiday. And Luo, the agency’s director, told a National Day event Wednesday that the legislation had saved Hong Kong from falling into “the abyss of color revolution.”“Patriotism isn’t a choice, but an obligation,” Luo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-enforce-stability-on-a-tense-national-day/story-mIh42yiDorWBDuwuVJzY4J.html

01-10-2020||World||American to furlough 19,000 as clock runs out on airlines||American Airlines will begin furloughing 19,000 employees on Thursday after lawmakers and the White House failed to agree on a broad pandemic-relief package that includes more federal aid for airlines.CEO Doug Parker said Wednesday night that if Washington comes up with a deal for USD 25 billion in airline aid “over the next few days,” American will reverse the furloughs and recall the employees.The move by American represents the first — and likely the largest — involuntary jobs cut across the industry in coming days. United Airlines has indicated it could furlough nearly 12,000 workers.Airline employees and executives made 11th-hour appeals this week to Congress and the Trump administration to avert furloughs when a federal prohibition on layoffs — a condition of an earlier round of federal aid — expires Thursday.The passenger airlines and their labor unions are lobbying for taxpayer money to pay workers for six more months, through next March. Their request is tied up in stalled negotiations over a larger pandemic-relief measure.Industry officials acknowledged that prospects were bleak for action before Thursday’s deadline. They said, however, they were cheered that the House this week included airline payroll help in a USD 2.2 trillion relief plan that moved closer to Republicans’ preference for a lower price tag.“It provides a glimmer of hope that something will get done,” said Nicholas Calio, president of the trade group Airlines for America.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday night that the administration wants to help hotels, airlines and schools. He said he was talking with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi but hinted that the White House doesn’t want to go above about USD 1.5 trillion — USD 700 million below the House Democrats’ figure.“I don’t think we’re going to make significant progress” until Thursday, he said on Fox Business.Calio suggested that Thursday might not be a hard deadline — airlines could reverse some furloughs if a deal between the White House and congressional Democrats appeared imminent.“Ideally, if it’s going to go beyond Thursday they will be close to a deal and say, ‘Hang on for a couple days,’ and we can wait,” he said.“Beyond that, the notices have gone and furloughs will go into effect.” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said she still expects action by Congress because majorities in the House and Senate have signaled support for more airline relief.She said a bailout that keeps airline workers employed would be cheaper for the government than putting them on the unemployment line during a pandemic.“These are people who are not going to be able to pay their rent, they are not going to be able to take care of themselves,” Nelson said on CNBC.Beyond American and United, smaller airlines have sent layoff warnings to several thousand employees. Delta and Southwest have shed thousands of jobs through voluntary departures but don’t plan to lay off workers immediately.Airlines have persuaded tens of thousands of employees to take early retirement or severance deals. But even after those offers, the airlines have more pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and other workers than they need.Critics say airlines shouldn’t get special treatment, and that subsidizing their workforces will only delay the companies’ need to adjust to the downturn in travel — which even airline trade groups think will last three or four years.“The airlines are always the first ones begging for support. They get bailed out over and over again,” Veronique de Rugy, a research fellow at George Mason University and columnist for a libertarian magazine, said in a recent interview.“Airlines have a history of not preparing properly for the next emergency because they know they are going to be bailed out.” In March, Congress approved USD 25 billion mostly in grants to cover passenger airline payrolls through September and up to another USD 25 billion in loans that the airlines could use for other purposes.Late Tuesday, the Treasury Department said it completed loans to seven major airlines: American, United, Alaska, JetBlue, Frontier, Hawaiian and SkyWest.American now expects to borrow USD 5.5 billion from the Treasury, and United can get USD 5.17 billion. Airlines have also borrowed billions from private lenders.They could use that money to keep employees — as critics like de Rugy suggest they should — but they are trying to cut spending in case ticket revenue remains severely depressed for a long time.US air travel remains down nearly 70 per cent from a year ago.

01-10-2020||World||Moderna says Covid-19 vaccine unlikely to be ready before US election: Report||Moderna Inc will not be ready to apply for emergency authorization for its potential Covid-19 vaccine before the US presidential election in November, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing the company’s chief executive officer.Stéphane Bancel told FT that he did not expect to have full approval to distribute the drug to all sections of the U.S. population until next spring.Moderna did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.Moderna will not be ready to seek emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration before Nov. 25 at the earliest, the report said, citing Bancel.The company’s experimental vaccine is among the leaders in the race to develop a safe and effective vaccine to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. The candidate is currently being tested in a large decisive trial. The race to come up with a vaccine has become a divisive issue for the U.S. presidential election and was of significant importance in the presidential debate on Tuesday between U.S. President Donald Trump and contender Joe Biden.Bancel earlier this month had said he expects the company to file for an Emergency Use Authorization in 2020, which could occur in November or even as early as October depending on interim analysis.Results from an early safety study of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine candidate in older adults on Tuesday showed that it produced virus-neutralizing antibodies at levels similar to those seen in younger adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-covid-19-vaccine-unlikely-to-be-ready-before-us-election-report/story-BX15F0mCu5qrmZw6ioDChL.html

Confirmed cases in the country have surpassed 158,400 as authorities have warned of community transmission of the deadly virus. The daily increase in infections has been 1,672, a rise of nearly 90% over that recorded a fortnight earlier. However, there have been far fewer fatalities when compared to the conditions prevailing in March and April, with only six confirmed to have died on Wednesday.The situation in the two provinces worst-hit by the pandemic, Ontario and Quebec, is grim. Francois Legault, Quebec premier, described it as “critical” as he announced a “red alert level” for three regions, including the province’s two largest municipalities, Montreal and Quebec City. Coming into effect on Thursday, many establishments that were allowed to reopen, including bars, restaurants and cinemas, will be forced to close down for a month.Ontario, meanwhile, recorded its highest single-day increase in new coronavirus cases on Monday, at 700, as part of a trend of numbers rising steeply over the last week.The surge in numbers has impacted public health infrastructure, particularly in relation to testing, as people queued up for hours for Covid-19 tests with results taking days to become available. Under pressure, the Trudeau government announced the procurement of molecular devices from Abbott Laboratories on Tuesday. Results are expected to be delivered within minutes after a swab specimen is taken from the throat or nose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-long-wait-ends-as-trudeau-government-okays-covid-19-rapid-test-kits/story-ZzhLpm6wIcQo98L0K7IJpO.html
01-10-2020||World||Canada’s population sees record low growth due to sharp decline in migration||Canada has seen record low growth in its population in the second quarter of the year, mainly due to a fall in migration to the country due to travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. A key highlight of the trend is that the number of Indians arriving in Canada as permanent residents (PRs) this year is set to number less than half the total for 2019.According to the country’s data agency Statistics Canada or StatCan, there was just a 0.1% increase in population between April and June, which is a record low. StatCan said in a release, “International migration is the main driver of population growth in Canada, accounting for 81.9% of growth in 2019-2020. Therefore, the restrictions placed on international borders and the subsequent drop in international migration levels had the largest impact on population growth in 2019-2020.”Coronavirus-related curbs have markedly affected Indians moving to Canada; they have comprised the largest source group for the country’s PRs in recent years. According to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Indian-origin PRs in 2019 were at a peak of 85,590, up from 69,980 the previous year. The category saw the numbers rise during the first quarter of the year, growing from 15,595 to 16,660. However, as Covid-19 restrictions came into place, there was a sharp drop in PRs in the country, falling from 23,825 for the second quarter of 2019 to only 9,945 for the same period this year. In total, just 29,800 Indians became Canadian PRs till the end of July this year, a pace that indicates the total will be below half of that for 2019.This is in sharp contrast to the situation last year. StatCan noted that the July-October quarter of 2019 had seen the numbers reach 208,659, growing by 0.6%. It said it was the “highest level of growth for a quarter since comparable record keeping began in July 1971”. However, “the global pandemic began to affect the demographic patterns in Canada at the end of the first quarter of 2020”, StatCan said, after Canada recorded its first Covid-19 death on March 9 and curbs, including those on international travel, came into effect about a week later. Canada had targeted accepting more than 300,000 new PRs each year. The pandemic could possibly make the government wind down those numbers in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-population-sees-record-low-growth-due-to-sharp-decline-in-migration/story-PESISYLMPGxBSZtovX82rJ.html
01-10-2020||World||US isn’t yet keen on formalising Quad, says state department official||Ahead of an upcoming ministerial meeting of the Quad - as a consultative group comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia calls itself - a senior US state department official dismissed talk of formalising the association, saying America wanted to strengthen existing regional architectures, not create new ones. The meeting is scheduled for October 6.The official also said, addressing a wide range of India-US issues, that human rights organisation Amnesty International’s decision to shut down its India operations had “received attention at the highest levels” of the Trump administration and it was being followed “very, very closely” by members of US congress.The official reiterated the US call for India and China to settle their border dispute using “their existing bilateral channels… and not resort to military force”.The official addressed the “situation” around Amnesty International shutting down its India operations on Tuesday, in response to a question. “We’ve been very, very closely following this issue, not just in the administration, but I know that our members of congress have (been following) as well” the official said, adding, “It has received attention at the highest levels of our government.”Speculation about formalising the four-country consultative group known as the Quad received a boost in September when a senior state department official, Steven Biegun, was seen to be signaling a US willingness to explore the possibility of growing the Quad into a Nato-like formally organised group.The US state department official said Biegun’s speech was a misinterpretation of what “he actually said (and) what it was the analysts believed he was getting at”.“The United States is building new and stronger bonds with the nations that share our values across the Indo-Pacific region,” the official said. “India, Australia and Japan are the main three (countries) that we have gotten together on the Quad. And these relationships flow from the spirit of respect to inclusivity and partnership, not domination. We all have our own Indo-Pacific strategies and approaches, and we share a complimentary vision of a free and open region that’s committed to a rules-based order and respect for international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes.”Sameer Lalwani, a South Asia expert with the think tank Stimson Center, said, “I don’t see these propositions as mutually exclusive - you can build new infrastructure on top of existing regional architecture to reinforce rather than displace it. “Deputy secretary Biegun even seemed to allude to that in his remarks a month ago. Gradually elevating the Quad from a grouping of consultations to expressed commitments to coordinated capabilities and actions can be additive, bolstering that regional architecture and deterring challenges to that order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-isn-t-yet-keen-on-formalising-quad-says-state-department-official/story-FvSaDVkhS9ggjwtixzbm3O.html
01-10-2020||World||US court approves $800 million settlement in Las Vegas mass shooting||A US court on Wednesday approved an $800 million settlement for victims of America’s worst mass shooting -- a rampage that left 58 dead and more than 800 wounded in Las Vegas.In the October 2017 massacre, a man named Stephen Paddock opened fire with high-powered rifles from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, unleashing more than 1,000 rounds as he mowed down people among a crowd attending an outdoor country music festival.MGM Resorts International, the casino’s owner, will pay $49 million “of its own funds” while the remainder is to come from its insurers, the court order stated.The order said there had been “near-unanimous participation in the settlement” among thousands of potential claimants including victims and their families.“We are grateful that the decision brings families, victims and the community closer to closure,” MGM said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday.“It is especially meaningful that the decision comes one day before the third anniversary of the incident, a time of great sadness and reflection.”An earlier statement said the settlement does not amount to an admission of liability by MGM Resorts.MGM was sued by victims on grounds of negligence for allowing Paddock to stockpile a huge amount guns and ammunition in his hotel room without being noticed. Twenty-four guns were found in Paddock’s hotel room including 10 AR-15 semi-automatic rifles, most of which were equipped with 100-round magazines.In 2018 MGM Resorts launched a counter-suit aimed at forcing the plaintiffs to drop their suits on grounds that it is not liable.An outline of the settlement was first announced last October, with MGM saying in a statement that “prolonged litigation around these matters is in no one’s best interest.”- ‘Unique and tragic’ -In her order Wednesday, Clark County District Court Judge Linda Bell noted “the extraordinary work and effort by counsel in this case to achieve the maximum amount available to claimants... despite having an immensely difficult, unique, and tragic set of circumstances.”At just after 10:00 pm on a balmy Sunday, Paddock opened fire on the 22,000-strong crowd below his hotel room listening to country singer Jason Aldean.The shooting went on for 10 minutes, sending the crowd into panic. Paddock was later found dead in his hotel room with a self-inflicted gunshot. Paddock left no message behind, and his family and girlfriend could not offer any explanation for what evidence later showed was long in the planning.In August 2018 authorities ended their probe of the shooting without learning Paddock’s motive. An FBI report said the gunman may have been seeking a “certain degree of infamy.”Eighteen more guns were recovered from Paddock’s residence in Mesquite, Nevada and another seven from his home in Reno.A heavy gambler, Paddock was known to wager tens of thousands of dollars at a time and had lost a great deal of money in the years leading up to the attack, according to a Las Vegas police report.amz/bfmMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-approves-800-million-settlement-in-las-vegas-mass-shooting/story-mQzbGHq2zhAPk5wg89gV0M.html
01-10-2020||World||Donald Trump to cut 2021 refugee admission to 15,000||President Donald Trump is planning to cut refugee admissions by 3,000 to 15,000 in 2021, submitting his proposal to Congress less than an hour before the deadline for the fiscal year’s figure was to expire, the administration announced late Wednesday.The 40-year-old resettlement program has been dwindling under his administration and the 2021 figure will continue to shrink it. The 2021 figure is a 16% reduction over 2020’s admissions.The 1980 Refugee Act requires presidents to issue their determination by Oct. 1 for the next fiscal year. The president also must consult with Congress before making his determination, though ultimately it is up to him.Trump froze refugee admissions in March amid the coronavirus pandemic, citing a need to protect American jobs as fallout from the coronavirus crashed the economy.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration is committed to the country’s history of leading the world in providing a safe place for refugees.“We continue to be the single greatest contributor to the relief of humanitarian crisis all around the world, and we will continue to do so,” Pompeo told reporters in Rome on the sidelines of a conference on religious freedom organized by the U.S. Embassy. “Certainly so long as President Trump is in office, I can promise you this administration is deeply committed to that.”But advocates say the government’s actions do not show that. Since taking office, Trump has slashed the number of refugees allowed into the country by more than 80%, reflecting his broader efforts to drastically reduce both legal and illegal immigration.The U.S. allowed in just over 10,800 refugees — a little more than half of the 18,000 cap set by Trump for 2020 — before the State Department suspended the program because of the coronavirus.The 18,000 cap was already the lowest in the history of the program. In addition, the State Department announced last week that it would no longer provide some statistical information on refugee resettlement, sparking more concerns.Advocates say the Trump administration is dismantling a program that has long enjoyed bipartisan support and has been considered a model for protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.Scores of resettlement offices have closed because of the drop in federal funding, which is tied to the number of refugees placed in the U.S.And the damage is reverberating beyond American borders as other countries close their doors to refugees as well.“We’re talking about tens of millions of desperate families with no place to go and having no hope for protection in the near term,” said Krish Vignarajah, president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a federally funded agency charged with resettling refugees in the United States.Bisrat Sibhatu, an Eritrean refugee, does not want to think about the possibility of another year passing without reuniting with his wife.For the past 2 1/2 years, he has called the caseworker who helped him resettle in Milwaukee every two weeks to inquire about the status of his wife’s refugee case.The answer is always the same — nothing to report.“My wife is always asking me: ‘Is there news?’“ said Sibhatu, who talks to her daily over a messaging app. “It’s very tough. How would you feel if you were separated from your husband? It’s not easy. I don’t know what to say to her.”He said the couple fled Eritrea’s authoritarian government and went to neighboring Ethiopia, which hosts more than 170,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum-seekers. Between 2017 and 2019, his wife, Ruta, was interviewed, vetted and approved to be admitted to the United States as a refugee. Then everything came to a halt.Sibhatu, who works as a machine operator at a spa factory, sends her about $500 every month to cover her living expenses in Ethiopia.“I worry about her, about her life,” Sibhatu said, noting Ethiopia’s spiraling violence and the pandemic. “But there is nothing we can do.”He hopes his wife will be among the refugees who make it to the United States in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-cut-2021-refugee-admission-to-15-000/story-ba0X3OJ9QktbCLxkYQfCpJ.html
01-10-2020||World||US Senate approves bill to avoid govt shutdown, sends it to president Trump||By a sweeping bipartisan vote Wednesday, the Senate sent President Trump a bill to fund the government through Dec. 11, averting the possibility of a government shutdown when the new fiscal year starts Thursday.Trump is expected to sign the measure before Wednesday’s midnight deadline. The temporary extension will set the stage for a lame-duck session of Congress later this year, where the agenda will be largely determined by the outcome of the presidential election.The measure would keep the government running through Dec. 11 and passed by a 84-10 vote. The House passed the bill last week.The stopgap spending bill is required because the GOP-controlled Senate has not acted on any of the 12 annual spending bills that fund the 30% of the government’s budget that is passed by Congress each year. If Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November, it’s likely that another stopgap measure would fund the government into next year and that the next administration and Congress would deal with the leftover business.The measure is the bare minimum accomplishment for Capitol Hill’s powerful Appropriations committees, who pride themselves on their deal-making abilities despite gridlock in other corners of Congress.The legislation — called a continuing resolution, or CR, in Washington-speak — would keep every federal agency running at current funding levels through Dec. 11, which will keep the government afloat past an election that could reshuffle Washington’s balance of power.The measure also extends many programs whose funding or authorizations lapse on Sept. 30, including the federal flood insurance program, highway and transit programs, and a long set of extensions of various health programs, such as a provision to prevent Medicaid cuts to hospitals that serve many poor people.It also finances the possible transition to a new administration if Biden wins the White House and would stave off an unwelcome Covid-caused increase in Medicare Part B premiums for outpatient doctor visits.Farm interests won language that would permit Trump’s farm bailout to continue without fear of interruption. In exchange, House Democrats won $8 billion in food aid for the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-approves-bill-to-avoid-govt-shutdown-sends-it-to-president-trump/story-GCAbNMKbvDGHf4ZQgXEM8I.html
01-10-2020||World||How the FBI became a target of Russian disinformation | Opinion||Almost a year ago, a former Russia specialist on the National Security Council warned Congress about Russia’s nefarious intentions in American politics. The goal of the Russians in 2016, Fiona Hill told the House Intelligence Committee, was to put whoever became president “under a cloud.”Not only did the Russians succeed — it was overcast before President Donald Trump even took office — but they also managed to damage the credibility and reputation of the very agency that is supposed to protect against foreign interference in U.S. elections: the Federal Bureau of Investigation.In her testimony last year, Hill warned that the opposition research commissioned by the Democratic Party against Trump and later used by the FBI to obtain a surveillance warrant against a campaign official named Carter Page would be a “perfect opportunity” for the Kremlin to inject disinformation into American political discourse. On Friday, the Justice Department declassified documents that show the FBI investigated the primary source of the dossier for being a Russian agent.One of those documents is a summary of the bureau’s investigation into a researcher at the Brookings Institution in 2009 and 2010. It says that in late 2008 he approached other researchers there who were joining the incoming administration of Barack Obama and asked if they wanted to make “a little extra money” once they were in their new positions and had access to classified information. The FBI later learned that in 2006 the primary source had contacts with “known Russian intelligence officers” at the Russian embassy in Washington.In 2010, the FBI closed its investigation because the primary source “had apparently left the United States.” But the bureau left open the prospect of reopening the probe if the primary source ever returned to the U.S.These facts alone are not dispositive. The former British spy who compiled the opposition research dossier on Trump’s campaign, Christopher Steele, has said that he is able to distinguish between real and fake information. It’s also possible that his source, the former Brookings Institution researcher, was acting as a kind of double agent.That said, “much of the material” in Steele’s reporting could not be corroborated, wrote Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz in his scathing 2019 report. “The limited information that was corroborated related to time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available,” he said. When the Justice Department declassified the three-day interview with Steele’s primary source, it showed that he had disavowed much of the information in Steele’s dossier.There were other signs that Steele was being played. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe informed the Senate Judiciary Committee this week that the U.S. government received a report that Russian intelligence surmised in July 2016 that “Hillary Clinton had approved a campaign plan to stir up a scandal against U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Putin and the Russians’ hacking of the Democratic National Committee.” Ratcliffe says the intelligence community “does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.”Nonetheless, it was important enough for then-CIA director John Brennan to brief the president about it, according to Ratcliffe, and for U.S. intelligence officials to forward an investigation referral to the FBI in September 2016. Earlier this year, the intelligence community declassified a series of footnotes to the Horowitz report that showed other U.S. intelligence officers had warned that Steele’s dossier may contain Russian disinformation.One might expect the FBI’s leadership to be deeply embarrassed about all of this. People such as former FBI Director James Comey have been warning for years about the danger of Russia’s disinformation campaign against the public. The 2017 intelligence community assessment of Russia’s interference in the election of the previous year includes an entire section on Russia’s English-language propaganda station, RT.But in a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said he had no recollection that Steele’s primary source had been investigated for being a Russian spy or that U.S. intelligence officers referred the intelligence on Russia’s assessment of Clinton’s campaign strategy to the FBI.None of this is to say that the FBI was colluding with Russia. Rather, it suggests that in their panic over the possibility of a Trump victory in 2016, FBI leaders — much like many cable news networks — embraced shoddy and now discredited intelligence to make a case against his campaign. The signs were there that Steele’s research was bunk, but the bureau ignored them.None of this information gets Trump off the hook, either. He has aided and abetted Russian disinformation by repeatedly denying that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. This gives the Russians cover and encouragement to do it all over again this year, which is exactly what the intelligence community has been warning about.In this respect, Trump himself, like the FBI, is a victim of Russian disinformation.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Eli Lake is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering national security and foreign policy.

01-10-2020||World||Biodiversity is life insurance for humans: French President Emmanuel Macron||French President Emmanuel Macron was philosophical on Wednesday in his appeal for global efforts to reverse biodiversity loss, saying it is the life insurance of humans.The “protection of nature” raises the fundamental ethical issue of the “protection of human beings”. Above all, the “protection of biodiversity” is the ‘protection of ecosystems”, he spoke at the UN Biodiversity Summit.“I do not believe that the right of any other living creature is higher than a human right. But I do not believe in the effectiveness of preserving human rights without preserving the ecosystems. For me, this is the philosophical and ethical basis of this battle for biodiversity,” Macron said.Scientists have long been alerting about the risks of new infectious diseases due to deforestation and the poaching of wild species, by showing the links between human, animal and environmental health. The Covid-19 pandemic reminds that biodiversity is the life insurance of humans.“When it is weakened, our health security and our economic security are at stake,” said Macron.He stressed the need to step up the fight against environmental crime, and to put a definitive end to all illegal activities that endanger nature, destroy ecosystems, feed corruption, hinder the development of rule of law and, ultimately undermine the sustainable development of humanity.He called for public investment to enable the transformation. The French recovery plan will devote more than 1 billion euros (1.17 billion US dollars) to biodiversity and the fight against land degradation, he said.“If 2020 is the year of awareness, 2021 must be the year of action,” Macron said.France will mobilize for the adoption of an ambitious new global strategic framework for the protection of biodiversity at next year’s UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China, he said.“Like the Paris Agreement on climate change, we would like this agreement to include quantified and measurable commitments, as well as a clear implementation and accountability mechanism,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biodiversity-is-life-insurance-for-humans-french-president-emmanuel-macron/story-2IvPFohgOq4a214hz4nu5I.html
01-10-2020||World||‘The fire is outflanking us’: California wildfire evacuees return home to find devastation||Nikki and Kevin Conant returned to their home in Northern California wine country Wednesday to find only the charred remains of their home and burned pieces of the wine barrels they used to repurpose into custom-made art and furniture.“It was like a part of me is gone, burned up in the fire. Everything we built here, everything we made here is gone,” Nikki Conant said.The couple, both 52, were preparing to evacuate Sunday when they saw an orange glow in the hills near their Santa Rosa rental home. Within 45 minutes, they could hear the trees crackling and propane tanks exploding as the blaze reached their community. They jumped in their car, and for what seemed like an eternity they were stuck in bumper-to- bumper traffic.“I thought we were going to burn alive. I really did. It was horrible,” Nikki Conant said.Nikki sobbed Wednesday when she spotted her now-burned chicken coop. Her twelve beloved chickens all died in the fire. All the tools for their repurposing business were gone, too.The Conants are among more than 70,000 people still under evacuation orders in the wine region north of San Francisco where the Glass Fire has incinerated at least 80 homes along with winery installations and other buildings.Flames were continuing to tear through the region’s rolling pastures and tree-dotted hills, toppling renowned wineries and restaurants.“Every time we try to construct some control lines, the fire is outflanking us, so we have to pull back,” Cal Fire Chief Mark Brunton said.Firefighters were also warily watching for “violent” winds expected to return to the Napa-Sonoma area late Wednesday, with continuing extreme heat and low humidity. Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger were to continue into Friday evening.Officials said they were requesting more fire crews to join 2,000 firefighters battling the blaze that has charred 76 square miles (197 square kilometers) with almost no containment.Pacific Gas & Electric also cut power to another 3,100 customers in Napa County at the request of firefighters, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported.Hot weather and the potential for fire damage could stress power supplies as people switch on their air conditioners. To avoid shortages, the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s power grid, issued a statewide Flex Alert for 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday. It urged customers to avoid using large appliances during that time and to keep the thermostat at 78 degrees or above.A mid-August heat wave strained the grid to the point where Cal ISO ordered utilities to implement brief rolling blackouts for the first time since 2001.Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in America to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas, especially because climate change has made California much drier. A drier California means plants are more flammable.Some Northern Californians say they are getting fed up with the annual evacuations and fire fears and are thinking of leaving. Despite their latest harrowing experience, the Conants said they plan to stay.Their landlord already told them the home will be rebuilt and offered them a trailer to stay at on the land while the house is finished, Nikki Conant said.“This is home,” she said, referring to the Santa Rosa area. “I was born and raised here, my family is here. I don’t have the heart to just give up and leave the area.”The massive blazes are also becoming harder to fight. On Wednesday, officials said wind-whipped flames led two firefighters to deploy the emergency fire shelters they carry in case of imminent danger from flamesThe firefighters were assigned to the Glass Fire in Napa County on Sunday when gusty off-shore winds fanned the fire, forcing them to deploy the shelters after flames overwhelmed them. The firefighters covered themselves on the ground with the space blanket-looking devices. They were not injured, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.It’s the third time fire crews have had to deploy their fire shelters this month — a last-resort effort to save their lives that was once uncommon. On Sept. 8, 14 firefighters deployed emergency shelters as flames overtook them and destroyed the fire station they were defending in the Los Padres National Forest. Three firefighters were hospitalized and later released. A day later, a crew fighting a deadly blaze in Butte County was overrun by flames when winds shifted; its members escaped with only minor injuries after deploying emergency shelters.About 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the north of wine country, the Zogg Fire, which also erupted during Sunday’s high winds and grew quickly, has killed four people, Shasta County Sheriff Eric Magrini said.A man evacuated with severe burns Sunday died at a hospital of his injuries Tuesday, Magrini said. Three others died Sunday.The deadly blaze that spread to neighboring Tehama County has burned 81 square miles (210 square kilometers) and destroyed 146 buildings, about half of them homes. It was 7% contained.The Glass and Zogg fires are among nearly 30 wildfires burning in California. Fire-related deaths in California this year total 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-fire-is-outflanking-us-california-wildfire-evacuees-return-home-to-find-devastation/story-JdlAfWZq71plbOSzZntyZO.html

The measure will now head to the Senate for consideration.Republican Representative Bill Huizenga said that their party was in “robust agreement” with Democrats about the need to combat forced labour.During the debate on the House floor, Huizenga accused Democrats of pushing through an “empty window dressing bill that hurts US investors and companies but unfortunately simply pays lip service to the Uygurs”.Meanwhile, Democrats said that only US-listed companies should be subjected to heightened scrutiny over forced labour in Xinjiang.Last month, the House of Representatives had passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act to ban imports of products into the US that were made with forced labour in Xinjiang and sanction individuals involved in labour trafficking.The Trump administration announced earlier in September that it will immediately block imports made in Xinjiang to end alleged forced labour practices.Human rights groups have accused the Chinese authorities of detaining more than a million people, mostly Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, in a network of detention centres as part of an assimilation campaign.China has denied the charges, saying the camps were built for vocational and Chinese language training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passes-bill-requiring-firms-to-disclose-connection-with-forced-labour-in-china-s-xinjiang/story-kRyknF92ewYfq9b5vJjI1N.html
01-10-2020||World||12 Democratic governors vow that all votes will be counted||Twelve Democratic governors issued a joint statement on Wednesday defending American democracy, vowing that every valid ballot will be counted in the election after President Donald Trump sowed distrust during the first presidential debate.Donald Trump claimed without evidence Tuesday night that mail voting — surging in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic — is ripe for fraud, and he refused to say whether he would accept the results. He also called on his backers to scrutinize voting procedures at the polls, which critics said could cross into voter intimidation.Without mentioning Trump by name, the governors noted his refusal last week to commit to a peaceful transition of power.“Any efforts to throw out ballots or refuse a peaceful transfer of power are nothing less than an assault on democracy,” they wrote. “There is absolutely no excuse for promoting the intimidation or harassment of voters. These are all blatant attempts to deny our constituents the right to have their voices heard, as guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, and to know the will of the people will be carried out.”Signing the statement were Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Ralph Northam of Virginia, Jay Inslee of Washington, Tony Evers of Wisconsin, Tim Walz of Minnesota, Kate Brown of Oregon, Steve Sisolak of Nevada, Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and John Carney of Delaware.The governors said all valid ballots cast in accordance with state and local laws must be counted and if Trump loses, “he must leave office — period.”They wrote that elections are not “an exercise in controlling power” and that disenfranchising voters “strikes at the very heart” of democracy.“We call on elected leaders at all levels, from both parties, to speak out loudly against such efforts in the weeks ahead,” they said.Trump campaign spokesperson Thea McDonald accused Democrats of “working to shred election integrity rules across the country to stack the deck for their lackluster candidate.” Republicans, she said, “are aiming for an election with results all Americans can trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-democratic-governors-vow-that-all-votes-will-be-counted/story-0DPCUNzZcvjEKND9kcckFJ.html
01-10-2020||World||Donald Trump says he won US presidential debate||US President Donald Trump has claimed that he won the first presidential debate against his Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Tuesday night.“By every measure, we won the debate easily last night,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday, a day after he and Biden clashed during the first of the three presidential debates in Cleveland, Ohio.Both the camps have declared victory.“I think he (Biden) was very weak. He was whining. We won the debate by almost every poll that I saw. If you look at the various polls. And I looked at about six of them, and we won every one of them,” he said.Responding to questions, Trump said he is looking forward to the other two debates in Florida and Tennessee. “I don’t mind debating him. I hear he wants to get out of the debates. I don’t know. That’s up to him,” he said.Responding to questions on his remark regarding the far-right group Proud Boys should “stand back and stand by,” Trump said he does not know who they are and would let the law enforcement agencies do their work.“I don’t know who the Proud Boys are. I mean, you’ll have to give me a definition, because I really don’t know who they are. I can only say they have to stand down, let law enforcement do their work,” he said.“Law enforcement will do the work more and more. As people see how bad this radical, liberal, Democrat movement is and the law enforcement is going to come back stronger and stronger. But again, I don’t know who Proud Boys are. But whoever they are, they have to stand down. Let law enforcement do their work,” he said.Trump said, “Antifa is a real problem, because the problem is on the left and Biden refuses to talk about it. He refuses to issue the words law and order. And you saw that last night when he choked up. He can’t say the words because he’ll lose the rest of the left. So he’s got to condemn Antifa. Antifa is a very bad group.” Biden, he said, has to say something about Antifa. “It’s not a philosophy. These are people that hit people over the head with baseball bats. He’s got to come out and he’s got to be strong, and he’s got to condemn Antifa. And it’s very important that he does that,” Trump added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-won-us-presidential-debate/story-i8oUN8uHmCEVlvXJot4B6N.html
01-10-2020||World||UK Covid rules may be working, 80,000-person mass survey shows||There are signs that restrictions on social contact such as limiting gatherings to groups of six may be helping slow the spread of Covid-19 across the UK, according to a major study.Researchers from Imperial College London and Ipsos MORI tested more than 80,000 volunteers in England between Sept. 18-26 as part of the country’s largest survey into Covid-19.The results show infections increased substantially across the country and the virus is still spreading, with an estimated one in every 200 people infected. But the “R rate” -- which measures how many people each infected person passes the virus on to -- fell to around 1.1, from 1.7 in late August and early September.“While our latest findings show some early evidence that the growth of new cases may have slowed, suggesting efforts to control the infection are working, the prevalence of infection is the highest that we have recorded to date,” said Paul Elliott, director of the program at Imperial College. “This reinforces the need for protective measures to limit the spread of the disease.”In London the prevalence of the disease rose fivefold, to 49 people per 10,000, up from 10. That puts the capital close to the national average.The study was commissioned by the government and full results are due next week, based on samples from 150,000 volunteers.In recent weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has introduced a range of measures to combat the disease, including 10 p.m. closing times for all bars and restaurants, and the “rule of six,” under which people must not meet in groups of more than six anywhere, indoors or outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-rules-may-be-working-80-000-person-mass-survey-shows/story-xVzixSfHvQlm3dIEIiCtqN.html
01-10-2020||World||Oxford-Astra Covid vaccine review to start in Europe||European regulators are set to start an accelerated review of a Covid-19 vaccine front-runner from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, in a sign the shot could be the first to seek approval in the region.The European Medicines Agency is expected to announce the “rolling review” as soon as this week, according to the person, who didn’t want to be identified because the decision is still private. Such assessments are used in emergencies to allow regulators to see trial data while the development is ongoing to speed up approvals of drugs and vaccines that are urgently needed.The move would be a key step forward for the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot after trials were halted earlier this month due to concerns about a participant in the U.K. study who became ill. The partners, along with companies such as Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., are sprinting ahead with experimental shots as governments look for a way out of the global crisis.The death toll from the disease exceeded 1 million this week, while the infection rate has rapidly picked up again in Europe.While the British regulator cleared the Oxford-Astra trial to restart less than a week after it was paused and studies in South Africa, Brazil and India have resumed, U.S. authorities have yet to give the go-ahead.Late Wednesday, Reuters reported that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had widened its investigation of the incident that led to the trial halt, citing people familiar with the matter.The EMA’s head of vaccines, Marco Cavaleri, said in July the agency would start rolling reviews of potential candidates after the summer. The approach means that a final approval could be granted a matter of days after the review period ends. Cavaleri said at the time the first approval of a vaccine could come by the end of the year.In a normal environment, drugmakers submit trial data to the regulator for a review that can take many months. Once that’s complete, an opinion is given on whether the product should be authorized for use, which must be signed off by the European Commission.In emergencies like a pandemic, a rolling review avoids delays so that an EMA recommendation and approval from the European Commission can be sought as quickly as possible. The agency started such an evaluation of remdesivir to treat Covid-19 in April, while trials were ongoing, and the drug was given conditional approval three months later.AstraZeneca declined to comment. A spokesperson for the EMA declined to comment on the review.“EMA has always stated that it will communicate the start of a rolling review for Covid-19 treatments or vaccines,” it said in a statement. “We have not made such an announcement for a vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-to-start-in-europe/story-6OxdwMCZz22n2UqbHZQjkO.html
01-10-2020||World||Northern California wildfire death toll rises to 4 as crews scramble to beat winds||The death toll from a wildfire raging in northern California’s Cascade foothills climbed to four on Wednesday as firefighters battling that blaze and another wreaking havoc in wine country near San Francisco braced to confront a new bout of high winds.Diminished winds across northern California assisted fire crews in making some initial headway on Tuesday against both blazes, which have scorched well over 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares) combined since they erupted about 200 miles (320 km) apart on Sunday.On Wednesday, crews fighting the so-called Zogg Fire in Shasta County and a separate blaze dubbed the Glass Fire in Napa and Sonoma counties scrambled to reinforce their control lines and tamp down hotspots while weather remained in their favor.A red-flag warning for heightened wildfire risks, including extreme winds, is due to be reinstated Wednesday evening for areas just north of San Francisco Bay, including the world-class wine-growing regions of Napa and Sonoma counties.Above-normal heat and extremely low humidity has persisted, even after fierce winds that fanned the explosive fires earlier in the week subsided on Tuesday.Authorities were also on guard for a return of high winds in Shasta County, closer to the Oregon border, California Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) officials said.“Now’s the time for our firefighters to buckle down,” Cal Fire Assistant Chief Bill See said during a late-morning update on the Glass Fire. “We’ll be diligently trying to secure the back door on this fire.”He added that the Napa Valley resort town of Calistoga, known for its hot springs, mud baths and wine tasting rooms but under full evacuation since late Monday, was a particular focal point for fire-protection efforts.The Glass Fire has already destroyed 80 homes and 32 other structures, including the mansion-like Chateau Boswell winery and a farmhouse containing storage, bottling and fermentation facilities at the Castello di Amorosa winery, built to resemble a 13th-century Tuscan castle. The castle itself was unscathed.Some 80,000 people have been placed under evacuation orders, including all 5,300 residents of Calistoga.The Zogg fire, burning near the town of Redding, has destroyed at least 146 structures, with some 15,000 structures listed as threatened and 2,200 residents under evacuation orders or advisories.The causes of the two fires are under investigation. Both were fueled by overgrown thickets of tinder-dry grass scrub covering the hilly, rugged terrain in each area.SMOKE-REDUCED VINTAGEThe Glass Fire struck midway through the traditional grape-harvesting season in Napa and Sonoma counties, both world-renowned among California’s wine-producing regions and still reeling from a cluster of large wildfires earlier this summer.The full effect on the region’s wine business remained to be seen. But industry officials said some vintners would likely scale back production of certain wines due to smoke exposure to grapes still on the vines when the fires struck. Several Napa Valley growers said recently they would forgo a 2020 vintage altogether due to smoke contamination of their crop.The blazes marked the latest flashpoints in a destructive spate of wildfires this summer across the U.S. West.California fires have scorched over 3.9 million acres (1.5 million hectares) since January - far exceeding any single year in state history. They have been stoked by increasingly frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme heat, high winds and dry-lightning sieges that scientists attribute to climate change.More than 7,200 homes and other structures have burned statewide this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northern-california-wildfire-death-toll-rises-to-4-as-crews-scramble-to-beat-winds/story-EXHXo67aWsoErgArJuDrmM.html

Trump, who was expected to try and dominate the first of three such meetings with Biden, repeatedly talked over his rival, and argued with moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News.Both candidates appeared to flout debate rules in a scrappy head-to-head peppered with insults.

01-10-2020||World||Punjab-born MP Virendra Sharma calls for urgent action on Covid-19 impact in Southall||The large Indian community in the London suburb of Southall is the hardest hit in terms of job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to serious social issues such as domestic violence and abuse in homes, said Punjab-born senior Labour MP Virendra Sharma.Sharma, who represents Ealing Southall since 2007, on Wednesday called for urgent action after chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recent announcements providing subsidy to companies and self-employed people to alleviate job losses, insisting that thousands of jobs were not protected under his schemes.Tens of thousands of people in Southall, Sharma said, had been directly and indirectly affected by the job losses. The Boris Johnson government, he alleged, had not considered the social impact of the pandemic.“Earlier, people used to be out of homes for work. Now, they remain at home 24 hours, which has its own implications. In our community, issues such as domestic and other violence are not spoken of due to ‘izzat’ (honour), but such incidents are on the rise. Drug abuse is also rising,” Sharma said. Sunak has often declared that despite the multi-billion-pounds packages to protect employment, he would not be able to save every job. According to Sharma, Sunak has described as “unviable” jobs in the wedding industry, events and exhibitions, major parts of the night-time economy like nightclubs and pubs, festivals, sports venues and theatres.He said: “We have to act now not just to save some parts of the economy but all the jobs at risk across the country. This country is only as strong as the life choices of thousands around the country who will be left unemployed, so we must act now to protect them.”The Indian community that has historically settled in Southall and nearby areas has recently faced major job losses, including at Heathrow and sectors associated with the airline industry. Former Labour leader and shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: “The chancellor is writing off thousands of businesses and a million workers, dismissing sectors that are shut down as ‘unviable’ and locking them out of government support.” “That means the wedding industry, events, clubs, festivals and arts and sports venues are being labelled unviable simply because they are following public health guidance to help tackle the virus. This is insulting and wrong, and writing these businesses off will damage lives across the country and accelerate the job crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-impact-in-southall-labour-mp-sharma-calls-for-urgent-action/story-AoYOyblT8whSHOkI7kjvIJ.html
01-10-2020||World||Boris Johnson says UK at ‘critical moment’ in Covid-19 fight||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said the UK is at a “critical moment” in its fight to control the spread of coronavirus, as a further 71 deaths took the country’s death toll from the deadly virus to 42,143.Addressing a briefing from 10 Downing Street in London, Johnson struck a sombre note as he called for “collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices” in order to avert another nationwide lockdown, even as he warned that he would not hesitate to impose further restrictions if needed.His warning of a high number of infections and “tragic increase” in deaths came as this week marked the biggest rise in daily cases since the pandemic began, with a further 7,108 infections recorded on Wednesday and the number of patients with Covid-19 on ventilators hitting 312.“These figures show why our plan is so essential. We have to stick to it together and we should stick to it with confidence,” said Johnson.“I know some people think we should give up and let the virus take its course despite the huge loss of life that may entail. I profoundly disagree. I don’t think the British people want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus,” he said, adding that the UK will “get through this”.He was joined by his scientific and medical experts who reiterated that the coronavirus cases were “heading in the wrong direction”.Johnson’s briefing came as the House of Commons passed by 330 votes to 24 an extension to the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation which needs parliamentary approval every six months.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to the members of the Parliament that they would be given votes “wherever possible” on any new coronavirus rules before they come into force in future. The assurance comes amid growing disquiet within Johnson’s own Conservative Party over some of the tough and hard to interpret localised lockdown measures being imposed in large parts of the country.In a rare intervention, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle delivered a harsh rebuke on the government for its failure to seek parliamentary approval for these measures.“The way in which the government has exercised its powers to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory,” he said. Hoyle warned that he was “now looking to the government to rebuild trust with the House and not treat it with the contempt it has shown”.As a result, any further tough lockdown moves are likely to be first tabled for a vote in Commons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-says-uk-at-critical-moment-in-covid-19-fight/story-3rvDliR5n6Llx4DQ8gx2HO.html
