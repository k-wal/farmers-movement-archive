Infection levels, — and deaths — in the UK are rising at their fastest rates in months.Without quick action, there are fears that UK hospitals will be overwhelmed in the coming weeks at a time of year when they are already at their busiest with winter-related afflictions like the flu. The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,825, up another 65 on Sunday.Although coronavirus infections are rising throughout England, northern cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen a disproportionate increase. While some rural areas in eastern England have less than 20 cases per 100,000 people, major metropolitan areas such as Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham have recently recorded levels above 500 per 100,000, nearly as bad as Madrid or Brussels.As a result, national restrictions such as a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants have been supplemented by local actions, including in some cases banning contacts between households. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have already closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.In response to the virus’ resurgence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a new three-tier local lockdown system for England on Monday, which could temporarily close pubs and restaurants in the virus hot spots. The speculation is household mixing, indoors or outside, will be banned in those areas put under the tightest restrictions. Liverpool’s local leader has said he expects his city to face the most onerous restrictions from Wednesday.He is briefing members of the Cabinet by conference call Sunday.Local leaders in northern England have vented their fury at the Conservative government over what they see as an “inadequate” wage support scheme that it announced Friday and for not properly telling them about the upcoming restrictions. The wage plan aims to help employees in companies that are forced to close because of virus restrictions, but mayors say it’s not generous enough in paying only two-thirds of employees’ wages and doesn’t compensate those indirectly hit by any business closures, such as drink suppliers to pubs.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick on Sunday sought to assuage concerns that the government was being overly hierarchical in its approach. He also indicated that local authorities will be given more control over the national test and trace program, which has struggled to live up to Johnson’s prediction that it would be “world-beating.”“In addition to the national infrastructure which is developing and increasing with every passing week, we’re also going to be making use of local councils to do contact tracing in particular, because there is clear evidence that local councils are good at that, as you’d expect,” he told the BBC.As well as facing questions over its coronavirus strategy, government members were having to respond to accusations of potential wrongdoing.Jenrick, himself, denied there was anything wrong in the fact that he and a junior minister in his department approved payments to towns in each other’s constituencies from a government fund earmarked for deprived areas. He insisted there was a “robust and fair” methodology behind the allocations.Separately, Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied claims that he broke the government’s drinking curfew after the Mail on Sunday newspaper claimed he was seen having a drink in a House of Commons bar after 10 p.m.“The proposed timeline of events is false and no rules have been broken,” a spokesman for the health secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-at-tipping-point-england-braces-for-more-restrictions/story-G3nH5gOaRiK1qMhTWvuoqM.html
11-10-2020||World||Courts ‘should not try’ to make policy: Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to senators||Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett will tell senators that courts “should not try” to make policy, leaving those decisions to the political branches of government, according to opening remarks for her confirmation hearing obtained Sunday by The Associated Press.The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, set to begin begin Monday as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the country, are taking place three weeks before Election Day and after millions of Americans already have voted. President Donald Trump nominated the federal appeals court judge soon after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died.“I have been nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat, but no one will ever take her place,” Barrett will tell the committee, according to her opening remarks.Barrett says she has resolved to maintain the same perspective as her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who was “devoted to his family, resolute in his beliefs, and fearless of criticism.”She speaks extensively of her family in the statement, and says she will never let the law define her identity or crowd out the rest of her life. She says a similar principle applies to the courts, which are “not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life.”“The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the People,” she says. “The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.”Barrett will tell the senators that “courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life.”Republicans who control the Senate are moving at a breakneck pace to put the 48-year-old judge on the Supreme Court before the Nov. 3 election, in time to hear a high-profile challenge to the Affordable Care Act and any election-related challenges that may follow the voting.Another reason for moving quickly: It’s unclear whether the election results would make it harder to confirm Barrett before the end of the year if Democrat Joe Biden were to win the White House and Democrats were to gain seats in the Senate.The hearing is taking place less than a month after the death of Ginsburg gave Trump the chance to replace the liberal justice and entrench a conservative majority on the nine-member court. Barrett would be Trump’s third Supreme Court justice.The country will get an extended look at Barrett over three days, beginning with her opening statement late Monday and hours of questioning Tuesday and Wednesday.Democrats have pressed in vain so far to delay the hearings, first because of the proximity to the election and now the virus threat. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/courts-should-not-try-to-make-policy-supreme-court-nominee-amy-coney-barrett-to-senators/story-mnJ2g6oQrd0qI4V0z9pvCO.html

11-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un throws down gauntlet with huge new ICBM: Analysts||The gargantuan new missile North Korea put on show at a military parade is an explicit threat to US defences and an implicit challenge to both the current and next American president, analysts say, warning Pyongyang could test the weapon next year.Leader Kim Jong Un watched the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) roll through Kim Il Sung square -- named after his grandfather -- in Pyongyang at the climax of an unprecedented night-time parade on Saturday.Analysts concurred that it was the largest road-mobile, liquid-fuelled missile anywhere in the world, and was highly likely to be designed to carry multiple warheads in independent re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies said it was “clearly aimed at overwhelming the US missile defense system in Alaska”. If the ICBM carried three or four warheads, he added on Twitter, the US would need to spend around $1 billion on 12-16 interceptors to defend against each missile.“At that cost, I am pretty sure North Korea can add warheads faster than we can add interceptors.”The missile was estimated at 24 metres long and 2.5 metres in diameter, which specialist Markus Schiller said was big enough to carry 100 tonnes of fuel, which would take hours to load.It was so big and heavy that it was practically unusable, he added: “You can’t move this thing fuelled, and you can’t fill it at the launch site. “This thing makes absolutely no sense at all, except for threat equation games, like sending the message of ‘we now have a mobile ICBM with MIRVs, be very afraid’.”North Korea watchers regularly caution that the devices Pyongyang puts on show at its parades may be mock-ups or models, and there is no proof they work until they are tested.But the missile was carried on an enormous and previously unseen 11-axle transporter-erector-launcher, far larger than the eight-axle Chinese-made vehicles the North has employed so far.“The truck may be a scarier story than the missile,” said Melissa Hanham of the Open Nuclear Network. “If the DPRK is indigenously producing their own chassis, then there is less of a constraint on the number of ICBMs they can launch.”- Red lines -Shortly before being inaugurated in 2017, Donald Trump tweeted that North Korea developing a weapon capable of reaching parts of the US “won’t happen!”.He spent the first year of his presidency -- which saw the North launch an ICBM with the range to do exactly that -- in an escalating war of words with Kim before an extraordinary diplomatic bromance developed between them.But nuclear negotiations have been deadlocked since the collapse of their Hanoi summit early last year over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.The ICBM was proof that the North had continued to develop its arsenal throughout the diplomatic process, analysts said, and gave Pyongyang greater heft to demand a return to the negotiating table.“Like it or not North Korea is a nuclear power and is probably the third nuclear power which is capable of striking American cities, third after Russia and China,” Andrei Lankov of Korea Risk Group told AFP.Kim was sending the US a message that the North’s capabilities were improving and that “if you don’t want to make a deal now, sometime later you will have to make a deal which will be worse for you, the international community”, he added.More than 12 hours after the end of the parade broadcast on North Korean state television Trump had not yet tweeted about it -- and nor had his Democratic rival Joe Biden.Trump has made much of Kim’s promise not to carry out any further ICBM or nuclear tests, and Shin Beom-chul of the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy said that by displaying the missile rather than launching it, Pyongyang had stopped short of crossing his red lines.“But it also signals that North Korea could carry out a launch if Trump is re-elected and ignores the North Korean issue,” he said, adding: “If Biden is elected and he doesn’t listen to North Korea, it will carry out a launch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/kim-jong-un-throws-down-gauntlet-with-huge-new-icbm-analysts/story-use8epW9gsaxbtNHAaoxKI.html
11-10-2020||World||Lithuania holds national vote, coalition talks expected||Polls opened Sunday for the first round of Lithuania’s parliamentary election, where voters will choose 141 national lawmakers and the ruling four-party coalition is facing a stiff challenge from the opposition.Pre-election polls in the Baltic nation show the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, which now leads the coalition government, marginally ahead of the opposition conservative Homeland Union-Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats, the populist Labour party and the center-right Liberal Movement.A recent surge in Covid-19 cases, soaring virus-related unemployment and economic challenges are the major issues that have sparked criticism of the current coalition government.Five or six parties are expected to cross the 5% threshold to enter the Seimas assembly but none is likely to get more than 20% support, so horse-trading talks to form a new governing coalition are very likely after the election.The recent sharp rise in coronavirus infections in Lithuania and new restrictions to fight the spread of Covid-19 may affect turnout among the country’s 2.4 million registered voters. Some 7.3% have already cast their ballots in an early voting, according to the Central Electoral Commission.A second round of voting has been set for October 25 in constituencies where no candidate gets a majority.Many Lithuanians complain that government did not do enough to help companies during the nation’s coronavirus lockdown, as the unemployment rate jumped from 9% in February to more than 14% in October. Others say the strict health regulations focused on fighting the virus left thousands of other patients without proper access to health services.Supporters of the ruling coalition say this coastal Baltic country has suffered relatively lightly in the pandemic. So far Lithuania has seen 5,963 confirmed coronavirus cases and and just above 100 deaths.Lithuania has kept strong democratic traditions since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. It has also played a major role as the protests in neighboring Belarus unfold against that nation’s authoritarian leader.Lithuania has granted shelter to Belarus opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus after challenging President Alexander Lukashenko in the country’s August 9 presidential vote. Officials said Lukashenko won a sixth term in office but opposition members say the election was riddled with fraud.Together with its Baltic neighbors Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania swiftly imposed sanctions against Belarusian leaders, and the European Union — a 27-nation bloc that includes the three Baltic nations — eventually followed suit with sanctions. Belarus is not an EU member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lithuania-holds-national-vote-coalition-talks-expected/story-agZkpcC5kd27ubF44CBYvN.html

11-10-2020||World||One held for vandalising Hindu temple in Pakistan||One person has been arrested after a Hindu temple was desecrated in Pakistan’s southeast Sindh province.Local police registered an FIR on the incident at the Shri Ramdev Temple in Kario Ghanwar area of Badin district and arrested Muhammad Ismail Sheedi, a local, who was named by complainant Ashok Kumar as the person believed to have caused the desecration. Police officer Badin Shabir Sethar told local media that he had ordered an investigation and sought an inquiry report within 24 hours. He also said that he suspected the accused was of unsound mind. “We are yet to confirm if he (Ismail) is mentally stable and intentionally destroyed the murtis (idols),” he said, adding that Ismail is also a drug addict. Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.The community mainly resides in the Sindh province. Kario Ghanwar is home to the Hindu Kolhi, Menghwar, Guwaria and Karia communities.According to the official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan.Incidents of violence against the minority community in Sindh have frequently been reported. Condemning the vandalism, London-based Pakistani human rights activist and spokeswoman for Justice for Minorities in Pakistan Anila Gulzar said only 20 temples out of 428 are left.“I strongly condemn the brutal act of vandalism committed against Shri Ram Mandir in Badin Sindh Pakistan on 10 October. Out of 428 only 20 mandirs are left in Sindh,” Gulzar said in a Facebook post.In May, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had condemned the razing of houses of people from the Hindu and Christian communities in Punjab province’s Bahawalpur city.A video of a similar incident had surfaced on the internet earlier this year in which a basti of a minority Hindu community in Bhawalpur was demolished. The demolition exercise was carried out under the watch of Tariq Bashir Cheema, the housing minister in the Imran Khan government, and the country’s principal Information officer Shahid Khokhar.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-held-for-vandalising-hindu-temple-in-pakistan/story-cmprJhpbhkcXi2nkZ6cOdP.html
11-10-2020||World||Amid tensions with India, China holds event to remember Indian doctor Kotnis||University students from India and China participated in an online event hosted by a Chinese association with close links to the government to mark the birth anniversary of Dwarkanath Kotnis, an Indian doctor who died in China during the Sino-Japanese war in 1942.In 1938, a medical team of five doctors comprising M Atal, M. Cholkar, Kotnis, BK Basu and D. Mukerji came to China as part of the Indian medical mission team’ uring the war with Japan to aid Chinese soldiers. Among the five, all, except Kotnis, returned to India.Hosted by the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), the event on Saturday saw the release of short documentaries on Kotnis to mark his 110th birth anniversary and a discussion on the Indian doctor’s legacy.It was held in the backdrop of the ongoing India-China border tension in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged bilateral ties to its worst levels.Speaking on the occasion, CPAFFC chairperson Lin Songtian, who until March was China’s ambassador to South Africa, said there have been temporary difficulties in Sino-Indian relations recently, but the young students of the two countries did not stop making the documentaries because of this. Instead, they incorporated their deep hope for peace and friendship between China and India into short video works, using their own way to commemorate Kotnis, he added.Students and professors from two Indian universities, the Doon University and the Central University of Gujarat besides several Chinese universities including Peking University, which co-organised the event, Beijing Foreign Studies University and Communication University of China took part in the event.A senior diplomat from the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Ma Jia, participated. The CPAFFC describes itself as a “national people’s organisation engaged in people-to-people diplomacy of the People’s Republic of China…In launching its activities, it has support from the government and assistance from all sectors of the society.”A separate webinar was held on Friday in Mumbai where the Chinese consul general Tang Guocai spoke on the Indian doctor’s impact on ties.Speaking at the webinar organised by Dr. Kotnis Memorial Committee, Tang remembered Dr. Kotnis’s contribution that exemplified India and China’s friendship tradition.“The culture and tradition of India and China have several commonalities just as Dr Kotnis is seen as an Indian in China and as Chinese in India,” Tang was quoted as saying by the official news agency, Xinhua.He also called upon China and India to join hands in vaccine research and manufacturing as well as in the public health field for the benefit of their people and the world as a whole.In August, Chinese official media had announced that a bronze statue of Kotnis erected outside a medical school named after him in north China’s Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei’s province, was to be unveiled later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-tensions-with-india-china-holds-event-to-remember-indian-doctor-kotnis/story-CpvGJ6uvarkrJhUqeVYeLO.html

11-10-2020||World||International flights: These countries are welcoming foreigners from October 12||Resuming international flights remains one of the most contentious issues in reopening as several countries across the world are going through a second wave of Covid-19 infections, and opening airports to foreigners is being seen as a major reason. Most of the countries have resumed international flights in a staggered manner but these central and south American countries have so far not allowed international flights since March.Panama: Panama will welcome international tourists from October 12. A negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test from within 48 hours will be required to get an exemption from quarantine. On March 23, Panama suspended all international passenger flights.Argentina: Argentina is likely to resume international flights from October 12, or a few days later, but by mid October, the government has said. This South American nations has been observing one of the most stringent lockdowns. Guyana: This South American country will resume international flights from October 12.British Airways will start its London-Lahore flights from October 12. At present, British Airways flies between London and Islamabad. Global airlines body International Air Transport Association has recently predicted that the global airline industry will burn through USD 77 billion in cash during the second half of 2020 despite the resumption of flight services. “The cash drain continued during the summer months, with airlines expected to go through an additional USD 77 billion of their cash during the second half of this year and a further USD 60-70 billion in 2021. The industry is not expected to turn cash positive until 2022,” it said. The aviation sector in India has also been significantly impacted due to the pandemic. In July, the country’s largest airline IndiGo declared a net loss of Rs 2,884.3 crore for the first quarter of 2020-21.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-flights-these-countries-are-welcoming-foreigners-from-october-12/story-wPNJfSyRW1toD9TVcZ3cJI.html

Our security and military superiority in the region are the most significant things for us. Our region has still not turned into Switzerland.”The Qatari request follows an August deal between the US and the United Arab Emirates in which Washington agreed to consider giving the Gulf state approval to buy F-35s in a side deal to a US-brokered agreement called the Abraham Accord to normalise diplomatic ties with Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-will-oppose-any-us-f-35-sale-to-qatar-israeli-minister-says/story-U9Fw6djs2lJIuSmkMeR2RP.html
11-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un shows off military might but refrains from threatening US||North Korea’s unprecedented nighttime military parade on Saturday showcased an unusually broad array of new weapons, from a show-stopping “monster” ballistic missile to previously unseen battle tanks.The hardware, likely still in varying stages of development, offered leader Kim Jong Un a chance to show the world his cutting-edge military power while adding practical capabilities to the North Korea’s already formidable nuclear and conventional forces, experts said.Kim is walking a fine line, seeking to increase pressure on the United States to ease sanctions while not destroying rapport with US President Donald Trump or Pyongyang’s partners in China.“Kim Jong Un’s speech was not threatening to the United States, instead labelling North Korea’s nuclear forces as self-defensive,” said Bruce Klingner, a retired CIA North Korea analyst now at the Heritage Foundation. “The clear message was that, counter to US claims, the North Korean nuclear threat has not been solved.”Video from the parade suggested a huge intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) potentially more lethal either because of multiple warheads or a bigger payload, larger missile carriers, a next-generation submarine-launched missile, and advances in conventional weaponry, military analysts said.Multiple warheads?The star of Saturday’s show was a massive, previously unseen ICBM carried on an equally huge “transporter-erector-launcher” (TEL) vehicle with 11 axles.Estimated to be 25 to 26 metres (82 to 85 feet) long and 2.5 to 2.9 metres (8 to 9.5 feet) in diameter, the unidentified missile would be the largest road-mobile ICBM in the world, military analysts said.Given that the Hwasong-15, the largest missile ever test-flown by North Korea, can already target anywhere in the United States, the most likely practical use for the new ICBM would be the ability to carry multiple warheads, said Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.It is much cheaper for North Korea to add warheads than for the United States to add interceptors, said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).“If each new North Korean ICBM can carry 3-4 warheads, we would need about 12-16 interceptors for each missile,” he said on Twitter. “The last time the US bought 14 interceptors, it cost $1 billion.”Other analysts said the missile could simply be designed to carry a single, larger warhead.“A bigger warhead doesn’t necessarily mean multiple warheads, a technology I believe North Korea has not secured yet,” said Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who is now a professor at Kyungnam University’s Far East Institute in Seoul.Missile carriersAnalysts said it was also notable that North Korea appeared to have built the huge new TELs to carry the new missiles.“They have a very limited supply of long TELs they acquired from China,” said another CNS researcher, Dave Schmerler, adding that the lack of vehicles has limited the number of ICBMs that could be deployed. “So the longer TELs we saw were indigenously produced.”But the massive size of the new missile and its carrier also has drawbacks, said Markus Schiller, a missile expert based in Europe.“Only special roads and bridges could support this in fuelled condition,” he said. “No sane person would drive this ticking bomb through the North Korean countryside.”It would likely take as much as a half a day to fuel such a large missile, making it difficult to quickly deploy in a war, meaning the missile’s main purpose is likely a political warning, Schiller said.Submarine missileNorth Korea also unveiled what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), labelled the Pukguksong-4.“If the new SLBM is intended to be deployed, it may be intended for the new conventionally powered ballistic missile submarine that North Korea hinted at building in July 2019,” analysts at 38 North, a US-based think tank, said in a report.At least some parts of the missile’s motor case appeared to be filament-wound, which would reduce the missile’s structure weight and allow greater range and payload capability, the report said.Conventional weaponsThe parade featured what appeared to be new or updated weapons for North Korea’s conventional military, one of the largest in the world.The North displayed rows upon rows of multiple launch rocket systems and short-range ballistic missiles that were heavily tested over the past year.“My biggest concern was the solid-fuel, short-range tactical missiles that North Korea had focused on developing over the past year or so,” said Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean nuclear negotiator.The parade also displayed new mobile air-defence radar vehicles and what appeared to be an entirely new tank with anti-tank missiles and smoke grenade launchers more closely integrated into the design than previous imported models.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-shows-off-military-might-but-refrains-from-threatening-us/story-szEl4ItiyrQeITiFk8ErvN.html
11-10-2020||World||Heavy shelling and civilian casualties dash hopes for Karabakh ceasefire||Hopes that a Russian-brokered ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan might hold were further dashed Sunday, with both sides accusing the other of intense shelling on civilian areas and escalating two weeks of fierce clashes.Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry said that overnight shelling by Armenian forces on the country’s second largest city, Ganja, had left seven people dead and 33 wounded including children, less than 24 hours after the halt to fighting was supposed to take effect.Rescuers in red helmets dug through piles of debris with their bare hands in search of signs of survivors, an AFP journalist in the city reported.They retrieved one nearly naked body and gingerly put it in a white bag to be taken away in an ambulance while several horrified residents watched on and wept.One witness said they were woken by a huge blast that levelled an entire square block of one- and two-floor houses in the early hours of the morning, leaving nine apartments destroyed.“Everything I’ve worked for my entire life has been destroyed,” said resident Zagit Aliyev, 68.The agreement to pause hostilities in order to exchange prisoners and the bodies of people killed after two weeks of fighting over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region was approved by Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in marathon Russia-brokered talks in Moscow.- ‘An absolute lie’ -The truce officially entered into force at noon on Saturday but both sides almost immediately accused each other of violations.On Sunday, the defence ministry in the breakaway region insisted Armenian forces were respecting the humanitarian ceasefire and in turn accused Azerbaijan of shelling civilian-populated areas. Claims that Armenian forces were responsible for shelling Ganja were “an absolute lie,” it added.The leader of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, Arayik Harutyunyan, described the situation as “calmer” on Sunday, but warned that the truce was precarious.An AFP journalist in the administrative capital of Stepanakert, which has been subjected to heavy bombings since the fighting erupted and is pockmarked with deep craters and unexploded ordnance, reported hearing loud explosions throughout the night.Vahram Poghosyan, a spokesman for Karabakh’s leader, said the overnight shelling on Stepanakert was “a disrespect of the agreements reached in Moscow,” and called on the international community to recognise the province’s independence as a way to end the fighting.New fighting broke out late last month, stemming from a long-simmering disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Karabakh.The disputed territory is an ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, home to about 150,000 people, which broke from Azerbaijan’s control in a war in the 1990s that killed some 30,000 people. Its separatist government is strongly backed by Armenia, which like Azerbaijan gained independence with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. - A ‘temporary’ ceasefire -The most recent bout of fighting has been the heaviest since the 1990s war, with more than 450 people reported dead, thousands forced to flee their homes and fears the fighting could escalate into a devastating all-out conflict.The return of fighting has stoked fears of a full-blown war embroiling Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a military treaty with Armenia.Armenia and world leaders including Russian leader Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have denounced the deployment of pro-Turkish fighters from Syria and Libya to bolster Azerbaijan’s army.France, Russia and the US -- known as the “Minsk Group” -- have for decades sought a lasting solution to the Karabakh conflict, but have failed to stop sporadic outbreaks of fighting, and Baku with Turkey’s backing appears set on continuing with its military intervention.A senior Azerbaijani official said Saturday the truce was only meant to be “temporary,” and said Baku had “no intention to backtrack” on its effort to retake control of Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heavy-shelling-and-civilian-casualties-dash-hopes-for-karabakh-ceasefire/story-CQ9JwVhKJEXnsH0tnjcPAJ.html
11-10-2020||World||South Korea allows relaxations in social distancing rules as cases decrease||South Korea will relax some rules on social distancing from Monday, allowing nightspots to re-open and spectators to attend sports events, after new coronavirus cases edged lower in recent weeks, authorities said. Daily infections have fallen largely into the double-digit range in the past two weeks, down from 440 during outbreaks at a church and a political rally in August that prompted clampdowns on gatherings and some businesses.“We will lower the level of social distancing nationwide but maintain controls on risk factors such as the door-to-door sales industry,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a meeting on Sunday. “Many citizens are feeling fatigue over prolonged distancing, and we also took its negative impact on the economy into consideration.” The relaxation means places of entertainment, such as nightclubs, karaoke bars and buffets can re-open, and audiences of up to 30% of stadium capacity will be allowed at sports matches such as the popular Korea Baseball Organization League, as long as they comply with anti-virus guidelines.But high-risk activities such as door-to-door sales businesses and small religious gatherings remain banned, with new limits on guests and spacing at nightspots and indoor sport venues in the heavily populated Seoul area, the government said. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo warned against complacency, saying the country still faced the dangers of what he called a “twindemic” of the virus and a winter seasonal flu.“We all know from past experiences that any slight carelessness could lead to another large-scale spread of the virus,” he told a separate briefing. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 58 cases by midnight on Saturday, taking total infections to 24,606, with 432 deaths. Of the new cases, 46 were domestically transmitted, most of them in the greater Seoul region, where small clusters continue to emerge from churches, door-to-door sales firms and medical institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-allows-relaxations-in-social-distancing-rules-as-cases-decrease/story-cDW6lOdytmwfWDkeAlZEmM.html
11-10-2020||World||Malaysia detains 60 Chinese citizens for trespassing into territorial waters||Malaysia’s maritime authority detained six Chinese fishing vessels and their crews for allegedly trespassing in waters off one of its southern states.The vessels, registered in Qinhuangdao, China, were believed to be sailing toward Mauritania in northwestern Africa to fish but had to stop and anchor off Johor state due to a malfunction, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said in a statement Saturday evening. There were six captains and 54 crew members, all Chinese nationals and between the ages of 31 and 60, it said.All were arrested after failing to produce permits from authorities to conduct activities or anchor in Malaysian waters, the agency said. It added the vessels, which didn’t have any cargo, were seized.Territorial tensions in the South China Sea have been on the rise with countries such as Vietnam pushing back against China’s maritime claims. Malaysia recently joined the fray by submitting to the United Nations its claim to rights over the remaining portion of a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the country’s baselines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-detains-60-chinese-citizens-for-trespassing-into-territorial-waters/story-8bmOsWn70QvCQsYaKLSsFL.html
11-10-2020||World||Covid-19: New curbs from Monday as UK back at ‘tipping point’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson will outline tougher measures to deal with Covid-19 on Monday after two top government advisers described the situation in UK as “precarious” and a “tipping point” similar to the situation in March.Peter Horby, chair of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, told the BBC the country is in a “precarious” position, adding that another national lockdown is possible.Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, also said on Sunday: “In our national fight against Covid-19, we are at a tipping point similar to where we were in March; but we can prevent history repeating itself if we all act now”.As of Saturday night, there were 15,166 new coronavirus cases – three times the daily peaks in April and May. There were 81 deaths in the last 24 hours, with hospitals reporting a surge in patients admitted. Overall, there have been 57,347 deaths and 590,844 cases.Johnson is unlikely to announce a second national lockdown, but tougher rules under a new three-tier system of restrictions in north England are due to be announced in the House of Commons on Monday. Some of the toughest restrictions are likely in Liverpool, where there has been a surge in recent infections. London is also expected to be placed under new restrictions, mayor Sadiq Khan warned.Van-Tam said: “Sadly, just as night follows day, increases in deaths will now follow on in the next few weeks. The good news, is that we are much more certain now that children are usually not badly affected by this virus.”“We now have much-improved testing capabilities, we know in more detail where the disease is, and we have better treatments. Earlier in the year we were fighting a semi-invisible disease, about which we had little knowledge, and it seeded in the community at great speed. Now we know where it is and how to tackle it – let’s grasp this opportunity and prevent history from repeating itself”, he added.Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week announced the extension and expansion of a job support scheme from November 1, to last until April 2021, indicating that the government is now assuming that the new set of measures would need to be in place for at least the next six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-curbs-from-monday-as-uk-back-at-tipping-point/story-oVCzyrObrAMquKecLOAwFJ.html
11-10-2020||World||Inhaled vaccines aim to fight coronavirus at Its point of attack||The Covid-19 vaccines closest to the finish line are designed to be injected into the arm. Researchers are looking at whether they can get better protection from inoculations that fight the virus at its point of attack — the nose and mouth.Most vaccines in human testing require two shots for effectiveness, and developers still aren’t even sure if they’ll prevent infections. Scientists are hoping to generate superior immune responses with inhaled vaccines that directly target the airway cells the virus invades.An alternative to conventional jabs, sprayed and inhaled immunizations under development in the U.S., Britain and Hong Kong could play an important role in helping society escape restrictions that have upended economies and everyday life. Among their goals is to prevent the pathogen from growing in the nose, a point from which it can spread to the rest of the body, and to other people.“Local immunity matters,” said Frances Lund, a University of Alabama at Birmingham immunologist working with biotech Altimmune Inc. on an early-stage nasal inoculation. “The vaccines that can be delivered to generate that will have some advantages over vaccines that are delivered systemically.”Most early vaccine developers focused on a familiar route — injections — seen as the fastest to protecting the world from disease. Inhaled vaccine makers are counting on some of the unique features of the lungs, nose and throat, which are lined with mucosa. This tissue contains high levels of immune proteins, called IgA, that give better protection against respiratory viruses.Activating these immune weapons, they theorize, can protect areas deeper in the lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 does the most damage. They also may improve vaccines’ chances of blocking transmission.“The first generation of vaccines are probably going to protect a lot of people,” said Michael Diamond, an infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. “But I think it’s the second- and third-generation vaccines — and maybe intranasal vaccines will be a key component of this — that ultimately are going to be necessary. Otherwise, we’ll continue to have community transmission.”In a study of mice in August, Diamond and his team found that delivering an experimental vaccine via the nose created a strong immune response throughout the body; the approach was especially effective in the nose and respiratory tract, preventing infection from taking hold. India’s Bharat Biotech and St. Louis-based Precision Virologics last month obtained rights to the single-dose technology.Vaccines that are sprayed into the nose or inhaled may hold other practical benefits. They don’t require needles, may not need to be stored and shipped at low temperatures and can reduce the need for health workers to administer them.“When you’re thinking about trying to deliver that across the world, if you don’t need to have an injectable vaccine, your compliance goes up because people don’t like getting shots,” according to Lund, the Alabama-based researcher. “But secondly, the level of expertise needed to administer that vaccine is significantly different.”Read More: Second-Generation Covid Vaccines Are Built for Impact Over SpeedAltimmune, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, plans to enter human testing with a nasal vaccine in the fourth quarter after positive studies in mice. Scientists at the University of Oxford, where a promising shot under development at AstraZeneca Plc was designed, and Imperial College London are also planning studies of slightly different inhaled vaccines.The experimental immunizations in Britain would be delivered through a mouthpiece in an aerosol, similar to some asthma therapies. Imperial researchers point to evidence that delivering influenza vaccines via a nasal spray can protect people against illness and help reduce transmission; they’re keen to explore if that’s also the case for SARS-CoV-2. AstraZeneca makes the FluMist nasal spray vaccine.Data from studies of the inhaled Oxford vaccine could come early in the new year, followed by Imperial results in the second quarter, according to Robin Shattock, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College.“We don’t know whether it will work well, but if it does, then it could be very important,” he said in an interview.Imperial College in recent months has been advancing studies of a Covid vaccine using RNA technology that would be delivered via conventional shots and plans to expand its trials to 20,000 people by year-end. Oxford, one of the front-runners in the global quest for an inoculation, is in the final stage of tests for a shot that uses a harmless virus to carry the genetic material of the pathogen into cells to generate an immune response. Both techniques may be conducive to inhalation, Shattock said.“This is a virus that’s transmitted through your respiratory tract, so if you want a vaccine that will really prevent infection and onward transmission you want to have an antibody response in your nose, in your lungs,” Shattock said. “The most efficient way to induce that is by inoculating through that route.”Researchers in Hong Kong are aiming for an intranasal vaccine that would simultaneously offer influenza and Covid-19 protection. The first phase of human tests will start next month, said Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology.The ambition is to come up with the “vaccine of choice,” as the world looks to build on the first wave of products, he said.Questions about the durability of nasal vaccines have yet to be resolved, and they’re at an early stage. Despite the advantages, the delivery devices are also more complex, according to Nick Jackson, head of programs and technology at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.“A needle and syringe work very well,” he said.Still, researchers said targeting the airways may pay off down the road. Oslo-based CEPI has provided funding to the Hong Kong project and is open to further investments in vaccines that are taking unconventional approaches as part of an effort to supply billions of doses to every corner of the world, Jackson said.“Whether it’s our vaccine or another one that goes through an intransasal route that actually is successful at disrupting transmission and disrupting the pandemic, I take my hat off,” Diamond said. “If we contribute by compelling or nudging these companies to think about an alternative route for what may be a successful platform, then we’ve done our job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inhaled-vaccines-aim-to-fight-coronavirus-at-its-point-of-attack/story-gdobAQr3aw6MhrKMrDYN8H.html

Prime Minister Imran Khan termed it “an attempt by India to create sectarian conflict across the country,” though no immediate evidence was given that India was behind the attack.Khan is the son of late prominent scholar Maulana Saleemullah Khan, who founded the grand seminary, Jamia Farooqia, decades ago. The seminary adheres to the Sunni Muslim teachings of the Deobandi sect, whose scholars have been the target of killings in the past.Khan held a doctorate in religious studies, received training in his father’s seminary and had taught in Malaysia.Police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon said the cleric and his driver were both killed in the attack Saturday evening, which took place in the middle class neighborhood of Shah Faisal Colony.Police said that when the cleric’s vehicle stopped in front of a busy shopping area, gunmen opened fire targeting the driver before firing three bullets that struck Khan’s head, neck and chest. The three attackers then fled on the back of a shared motorcycle.Khan was rushed to a private hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival, said the hospital’s spokesperson Anjum Rizvi. Police said the driver died before reaching a government hospital.Pakistan has a history of sectarian enmity between Sunni and Shiite extremists. Attacks by both sides have claimed hundreds of lives, including those of religious scholars.Counter-terrorism police officer Raja Umar Khitab said the attack appeared to be a “conspiracy to trigger sectarian violence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-cleric-murder-imran-khan-blames-india-for-triggering-sectarian-rift-but-fails-to-provide-evidence/story-A75AcWUI3ZLs2cX1hnNHdN.html

He is scheduled to address a rally in Florida on Monday, and in Pennsylvania and Iowa later in the week.His Democratic challenger Joe Biden was in Pennsylvania for the 11th time, wooing the battleground state that will play a critical role in deciding the election.Trump was no longer a transmission risk to others, his physician Sean Conley declared in a statement, adding the president had been without fever for 24 hours, all his symptoms had improved and there was no “longer evidence of actively replicating virus” in his body.“First of all, I’m feeling great. I don’t know about you. How’s everyone feeling? Good?” Trump said from a White House balcony overlooking his supporters who stood around below. He went on to claim the pandemic was disappearing and vaccines and therapeutics were on their way.Billed as a “peaceful protest in support of law and order,” the event marked the resumption of campaigning by the president a break forced by his illness. “We’re starting very, very big with our rallies…because we cannot allow our country to become a socialist nation,” Trump said.Trump trails Biden by 9.6 points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls and by 10.1 points in FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average of national polls. The gap is narrower in battleground states, which eventually determine the outcome in presidential elections because of electoral college.Biden was in one of them on Saturday, making his case with a promise of jobs and unity in Pennsylvania. “My plan is about making the kinds of investments that will stimulate the economy, to get us back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before,” Biden said in Erie.He added, with a reference to a campaign event in historic Gettysburg, also in Pennsylvania, recently, “As I said earlier this week on the sacred ground of Gettysburg, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’ll govern as an American president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-returns-to-campaign-with-wh-event-says-covid-19-disappearing/story-y5rcIgOAoeHRC0HSAob0XI.html

11-10-2020||World||Scientists question China’s ability to produce enough Covid-19 vaccine doses for export||China has four coronavirus vaccine candidates in stage 3 clinical trials. An official with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has publically pledged that an effective coronavirus vaccine may be available by the end of the year.State pharmaceutical giant China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and US-listed Sinovac Biotech are developing three of the vaccines under state’s emergency use programme while CanSino Biologics is developing the fourth.Also Read: China joins COVAX coronavirus vaccine allianceOn October 11, China also announced that it is joining the Covid-19 vaccine alliance known as COVAX. The country signed an agreement with GAVI, the co-leader of the alliance. China is joining the alliance to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. “We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,” she said, according to news agency Associated Press.As list of countries with which China has promised to share its vaccines continues to grow, scientists question whether it will be able to produce enough doses even if the vaccine is ready soon, said a report published on science journal Nature.The COVAX alliance, together with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, is aiming to provide 2 billion doses of vaccine to the most vulnerable people in poor countries, the report said, pointing out that the country’s drug regulator would need to wait till data proves that the vaccines are safe and effective before granting them full approval.Also Read: China coronavirus vaccine may be ready for public in November: Official“Until then, there are still uncertainties,” Wu Guizhen, the chief biosafety expert at CDC told Nature.According to Zheng Zhongwei, the head of the Chinese government’s Covid-19 vaccine task force, China will have capacity to produce 600 million vaccine doses by the end of the year, and one billion next year. However, since the country has a largely unvaccinated population of 1.4 billion people, there would not be many doses left for export. In addition to the mismatch of demand and supply, a problem of approval by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is persists. If China commits doses of vaccines, they would need to be approved by these organisations and currently not one of the four leading vaccine candidates are on the list of vaccines supported by the CEPI, according to the science journal report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-question-china-s-ability-to-produce-enough-covid-19-vaccine-doses-for-export/story-aGGJlSiniqt7VquDsbjRzI.html

11-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un reveals largest liquid-fuelled missile designed to carry multiple warheads: Report||The gargantuan new missile North Korea put on show at a military parade is an explicit threat to US defences and an implicit challenge to both the current and next American president, analysts say, warning Pyongyang could test the weapon next year.Leader Kim Jong Un watched the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) roll through Kim Il Sung square -- named after his grandfather -- in Pyongyang at the climax of an unprecedented night-time parade on Saturday.A consensus rapidly emerged among analysts that it was the largest road-mobile, liquid-fuelled missile anywhere in the world, and was highly likely to be designed to carry multiple warheads in independent re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies said it was “clearly aimed at overwhelming the US missile defense system in Alaska”. It was “much cheaper for North Korea to add warheads than for the US to add interceptors”, he added on Twitter.If the ICBM carried three or four warheads, he explained, the US would need to spend around $1 billion on 12-16 interceptors for each missile.“At that cost, I am pretty sure North Korea can add warheads faster than we can add interceptors.”The missile was estimated at 24 metres long and 2.5 metres in diameter, which specialist Markus Schiller said was big enough to carry 100 tonnes of fuel, which would take hours to load.It was so big and heavy that it was practically unusable, he added: “You can’t move this thing fuelled, and you can’t fill it at the launch site. “This thing makes absolutely no sense at all, except for threat equation games, like sending the message of ‘we now have a mobile ICBM with MIRVs, be very afraid’.”North Korea watchers regularly caution that the devices Pyongyang puts on show at its parades may be mock-ups or models, and there is no proof they work until they are tested.But the missile was carried on an enormous and previously unseen 11-axle transporter-erector-launcher, far larger than the eight-axle Chinese-made vehicles the North has employed so far.“The truck may be a scarier story than the missile,” said Melissa Hanham of the Open Nuclear Network. “If the DPRK is indigenously producing their own chassis, then there is less of a constraint on the number of ICBMs they can launch.”- Red lines -Shortly before being inaugurated in 2017, Donald Trump tweeted that North Korea developing a weapon capable of reaching parts of the US “won’t happen!”.He spent the first year of his presidency -- which saw the North launch an ICBM with the range to do exactly that -- in an escalating war of words with Kim before an extraordinary diplomatic bromance developed between them.But nuclear negotiations have been deadlocked since the collapse of their Hanoi summit early last year over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.The ICBM was proof that the North had continued to develop its arsenal throughout the diplomatic process, analysts said, and gave Pyongyang greater heft to demand a return to the negotiating table.The spectacle was aimed at the next administration, whoever headed it following next month’s presidential election, said Suzanne DiMaggio of the Carnegie Endowment.“Kim relayed -- and demonstrated -- that North Korea’s nuclear deterrent is at its strongest,” she said. “His key messages: There isn’t a viable military option against us. Deal with us on this basis.”More than 12 hours after the end of the parade broadcast on North Korean state television Trump had not yet tweeted about it -- and nor had his Democratic rival Joe Biden.Trump has made much of Kim’s promise not to carry out any further ICBM or nuclear tests, and Shin Beom-chul of the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy said that by displaying the missile rather than launching it, Pyongyang had stopped short of crossing his red lines.“But it also signals that North Korea could carry out a launch if Trump is re-elected and ignores the North Korean issue,” he told AFP, adding: “If Biden is elected and he doesn’t listen to North Korea, it will carry out a launch.”sh-slb/gle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-reveals-largest-liquid-fuelled-missile-designed-to-carry-multiple-warheads-report/story-AXRBApwfAWeeje43s8wGEJ.html
11-10-2020||World||US Covid-19 cases hit two-month high, 10 states report record increases||New cases of Covid-19 in the United States hit a two-month high on Friday with over 58,000 infections of the coronavirus reported and hospitalizations in the Midwest at record levels for a fifth day in a row, according to a Reuters analysis. Ten of the 50 states reported record one-day rises in cases on Friday, including the Midwestern states of Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio. Wisconsin and Illinois recorded over 3,000 new cases for a second day in a row - a two-day trend not seen even during the height of the previous outbreak in the spring, according to Reuters data. The Western states of Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming also reported their biggest one-day jumps in cases, as did Oklahoma and West Virginia.Nineteen states have seen record increases in new cases so far in October. Amid the resurgence in cases across the nation, President Donald Trump, who recently contracted Covid-19, addressed his supporters from the balcony of the White House on Saturday, a prelude to restarting his re-election campaign.He is scheduled to travel on Monday to Florida.Also Read: Trump no longer at risk of transmitting Covid-19: White House doctorTrump and his administration have faced criticism for their handling of the pandemic that has claimed over 213,000 lives in the country, as well as for a lax approach to mask-wearing and social distancing in the White House.While deaths nationally continue to trend downward, the United States is losing on average 700 lives a day. Three states reported a record one-day increase in fatalities on Friday: Arkansas, Missouri and Montana. Health experts caution that deaths are a lagging indicator and usually rise weeks after cases climb.The number of people who succumb to Covid-19 is expected to accelerate this winter.The country’s daily death rate is projected to more than triple by mid-January to 2,250, with an overall 395,000 fatalities by Feb. 1, 2021, according to a new update of the University of Washington’s widely-cited model.But if Americans increase their wearing of masks to the level seen in Singapore, the Feb. 1 death toll would drop to 316,000, saving 79,000 lives, according to the University’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, whose model has been cited by the White House Coronavirus Task Force.Currently, there is no federal mandate to wear a mask, and 17 states do not require them, according to a Reuters analysis.In addition to rising cases, hospitals in several states are straining to handle an influx of patients.Seven states on Friday reported record numbers of hospitalized Covid-19 patients: Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. In the Midwest, hospitalizations rose to nearly 9,000, continuing a streak of records that began on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-hit-two-month-high-10-states-report-record-increases/story-eSvlYPILnqoqMEFyMz2CiK.html

Abu Dhabi and Ankara also back opposing sides in Libya’s conflict.“The Turkish military presence in the Arab Gulf is an emergency,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s state minister for foreign affairs, said on Twitter on Saturday.“It reinforces polarisation, and it does not take into account the sovereignty of states and the interests of the Gulf countries and its people.”The United States, seeking a united Gulf front against Iran, has tried to resolve the row in which Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and non-Gulf Egypt severed political, trade and travel links with Qatar over accusations that it backs militants and is cosying up to regional foe Iran.Doha, which hosts the region’s largest U.S. military base, denies the accusations and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty.On Sept. 9, the State Department’s top diplomat for the Middle East, David Schenker, said there may be some progress in resolving the rift within weeks, citing signs of “flexibility in negotiations”, ahead of U.S. elections.Diplomats and Gulf sources have confirmed talks between Riyadh and Doha after negotiations that broke down early this year, but there have been no signs yet of a breakthrough.In a recent documentary on Al Jazeera television, Qatar’s state minister for defence accused boycotting nations of having planned to invade Qatar, a charge they have denied in the past.Riyadh’s former intelligence chief, in televised remarks this month, described Qatar as a “tick on a camel”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-official-says-turkey-s-army-in-qatar-destabilises-region/story-yQvyDMjrFJKCoesQnHI4FN.html

11-10-2020||World||Pakistan opposition parties accuse army of meddling with polls||For the first time, Pakistan’s two major Opposition parties have come out openly against the country’s powerful military, accusing it of rigging the 2018 elections that brought Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party to power. In the past, political leaders have only indirectly pointed to the involvement of the military establishment in the country’s political affairs but this is the first time that the leaders of the two main Opposition parties -- the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) have openly criticised the military. Former prime minister and PML-N supremo Sharif, who is in London since November last year and facing a number of corruption cases, fired the first salvo at the inaugural meeting of the Pakistan Democratic Movement, an alliance formed by Opposition parties last month to oust Prime Minister Khan. Sharif alleged that the military rigged the 2018 elections to bring Prime Minister Khan to power. He said interfering in politics in uniform amounts to treason under the country’s Constitution. His allegations sparked an angry response from Khan, who said Sharif was “playing a very dangerous game” by humiliating the military and intelligence services. He dismissed the allegations of rigged elections as baseless. Sharif served as Pakistan’s prime minister three times, first removed by a president in 1993, then by military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 1999. A court in 2017 ousted him from power over corruption allegations. Khan, a former cricketer, came to power in 2018. After Sharif, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday accused the military of rigging the 2018 elections. Bilawal warned that any interference in the coming legislative assembly elections in Gilgit-Baltistan would lead to a strong reaction from his party, including a siege of Islamabad and a sit-in in the city. “Such things were never witnessed even in dictatorships of General Zia and Gen Musharraf,” Bilawal was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper. “I wonder how you deploy a soldier inside and another outside the polling station. That was so strange. Even if you (military establishment) have done something wrong or not, you would be blamed either way. This should not happen,” he said. He said the “PPP would not allow anyone to steal the peoples mandate in the coming elections in Gilgit-Baltistan.” Pakistan has announced that the once-postponed election for the legislative assembly of Gilgit-Baltistan will be held on November 15, amidst India’s strong objection to Islamabad’s move to alter the status of the militarily-occupied region. India also clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country. Pakistan’s military top brasses have in recent times advised political parties to stop dragging them into politics and making baseless accusations against them. Prime Minister Khan on Friday said the Opposition’s real issue with the military is that they remained unable to control the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) unlike other institutions after the agency found out about their corruption. On September 20, the leaders of 11 major Opposition parties formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to launch a three-phased anti-government movement under an “action plan” starting with countrywide public meetings, protest demonstrations and rallies before a “decisive long march” towards Islamabad in January 2021. The Opposition parties will hold their first combined rally against the Imran Khan-led government on October 16 in Gujranwala city in Punjab province, demanding to oust the “selected” prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the powerful military in the country’s politics. The Opposition leaders had announced that they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek “the selected prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the establishment in politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-parties-accuse-army-of-meddling-with-polls/story-Ab1QB6iYwiHgerzmdiLUyM.html
11-10-2020||World||Brazil reaches 150,000 deaths from Covid-19 milestone||Brazil’s count of Covid-19 deaths surpassed 150,000 on Saturday night, despite signs the pandemic is slowly retreating in Latin America’s largest nation.The Brazilian Health Ministry reported that the death toll now stands at 150,198. The figure is the world’s second highest behind the United States, according to the tally maintained by John Hopkins University.The milestone has rekindled the pain of Naiane Moura, a sales consultant, who lost her father Elivaldo to Covid-19 in April. The 58-year-old postman had no prior illness and battled Covid-19 for seven days in a public hospital in Manaus, Brazil’s largest city in the Amazon.“When I see 150,000, I see my father alongside many other faceless bodies,” Moura said by phone. “I didn’t imagine that we would reach that number. I don’t believe that we will ever be able to totally overcome this.” Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro played down the severity of the virus while deaths mounted rapidly in Brazil. The 65-year-old president flouted social distancing at lively demonstrations and encouraged crowds during outings from the presidential residence.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBolsonaro rejected governors’ and mayors’ lockdowns and other tough measures to contain the virus’ spread, even after he contracted it himself in July, and insisted that shutting down Brazil’s economy would pitch the nation into chaos.“Life goes on. Brazil needs to produce,” he said on July 7 in Brasilia when he announced he was infected.Moura’s hometown of Manaus became a horror show early on in the pandemic. Between April and May, the health system collapsed in the city as patients were turned away from full hospitals and overwhelmed cemeteries were forced to dig mass graves. The capital of Amazonas state has had 122 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, far above the national average of 71 per 100,000. The nation of 210 million people surpassed 5 million confirmed infections on Wednesday, according to official data.There have been recent signs of relief in Brazil. Over the last month and a half, the viral curve has dropped. The average number of deaths sat at 598 over the last seven days, the lowest level since the beginning of May.The mayors of large cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro continue to reopen activities like cinemas and schools, even as public health experts warn of possible new outbreaks.Manaus, where restrictions were relaxed, registered an increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks that led to speculation of a possible second wave. Local authorities reinstituted restrictions on commerce and activity, and shut down the riverside beach.Moura said she holds federal authorities responsible for the massive death toll.“A lot of lives could have been saved if our leaders had taken rigorous measures in the beginning,” she said.Bolsonaro has faced fierce criticism of his handling of the health crisis, and changed health ministers twice in the midst of the pandemic.Yet his popularity is at its highest since he took office in January 2019, which political analysts attribute to his distribution of emergency cash to help tens of millions of poorer Brazilians withstand the economic downturn.Some 40 per cent of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Ibope rate their government as good or excellent, according to a poll published on September 24 that has a margin for error of two percentage points. “Bolsonaro helped the population to open their eyes. Health has to go hand in hand with the economy,” said Paulo Gomes, 54, a taxi driver who supports Bolsonaro.In Sao Paulo, Ricardo Vieira, a doctor working in one of the city’s largest working-class neighbourhoods known as favelas, said the government’s Covid-19 cash transfer program wasn’t enough to shield the poor, who often have scarce access to healthcare.To remedy the lack of support in the Paraisopolis favela, an NGO called G10 hired three private ambulances and eight health professionals, among them Dr Vieira, who has been there since March.“We are dealing with lives, and when we came to a poor community we saw that the government cannot reach these people.” Vieira told The Associated Press.Despite the difficulties and the lack of resources, Vieira continues to fight to contain the pandemic’s devastation.“I do what I can, I do my best,” Vieira said, as tears welled up then rolled down his cheek. “And I don’t know what else I could do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-reaches-150-000-deaths-from-covid-19-milestone/story-sbALp8LwIV5bOZIxMKmQhN.html
11-10-2020||World||Trump no longer at risk of transmitting Covid-19: White House doctor||President Donald Trump’s doctor said Saturday the president is no longer at risk of transmitting the coronavirus.In a memo, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley says Trump meets the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation and that by “currently recognized standards” he is no longer considered a transmission risk.The memo follows Trump’s first public appearance since returning to the White House after being treated for the coronavirus. Hundreds of people gathered Saturday afternoon on the South Lawn for a Trump address on his support for law enforcement from a White House balcony.Trump took off a mask moments after he emerged on the balcony to address the crowd on the lawn below, his first step back onto the public stage with just more than three weeks to go until Election Day. He flouted, once more, the safety recommendations of his own government just days after acknowledging that he was on the brink of “bad things” from the virus and claiming that his bout with the illness brought him a better understanding of it.Also Read | Donald Trump makes first public appearance since hospital release; White House won’t say if he’s still contagious with coronavirusHis return was a brief one. With bandages visible on his hands, likely from an intravenous injection, Trump spoke for 18 minutes, far less than at his normal hour-plus rallies. He appeared healthy, if perhaps a little hoarse, as he delivered what was, for all intents and purposes, a short version of his campaign speech despite the executive mansion setting.Though billed as an official event, Trump offered no policy proposals and instead delivered the usual attacks on Democrat Joe Biden while praising law enforcement to a crowd of several hundred, most of whom wore masks while few adhered to social distancing guidelines.“I’m feeling great,” said Trump, who said he was thankful for their good wishes and prayers as he recovered. He then declared that the pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans, was “disappearing” even though he is still recovering from the virus.In either an act of defiance or simply tempting fate, officials organized the crowd just steps from the Rose Garden, where exactly two weeks ago the president held another large gathering to formally announce his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. That event is now being eyed as a possible Covid-19 superspreader as more than two dozen people in attendance have contracted the virus.Trump had hoped to hold campaign rallies this weekend but settled for the White House event. But even as his health remained unclear, he planned to ramp up his travel with a rally in Florida on Monday, followed by trips to Pennsylvania and Iowa on subsequent days. It was not clear if Trump posed a risk to those he would fly with on Air Force One or encounter at the rally sites.Before the speech, White House officials said they had no information to release on whether the president was tested for Covid-19, meaning he made his first public appearance without the White House verifying that he’s no longer contagious.Security was stepped up around the White House before the event, which was called a “peaceful protest for law & order” and predominantly attended by Black and Latino supporters. Police and the Secret Service closed surrounding streets to vehicles and shut down Lafayette Square, the park near the White House that has long been a gathering place for public protest.As questions linger about his health — and Democratic opponent Joe Biden steps up his own campaigning — Trump has more frequently called into radio and TV programs to speak with conservative interviewers, hoping to make up for lost time with just over three weeks until Election Day and millions already voting.Biden’s campaign said he again tested negative on Saturday for Covid19. Biden was potentially exposed to the coronavirus during his Sept. 29 debate with Trump, who announced his positive diagnosis barely 48 hours after the debate.The president had not been seen in public — other than in White House-produced videos — since his return five days ago from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he received experimental treatments for the coronavirus.On Saturday, all attendees were required to bring masks or were provided with them, and were given temperature checks and asked to fill out a brief questionnaire. Some in the crowd removed their mask to listen to Trump.Trump’s Monday event in Sanford, Florida, what he’s described as a “BIG RALLY,” was originally scheduled to be held on Oct. 2, the day after he tested positive. Ahead of his Saturday event, Trump used Twitter to share news articles about problems with mail-in ballots in New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims that universal mail-in voting is beset by widespread fraud.Trump’s return to public activity came as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, cautioned the White House again to avoid large-scale gatherings of people without masks.He said of the Barrett event in an interview with The Associated Press, “I was not surprised to see a superspreader event given the circumstances.” That means “crowded, congregate setting, not wearing masks. It is not surprising to see an outbreak,” he said.District of Columbia virus restrictions prohibit outdoor gatherings larger than 50 people, although that rule has not been strictly enforced. Masks are mandatory outdoors for most people, but the regulations don’t apply on federal land, and the Trump White House has openly flouted them for months.Confined to the White House as he recovers, Trump spent sizable chunks of the past few days making the rounds of friendly conservative media, calling in to Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night and spending two hours live on air with radio host Rush Limbaugh on Friday in what his campaign billed as a “radio rally.”Holding court on his reelection battle, his fight against the coronavirus and revived negotiations with Democrats to pass an economic stimulus bill, Trump made a direct appeal to his base of loyal supporters, whom he needs to turn out to the polls in droves.In a Friday night interview on Fox’s Tucker Carlson’s show, Trump was asked if he has been retested for Covid-19. “I have been retested, and I haven’t even found out numbers or anything yet. But I’ve been retested, and I know I’m at either the bottom of the scale or free,” he said.White House officials, however, have declined to answer when Trump last tested negative for the virus before his diagnosis or release detailed information about lung scans taken while Trump was hospitalized.Aides to the president insist that it is safe for Trump to return to his regular activities, including campaigning. CDC guidelines call for the infected to wait at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms, Fauci noted in the AP interview. That onset for Trump was Oct. 1, according to his doctors.Conley added that Trump was showing no evidence of his illness progressing or adverse reactions to the aggressive course of therapy he has received.While reports of reinfection in Covid-19 victims are rare, the CDC recommends that even people who recover from the disease continue to wear masks, stay distanced and follow other precautions. It was unclear if Trump, who has refused mask wearing in most settings, would abide by that guidance as he resumes his campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-no-longer-at-risk-of-transmitting-covid-19-white-house-doctor/story-YXlgzcLBNUiTRoZmC3omUL.html
11-10-2020||World||Hurricane Delta leaves Louisianans reeling and out of power, as the clean-up begins||Weary residents of coastal Louisiana began cleaning up on Saturday from wind and water damage inflicted by Hurricane Delta to their already storm-battered region, even as it weakened and moved northeast.Delta made landfall near the town of Creole in Cameron Parish early Friday evening as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, packing sustained winds of 100 miles per hour.Though not as powerful as August’s Hurricane Laura, a Category 4 storm that tore homes and businesses apart, Delta toppled trees and power poles, leaving hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast residents without power.Also Read: Oil explorers get back to work after hurricane Delta rakes LouisianaThe storm weakened to a tropical depression as it moved inland to western Mississippi, according to the National Hurricane Center, but still carried heavy rains.Sylvia Pastrano, 65, said the roof of her Lake Charles, Louisiana home leaked from Delta’s rains after being initially damaged by Laura. She positioned three trash cans over her bed to catch the water.“We were debating whether to leave or not but my husband has got orthopedic issues and I do too and we’re just too exhausted to even get up and evacuate,” Pastrano said. “Last night it was terrifying, the whistling and whistling.”Delta brought widespread flooding of streets and riverbanks, mostly in southwestern Louisiana, tracking the path of destruction left by Laura but causing damage over a larger swath of the Gulf Coast.“Even if it wasn’t quite as powerful as Hurricane Laura, it was much bigger,” Governor John Bel Edwards told a briefing in Baton Rouge.Some 3,000 National Guard troops had been called up to distribute relief supplies, clear roads, maintain security and conduct search and rescue operations, the governor said.600,000 WITHOUT POWERWhile no deaths have so far been linked to Delta, Edwards said storm-related fatalities often occur in accidents such as falls, during clean-up operations, or from carbon monoxide poisoning from residents using home generators.About 600,000 of the state’s electric customers, 25% of the total, were without power at midday, Edwards said. But restoration was progressing faster than it did after Laura because Delta’s winds were less damaging to the infrastructure, he said.Also Read: With whipping winds, Delta drenches Louisiana, MississippiLaura’s winds damaged tens of thousands of homes, leaving roofs across the region dotted with blue tarpaulins. More than 6,000 people were still living temporarily in hotels when Delta struck.Delta spared many of the rooftop tarps that were still up, but deluged some streets and littered others with downed trees and branches.“Laura was much worse,” said Lake Charles resident Matthew Williams, 49. “This was more rain than wind.”Williams, who had just gotten his power back about a week and a half ago after the outage left by Laura, said he rode out the storm at his home.With the sun shining brightly, Frederick Hannie, 35, surveyed the water damage to his gym, CrossFit Lake Charles, which had already sustained wind and roof damage from Laura.Between two hurricanes and the coronavirus pandemic, Hannie said, “it definitely takes a little financial gymnastics” to run a business this year.As Delta made its way over the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, energy companies cut back US oil production by about 92%, or 1.7 million barrels per day - the most since 2005’s Hurricane Katrina.While the storm is expected to continue weakening, it is forecast to bring rain though Tennessee, Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley through early next week.Delta was the tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season to make US landfall this year, eclipsing a record dating to 1916.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-delta-leaves-louisianans-reeling-and-out-of-power-as-the-clean-up-begins/story-OgOfaWmG4X4Nz0Xylpw73L.html

11-10-2020||World||28 arrested, tear gas used in Wisconsin protests||Police used tear gas on demonstrators and arrested 28 people during a third straight night of protests over the lack of charges against a suburban Milwaukee police officer who fatally shot a Black teen, authorities said, as they took to Twitter on Saturday to outline what they called an “escalation in force by the protesters.”About 100 people gathered outside City Hall on Friday past Wauwatosa’s 7 p.m. curfew and refused multiple orders to disperse, according to police. Police said they used tear gas on the crowd, after bottles were thrown at officers.On Saturday, the Wauwatosa Police Department posted on Twitter that people have been asking valid questions about the police response over three nights of protests. Police posted a picture of bottles they said were found in a backpack, including a bottle of lighter fluid, noting that the materials can be used to start fires.Also Read | Alvin Cole killing: No charges for Wisconsin police officer“Over the past three nights, we have seen an escalation in force by the protesters. Our law enforcement response is in reaction to this escalation,” police tweeted. They said that on Friday night, protestors had Molotov cocktails and other fire starting supplies and guns were spotted in the crowd.Protesters have gathered every day since prosecutors announced Wednesday that they would not charge Officer Joseph Mensah in 17-year-old Alvin Cole’s death. Mensah, who is Black, shot Cole after a foot chase outside a Wauwatosa mall in February.The police department’s tweets come as some have chastised authorities for the way they have handled the protests. During Thursday night’s demonstration, police arrested Alvin Cole’s mother, Tracy Cole, and his sisters. Family attorney Kimberly Motley criticized the way police treated the family, noting Tracy Cole had to be treated for injuries.In a tweet addressing the police chief and mayor on Friday, Motley said “due to your failed leadership you have turned Wauwatosa into a war zone!’About an hour after Friday’s curfew went into effect, law enforcement began advancing toward the crowd. Police said they used chemical irritants, which they described as tear gas, as well as pepper balls and paint balls after bottles and rocks were thrown at them. Video posted to Twitter by local reporters showed heavy smoke in the air as police advanced, and multiple people taken into custody.Windows were broken at a Snap Fitness center, police said.Police said two of Friday’s 28 arrests were for felonies, one was for a misdemeanor and 25 were for municipal citations. Police noted that some of the people arrested were blocking traffic, others had tried to start fires, and one person had materials to start a fire. Another person in the group posted a picture of himself with a handgun, authorities added, though it was not clear if he was among those arrested.Two people arrested were evaluated for minor injuries, police said.One of the arrestees was driving in one of three vehicles that had come to the Wauwatosa Police Department early Saturday. The vehicle almost hit an officer, according to police. The driver got into a second vehicle, and police arrested the person after a short chase, authorities said.“We can appreciate the anger and frustration that exists among those closely affected by recent events,” police said in a statement Saturday. They asked people to continue to comply with the 7 p.m. curfew, which was to be in effect again on Saturday and Sunday nights. The National Guard is assisting local police.The protests in Wauwatosa are just the latest in a series of demonstrations against police racism and brutality that have erupted across the country since George Floyd’s death. Floyd, who was Black, died in May after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck as Floyd gasped that he couldn’t breathe.The co-founder and publisher of The Daily Caller said two of his reporters were beaten and detained by police in Wauwatosa on Thursday as they were videotaping Tracy Cole’s arrest. Numerous journalists have been injured or arrested while covering protests nationwide in recent months.Neil Patel, who founded the conservative news outlet with Tucker Carlson, said in a statement that reporters Shelby Talcott and Richie McGinniss “were brutally beaten with clubs for no reason,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.A message seeking comment from the Wauwatosa Police Department was not immediately returned to The Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/28-arrested-tear-gas-used-in-wisconsin-protests/story-eMsZifGjLKbAjzOy3u83WL.html
11-10-2020||World||US slams China’s LAC deployment||China has sent 60,000 troops near India’s northern border, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said while citing a previously unreported number as he sharply criticised Beijing for its “bad behaviour” and threats it posed to the Quad nations, a remark that comes amid heightened tensions between India and its neighbour over a standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Foreign ministers from the Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group – India, the US, Japan and Australia – met in Tokyo on Tuesday in first such talks since the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic began earlier this year. Members of the Quad pushed for a rules-based global order and peaceful resolution of disputes in the face of China’s growing aggression across the Indo-Pacific.“The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border,” Pompeo told The Guy Benson Show in an interview on Friday after returning from Tokyo. He also commended India for “diplomatically” pushing back by banning Chinese apps and ending government procurements of supplies made in China. “I was with my foreign minister counterparts from India, Australia, and Japan – a format that we call the Quad, four big democracies, four powerful economies, four nations, each of whom has real risk associated with the threats imposed – attempting to be imposed by the Chinese Communist Party. And they see it in their home countries, too,” he said.Pompeo said US President Donald Trump vowed “to take seriously the threat from General Secretary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, and we’re no longer going to allow them to run around cost-free and impose their vision for the future upon the West”. He also criticised China’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its telecommunication infrastructure, and said the country steals intellectual property. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials on Pompeo’s latest remarks on Chinese troop deployment.Against the backdrop of the five-month border standoff with China, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said in his opening remarks at the Tokyo meet that India and the other members of Quad remain committed to a rules-based international order, “underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes”. At the meet, Pompeo said it was critical for partners in the Quad to collaborate to “protect our people and partners from the [Chinese Communist Party]’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion” that had been witnessed in the South and East China Sea, “the Mekong, the Himalayas [and] the Taiwan Straits”. Tensions have spiked on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake, where troops from the two sides are within close range of each other and where there have been several instances of firing since late August. Sharp divergences remained between the two countries even after they framed a five-point roadmap for easing tensions on the disputed border and speeding up the disengagement of troops.Pompeo met Jaishankar and they underscored the need to work together to advance, peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe. He described his meeting with Jaishankar as “productive.” “They see, the people of their (Quad) nations understanding that we all slept on this for too long. For decades, the West allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us. The previous administration bent a knee, too often allowed China to steal our intellectual properties and the millions of jobs that came along with it. They see that in their country too,” he said in the interview. The US secretary of state spoke of the India-China conflict along with other issues in a string of interviews that were the first since he travelled to Japan for the meeting of the ministers of the Quad.Underscoring the need for America to be engaged in the region and to stand with allies and friends, the US secretary of state said on the Larry O’Connor show: “They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight. But they’ve all seen it, whether it’s the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the northeastern part of India – right? – the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north.”On the Hugh Hewitt show, Pompeo spoke of India’s pushback. “The Indians have banned dozens and dozens of Chinese apps, and the Indians have stopped having their government purchase any product from China. That’s remarkable. It’s work that has been done diplomatically, and then there’s the security issues too.” The US, which has since banned several Chinese apps, has strongly condemned Chinese aggression along the Indian border, and has been supportive of New Delhi.In an interview to Fox News, Pompeo said the US has begun to build out all the edifice of the structure and the allies and the coalition to push back against China. “Look, they’ve stacked 60,000 soldiers against the Indians in the north. When the Australians had the temerity to ask for an investigation of the Wuhan virus... something that we know a lot about, the Chinese Communist Party threatened them. They bullied them,” Pompeo said. With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slams-china-s-lac-deployment/story-6Si2if2ixqWEgnGL0WGdfM.html
11-10-2020||World||Five things to know about court nominee Amy Coney Barrett||Confirmation hearings begin Monday for President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. If confirmed, the 48-year-old appeals court judge would fill the seat of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month.Ginsburg’s replacement by Barrett, a conservative, would shift the balance on the court significantly right, from 5-4 in favor of conservatives to 6-3. Here are 5 things to know about her:EDUCATION:Barrett was born in Louisiana and attended Rhodes College, a liberal arts school in Memphis, Tennessee, as an undergraduate. She went to law school in Indiana, at Notre Dame, on a full scholarship. She’d be the only justice on the current court not to have attended either Harvard or Yale for law school.Barrett was a law professor at Notre Dame for 15 years before Trump nominated her to become a federal appeals court judge in 2017.JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY:Barret has said that her judicial philosophy is the same as that of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whom she worked for after law school and has called a mentor. Scalia described himself as an “originalist,” interpreting laws and the Constitution based on what they were understood to mean when they were written.“Judges must apply the law as written,” Barrett said when she spoke at the announcement of her nomination in the White House Rose Garden last month. “Judges are not policymakers.”RECORD:Barrett’s short tenure as a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has led to few noteworthy or controversial opinions. She has, however, signed onto several decisions that she is sure to be questioned about during her confirmation hearing.In 2018, a three-judge panel ruled that Indiana laws requiring that funerals be held for fetal remains after an abortion or miscarriage and banning abortions because of the sex, race or developmental disability of a fetus were unconstitutional.Barrett was among four judges who wanted the full court to weigh in and suggested that the laws might be constitutional. And last year, after a three-judge panel blocked an Indiana law that would make it harder for a minor to have an abortion without her parents being notified, Barrett voted to have the case reheard by the full court.In a dissent in a 2019 gun-rights case, Barrett argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony shouldn’t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun. Also in 2019 Barrett wrote a unanimous three-judge panel decision making it easier for men alleged to have committed sexual assaults on campus to challenge the proceedings against them.FAITH:Barrett would be the seventh member of the court either to be Catholic or have been raised Catholic. But she’s been somewhat more vocal about her faith than other members, and faith became a flashpoint during her confirmation to be an appeals court judge.At Notre Dame, a Catholic university, Barrett was a member of University Faculty for Life. And in 2006 she signed her name to a newspaper ad sponsored by an anti-abortion group in which she said she opposed “abortion on demand” and defended “the right to life from fertilization to the end of natural life.” Barrett’s membership in a Christian group called People of Praise has also drawn scrutiny, as has a law review article she co-authored decades ago that concluded that Catholic judges are “morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty.”At Barrett’s 2017 confirmation hearing, Democrats questioned whether her personal views would color her legal judgment, especially with respect to the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at one point told Barrett she was concerned “that the dogma lives loudly within you.” That remark prompted an outcry from Catholic leaders.FAMILY:Barrett has joked that the president asked her to be the ninth justice and that she’s used to being in a group of nine: her family.“While I am a judge I’m better known back home as a room parent, carpool driver and birthday party planner,” Barrett said in September.Barrett and her husband, Jesse, a lawyer, are the parents of seven children: Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet, and Benjamin. Vivian and John Peter are adopted and were born in Haiti. And Benjamin, their youngest child, has Down syndrome. Barrett has said that Benjamin’s “brothers and sisters unreservedly identify him as their favorite sibling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-things-to-know-about-court-nominee-amy-coney-barrett/story-KmA0hAeyJbwCQf08lyjR0I.html
11-10-2020||World||White House coronavirus aid offer is panned by Pelosi, Senate GOP||A new White House coronavirus aid offer got bad reviews from both ends of the political spectrum on Saturday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., rejected the most generous Trump administration plan to date as “one step forward, two steps back.” The Republicans who control the Senate dismissed it as too expensive and a political loser for conservatives.Pelosi said she is still hopeful that progress can be made toward a deal but it’s as clear as ever that GOP conservatives don’t want a deal on her terms.The White House had boosted its offer before Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi spoke on Friday afternoon. President Donald Trump is eager for an agreement before Election Day, even as his most powerful GOP ally in the Senate said Congress is unlikely to deliver relief by then.“Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!” Trump said Friday on Twitter.The new offer totals about $1.8 trillion, aides familiar with it said, with a key state and local fiscal relief component moving from $250 billion to at least $300 billion. The White House says its most recent offer before that was about $1.6 trillion. The aides were not authorized to publicly discuss private negotiations and spoke on condition of anonymity.Pelosi’s most recent public offer was about $2.2 trillion, though that included a business tax increase that Republicans won’t go for.In a letter Saturday to colleagues, Pelosi said, “This proposal amounted to one step forward, two steps back. When the president talks about wanting a bigger relief package, his proposal appears to mean that he wants more money at his discretion to grant or withhold.”She said that while his administration attempted to address some of the Democratic concerns, disagreement remained on many priorities and Democrats are “awaiting language” on several provisions.“Despite these unaddressed concerns, I remain hopeful that yesterday’s developments will move us closer to an agreement on a relief package that addresses the health and economic crisis facing America’s families,” Pelosi’s letter said.Mnuchin’s latest offer also got a roasting from GOP senators, who weighed in on a conference call Saturday morning, according to a Republican familiar with the call who was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Many conservatives are skeptical of so much deficit-financed aid in the first place, and Pelosi-sought provisions such as expanding eligibility for the Affordable Care Act landed with a thud.Pragmatists such as Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio and politically endangered Republicans including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina appear willing to “go big” as Trump wants. But rank-and-file Republicans — Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Rick Scott of Florida, and John Barrasso of Wyoming, for example — are adamantly opposed to another relief bill that’s so generous.GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remains skeptical of the chances for an agreement, having told an audience in Kentucky on Friday that he didn’t see a deal coming together before Election Day.“I think it’s unlikely in the next three weeks,” McConnell said Friday. He said later that “the first item of priority of the Senate is the Supreme Court,” suggesting there isn’t time to process both a relief bill and the high court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett before the Nov. 3 election.President Donald Trump has been all over the map, first as one of the forces in favor of a deal, then killing the talks on Tuesday, only to revive them by weeks’ end.On Tuesday, he ordered an end to the weekslong talks after being told that few Republicans in Congress would end up voting for a possible Pelosi-Mnuchin deal. Now, after a political beating, Trump is pressing hard for a deal, motivated by the prospect of sending $1,200 direct payments to voters before November.It’s clear from Saturday’s Senate GOP conference call that the skepticism or outright opposition hasn’t changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-coronavirus-aid-offer-is-panned-by-pelosi-senate-gop/story-eA4qgECtUlBg5q92jVgxOJ.html
11-10-2020||World||Dr Anthony Fauci calls White House event ‘superspreader’; Donald Trump to resume campaigning||Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious-disease expert in the US, said on Friday that an event hosted by the White House last month was a “superspreader” as a number of attendees tested positive for Covid-19, including some US senators and members of President Donald Trump’s staff and campaign team.The US president and first lady Melania Trump, who had attended the event, also tested positive for the coronavirus disease, but their infections were not traced back to the White House event held on September 26. At least 34 members of the White House staff and contacts have so far been infected, according to multiple news reports.“I think the data speak for themselves,” Dr Fauci said in an interview on CBS News on Friday. “We had a superspreader event in the White House, and it was in a situation where people were crowded together and were not wearing masks. So the data speak for themselves.”Fauci’s characterising of the event as a “superspreader event” came on the day the White House announced Trump’s return to election campaigning with a speech from the White House scheduled for later on Saturday and a rally in Florida on Monday.Meanwhile, the second presidential debate between Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, scheduled for October 15, has been cancelled by the independent body that conducts the debates. It had earlier announced that the debate would be held virtually, which was rejected by the US president who had demanded that it should be held in-person but later. Dr Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who has not hesitated to call out the Trump administration’s missteps in combating the Covid-19 pandemic, was referring to a Rose Garden event hosted by the White House on September 26 for the US president to announce judge Amy Coney Barrett as his pick for the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Among attendees of the September 26 event who went on to test positive for Covid-19 were Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who helped the US president prepare for his debate with Biden, Senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis, Trump’s spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, adviser Stephen Miller and former adviser Kellyanne Conway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dr-anthony-fauci-calls-white-house-event-superspreader-donald-trump-to-resume-campaigning/story-oFKrIuF8SW9zBBAG5wKVcK.html
11-10-2020||World||Indian-origin academician Srikant Datar named dean of Harvard Business School||Srikant M Datar, an alumnus of Mumbai University and IIM Ahmedabad, has been named the new dean of Harvard University’s business school.Datar will succeed Nitin Nohria, another Indian-American, and will be the second dean of Indian origin at Harvard University, with Rakesh Khurana, who heads Harvard College.“Srikant Datar is an innovative educator, a distinguished scholar and a deeply experienced academic leader,” Harvard University president Lawrence Bacow said while announcing the appointment on Friday, as cited in a post on the Harvard Business School’s (HBS) website. “He is a leading thinker about the future of business education, and he has recently played an essential role in HBS’s creative response to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.”Datar will be the 11th dean of the prestigious school. He joined the HBS faculty in 1996 after teaching stints at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford. He started his higher education at University of Mumbai - it was called University of Bombay at that time - and his next stop was the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad.“I am humbled and honoured to take on this role,” said Datar. “Harvard Business School is an institution with a remarkable legacy of impact in research, education and practice. Yet, the events of the past year have hastened our passage to an unforeseen future. I look forward to working with colleagues and friends of the School - including throughout Harvard, in our Boston community, and around the world - to realise our mission in what undoubtedly will be an exciting new era.”Nohria, who also studied in Mumbai, had been HBS dean for more than 10 years, starting in 2010. Nohria had announced plans to step down last November, but stayed on in view of the pandemic.“Srikant is an outstanding choice as Harvard Business School’s next dean,” Nohria said. “He has thought deeply about the challenges and opportunities facing management education, and has a proven record of collaboration, innovation and leadership - not only within HBS, but across Harvard and at other organisations.”The HBS post called Datar “a prominent thinker and innovator” on the future of business education. He has co-authored Rethinking the MBA: Business Education at a Crossroads, and has developed courses on “Developing Mindsets for Innovative Problem Solving” and “Managing with Data Science”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-academician-srikant-datar-named-dean-of-harvard-business-school/story-IRgDILe2kBu2nUQV4N4oSJ.html
11-10-2020||World||China has deployed 60,000 troops on India’s northern border: Mike Pompeo||US secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Friday said China was amassing “huge forces” along the border with India and had already deployed 60,000 troops there, citing a previously unreported number that significantly scaled up the magnitude of the threat.He also commended India for “diplomatically” pushing back by banning Chinese apps and ending government procurement of supplies made in China.The US secretary of state spoke of the India-China conflict along with other issues in a string of interviews since he travelled to Japan for a meeting of the ministers of the Quad - an informal group comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia.Pompeo and India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar also met separately on the sidelines of the meeting.“The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border,” Pompeo said on The Guy Benson Show and added in a separate interview with Larry O’Connor, “The Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north.”The top American diplomat mentioned the size of the existing Chinese deployment of 60,000 troops along the border with India in several of the interviews as he spoke broadly of the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party to the world – touching upon issues ranging from security to health, including the Covid-19 pandemic.“A million people now dead because the Chinese Communist Party didn’t respond to the Wuhan virus in a way that they should have. Economies destroyed as a direct result of that,” Pompeo said on The Guy Benson Show.“The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border. The Australians saw that, and when they had the temerity to simply ask for an investigation about the virus, the Chinese began to exert economic power against them to try to coerce and bully them.”Underscoring the need for America to be engaged in the region and stand with allies and friends, the US secretary of state said on the Larry O’Connor Show, “They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight. But they’ve all seen it, whether it’s the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the northeastern part of India - right? - the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north.”On the Hugh Hewitt Show, Pompeo spoke admiringly of India’s pushback. “The Indians have banned dozens and dozens of Chinese apps, and the Indians have stopped having their government purchase any product from China. That’s remarkable. It’s work that has been done diplomatically, and then there are the security issues, too.”The US, which has since banned several Chinese apps and forced TikTok sell off its American operations, has strongly condemned Chinese aggression along the border with India, and has been supportive of New Delhi, fast-tracking, among other things, its defence purchase orders.The US has adopted a more confrontational approach towards China in recent months.“The old paradigm of blind engagement with China has failed,” Pompeo said in a widely anticipated policy speech at a legacy California library run by the foundation of late US president Richard Nixon, who re-established diplomatic ties with China and paved the way for its opening with a historic visit in 1972.“If the free world doesn’t change Communist China, (it) will surely change us,” Pompeo had warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-deployed-60-000-troops-on-india-s-northern-border-mike-pompeo/story-CmE7EOvDWEHYVVbaIqOtcO.html
11-10-2020||World||Judge throws out Donald Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania lawsuit||A federal judge in Pennsylvania on Saturday threw out a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s campaign, dismissing its challenges to the battleground state’s poll-watching law and its efforts to limit how mail-in ballots can be collected and which of them can be counted.The ruling by US District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan — who was appointed by Trump — in Pittsburgh also poured cold water on Trump’s claims that election fraud will work against him.Trump’s campaign said it would appeal at least one element of the decision, with barely three weeks to go until Election Day in a state hotly contested by Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.The lawsuit was opposed by the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, the state Democratic Party, the League of Women Voters, the NAACP’s Pennsylvania office and other allied groups.“The court’s decision today affirms what we’ve long known, that Pennsylvania’s elections are safe, secure, and accurate, and residents can vote on Nov. 3rd with confidence that their votes will be counted and their voices heard,” Wolf’s office said in a statement. “The ruling is a complete rejection of the continued misinformation about voter fraud and corruption, and those who seek to sow chaos and discord ahead of the upcoming election.”However, Trump’s campaign said in a statement that it looked forward to a quick decision from the appeals court “that will further protect Pennsylvania voters from the Democrats’ radical voting system.”The lawsuit is one of many partisan battles being fought in the state Legislature and the courts over mail-in voting in Pennsylvania, amid concerns that a presidential election result will hang in limbo for days on a drawn-out vote count in Pennsylvania.In this case, Trump’s campaign wanted the court to bar counties from using drop boxes or mobile sites to collect mail-in ballots that are not “staffed, secured, and employed consistently within and across all 67 of Pennsylvania’s counties.” Trump’s campaign said it would appeal the matter of drop boxes.More than 20 counties — including Philadelphia and most other heavily populated Democratic-leaning counties — have told the state elections office that they plan to use drop boxes and satellite election offices to help collect the massive number of mail-in ballots they expect to receive.Trump’s campaign also wanted the court to free county election officials to disqualify mail-in ballots where the voter’s signature may not match their signature on file and to remove a county residency requirement in state law for certified poll watchers.In guidance last month, Wolf’s top elections official told counties that state law does not require or permit them to reject a mail-in ballot solely over a perceived signature inconsistency. Trump’s campaign had asked Ranjan to declare that guidance unconstitutional and to block counties from following it.In throwing out the case, Ranjan wrote that the Trump campaign could not prove their central claim: that Trump’s fortunes in the Nov. 3 election in Pennsylvania are threatened by election fraud and that adopting the changes the campaign sought changes will fix that.Ranjan wrote Trump’s campaign could not prove that the president has been hurt by election fraud or even that he is likely to be hurt by fraud.“While plaintiffs may not need to prove actual voter fraud, they must at least prove that such fraud is ‘certainly impending,’” Ranjan wrote. “They haven’t met that burden. At most, they have pieced together a sequence of uncertain assumptions.”Ranjan also cited decisions in recent days by the US Supreme Court and the 11th Circuit US Court of Appeals in hot-button election cases, saying he should not second-guess decisions by state lawmakers and election officials.The decision comes as Trump claims he can only lose the state if Democrats cheat and, as he did in 2016′s campaign, suggests that the Democratic bastion of Philadelphia needs to be watched closely for election fraud. On Friday, Trump’s campaign lost a bid in a Philadelphia court to force the city to allow campaign representatives to monitor its satellite election offices.Democrats counter that Trump is running on the conspiracy of election fraud because he cannot run on his record of fraud and mismanagement. They also accuse Trump of trying to scuttle some of the 3 million or more mail-in votes that are expected in the November 3 election in Pennsylvania, with Democrats applying for mail-in ballots by an almost three-to-one rate over Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-throws-out-donald-trump-campaign-s-pennsylvania-lawsuit/story-oNaN4Nyb47e2iKIlM1vegK.html
11-10-2020||World||Donald Trump makes first public appearance after hospital release; White House won’t say if he’s still contagious with coronavirus||President Donald Trump made his first public appearance on Saturday since returning from a three-day coronavirus hospitalization, telling supporters assembled on the White House’s South Lawn that “through the power of American science and medicine, we will eradicate the China Virus once and for all.”“I want to thank you all for the prayers,” Trump said from a White House balcony before hundreds of invited guests.The appearance was designed to show the president has recovered from Covid-19 and is ready to resume work and his race against Democratic nominee Joe Biden. But the president appeared without certification from his doctors that he’s no longer contagious with the deadly virus, and despite the White House not releasing a formal update on his recovery since Thursday.Still, the president sat for at least three hours of radio and remote television interviews with conservative media personalities on Friday, and is expected to resume a heavy campaign travel schedule this week with rallies in Florida, Pennsylvania and Iowa. Trump has been itching to return to public events following his battle with the coronavirus, aides say -- an impatience only heightened by the president falling further behind Biden in polls.Still, Saturday’s event risks deepening concern among voters about Trump’s handling of a pandemic that has left more than two dozen of his close associates infected and more than 210,000 Americans dead.After the president’s last outdoor event -- a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony to announce his pick of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court -- at least 11 attendees tested positive for coronavirus. While the White House had a testing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and attendees mingled and sat in close proximity to one another both indoors and outdoors.Trump’s physician said Wednesday that the president had been free of symptoms for the previous 24 hours. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump “will be clear to go” on Saturday, when “he wants to talk to the American people.” There are medical tests underway to ensure he doesn’t transmit the virus when he returns to the campaign trail, she said on Fox News, adding that she’d conferred with White House doctor Sean Conley. McEnany, who herself has tested positive for Covid-19, is working remotely.Virus ScreeningOn Saturday, White House guests were required to bring masks with them and wear them on the grounds, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that they also have to undergo a Covid-19 screening on Saturday morning that will include a temperature check and a brief questionnaire. But those rules were put in place not by the White House but by the organizer of the event, the Blexit group, led by Candace Owens, a Trump ally, the person said.Trump’s first trip outside of D.C. will be to Orlando on Monday, where he’s expected to hold an outdoor airport hanger rally. He’ll follow that on Tuesday with a rally at an airport outside of Pittsburgh, and a similar event Wednesday in Des Moines. His campaign is negotiating a town hall on network television on Thursday, according to CNN.Trump’s challenge to win over voters has only intensified in recent days. His vacillations on a stimulus bill and second presidential debate have fed a developing narrative that he’s flailing as a second term slips from his grasp.Earlier in the week, Trump -– to the dismay of fellow Republicans -- said he was cutting off talks on an additional coronavirus stimulus bill, only to rapidly reverse course after the announcement rocked markets.But subsequent days saw a flurry of different and often contradictory statements from the White House. First, officials said they would resume talks -- but only on standalone bills to bolster the airline industry and small businesses.Reversing CourseThen Trump said not only did he want a sweeping bill, but was open to levels beyond even what Democrats had proposed. By Friday afternoon, the administration was preparing a proposal for a $1.8 trillion deal that fell below what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has described as her floor, but exceeded levels Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said would be acceptable. Both House Democrats and Senate Republicans expressed skepticism over the proposal earlier Saturday.Trump and his campaign team -- which, like the White House staff, has suffered coronavirus infections at the highest levels -- are searching for ways to reverse the president’s slide in polls.Trump pulled out of the second debate because the bipartisan commission organizing the event said it would be held virtually following his diagnosis. Trump’s efforts to force the debate commission to reverse course or reschedule the remaining debates fell flat. As a result, Trump will either be deprived of one of the final marquee opportunities to reach voters before Election Day or forced to publicly reverse himself.That’s left the president eager to return to the campaign trail, with hopes that his signature rallies can offer him a chance to reconnect with voters and rekindle enthusiasm for his candidacy.The president told Fox News host Sean Hannity that his team was looking to organize a rally Saturday night in Florida -- the earliest possible date his medical team said he might be able to resume public appearances -- and a second event Sunday in Pennsylvania.Virus SymptomsWhite House aides said logistical challenges prevented organizing such events on short notice. But the president also acknowledged Friday he’s still experiencing some symptoms from his brush with coronavirus. Trump was seen struggling to catch his breath after walking a flight of stairs during his return from the hospital on Monday, and occasionally lost his voice during his interview with Hannity on Thursday.Still, Trump sought to underscore his health Friday through his marathon of interviews with conservative media figures.That included a two-hour uninterrupted conversation on Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio show. On that program, Trump ranked Fox News hosts by how favorable they were to him personally, expressed alarm that Attorney General Bill Barr might not release the findings of a politically charged investigation into the origins of its Russia probe and delivered an expletive-charged warning to Iran.Trump followed that up with several more interviews, including an appearance on Mark Levin’s talk show. The president is expected to be interviewed again Sunday morning by Fox Business Network.“I feel really good, I feel very strong, I know a lot of people who have had the Covid—or the China virus as I call it because it came from China,” the president said in an interview on Fox News Friday. “But I feel really, really strong and a lot of people don’t feel that way sometimes for a while afterwards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-makes-first-public-appearance-since-hospital-release-white-house-won-t-say-if-he-s-still-contagious-with-coronavirus/story-4fvx2HpXTQv5fvGVVjMKMN.html
