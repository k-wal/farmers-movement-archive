A pledging conference for more funds co-hosted by the UK, US, EU and the UNHCR is scheduled for Thursday. The Foreign Office said that nearly 860,000 Rohingya live in overcrowded camps in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, without formal education or work opportunities. Coronavirus has made the situation in the packed and unsanitary camps even more desperate.The funding is intended to provide hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people with food, healthcare, water and sanitation, as well as care and counselling for those traumatised by violence. It will also improve access to education for 50,000 young people, as well as create isolation and treatment centres for people suffering from coronavirus.Raab said: “The people living in Cox’s Bazar face unimaginable hardship and many have been victims of violence. We have imposed sanctions on the perpetrators of this brutality, and this new funding will save lives in the camp and help Bangladesh become more resilient to disasters such as coronavirus.”“Today I urge the world not to turn away from the Rohingya’s suffering and to take the action necessary to allow them to safely return to the homes they fled in terror.”The Foreign Office added that according to UN estimates, $1 billion is needed this year to help Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh but so far, less than half of that has been raised.Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya reportedly left Myanmar in 2017 to escape violence. Since then, the UK has imposed sanctions on two generals in the Myanmar military, as recommended by a UN independent investigation, which found them responsible for atrocities which amount to ethnic cleansing.Thursday’s announcement brings the total UK aid commitment to the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh close to £300 million, including £37.5 million to provide humanitarian assistance in Cox’s Bazar and £10mn in support for Bangladesh to help the country respond to coronavirus and natural disasters such as flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-turn-away-from-rohingya-s-plight-uk-urges-world/story-VUactqCtwrnro9k5riEgDK.html
22-10-2020||World||US Senate panel moves ahead with confirmation process of SC judge Barrett||The Republican-led US Senate judiciary committee on Thursday advanced judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court for a floor vote, with Democrats boycotting a procedural vote.The full Senate is scheduled to vote on Monday, confirming her as the ninth member of the bench to replace the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “My Democratic Senate colleagues and I boycotted the Supreme Court nominee committee vote today,” Kamala Harris, a member of the committee and the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said in a tweet.“Let’s be clear: this nomination process is a sham and shows how Republicans will stop at nothing to strip health care from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions,” she said after the 12-0 vote in the Senate panel.Democrats couldn’t have stopped the nomination from advancing even if they had attended the meeting of the 22-member committee that has 12 Republicans. They stand disadvantaged to determine the floor vote either in the Republican-dominated chamber, even with a few defections.Lacking in numbers, Democrats have sought to characterise Barrett’s nomination as an attempt by President Donald Trump and his congressional allies to change the ideological balance of the court with the aim of striking down health care and abortion and helping him stay in office if the outcome of the November 3 election is disputed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-moves-ahead-with-confirmation-process-of-sc-judge-barrett/story-JiIYc5Pkqrg5BzOnec4fgM.html

A major crisis erupted in the country, with the police in the Sindh province putting up a determined fight against the all-powerful military for “kidnapping” Sindh IGP Mushtaq Mehr, during Awan’s arrest saga. Interior Ministry is being blamed for orchestrating the arrest of Safdar Awan and kidnapping of Mushtaq Mehr as Rangers, which is a paramilitary federal law enforcement organization, operates directly under the authority of the Interior Secretary of Pakistan. The move to force the Sindh IGP to register an FIR against Safdar and PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz may be the brainchild of Izaj Shah, the Interior Minister who also controls the Rangers, sources said. “No political leader in a democratic system could be allowed to target national institutions in the name of freedom of expression,” The News International quoted Shah as saying.While talking to a private news channel, he said action should be taken against PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif for his anti-state narrative.Shah, a former Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) operator, who is often criticised for policies and support for terrorists, may have thought that his move would create a divide between the Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz).Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan government is seemed to be shaken up by the anti-government rally in Karachi where political parties under the banner of joint opposition alliance---Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-- protested against the ‘puppet’ government. Thousands of people participated in the rally in Karachi.Following the rally, Maryam’s husband Safdar Awan was arrested from his hotel room. Safdar has now been released on bail.Almost all police officers in Sindh Police applied for leave in protest against the humiliation meted out to the Sindh IGP Mushtaq Mehr, during the PML-N leader Safdar Awan’s arrest saga.PML-N leader and spokesman for Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz’s and former Sindh Governor Muhammad Zubair said that the IGP Sindh was ‘kidnapped’ by Rangers who forced him to file an FIR for Safdar’s arrest.Brigadier Shah who was appointed as interior minister in 2018 by Prime Minister Imran Khan, remains a highly controversial figure in Pakistan.Former Prime Minister and PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto had named Shah in a letter as someone who should be investigated if she was assassinated. After her assassination, the PPP accused Brig Shah of having links with Al Qaeda and Taliban, The News International reported.Shah continued to be Pakistan’s former military dictator Pervez Musharraf’s trusted aide even after he was ousted. Gen Musharraf had nominated Shah as High Commissioner to Australia, but Canberra refused to accept his nomination, forcing the government to withdraw it.

We are in touch with the labourers also for getting them the assistance needed, at the earliest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Somalia has assured that arrangements will be made for these people to visit India soon,” the Commission tweeted in Hindi on Wednesday in reply to a tweet by activist Rajesh Mani. Rajesh Mani of Manav Seva Sansthan said 33 Indian labourers, including 25 workers from Uttar Pradesh, have been held hostage by a company in Somalia for the last eight months. He said the matter came to his knowledge after a labourer from Kushinagar district contacted him.The activist said he took to Twitter to contact the Indian High commission in Kenya to seek help. “I contacted the Indian High Commission in Kenya and the external affairs ministry through Twitter and e-mail. They gave assurance of helping the labourers,” he said.Mani said out of the 33 labourers held hostage, 21 belong to Gorakhpur division. Six of the labourers are from Bihar and one each from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, he said. According to the activist, the labourers had joined the company 10 months ago. In the first two months, the company treated them well, but from the last eight months, the workers were not paid their salaries, he said. “On Tuesday, one Sugreev Kushwaha of Kushinagar contacted me through WhatsApp, and told me that 33 Indian labourers were living in difficult conditions as the company at Mogadishu in Somalia, where they were working, had made them hostage in the factory campus. He said they have not been paid from the last eight months. He also sent me a video clip showing their condition,” Mani said.“When the labourers demanded their salary, the company made them hostage inside the factory campus, took their passports and threatened to shoot them. They have also not been given food, water and medicines since the last 15 days. The labourers have been confined to their rooms and kept hungry and thirsty. The company is treating them like bonded labourers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/33-indian-labourers-held-hostage-by-somalian-company-high-commission-steps-in-to-resolve-crisis/story-1D55W3gzYP4oKq1cBG2yRO.html
22-10-2020||World||Plot thickens over origins of Pope’s civil union endorsement||Questions swirled Thursday about the origins of Pope Francis’ bombshell comments endorsing same-sex civil unions, with all evidence suggesting he made them in a 2019 interview that was never broadcast in its entirety.The Vatican refused to comment on whether it cut the remarks from its own broadcast or if the Mexican broadcaster that conducted the interview did. And it didn’t respond to questions about why it allowed the comments to be aired now in the documentary “Francesco,” which premiered Wednesday.In the movie, which was shown at the Rome Film Festival, Francis said gay people have the right to be in a family since they are “children of God.”“You can’t kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this,” the pope said. “What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.”Those comments caused a firestorm, thrilling progressives and alarming conservatives, given official Vatican teaching prohibits any such endorsement of homosexual unions.While serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis endorsed civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same-sex marriages. However, he had never come out publicly in favour of legal protections for civil unions as pope, and no pontiff before him had, either.One of Francis’ top communications advisers, the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, insisted the pope’s comments were old news, saying they were made during a May 2019 interview with Mexican broadcaster Televisa.“There’s nothing new because it’s a part of that interview,” Spadaro told The Associated Press as he exited the premiere. “It seems strange that you don’t remember.”But Televisa didn’t air those comments when it broadcast the interview — nor did the Vatican when it put out its recordings of it. The broadcaster has not commented on the intrigue.The Vatican frequently edits the pope in official transcripts and videos, especially when he speaks on sensitive issues. Yet some version of the footage was apparently available in the Vatican archives, which were opened to filmmaker Evgeny Afineevsky.Televisa has not confirmed that the comments were made during its interview, but the scene of the documentary is identical to the Televisa interview, including the yellow background, a chair in the corner and slightly off-center placement of the chain of Francis’ pectoral cross.The official 2019 Vatican News transcript of that interview, as well as the official Vatican edit, contains no such comment on the need for legal protections for civil unions. The official edit does include his comments on the need for gay people to feel they are part of a family, as he has said previously.Further muddying the waters is the fact that Afineevsky, when pressed by reporters late Wednesday, said the pope made the comments to him directly, through a translator, but declined to say when.When The Associated Press interviewed Afineevsky on Oct. 14, the director was asked if he realized at the time that Francis’ comments were going to grab headlines.Afineevsky dodged the question about the origin of the quote and seemed to not appreciate its significance. But he said that he hoped journalists would take more away from the film.“If journalists will be focusing on this movie only on that, then it will be a pity,” he said. “But I think that’s one of the issues that our world needs to understand, that we’re all equal.”The head of the Vatican communications branch, Paolo Ruffini, refused to speak to reporters who attended an award ceremony Thursday in the Vatican gardens for Afineevsky, and the director himself kept his distance.The Catholic Church teaches that gay people must be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.” A 2003 document from the Vatican’s doctrine office stated the church’s respect for gay people “cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.”Doing so, the Vatican reasoned, would not only condone “deviant behavior,” but create an equivalence to marriage, which the church holds is an indissoluble union between man and woman.That document was signed by the then-prefect of the office, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI and Francis’ predecessor.Afineevsky, who is gay, had expressed surprise after the premiere that the pope’s comments had created such a stir, saying Francis wasn’t trying to change doctrine but was merely expressing his belief gay people should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals.On Thursday, he declined to take any further questions and sought to put attention on the main issues dealt with in the film: climate change, refugees and poverty.“I am so proud that finally ‘Francesco’ is on its way to the road to change hearts and minds,” he said at the prize ceremony in the Vatican gardens. “Finally, I am happy that I can bring voices from the Rohingya refugees, refugees from Syria, the voices of victims of sexual abuse, voices from different points from different corners of the world.”(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

22-10-2020||World||Human rights group says Lebanon probe into Beirut port blast flawed||A leading international human rights group on Thursday said a Lebanon-led probe into the devastating port explosion in Beirut this summer has been marred by political meddling and lack of judicial independence, resulting in failure to yield credible results two months later.Human Rights Watch called for a United Nations-led inquiry into the causes of the blast to determine responsibility. The New York-based watchdog called on international supporters of Lebanon, lead by France, meeting next week to press the Lebanese authorities to accept an independent probe.The massive Aug. 4 blast killed nearly 200 people and injured more than 6,000 when some 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical, detonated at Beirut’s port. It also devastated several neighbourhoods, shattering thousands of residential, historic and other buildings.“Everyone in Beirut has had their life turned upside down by the catastrophic explosion that devastated half the city, and they deserve justice for the disaster inflicted on them,” said Aya Majzoub, Lebanon researcher at HRW. “The Lebanese authorities’ failings over the past two months have shown that an international investigation is the only avenue for the people of Lebanon to get the answers and the justice that they deserve. “ It is still not known what ignited the chemicals, which were stored at the facility for six years. Local media say that 25 people have been detained and 30 charged in the explosion, mostly port and customs officials.Majzoub said authorities are pretending to carry out a credible investigation — pointing to fundamental weakness and flaws in the process she called “opaque.” The probe began with political wrangling over the naming of the lead investigator, included military threats to jail leakers and raised concerns over whether the panel appointed along sectarian lines could be fully impartial.HRW said the role of foreign investigators was unclear, calling on France and the United States to clarify their mandate and “make public any attempts to obstruct justice.” Earlier this month, the judge investigating the explosion received a report from the FBI about the bureau’s own probe, but no details have emerged from it. The French and British have yet to present their own findings.Majzoub said there was no transparency in sharing evidence or charges, while no senior official was named in the probe. Reports showed government officials at the highest level were informed of the dangerous chemicals in the port.HRW said the focus on administrative port and customs officials raises concerns that politicians suspected of being implicated in the blast may escape accountability. There were also concerns of possible tampering with the crime scene, following the eruption of two fires at the port since the explosion in September.Families of the dead and survivors of the blast called on the UN Security Council for an international investigation, but Lebanese officials rejected such calls as a “waste of time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-rights-group-says-lebanon-probe-into-beirut-port-blast-flawed/story-x6ehJMaxlxCwL7JDQ7PmEO.html

22-10-2020||World||Edward Snowden granted permanent residency in Russia||Fugitive US whistleblower Edward Snowden has been granted permanent residency in Russia, his lawyer said on Thursday.Snowden, the former US intelligence contractor who revealed in 2013 that the US government was spying on its citizens, has been living in exile in Russia since the revelations.The 37-year-old has said he would like to return to the United States.His lawyer Anatoly Kucherena told AFP on Thursday that his residency permit was extended and is now indefinite, a situation made possible by recent changes to Russia’s immigration law. Kucherena said the application was filed in April but the process was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.Snowden is wanted in the United States on espionage charges after he leaked information showing that agents from the National Security Agency (NSA) were collecting telephone records of millions of US citizens. When asked whether Snowden planned to apply for Russian citizenship, Kucherena said: “He will make the decision himself.” Kucherena said it was “natural” that Snowden wanted to return to the United States but will only do so when the case against him is closed.Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump said he would “take a look” at pardoning Snowden but has not made further comment on the matter. A 2015 petition calling on then president Barack Obama to pardon the whistleblower and privacy advocate was rejected by the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/edward-snowden-granted-permanent-residency-in-russia/story-V61l76Q9rbTnJorbkBeP0K.html

He said four vaccines of China are currently in phase three clinical trial stage.Also Read: Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro rejects Chinese vaccine against Covid“Chinese vaccines R&D indeed spoken off highly by various countries,” he said, adding that China is also part of COVAX, the World Health Organisation’ alliance to equitably distribute Covid-19 vaccines around the world. Bolsonaro said the Chinese vaccine has not yet completed testing, which is the case with all potential vaccines for the virus. “My decision is to not purchase such a vaccine.” Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus.It has had nearly 5.3 million confirmed cases - the third-highest tally in the world after the US and India - and is second only to the US in terms of deaths, with nearly 155,000 registered so far, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.Bolsonaro’s decision came as a dampener for China’s push to use its vaccines as a diplomatic tool to enhance its global image with the supply of coronavirus vaccines to especially developing countries. However, Zhao said that China is “committed that once deployed and put into use our vaccines will be for the global public good.” “China will contribute to the accessibility and affordability of the vaccines in developing countries”, he said, adding that China and Brazil have seen sound cooperation in Covid-19 control. “We believe that such cooperation will contribute to our final and absolute victory over the virus in China, Brazil and around the world,” he said.Brazil’s decision on Sinovac followed Bangladesh’s decision to stall the phase-3 trial after the Chinese firm asked the Bangladeshi government to co-finance it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-defends-its-covid-vaccine-after-brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-s-guinea-pig-jibe/story-1O1Ccb0SrQPf6vx609GDJP.html
22-10-2020||World||As UK Covid cases surge, Rishi Sunak extends wage bill support||Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Thursday again extended and expanded schemes to support employees, companies and the self-employed over the next six months, as more areas in England went into the highest alert level following a surge in Covid-19 cases.The support, which since April included the state picking up varying percentages of the wage bill of employees, the income of the self-employed and various incentives to companies, total nearly 200 billion pounds, Sunak told the House of Commons.The new package comes in the context of wrangling between the central government in London and local leaders in Greater Manchester over the financial support for companies that are required to close in areas under the highest alert level 3. London is under level 2.As of Wednesday night, the UK has recorded 26,688 new cases in 24 hours – four times the day-peaks in April and May – besides 191 deaths. South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester are due to join Liverpool and parts of Leicestershire in level 3 alert level this week.Announcing the new package, Sunak told MPs: “I’ve always said that we must be ready to adapt our financial support as the situation evolves, and that is what we are doing today. These changes mean that our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs.”“I know that the introduction of further restrictions has left many people worried for themselves, their families and communities. I hope the government’s stepped-up support can be part of the country pulling together in the coming months”.Opposition leaders accused the Boris Johnson government of being ‘London-centric’ and criticised it for allegedly ignoring north England and announcing the package only when it was clear that London companies would be more adversely affected under the level 2 alert level. Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, said: “This is incredible. I don’t for a moment begrudge help for London business but this is the same chancellor who refused to help Greater Manchester as we lived with these restrictions for months and said it was ‘unfair’ to other areas when we asked for help. Don’t ever forget this.”Sean Fielding (Labour), leader of the Oldham council in north England, added: “It stinks. Proves that when people like me say that the government wouldn’t leave London high and dry we’re not just being chippy northerners, it’s true. Our businesses have struggled under the equivalent of tier 2 restrictions, or more, for three months and received nothing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-uk-covid-cases-surge-rishi-sunak-extends-wage-bill-support/story-RCwHbuODuXCto1fY5Uuc1K.html
22-10-2020||World||UK’s foreign policy is adrift, lacks clarity, warn MPs||The UK’s foreign policy is ‘adrift’ and the claim of ‘Global Britain’ lacks clarity, warned a new report by an influential parliament panel.“The UK’s international policy has been adrift,” said the report released on Thursday by the foreign affairs committee of the House of Commons. It said the Brexit-bound country’s foreign policy lacked a clear strategic vision, confidence, and coherent implementation. The report titled ‘A brave new Britain? The future of the UK’s international policy’ has taken inputs from Indian and other diplomats and reflected their worries.Calling on the Boris Johnson government to ‘step-up and do more’ on the global stage, MPs questioned the oft-repeated claim in the pro-Brexit discourse of the country reinventing itself as ‘Global Britain’, alleging that few were clear what it meant.It said: “More than four years after the sound bite was first used to encapsulate the UK’s international role, and almost three years after our Committee first called for more clarity about its meaning and metrics, many of our contributors still told us that they did not know what Global Britain stood for.”Diplomats and experts told the committee that the UK has recently “appeared less ambitious and more absent in its global role”, the report noted, quoting former Indian diplomat Asoke Mukerji telling MPs that “in the political and strategic sphere, there is a perception that the UK is not involved as much as it should be.”The reasons, according to them, include a diminished profile during the UK’s membership of the European Union, distraction by the process of leaving the EU, and a more general de–prioritisation of some regions plus reluctance against assertion in others.Tom Tugendhat, committee chair, said: “In the face of adversity, it is vital we have a clear and consistent strategy to overcome the challenges we face. Without a plan and corresponding budgets to support it the UK cannot coherently respond to such challenges or remain confident in its delivery of Global Britain.” “It leaves the UK feeling its way in the dark and adds to uncertainty at a time of great global instability…Many key global voices feel that this country has a huge part to play as the world changes in coming years. The UK must now move forward in a confident, clear and coherent way, driving events, not simply be pushed around by an increasingly unstable world.”The committee’s report is the second major exercise this year into the UK’s foreign policy before Brexit is completed on December 31. An Integrated Review of foreign policy, defence and international development is also underway, but may not be published in November, as scheduled, due to Covid-19-related developments.India and the Indo-Pacific are expected to be the new area of focus of a post-Brexit Britain, as indicated by foreign secretary Dominic Raab and others, but the committee cautioned the government that such a tilt cannot work without continuing firm links with Europe.The report said: “None of our contributors wanted the UK to stand back or keep quiet. All of them urged the UK to step up, do more, and play a more impactful role in the world. They highlighted the positive contribution that the UK could make to international relations, and the negative implications if it declined.”“But the UK will have the greatest impact abroad if it uses its range of assets and capabilities coherently. It is unlikely that the merger of the Department for International Development and the Foreign & Commonwealth Office will resolve the persistent problem that Britain abroad is less than the sum of its parts,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-foreign-policy-is-adrift-lacks-clarity-warn-mps/story-Ra01Cz36Jkv4eR4GmdFKHJ.html

The Afghan Air Force also supported security forces during the fightings,” provincial government spokesman Mohammad Jawad Hajri told Xinhua.Several Taliban terrorists were also dead or wounded, he added.The area has been the scene of heavy clashes between government soldiers and Taliban terrorists in recent days. On Tuesday night, at least 28 security forces, including a senior provincial police official, and several terrorists were killed and many people from two sides wounded in Baharak.Local villagers claimed that security forces attacked terrorists’ position Wednesday night, to avenge the loss of security forces in the village. They said 10 civilians were killed and eight wounded during Wednesday night’s airstrikes.In the meantime, spokesman Hajri accused terrorists of using civilians as human shields and attacking security forces from villagers’ houses.Earlier on Thursday morning, five Taliban terrorists were killed and five terrorists and two soldiers were wounded after government security forces repelled a Taliban attack on a checkpoint in neighbouring Khwaja Ghar district, district chief Mohammad Omar told Xinhua.Fighting rages across Afghanistan as Taliban terrorists have been attempting to take territory and consolidate their position as peace talks between the Afghan government delegation and Taliban representatives were underway in Doha, capital of Qatar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-civilians-killed-in-clashes-airstrikes-in-afghanistan/story-P4NVo9GpOIagwtbBsnpdEN.html
22-10-2020||World||Trump-allied groups pour $30 million into Barrett’s confirmation to Supreme Court||Conservative non-profit groups plan to spend about $30 million by month’s end advocating Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the US Supreme Court, according to people familiar with the activities.The money has financed a barrage of advertising and grass-roots activity --mostly in battleground states -- that’s saturating television screens, social media feeds, Senate offices and roadside stops in the weeks leading to the Nov. 3 election.The goal is to ensure Barrett’s Senate confirmation to the high court, which could happen as soon as Monday, after a committee vote set for Thursday. But with Democrats all but powerless to block a vote, conservative groups have have sought to turn Barrett into an political asset for President Donald Trump, who trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden both nationally and in swing states.The spending by the conservative groups could have the side effect of aiding Trump’s campaign, which has fallen well behind Biden’s in fundraising. The former vice president’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee reported having about $177 million on hand at the beginning of October, nearly three times as much as the incumbent president’s re-election effort.The election has been dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and Trump’s response, which polls show voters rate poorly. But Republicans have used the nomination fight to fire up conservatives who may be wary of Trump, especially conservative Roman Catholics and evangelicals, by accusing Democrats of bigotry by focusing on the religious beliefs of Barrett, a devout Catholic.The Judicial Crisis Network is spending $10 million on a television and digital ad campaign supporting Barrett, the people said. A spot released last week features Barrett speaking during her confirmation hearing about “some the caricatures floating around” about her religious views. Another from Sept. 29 says “Democrats and liberal extremists” attacked Barrett’s faith.Democratic senators mostly avoided questions about Barrett’s faith during confirmation hearings and instead focused on whether she would strike down Obamacare or the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling. Democrats have used the prospect of those outcomes to rally their strongest supporters before the election.More than 100 paid field staff from the conservative group Heritage Action for America have run phone banks, knocked on doors and sent mail and text messages to people in North Carolina, Iowa, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, according to the people. The group expects to spend $3.8 million by Election Day and aims to reach 2.5 million voters.Anti-abortion rights groups, such as Concerned Women for America and the Susan B. Anthony List, have organized events in 10 states that are presidential battlegrounds or have key Senate races. The anti-tax group Club for Growth is spending $5 million on advertising and sending pro-Barrett letters to senators. America First Policies, the non-profit arm of the pro-Trump super political action committee America First Action, is pouring another $5 million into advertising and direct mail backing Barrett.People affiliated with the groups argue the efforts have helped shape public opinion around the nomination, which allows Republican candidates to use it as a weapon against their Democratic opponents.A New York Times/Siena College Research Institute poll conducted last week showed 47% of likely voters said the Senate should vote on Barrett’s nomination before the election, compared to 39% who said a vote should only be held if Trump wins a second term. Almost six in 10 said they opposed increasing the size of the Supreme Court in response to Barrett’s confirmation, an idea supported by some on the left but not embraced by Biden, while just over three in 10 said more justices should be added to the bench.Liberal groups have also spent millions of dollars opposing Barrett’s nomination.Following the death last month of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Demand Justice promised to spend $10 million opposing confirmation of any Trump nominee before the election. It also began a multimillion-dollar ad campaign opposing Barrett’s confirmation in Iowa, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.Those spots assailed Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for pushing the Barrett nomination through the Senate before the election, with the pandemic still raging. The Democratic super-PAC American Bridge also launched an opposition research “hub” containing information on Barrett’s judicial record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-allied-groups-pour-30-million-into-barrett-s-confirmation-to-supreme-court/story-9ihKlOQ1J5r22McRp9ql1L.html
22-10-2020||World||Saudi Arabia-US ties might face reset if Biden wins||Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman enjoyed a near free pass under his personal relationship with US President Donald Trump, but the kingdom’s brazen young leader will have to tread more carefully should Democrats take the White House and reset strategic ties.Riyadh’s human rights record, with the brutal 2018 murder of Washington Post Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and detention of women activists, will be a prime point of friction with a Joe Biden administration, as will the Yemen war.At issue for the Gulf powerhouse, which lobbied hard for Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against foe Iran, is how Biden will address Tehran’s ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies in any talks to revive an international nuclear pact with Iran that Washington quit in 2018.While Riyadh and its Gulf allies prefer a Trump administration that also prioritised lucrative deals over human rights concerns, a Biden win would not upend decades long alliances, five regional sources and diplomats said. Biden may, however, place stronger conditions on US support, they said.“There will be challenges but there are long-term strategic institutional relationships and no one wants to break the camel’s back, though a Biden administration will want compromises,” said one Gulf source. A foreign diplomat in the region echoed the view that Saudi-US ties would not be unduly harmed: “I imagine (Biden) would demand a few high-profile concessions ... something on women’s rights defenders maybe.”In his campaign Biden pledged to reassess ties with Saudi Arabia, an oil exporting giant and major buyer of American arms, demand more accountability over Khashoggi’s killing in Riyadh’s Istanbul consulate and end U.S. support for the Yemen war.“Instead of giving blank checks to dictators and authoritarians around the world, as the Trump Administration has done, Joe Biden will stand up for universal values with friends and foes alike, and stand with the democratic world as we address common challenges,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.De-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has firmly consolidated power, crushing dissent, and detaining rivals to the throne, measures that tainted a reformist image initially lauded abroad as he moved to open up the kingdom.He has denied ordering Khashoggi’s killing, which sparked global outrage and spooked investors, but in 2019 indicated some personal accountability by saying it happened under his watch.Riyadh jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years in the case.The kingdom’s foreign minister, in a webinar this month, said it was also reforming security services so “something like this cannot happen again”.Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud though struck a defiant tone over Western condemnation of the trials of women activists, saying they are charged with “serious crimes”.The detainees are accused of harming Saudi interests. Few charges have been made public but some relate to contacts with foreign journalists, diplomats and rights groups.Trump has objected to punitive measures against Riyadh over human rights. But in April he threatened withholding military support ,boosted after 2019 attacks on Saudi energy facilities, after an oil war between Riyadh and Moscow wreaked havoc on markets, threatening the US oil industry.Prince Faisal stressed that despite “occasional divergences”, the Saudi-US alliance “goes much deeper than just one king or one president.”Riyadh and its Gulf allies strongly disagreed with the Obama administration over the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the 2011 “Arab Spring”, warning Washington against abandoning traditional allies and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood.State-backed media in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recently focused on emails linked to Hillary Clinton and the Brotherhood , a move one Saudi source said aimed to show Democrats had erred and could do so again.“There is concern that a Biden presidency would at best, mean a reduced US focus on the Middle East, and at worst ... a more hardline approach towards Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries,” said Abdulaziz Sager, chairman of Riyadh-based Gulf Research Center.“There is a desire for clarity among Saudis in terms of what Biden’s concrete foreign policy would be towards Saudi Arabia.”Gulf states are also trying to push through arms deals, with the UAE and Qatar seeking US F-35 fighter jets.The UAE has hedged its bets, reducing its military presence in Yemen, and becoming the first Arab state in a quarter century to normalise ties with Israel, creating a new axis against Iran and Islamists deemed a threat to Gulf dynastic rule.Bahrain followed suit, handing Trump a win in US brokered accords that also garnered bipartisan support.“One of the reasons Gulf States are establishing relations is because they realised a few months ago they might not have the US to rely on as in the past. Israel is a natural partner,” said a source familiar with the process.Saudi columnist Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh, writing in local daily Al Jazirah, said this “created a new reality on the ground that candidate Biden cannot overlook” when dealing with Iran.Trump initially said the United States was “locked and loaded” after the 2019 attacks on Saudi oil facilities, blamed by Riyadh and Western powers on Tehran, but a conventional military response did not materialise. The apparent attempt to avoid a war was watched closely around the Gulf.Saudi Arabia tacitly backed the Israel deals but is unlikely to join soon given its position as custodian of Islam’s holiest sites and architect of a 2002 Arab Peace Initiative that offered Israel ties in return for Palestinian statehood.Riyadh has said only an Israeli-Palestinian deal could deliver lasting peace and stability.“The Saudis will probably not move to recognize Israel before the election in large part because this is a card they can play with a new Biden administration,” said David Rundell, a former chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Riyadh.Gulf rivals are also biding time over a political row that has seen Riyadh and its allies boycott Qatar, two of the Gulf sources said, despite pressure from Trump to end the dispute. If Trump wins, Riyadh would seek to end the row and form a united Gulf Arab front against Iran, one of the sources said. “It may not be as big an issue for Biden, but if he also pushes for it, then we’ll see progress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-us-ties-might-face-reset-if-biden-wins/story-JYNhMMzC47dDWodYsnYwjO.html
22-10-2020||World||India, US set for military pact on satellite data during Pompeo visit||India is closing in on an agreement with the United States that will give it access to satellite data for better accuracy of missiles and drones, government and industry officials said, as it tries to narrow the gap with the powerful Chinese military.The two sides are expected to announce the pact during the visit next week of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defense secretary Mark Esper for talks in New Delhi with Indian counterparts Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh.The United States, which antagonised Beijing this week by approving the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, has also been pushing for stronger security ties with India to help balance China’s growing regional influence.US companies have sold India more than $21 billion of weapons since 2007 and Washington has been urging the Indian government to sign agreements allowing for sharing of sensitive information and encrypted communications for better use of the high-end military equipment.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet discussed the final draft of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation on Wednesday, an Indian government source said.An accord would provide India with access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data, a defence industry source said.It would also allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on US-supplied aircraft to India, the defence source said.“It is a foundational agreement, which the US has signed with many of its partners for greater interoperability,” the source said.India has traditionally been hesitant about getting drawn into a US-led security alliance and antagonising China. But tensions have risen dramatically with China this summer, erupting into a clash between border troops in the western Himalayas.This week New Delhi agreed to invite Australia into next month’s naval exercises scheduled with the United States and Japan, disregarding concerns it would anger China, which sees such a grouping as directed against it.“In tandem, the moves signal a new level of strategic convergence between the two democracies and a break from India’s ‘non-aligned’ past,” said Jeff Smith, a South Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation, about the proposed pact.Already there is robust intelligence sharing between US and India, particularly about Chinese activity in the region, a second government official said.This includes information on PLA deployments on the Indian border and also Chinese maritime activity, including its deep water fishing fleets, which have caused friction between Beijing and other countries.“They are sharing a large amount of data,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-set-for-military-pact-on-satellite-data-during-pompeo-visit/story-PK2DxYltSpk6rtQ06zEqXL.html

Once an effective vaccine is produced, the storage of the vaccine shots is going to be one of the most crucial aspects, experts have said. Pfizer, as reported, has fitted with 350 large freezers.2. Apart from the Michigan facility, the company has another in Belgium. These are the two final assembly centres, the report said.3. Reusable temperature-controlled containers have been designed by the company. Each of this boxes can hold 1,000 to 5,000 doses. The temperature will be minus 70 degrees Celsius.Also Read: AstraZeneca trial volunteer dies in Brazil. What it means for Covid-19 vaccine development4. The company has designed such boxes so that separate refrigeration is not required when the vaccines are shipped by trucks or cargo planes.5. Pfizer has also tied up with cargo flights for delivery — which will take three days depending on the location, the report said.The preparation to lay out a fast and fool-proof delivery plan began when the company started working for the vaccine with Germany’s BioNTech SE in March. The vaccine maker is likely to apply for authorisation in November once it gets global data of 44,000 people who underwent the trials. Apart from the US government, the EU, Japan, the UK have already placed vaccine orders with Pfizer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/350-large-freezers-football-ground-size-land-inside-pfizer-s-vaccine-distribution-campaign/story-tWlVjJvl3Bk3yrWxUaPLlO.html
22-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Final Presidential debate could thrust foreign policy back into campaign||As Joe Biden hopscotched through Iowa and New Hampshire in late 2019, he also name-dropped his way across the globe.China’s Xi Jinping. German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Vladimir Putin of Russia.“I’ve met every major world leader for the last 40 years,” the former vice president and eventual Democratic presidential nominee said.Behind the braggadocio was something Biden saw as a chief selling point for his third White House bid: His decades as a leading senator and two-term vice president make him “ready on day one” to restore a world order he believes President Donald Trump has destabilized.Biden’s foreign policy credentials have largely been overshadowed by questions about how he would lead the US through the worst pandemic in a century. But the issue could reemerge Thursday as Trump and Biden take the stage for a final debate, with a topic list including national security.Both campaigns believe their competing approaches — Trump’s “America First” doctrine that he says ended an era of other nations taking advantage of the United States; Biden’s pledge to reinvigorate a network of Western democracies — can sway voters.“The 800-pound gorilla that will be making its presence felt on Jan. 21 is still going to be Covid-19,” said Tony Blinken, Biden’s top foreign policy adviser, describing the pandemic as “the first big national security challenge” that would require Biden to make good on his promise of better coordination among the US and its allies.But, Blinken said, “The world doesn’t stop just because we have this Covid crisis. … We would have to walk and chew a lot of gum at the same time.” Biden blisters Trump on everything from his hard-line immigration policies and dismissing the climate crisis to criticizing NATO allies and “embracing” Putin and North Korea’s authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un.In an ABC News town hall last week, Biden credited Trump for recently cementing diplomatic ties between Israel and two Arab neighbors: Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. But, Biden said, the president still has “no coherent plan for foreign policy” beyond “America alone.” Trump counters that “America First” is more than sloganeering. He won a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, curtailed legal immigration, wielded tariff powers and insists he’s staring down Beijing’s Xi on trade — efforts he frames as benefiting American workers.Yet heading into the final debate, Trump’s loudest foreign policy pitch isn’t about his record. It’s casting Biden as corrupt because of his son Hunter’s business associations in Ukraine and China.The president has promoted an unconfirmed New York Post report published last week that cites an email in which an official from Ukrainian gas company Burisma thanked Hunter Biden, who served on the company’s board, for arranging for him to meet Joe Biden during a 2015 visit to Washington.The Biden campaign has rejected Trump’s assertion of wrongdoing and noted that Biden’s schedule did not show a meeting with the Burisma official.Once the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden hails from the bipartisan establishment that shaped US international policy from World War II’s end until Trump’s election.Biden sees the international order established over that span — NATO, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization – as anchoring global stability, with the US leading as the world’s democratic superpower, rivaled only by one-party China.Trump eschews those institutions and their multilateral efforts. He’s withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization, the Paris accords to reduce carbon pollution worldwide and a multinational deal that limited Iran’s nuclear program. He’s pledged to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany, a notable retreat from the post-WWII framework.To Biden, those moves invite Russian aggression in Europe and an unchecked Beijing.Trump undoubtedly has been an international force. His NAFTA overhaul drew bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. The latest Middle East deal is a historic step, though it doesn’t address the region’s biggest unresolved matters: the Syrian civil war, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the land dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Biden has promised immediate changes.He’d recommit to the Paris accords while rejoining WHO and restoring its US financial support. He’s pledged to reverse Trump’s executive actions limiting travel from certain Muslim nations and curtailing the US asylum program for refugees.He’d restore foreign aid programs to other Western Hemisphere nations, especially in Central America, where economic and political instability drive migration patterns to the US Aides said Biden would likely halt troop reductions in Europe, believing those postings are fundamental to the US commitment to NATO and containment of Russian ambitions on the continent.Biden also promises to confront Putin, whom he describes as a “thug,” over interference in US elections via social media and other means. Trump has publicly rejected US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in 2016 and is doing so again in 2020 in ways intended to help Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-final-presidential-debate-could-thrust-foreign-policy-back-into-campaign/story-ttUHKuIO9jGds62ArfIXRP.html
22-10-2020||World||Taiwan says not seeking arms race with China after new US arms sale||Taiwan is not seeking to get involved in an arms race with China but does need a credible combat capability, Defence Minister Yen De-fa said on Thursday, after the United States approved a potential $1.8 billion arms sale to the Chinese claimed island.Beijing has applied increasing pressure om democratically ruled Taiwan to accept China’s sovereignty, including by flying fighter jets across the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.The latest US arms package includes sensors, missiles and artillery, and further congressional notifications are expected for drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles, made by Boeing Co, to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.Speaking to reporters, Yen thanked the United States and said the sales were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the “enemy threat and new situation”.“This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,” he added.“This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.”China is likely to condemn the new weapons sale, as it always does, but Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.“We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.”Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernisation a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly “asymmetric warfare” capabilities, which refers to making any Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.Washington, which, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei though it is its strongest global backer, has been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so it can become a “porcupine”, hard for China to attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-not-seeking-arms-race-with-china-after-new-us-arms-sale/story-r958HVDJ12HaylXhvPxwNK.html

22-10-2020||World||Snap polls averted after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party defeats motion seeking probe into corruption||The possibility of snap elections in Canada was averted for a third time since late September, as the ruling Liberal Party defeated an opposition motion in parliament that had aimed to establish a special committee of the House of Commons to investigate alleged government corruption.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had taken the firm position that such a motion would constitute a vote of confidence, and a loss would precipitate immediate elections. However, the motion was opposed by 180 MPs - including the Liberal caucus as well as members of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Greens and two Independents - with 146 supporting it, comprising the two largest opposition groupings, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois.It marked the third time the NDP came to the rescue of the Liberal Party, voting along with it on a critical motion. The motion had been moved to create a 15-member special committee that would probe, among other things, the grant of a nearly billion-dollar contract to a charity with close links to PM Trudeau and his family. The project given to WE Charity was later cancelled after a controversy erupted when it was revealed that Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother had been paid appearance fees by the organisation.Pablo Rodriguez, leader of the government in the House, accused the opposition of a gambit that could have led to “paralysing the government in the middle of a pandemic”. Speaking to reporters in Ottawa after the vote, Conservative House leader Gérard Deltell countered, “This is what the issue is all about with this motion, and what we see right now is a prime minister who will do whatever it takes to call an election.”NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, despite voting with the Liberals, levelled the same charge at Trudeau, saying in a statement, “We think the threat to call an election over an opposition motion to set up a committee is ridiculous and out-of-touch with what Canadians are facing. The prime minister always has the power to call an election. It’s clear that he wants an election now to hold onto power, before the pandemic gets worse.”However, Singh’s party came in for criticism from other opposition members for siding with the ruling party for the third time running, as Bloc Québécois House leader Alain Therrien accused the NDP of acting like “the Liberals’ lap dog”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/snap-polls-averted-after-canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-s-party-defeats-motion-seeking-probe-into-corruption/story-HTBpg9CvuO95NAodpfZK6H.html
22-10-2020||World||Thailand cancels emergency decree in bid to calm protests||Thailand’s government on Thursday canceled a state of emergency it had declared for Bangkok last week after the embattled prime minister suggested the gesture to cool massive student-led protests seeking democracy reforms.The revocation of the emergency decree was published in the government gazette, and took effect at noon Thursday.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha went on national television on Wednesday night to appeal to pro-democracy protesters to reduce political tensions and promised to lift the emergency measure.As he was speaking, protesters marched near Government House, his office, to demand he step down. They also asked for the release of their colleagues who were arrested in connection with earlier protests.They said that if their demands were not met, they would return in three days.The protesters are pressing for a more democratic constitution and reforms to the monarchy. The implicit criticism of the royal institution has stirred controversy because it traditionally has been treated as sacrosanct and a pillar of national identity.Wednesday marked the eighth straight day of demonstrations by a movement that was launched in March. It went into a lull as Thailand dealt with a coronavirus outbreak, and slowly revived in July. In the past week especially, protest have spread to other provinces.The demonstrations have continued even though many top protest leaders have been detained and the state of emergency banned public gatherings of more than four people.Prayuth, in the taped speech, pleaded with his countrymen to resolve their political differences through Parliament.“The only way to a lasting solution for all sides that is fair for those on the streets as well as for the many millions who choose not to go on the streets is to discuss and resolve these differences through the parliamentary process,” he said, according to an official English-language text of his remarks.The government on Tuesday approved a request to recall Parliament to deal with the political crisis in a special session from Monday to Wednesday.“While I can listen to and acknowledge the demands of protesters, I cannot run the country based on protester or mob demands,” Prayuth said.He ended his remarks with a plea: “Let us respect the law and parliamentary democracy, and let our views be presented through our representatives in Parliament.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-cancels-emergency-decree-in-bid-to-calm-protests/story-jrg9kHMBa9RIXaNX8MPIrO.html
22-10-2020||World||Pakistan’s parliamentary panel passes bill for review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s conviction||Pakistan’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice passed a government bill on Wednesday evening that seeks to review the conviction of Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has been sentenced to death by a military court for alleged involvement in spying.Farogh Naseem, minister for law and justice, told committee members that the bill, titled “the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance”, was introduced in compliance with directives of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Naseem argued that in case the bill was not adopted by parliament, Pakistan was facing possible sanctions for not complying with the ICJ’s verdict.Naseem said his ministry had sought to “preempt a possible Indian move” of filing a contempt petition against Pakistan in the ICJ by promulgating the ordinance, and clarified that neither India nor Jadhav had filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court to seek relief permissible under the ICJ verdict.He said that his ministry had to file a petition for the appointment of a lawyer for Jadhav, which is pending adjudication.Opposition parties criticised what they said was a move towards giving relief to Jadhav, calling it an NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) to persons charged with espionage. It is said that the NRO was introduced by former president Pervez Musharraf to give relief to politicians against whom charges had been filed during a spell of military rule in Pakistan.Aliya Kamran of JUI-F Party accused the Imran Khan administration of legislating on behalf of New Delhi. She demanded that the bill should be debated in public before it is passed.In response to the criticism, Naseem argued before the committee that India had been looking for a way to file a contempt plea against Pakistan with the ICJ. In such a scenario, the country could face sanctions if the matter was referred to the United Nations Security Council, the minister said.After further debate, the matter was settled through voting. Eight members voted in favour of the bill, while five opposed it, allowing it to be passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-parliamentary-panel-passes-bill-for-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-conviction/story-JwvXP1LMklXpodVAq1tXxJ.html

The Republican incumbent exuded confidence that he will get four more years in the White House. “We are going to win four more years in the White House. With your vote we will continue to cut taxes, cut regulations, lower drug prices like never before,” he said.

He, however, did not disclose her identity. “The residents of this city are holding a protest rally today after the unprecedented violation of norms,” the governor added.The incident took place in the city of Najafabad. In the video, which was shot with a mobile phone, the woman is seen cycling in front of a mosque. She can also be seen repeatedly raising her right hand in the air.IRNA further said the video of the woman, showing her ‘riding her bike without a veil in the main square’ and ‘in front of a big mosque,’ had triggered protests from residents and clerics in Najafabad.Under Iran’s Islamic law, which has been in force there since the 1979 revolution, women must wear a hijab that covers their head and neck and conceals their hair.However, in recent times, Iranian women have challenged this decree by allowing their veils to reveal more hair, especially in the capital Tehran and other major cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-woman-arrested-for-cycling-without-hijab-accused-of-insulting-islamic-veil/story-XjFiNHC2sL5LTdiayqyZJK.html
22-10-2020||World||Barack Obama hits campaign trail, slams US President Donald Trump||With less than two weeks left for the close of polling, Barack Obama hit the campaign trail on Wednesday in support of Democratic White House hopeful Joe Biden, launching with a blistering attack on US President Donald Trump. The former US president slammed Trump for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, his secret bank account in China, his tweeting, and for “making things up”. Obama urged Democrats to vote like never before to “leave no doubt” about the outcome.Obama’s drive-in rally in Philadelphia where he canvassed for his former vice-president was the largest turnout yet for a Biden campaign event.Biden was off the campaign trail on Wednesday to prepare for the final presidential debate with his rival on Thursday, to be held in Nashville, Tennessee. President Trump, too, was out campaigning, visiting North Carolina, a key battleground state, keeping up with his one-rally-a-day routine.Targeting Trump, former president Obama said, “Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country. Donald Trump isn’t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself.” It was a reference to the US president himself contracting Covid-19.“We literally left this White House a pandemic playbook... they probably used it to prop up a wobbly table somewhere,” Obama said.Obama criticised the Trump administration for driving a booming economy into the ground, giving tax breaks to billionaires, trying to gut the affordable health care system in the middle of a pandemic, and leaving America’s standing abroad in tatters. “His TV ratings are down. So, you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show. This is reality,” Obama said. “The rest of us have to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously.”On recent reports of Trump’s bank account in China, Obama said, “He’s got a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible? Can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for re-election? You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that. They would have called me Beijing Barry.”The former president, who remains very popular in the Democratic Party, was on a mission to energise Democrats to vote, especially young Black and Hispanic Americans - who so far don’t appear to be excited about Biden - and those who are likely to stay home on Election Day.“We can’t be complacent. I don’t care about the polls,” Obama said, referring to a slew of opinion polls that have Biden in the lead nationally and in battleground states, as was Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, in 2016. “There were a whole bunch of polls last time. Didn’t work out. Because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home. And got lazy and complacent. Not this time. Not this election.”Urged Democrats to go out and vote, Obama said, “We’ve got to turn out like never before. We cannot leave any doubt in this election.”Later in the day, national security officials warned of possible interference in the US election by Russia and Iran in general, after letters were purportedly sent out in the name of a white supremacist group, “Proud Boys”, to some Democrats in Florida and Alaska, threatening them to vote for Trump or face consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-hits-campaign-trail-slams-us-president-donald-trump/story-X1KNPnAoV6hPkyMTqXH2sN.html
22-10-2020||World||Britain partners with Oxford firm to assess Covid vaccine T cell responses||Britain on Thursday said it would partner with an Oxford-based firm to provide testing for the T cell response of coronavirus vaccine candidates to try to assess their immune responses.T cell immunity is thought to be essential to protection against infection from the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus, and could provide longer term immunity than antibodies. The UK Vaccine Taskforce has chosen Oxford Immunotec to supply T cell testing for its assessment of different vaccine candidates.“It is important to be able to assess the different vaccines head-to-head and the T cell response is part of our portfolio of accredited assays that we are employing for cross comparisons,” Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Vaccines Taskforce, said in a statement.Britain has signed supply deals for six different coronavirus vaccine candidates, including those being made by AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech, seen as among the frontrunners in the race for a vaccine.Oxford Immunotec said its technology platform enabled the centralisation of fresh blood samples from different locations to measure the T cell response in a standardised way.It said the platform, known as T-SPOT, was being used to identify the T cells made in response to the pathogen that causes tuberculosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-partners-with-oxford-firm-to-assess-covid-vaccine-t-cell-responses/story-5szobfKs3905JL2ZLSbEYP.html
22-10-2020||World||US proposes not to issue business visas for H-1B speciality occupations||The US State Department in a federal notification Wednesday proposed to make changes to its existing visa regulations under which foreign professionals, which would fall under H-1B, would not be issued temporary visa for business, as has been widely prevalent currently. If finalized, this proposal will eliminate any misconception that the “B-1 in lieu of H policy” provides an alternative avenue for foreign professionals to enter the US to perform skilled labour that allows, and potentially even encourages them and their employers to circumvent the restrictions and requirements relating to the H non-immigrant classification established by the Congress to protect US workers, the State Department said.The move is likely to impact a lot of Indian companies who send their technology professionals on B-1 visas for a short stay to complete the jobs on site in the US. On December 17, 2019, the California Attorney General announced a USD 800,000 settlement against Infosys Limited to resolve allegations that approximately 500 Infosys employees worked in California on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas rather than H-1B visas, the State Department said. “The proposed changes and the resulting transparency would reduce the impact of foreign labour on the US workforce of aliens performing activities in a specialty occupation without the procedural protections attendant to the H-1B classification,” it said. In its federal notification issued on Wednesday, the State Department said US architecture firm seeking protection from rising labour costs in the country might believe it could lay off its US architects and contract for the same professional architectural services will be provided by a foreign architecture firm. If the foreign firm sought H-1B visas for its architects, it would be required to pay the prevailing wage for architects in the area of intended employment in the United States, presumably the same wage the US architects had been paid, and meet the other requirements enacted by the Congress to protect US workers.But under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, the foreign architects could ostensibly seek B-1 visas and travel to the US to fill a temporary need for architecture services, so long as they retained a residence in the foreign country and continued to receive a salary, perhaps significantly lower than what is customary for US architects, dispersed abroad by the foreign firm (or under the auspices of a foreign parent or subsidiary), the State Department added.Under the Department’s guidance, visas could be issued for multiple architects planning temporary work in the United States, in certain situations. However, a foreign employer may succeed in undermining US immigration law and policy by rotating architects between the US and the foreign country to effectively fill the position of one US architect at a significantly lower cost, the notification said.“If the architects who intended to perform skilled labour were “of distinguished merit and ability... seeking to perform (temporary architectural services) of an exceptional nature requiring such merit and ability, one might argue the current regulatory language suggests this type of labour is a permissible basis for B-1 non-immigrant visa issuance,” the State Department said.This potential outcome is harmful to US workers and contrary to policies of the Trump Administration, it said.The State Department said the application process for a B-1 visa does not include similar procedural requirements to protect US workers like that of H-1B visas.Also, the fees for the B-1 visas are far less than that of H-1B visas. While the Congress required H-1B employers to pay significant fees to fund assistance to the US workforce as well as prevention and detection of fraud related to skilled labour, employers are not required to pay comparable fees to employ skilled workers under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, it said.According to the notification, the State Department estimates that this proposal will affect no more than 6,000 to 8,000 foreign workers per year, specifically aliens intending to provide services in a specialty occupation in the US.As per its estimate, up to 28 per cent of the approximately 8,000 annual B-1 visa issuances under the B-1 in lieu of H policy were to foreign workers who applied for a visa to perform services in a specialty occupation for a small entity in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-proposes-not-to-issue-business-visas-for-h-1b-speciality-occupations/story-JuA4T1HMjEfNUcy2nFDITO.html
22-10-2020||World||Democrats to boycott Senate Judiciary vote on Judge Barrett’s nomination||Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will boycott Thursday’s committee vote on Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination, The Hill reported.According to a joint statement by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Democrats on the committee, the push to confirm Barrett was a “sham process” from the beginning.“This has been a sham process from the beginning...We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just twelve days before the culmination of an election that is already underway,” read the statement.Meanwhile, The Hill has reported that the Republicans are expected to hold a rare weekend session to pave the way for a final confirmation vote on Barrett’s nomination on Monday despite the boycott by the Democrats.Barrett was nominated as the new justice of the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump on September 26.Barrett is a former law clerk to the late right-wing beacon Justice Antonin Scalia. She has been a federal judge for three years on the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.The seat of the Justice of Supreme Court became vacant with the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg who has been regarded as an iconic champion of women’s rights and a history making jurist passed away at the age of 87.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-to-boycott-senate-judiciary-vote-on-judge-barrett-s-nomination/story-bxNPjB1eOxeVNrO1XnMNZK.html
22-10-2020||World||Kamala Harris slams Trump for being an ‘incompetent’ president||The United States deserves to have a president who understands the dignity of the people and guides the country in a way that Americans can regain their standing and get closer to those ideals they hold, Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris said on Wednesday. In her remarks during a virtual fund raiser, Harris slammed Trump for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic fallout. “We deserve to have a President and to have a leadership in our country that understands the dignity of who we are and respects the dignity of who we are as a people, and guides our country, in a way that we can regain our standing and get closer to those ideals we hold,” Harris said. “We recognize that we have over eight million people in our country who have contracted the virus, again, it didn’t have to be this way, and yet we still have a President who also was the commander-in-chief who should have, as his first priority, to keep the health and well-being of the Americans intact and he is still denying the realities and the seriousness of this virus and the need to wear a mask,” she said. The Senator, who turned 56 a day ago, said “We are in a public health crisis and an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression”. At another fund raiser, she urged her countrymen to go out and vote. “Thirteen days to go. And we cannot let up on this gas pedal. We got to push -- well you know, electric vehicle pedal we need to push, push, push through,” she said. She called herself a “proud daughter of California”, and said “almost everything is at stake.” Harris addressed a campaign rally in Asheville, North Carolina. More than 150 people, many of them women, were sitting spaced out throughout the stadium, waving bright blue pom-poms and shaking noisemakers. She urged people to vote early.“This moment will pass, and years from now our children, our grandchildren...will ask us ‘Where were you in that moment?’ We will tell them about what we did to fight for the soul of this nation,” Harris said.Trump, she alleged, is incapable of being a President who will protect the well-being and health of the American people and “that is why he’s got to go”.Urging people to head to the polls in an election that’s likely to rely on turnout, she blasted Trump for his “failure” to handle the coronavirus pandemic, his refusal to condemn white supremacy, and his disbelief in science and climate change.“We love our country, imperfect though it may be,” she said of why people were here tonight.“And this country that we hold so dear — yes, it has taken a little bit of a beaten because of you know who. But what we know is our democracy and the strength of it will always be a function of our preparedness and willingness to fight for it,” she noted.Some of the loudest approval from the audience came when she criticized Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to make it more challenging for people to vote through a complicated mail-in ballot process and by closing polling locations.She drew loud laughter from some when — as she did during the vice presidential debate — she described Trump’s “weird obsession” with repealing Obama policies.“Do you think he is a racist? Yes,” Harris said of a question she often gets. “I don’t say that lightly, one should never say that lightly. But there is a pattern here. Think back to Charlottesville,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-slams-trump-for-being-an-incompetent-president/story-Rd9Modkzqfnv6iQ1lk5zMN.html

If there is no improvement in SOPs compliance observed, NCOC will have no choice but to revert to strict measures leading to re-closures of services.”Highlighting the “clear resurgence in coronavirus” in the country, the NCOC has asked the chief secretaries to “strictly implement” the SOPs.This statement was issued after Minister for Planning Asad Umar had said that the death rate due to coronavirus has increased by 140 per cent in the last week, Geo News reported.”We are collectively committing a blunder by recklessly ignoring all SOPs and the results have started to show,” Umar said.In a tweet, he said, “Last week daily COVID-19 mortality was 12. This is a 140 per cent increase vs few weeks back. We are collectively committing a blunder by recklessly ignoring all sop’s and the results have started to show.

22-10-2020||World||US to sell $1 billion worth of advanced air-to-ground missiles to Taiwan||The US government announced approval Wednesday to sell $1 billion worth of advanced air-to-ground missiles to Taiwan as the island shores up its defenses against the threat from China.The State Department said it had agreed to sell 135 of the AGM-84H SLAM-ER missiles, precision-guided, air-launched cruise missiles, and related equipment.Also approved was the sale of six MS-110 reconnaissance pods for air reconnaissance, and 11 M142 mobile light rocket launchers, taking the value of three arms packages to $1.8 billion.The SLAM-ER missiles will help Taiwan “meet current and future threats as it provides all-weather, day and night, precision attack capabilities against both moving and stationary targets” on the ground or ocean surface, a statement said.China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, has stepped up pressure toward the island over the past year, sending attack and surveillance aircraft into its airspace and ships near its waters.Last week Beijing released video of a military exercise simulating an invasion of a Taiwan-like territory featuring missile strikes and amphibious landings.While Taiwan has for decades fallen back on an implicit US security guarantee, Washington has urged it to strengthen its own capabilities to resist an attack.But Washington also wants Taiwan to upgrade its armaments. “Whether there’s an amphibious landing, a missile attack, a grey zone-type operation, they really need to fortify themselves,” President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said last week.“Taiwan needs to start looking at some asymmetric and anti-access area denial strategies... and really fortify itself in a manner that would deter the Chinese from any sort of amphibious invasion or even a grey zone operation against them,” said O’Brien.The sales announced Wednesday did not include the MQ9 Reaper combat drones which Taiwan has reportedly requested.pmh/mjs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-sell-1-billion-worth-of-advanced-air-to-ground-missiles-to-taiwan/story-vFyoPrFWGaX9i0hcZJgmzL.html
22-10-2020||World||Barack Obama rips into Donald Trump’s record in 2020 campaign trail debut||Former President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail on Wednesday, launching a blistering attack on Donald Trump with less than two weeks to go before the Republican president’s Election Day face-off with Democratic nominee Joe Biden.Speaking at a drive-in rally in Philadelphia on behalf of Biden, his former vice president, Obama offered his fiercestcritique yet of his successor, taking aim at Trump’s divisive rhetoric and his track record in the Oval Office.“He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself,” Obama said.Obama, who governed for two terms and remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, blasted Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting that the president himself had fallen victim to the virus.“Donald Trump isn’t suddenly going to protect all of us,” he said. “He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself.”Obama’s appearance filled a gap left by Biden, who has stayed at home in Delaware since Monday for meetings and preparation ahead of his Thursday debate with Trump in Nashville, Tennessee.The drive-in rally was held in the parking lot of Citizens Bank Park, the baseball stadium in Philadelphia, with the city’s skyline visible in the distance. It was the largest event of its kind that the Biden campaign has staged amid the coronavirus outbreak.The almost 280 vehicles were spread throughout the lot, with big screens placed to allow attendees to see the former president.With a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showing Biden with just a 4-percentage-point edge in Pennsylvania, Obama warned Democrats against complacency.“We’ve got to turn out like never before,” he said. “We cannot leave any doubt in this election.”Four years ago, Obama participated in a rally in Philadelphia with then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the day before the election, only to see Trump narrowly take the state. The Biden campaign considers winning there a top priority.Americans are voting early at a record pace this year, with 42 million ballots cast both via mail and in person ahead of the Nov. 3 election on concerns about the coronavirus and to make sure their votes are counted.The record early vote so far represents about 30% of the total ballots cast in 2016, according to the University of Florida’s U.S. Elections Project.After Obama spoke, Trump held a rally in North Carolina, another battleground state where opinion polls show a tight race.Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, was also in North Carolina to mobilize voters in Asheville and Charlotte.Top ally Even though Wednesday marked Obama’s 2020 campaign debut, his support has been essential for Biden. He has appeared at joint fundraisers with Biden and Harris, and his network of well-connected former aides has been instrumental in helping the campaign outpace Trump in bringing in donations. The Biden campaign is hopeful that Obama will commit to more events before the election.The last days of campaigning are taking place amid a surge in new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations in battleground states, including North Carolina and Pennsylvania but also Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. Pennsylvania has averaged 1,500 new cases a day over the past week, a level it has not seen since April, according to a Reuters analysis. North Carolina is averaging 2,000 new cases a day over the past week, its highest level ever. The virus has claimed the lives of more than 221,000 people in the United States.Polling shows a majority of voters are disappointed in the way Trump has handled the pandemic, which he has repeatedly said would disappear on its own.Biden and Trump are scheduled to meet in their second and final debate on Thursday night, giving the Republican an opportunity to change the trajectory of a race that Biden is leading in national polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-rips-into-donald-trump-s-record-in-2020-campaign-trail-debut/story-PvRb2CH6WFxjHMiu9TDfLO.html
22-10-2020||World||Deceased AstraZeneca trial volunteer didn’t receive Covid-19 vaccine||A participant who died during a trial of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil hadn’t received the company’s shot, according to a person familiar with the matter.The person asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.Brazil’s health authority Anvisa said it had been informed on Monday of the study volunteer’s death and had received a partial report from an international committee assessing the trial’s safety. That committee suggested the trial should continue, Anvisa said in a statement.AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with the University of Oxford, said it can’t comment on individual cases because of confidentiality and clinical trial rules. Oxford has no concerns about the safety of the vaccine trial after an independent and careful review, and Brazil’s regulators have recommended that it continue, university communications head Stephen Rouse said in statement.AstraZeneca’s American depositary receipts fell as much as 3.3% in New York on Wednesday afternoon after word of the person’s death, but trimmed most of those losses in recent trading.US Trial PauseA clinical trial of the vaccine in the US has been on hold for more than a month. Studies were halted globally in September when a UK participant became ill, but have resumed in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India in recent weeks. While temporary pauses in vaccine studies are common, AstraZeneca and Oxford have faced pressure to disclose more information about the UK episode.Interruption of the US trial raised concerns about the prospects of one of the world’s fastest-moving shots and highlighted the hurdles researchers face when developing a vaccine. Another vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, said earlier this month that it would pause its trial to investigate an illness in a study participant.Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines are based on adenoviruses, cold germs that researchers have used in experimental therapies for decades, and the two paused trials have raised questions about the approach.AstraZeneca told analysts in early October that it expected the US study could resume this year and that global approval would be determined by results in tests outside the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deceased-astrazeneca-trial-volunteer-didn-t-receive-covid-19-vaccine/story-7rkZbl540zUZ4p9qlgCuoM.html
22-10-2020||World||AstraZeneca trial volunteer dies in Brazil. What it means for Covid-19 vaccine development||In September first week, pharma company AstraZeneca which is developing a Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with Oxford University halted the trial process as two participants who took part in a trial developed adverse impact. Following this, the trial in other countries got stopped, triggering concern over vaccine safety. The trials began after the UK government gave the vaccine a go-ahead. Trials began in India, Brazil as well. The US authorities, however, has not yet resumed trials. Then a volunteer died in Brazil. But the trial is not being stopped.Here’s all you need to know about the latest case:1. Details of vaccine trial participants are confidential information. The details of the illness, if one might develop, are also not disclosed. Brazil’s newspapers reported that the person was a 28-year-old doctor who worked with Covid-19 patients.2. Reports suggest the person was enrolled as a participant for the ongoing trial. But no candidate vaccine shot was administered yet.3. Hence, the trial has not been stopped. “All significant medical events are carefully assessed by trial investigators, an independent safety monitoring committee and the regulatory authorities. These assessments have not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study,” AstraZeneca said.4. But such a piece of news leads to fear among people. 5. Johnson and Johnson which is producing millions of vaccine shots in the United States has halted their trial as one participant reported unexpected illness.So far, three vaccine trials have been briefly paused in between. Apart from AstraZeneca (resumed elsewhere apart from the US) and Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly’s trial of the antibody treatment was paused after adverse report. Experts, however, feel pausing trials shows the vaccine makers are exercising extreme caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-death-of-volunteer-a-roadblock-for-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-latest-developments/story-JkdPahaSXgB28lLUhqxenM.html
22-10-2020||World||Pope Francis becomes 1st pope to endorse same-sex civil unions||Pope Francis became the first pontiff to endorse same-sex civil unions in comments for a documentary that premiered Wednesday, sparking cheers from gay Catholics and demands for clarification from conservatives, given the Vatican’s official teaching on the issue.The papal thumbs-up came midway through the feature-length documentary “Francesco,” which premiered at the Rome Film Festival. The film, which features fresh interviews with the pope, delves into issues Francis cares about most, including the environment, poverty, migration, racial and income inequality, and the people most affected by discrimination.“Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God,” Francis said in one of his sit-down interviews for the film. “You can’t kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this. What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.”While serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis endorsed civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same-sex marriages. However, he had never come out publicly in favor of civil unions as pope, and no pontiff before him had, either.Also Read | Pope reverts back to mask-less old ways at indoor audienceThe Jesuit priest who has been at the forefront in seeking to build bridges with gays in the church, the Rev. James Martin, praised the pope’s comments as “a major step forward in the church’s support for LGBT people.”“The pope’s speaking positively about civil unions also sends a strong message to places where the church has opposed such laws,” Martin said in a statement.However, the conservative bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, Thomas Tobin, immediately called for clarification. “The pope’s statement clearly contradicts what has been the long-standing teaching of the church about same-sex unions,” Tobin said in a statement. “The church cannot support the acceptance of objectively immoral relationships.”Catholic teaching holds that gays must be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.” A 2003 document from the Vatican’s doctrine office stated that the church’s respect for gays “cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.”Doing so, the Vatican reasoned, would not only condone “deviant behavior,” but create an equivalence to marriage, which the church holds is an indissoluble union between man and woman.That document was signed by the then-prefect of the office, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI and Francis’ predecessor.Director Evgeny Afineevsky, who is gay, expressed surprise after the premiere Wednesday that the pope’s comments on civil unions had created such a firestorm, saying Francis wasn’t trying to change doctrine but was merely expressing his belief that gays should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals.“The world needs positivity right now, the world needs to care about climate change, care about refugees and migration, borders, walls, family separation,” Afineevsky said, urging attention be paid to the main issues covered by the film.One of the main characters in the documentary is Juan Carlos Cruz, the Chilean survivor of clergy sexual abuse whom Francis initially discredited during a 2018 visit to Chile.Cruz, who is gay, said that during his first meetings with the pope in May 2018 after they patched things up, Francis assured him that God made Cruz gay. Cruz tells his own story in snippets throughout the film, chronicling both Francis’ evolution on understanding sexual abuse as well as to document the pope’s views on gay people.Afineevsky had remarkable access to cardinals, the Vatican television archives and the pope himself. He said he negotiated his way in through persistence, and deliveries of Argentine mate tea and Alfajores cookies that he got to the pope via some well-connected Argentines in Rome.“Listen, when you are in the Vatican, the only way to achieve something is to break the rule and then to say, ‘I’m sorry,’” Afineevsky said in an interview ahead of the premiere.The director worked official and unofficial channels starting in early 2018, and ended up so close to Francis by the end of the project that he showed the pope the movie on his iPad in August. The two recently exchanged Yom Kippur greetings; Afineevsky is a Russian-born, Israeli-raised Jew now based in Los Angeles. On Wednesday, Afineevsky’s 48th birthday, the director said Francis presented him with a birthday cake during a private meeting at the Vatican.But “Francesco” is more than a biopic about the pope.Wim Wenders did that in the 2018 film “Pope Francis: A Man of His Word,” which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. “Francesco,” is more a visual survey of the world’s crises and tragedies, with audio from the pope providing possible ways to solve them.Afineevsky, who was nominated for an Oscar for his 2015 documentary “Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom,” traveled the world to film his pope movie: The settings include Cox’s Bazaar in Bangladesh where Myanmar’s Rohingya sought refuge; the U.S.-Mexico border; and Francis’ native Argentina.“The film tells the story of the pope by reversing the cameras,” said Vatican communications director Paolo Ruffini, who was one of Afineevsky’s closest Vatican-based collaborators on the film.Ruffini said that when Afineevsky first approached him about a documentary, he tried to tamp down his hopes for interviewing the pope. “I told him it wasn’t going to be easy,” he said.But Ruffini gave him some advice: names of people who had been impacted by the pope, even after just a brief meeting. Afineevsky found them: the refugees Francis met with on some of his foreign trips, prisoners he blessed, and some of the gays to whom he has ministered.“I told him that many of those encounters had certainly been filmed by the Vatican cameras, and that there he would find a veritable gold mine of stories that told a story,” Ruffini said. “He would be able to tell story of the pope through the eyes of all and not just his own.”Francis’ outreach to gays dates to his first foreign trip in 2013, when he uttered the now-famous words “Who am I to judge,” when asked during an airborne news conference returning home from Rio de Janiero about a purportedly gay priest.Since then, he has ministered to gays and transsexual prostitutes, and welcomed people in gay partnerships into his inner circle. One of them was his former student, Yayo Grassi, who along with his partner visited Francis at the Vatican’s Washington D.C. embassy during the pope’s 2015 visit to the U.S.The Vatican publicized that encounter, making video and photos of it available, after Francis was ambushed during that same visit by his then-ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who invited the anti-gay marriage activist Kim Davis to meet with the pope.News of the Davis audience made headlines at the time and was viewed by conservatives as a papal stamp of approval for Davis, who was jailed for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Vatican, however, vigorously sought to downplay it, with the Vatican spokesman saying the meeting by no means indicated Francis’ support for her or her position on gay marriage.However, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was fervently opposed to gay marriage when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. Then, he launched what gay activists remember as a “war of God” against Argentina’s move to approve same-sex marriage.The pope’s authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, said at the time of his 2013 election that Bergoglio was politically wise enough to know the church couldn’t win a straight-on fight against gay marriage. Instead, Rubin said, Bergoglio urged his fellow bishops to lobby for gay civil unions instead.It wasn’t until Bergoglio’s proposal was shot down by the conservative bishops’ conference that Bergoglio publicly declared his opposition, and the church lost the issue altogether.Francis, in the new documentary, essentially confirms Rubin’s account of what transpired. Of his belief in the need for legislation to protect gays living in civil relationships, he said: “I stood up for that.”Afineevsky declined to say when Francis made the comment, but he began production in 2018 and Italy locked down for the coronavirus in March, suggesting the interview would have occurred in 2018 or more likely 2019.Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an organization of LGBT Catholics, praised Francis’ comments as a “historic” shift for a church that has a record of persecuting gays.“At the same time, we urge Pope Francis to apply the same kind of reasoning to recognize and bless these same unions of love and support within the Catholic Church, too,” he said in a statement.However, more conservative commentators sought to play down Francis’ words and said that while secular civil unions are one thing, a church blessing of them is quite another.In a tweet, conservative U.S. author and commentator Ryan Anderson noted that he and some of his colleagues had gone on record a decade ago saying they would support federal civil unions for any two adults who commit to sharing domestic responsibilities. Such an arrangement, Anderson said, would leave churches the option of refusing to recognize these unions as marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-becomes-1st-pope-to-endorse-same-sex-civil-unions/story-vGkVW3mF3USG6GtwwihO1I.html
22-10-2020||World||Pakistan unlikely to exit FATF’s grey list: Report||Pakistan may remain on the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as it has been unable to comply with six of the 27 points in the global terror financing and money laundering watchdog’s action plan, a media report said on Wednesday.The Paris-based global watchdog is holding its virtual plenary session on October 21-23. It will review Pakistan’s progress on the 27-point action plan.The FATF had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018. “The country will succeed in exiting the FATF’s grey list by June next year,” The Express Tribune reported, quoting diplomatic sources. It said the country has managed to avert being blacklisted. The International Cooperation Review Group of the FATF has acknowledged that Pakistan had complied with 21 points of the action plan, the report said.Also Read | Pakistan readies plan to sabotage J&K telecom blackout with new mobile towersSeeking to wriggle out of the FATF’s grey list, Pakistan in August imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. It won a three-month further extension to complete FATF’s 27-point action plan because of the coronavirus pandemic. The deadline was June this year, but the FATF extended it due to the postponement of its plenary over Covid-19. In February, the FATF gave Pakistan a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against money laundering and terror financing committed with the international community.Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa has ordered an inquiry into the kidnapping of Sindh police chief Mushtaq Mahar by paramilitary Rangers Force to compel him to sign orders that had led to the brief arrest of Muhammad Safdar Awan, the son-in-law of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Safdar was arrested on Monday by Punjab police that forcibly entered his hotel room in Karachi, where he was staying with his wife and PML-N vice-president Maryam Sharif after a massive rally a day earlier, organised by Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). PDM alleged the arrest came after Mahar was abducted and made to register cases against Awan and 200 others including Maryam Nawaz for sloganeering at the mausoleum of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.The probe came after more than 20 senior provincial police officers including Mahar went on leave to protest against the abduction. Mahar later withdrew his leave application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unlikely-to-exit-fatf-s-grey-list-report/story-rtPe2SNQ6Ypr3G1B5xqNDI.html
22-10-2020||World||The US-China conflict over chips is about to get uglier||On a scorching hot day in late August, representatives of Taiwan’s government and industry crowded into the clinical cool of a state-of-the-art semiconductor facility for a symbolic moment in the global tech conflict.They were attending the opening ceremony for a training center built by Dutch company ASML Holding at a cost of about $16 million, small change for an industry used to spending $10 billion or more on a single advanced manufacturing plant.The real value of the site in the southern city of Tainan is strategic: It’s one of just two such facilities outside the Netherlands capable of training semiconductor engineers to fabricate cutting-edge chips on ASML machines. Fellow US ally South Korea hosts the other — and Washington is working hard to ensure China never acquires the same technology.  As the US-China confrontation takes root, the ability to craft chips for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars and smartphones has become an issue of national security, injecting government into business decisions over where to manufacture chips and to whom to sell them. Those tensions could kick into overdrive as Communist Party leaders set a five-year plan that includes developing China’s domestic technology industry, notably its chip capabilities.Semiconductors made from silicon wafers mounted with billions of microscopic transistors are the basic component of modern digital life and the building blocks of innovation for the future. They are arguably one of the world’s most important industries, with sales of $412 billion last year; scale that up to the electronics industry that depends on chips, and it’s worth some $5.2 trillion globally, according to German manufacturers.Politics is roiling that business model, sparking a drive for more autonomy from the US to China, Europe and Japan. “We’re in a new world where governments are more concerned about the security of their digital infrastructure and the resiliency of their supply chains,” said Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of global policy with the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association. “The techno-nationalist trends gaining traction in multiple capitals around the world are a challenge to the semiconductor industry.”At once highly globalized and yet concentrated in the hands of a few countries, the industry has choke points that the US under the presidency of Donald Trump has sought to exploit in order to thwart China’s plans to become a world leader in chip production.Washington says Beijing can only achieve that goal through state subvention at the expense of US industry, while furthering Communist Party access to high-tech tools for surveillance and repression. China rejects the allegations, accusing the US of hypocrisy and acting out of political motivation.For both sides, Taiwan, which is responsible for some 70% of chips manufactured to order,  is the new front line.Beijing is increasingly hostile toward Taiwan, a democratically governed island it regards as a renegade province. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s status as the world’s largest contract chipmaker — a trend taking over the industry — the go-to supplier for Apple Inc. and the focus of next-generation chip-making, adds another dimension to China’s enmity, and to its standoff with the US.TSMC has become “turf that all geopolitical players want to secure,” founder Morris Chang said in November.Just a couple of kilometers from the new training center, cranes dot a massive construction site where TSMC is building “fabs” in which it will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world — chips that are no longer available to China’s Huawei Technologies due to US export controls. Huawei used to be TSMC’s second-largest customer, accounting for 14% of sales; those shipments stopped in September.The White House has also imposed export restrictions on China’s largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., having already squashed Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., once among Beijing’s biggest hopes to climb the chip ladder. The US is also reaching out to key players at home and abroad to ask them to reconsider their relations with China.  China’s intentions are so alarming to America because chips can be dual-use items with military applications, according to a former official familiar with the US administration’s efforts. “They are the fundamental basis of our qualitative military advantage, from missiles to radars to submarines,” the official said.After decades when the industry was encouraged to go global, Trump is attempting to reel it back home. The CHIPS for America Act introduced to Congress in June aims to set up incentives to support semiconductor manufacturing and research in the US.One executive at a Chinese semiconductor company, asking not to be named due to commercial and political sensitivities, said three of its deals had been aborted because of concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or CFIUS, which reviews the national security implications of transactions. Germany has also been effectively cut off, making any deals very difficult, the person said.China “firmly opposes the unjustified suppression” of its companies by the US “under the weakest pretext of national security,” and will continue to defend them, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in late September.China — the world’s biggest semiconductor market, accounting for more than 50% of all chips sold — isn’t standing by as its high-tech ambitions are kneecapped. That outsized demand means many major deals need Beijing’s sign-off: Qualcomm gave up its pursuit of NXP Semiconductors in 2018 after failing to win approval from China.China’s five-year plan for the chip industry will lend it the same strategic importance Beijing gave to its atomic bomb program. What’s more, a law passed Oct. 17 may allow China to hit back at the US, with speculation that it could prompt export controls on rare earths used in chip production.Still, the rolling restrictions imposed by Trump haven’t just hit China’s chip capabilities but are upending the entire industry. And there’s scant sign of a climbdown, whoever wins the US election in November.   Citing the need to promote “digital sovereignty,” the European Commission is exploring a 30 billion-euro ($35 billion) drive to raise Europe’s share of the world chip market to 20%, from less than 10% now.  Japan is also looking to bolster its domestic capacity. At least one Japanese delegation traveled to Taiwan in May and June this year in the hope of convincing TSMC to invest in Japan, a person with knowledge of the visit said. But TSMC announced in May that it was building a $12 billion facility in Arizona, and the company declined to receive any foreign visitors seeking to woo it, said another person familiar with the company’s thinking. Both asked not to be named discussing corporate strategy.Meanwhile South Korea, home to Samsung, the No. 1 memory chipmaker, is striving for more self-reliance after Japan imposed export curbs last year on chemicals used in semiconductor manufacture during a flare-up in the countries’ tensions over Japan’s wartime past.While the U.S. remains dominant with giants like Intel Corp and Qualcomm and a virtual monopoly on the software essential to chip design, “there’s no region in the world that can proclaim strategic autonomy in semiconductors,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the Technology and Geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. “Take out any of these players and the value chain falls down.”In January, days before Trump signed an initial trade deal with China, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sat down for dinner with around 30 CEOs in Silicon Valley. He was the guest of Keith Krach, a 30-year veteran of the tech scene who was appointed undersecretary for economic growth in June 2019.Pompeo had a message for them: China’s Communist Party “is a threat to your companies because they don’t want to compete, they want to put you out of business,” Krach recalled him saying, he told a virtual conference of the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Sept. 29.Trump may have weaponized the semiconductor value chain, but it was the Obama administration that first acted on the threat posed by China, unveiling a semiconductor strategy in January 2017 as one of its last acts. Trump picked up the baton, but the nature of the supply chain means that others are in the US line of sight.Israel — a high-tech R&D hub where Intel is the largest private employer — exported semiconductors worth about $2.1 billion last year, with about half going to China, data compiled by UN Comtrade shows.That closeness to China risks becoming a liability. Zvika Orron, a partner at Israel’s Viola Ventures who leads semiconductor investing, said there’s a hesitancy on the Israeli side to look to China because of worry that Chinese funding could imperil future US deals. Carice Witte, founder of the SIGNAL nonprofit focused on Israel-China ties, said the US is bound to “start asking more questions.”The UK is another pinch point thanks to Arm Ltd., whose instruction set — the basic code that allows chips to communicate with software — underlies everything from smartphones to the world’s fastest supercomputer. Arm currently sells to China, but the company’s takeover by Nvidia Corp puts that business in doubt. If the $40 billion deal wins regulatory approval, Arm would fall under American jurisdiction and become even more subject to US export controls.  While the UK government has yet to show its hand, it allowed the sale of Arm to Softbank of Japan in 2016, so wouldn’t normally be expected to intervene now. But the newly strategic nature of the industry has prompted lawmakers to call for a review of the deal’s implications. Here too there are concerns at being caught between the US and China.Losing a world-class technology company to the US for the Department of Justice to “weaponize” is not a good place to be, according to a person with knowledge of British national security considerations. The risk, they said, is a UK strategic asset becomes “recognized as part of the U.S. arsenal” in its campaign against China.Over the Taiwan Strait on mainland China, the mood at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in late August was gloomy. Chinese executives worried what the Trump administration might do next to hobble Beijing’s progress.“The conflict remains very fluid, which makes it impossible to predict what next moves both sides are going to take,” said Huang Yan, application and sales director at Senodia Technology, a Shanghai-based chip design company that develops sensor chips for smartphones.China is on course to import $300 billion of semiconductors for the third straight year, underscoring its dependence on U.S. technology. That’s something President Xi Jinping is determined to end.Xi has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies from artificial intelligence to wireless networks. A focus of Beijing is to accelerate research into so-called third-generation semiconductors — circuits made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, a fledgling technology where no country dominates.Yet without silicon capabilities it will be difficult for China to build a proper semiconductor industry, said a senior TSMC official. Another person from a company involved in third-generation chip production said designing them is an art, and even poaching a team of designers won’t necessarily guarantee success.The consensus is it won’t be easy for China to catch up, especially at the cutting-edge where TSMC and Samsung are producing chips whose circuits are measured in single-digit nanometers, or billionths of a meter. SMIC would have to double annual research spending in the next two-to-three years just to prevent its technology gap with those companies widening, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum.The tussle raises the prospect of a broader decoupling of the global industry with two distinct supply chains. As with 5G, the question then becomes one of the extent of each system: Does China’s high-tech gravity pull in Southeast Asia and parts of Europe, or is it confined to its immediate neighborhood? How many allies will side with the US?To be sure, the chip industry is still thriving, with the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 30% this year. Geopolitics is now a feature of boardrooms, said the SIA’s Goodrich, but 5G and AI are likely to cause more market upheaval.The direction of travel still worries key players. Shares of Micron Technology Inc., the largest US chipmaker, fell in September after it was forced to halt shipments to Huawei, its biggest customer.Complete decoupling would harm US competitiveness and hurt China, raising the prospect of less money for R&D, slowing innovation, said Goodrich. “A world in which the U.S. and China are independent from one another is a negative outcome for everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-u-s-china-conflict-over-chips-is-about-to-get-uglier/story-VAqyjTLK6wHsq1OLRmHDnJ.html
22-10-2020||World||Relief for Justin Trudeau as Canada avoids snap election||Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government avoided being toppled in a confidence vote Wednesday after a majority of Parliament members voted against a Conservative motion to create a special anti-corruption committeeThe Liberal government had declared the motion to be a matter of confidence. Trudeau’s Liberal party won re-election last year but does not have a majority of seats in Parliament and must rely on at least one opposition party to remain in power. The leftist New Democrat party and Green parties voted with the government to avoid an election.“It was about paralyzing the government in the middle of a pandemic,” Liberal House leader Pablo Rodriguez said of the attempt to create the committee. Rodriguez had said the motion would allow the opposition to pull Cabinet ministers from their work and require them to testify “day after day.”New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh in announcing that his party would vote with the government said the party wants to focus on what Canada needs during the pandemic.The opposition Conservatives, the New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois have argued that the Liberals are avoiding scrutiny of contracts and programs set up to deal with the pandemic. The Liberals temporarily closed Parliament in August, which shut down the work of existing committees probing the We Charity deal.Trudeau has said he should have recused himself from a Cabinet decision to award a contract to We Charity to administer money to students having trouble finding work due to the pandemic. The almost billion-dollar program came under scrutiny after it was revealed that We Charity, an organization Trudeau’s family has worked for, was chosen to administer it. Trudeau’s wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined $300,000 Canadian (US$221,000) for speaking at a number of We Charity events.The Conservatives have said the committee could explore the We Charity deal.Robert Bothwell, a professor at the University of Toronto, expects an election in the spring, but said it also depends on how the pandemic is going.“Trudeau isn’t that really popular,” Bothwell said. “The bloom is off the rose.”Bothwell said weak opposition keeps him in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/relief-for-justin-trudeau-as-canada-avoids-snap-election/story-9GDxlAakFuthnlMWfQRGOI.html
22-10-2020||World||Court ruling could block thousands of Iowa ballot requests||A split Iowa Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a new Republican-backed law that could bar county elections commissioners from mailing absentee ballots to thousands of people who omitted information on their applications.The 4-3 ruling means that voters who want to cast mail-in ballots in the Nov. 3 election must complete their absentee ballot applications before Saturday’s deadline in order to qualify.Auditors will not be allowed to use the state’s voter registration system to fix any deficient applications, as they have done in prior elections. Voters must do so themselves.Dissenting justices said the ruling will “likely cause thousands of voters to not receive their ballot in time to use it” and others will face increased health risks from voting in person during the pandemic.Those affected would still be able to vote early at the auditor’s office and satellite locations or on Election Day.The ruling marks another legal victory for Republicans and President Trump’s reelection campaign in Iowa, where his race against Democrat Joe Biden and a key Senate contest are expected to be close.Republicans who control the Iowa Legislature passed the law in June after the primary saw record turnout with heavy mail-in voting, which was promoted as a way to keep people from contracting coronavirus at crowded polling places.The law specified that auditors cannot use government databases to fill in blanks on absentee ballot request forms and must contact voters by email, phone and mail to provide the information. Auditors say that task is time-consuming and not always successful.Under Iowa’s voter identification law, those applying for absentee ballots must provide either a driver’s license number or their voter pin number, which few people know. Auditors say some requesters leave that field blank, or make other mistakes or omissions on the forms, which also ask for addresses and birth dates.Critics contend the law adds several days of processing incomplete requests and that thousands of them could be left without absentee ballots.The League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa and Majority Forward, a group supporting Senate Democrats, filed a lawsuit in July claiming the law was an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote that could prevent some people from participating this year.Trump’s campaign and Republican groups intervened, arguing the law was necessary to protect election integrity. A judge in Johnson County sided with them last month, upholding the law.The Supreme Court agreed last week to review the decision. On the same day, the court upheld a directive from Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, that invalidated tens of thousands of absentee ballot applications that had been sent to voters in three counties with their identification information already filled in.In the majority opinion Wednesday, four justices agreed with Republicans that the law was a way to “protect the integrity and security of the absentee ballot system” by requiring requesters to provide information verifying their identities.“We are not persuaded the statute imposes a significant burden on absentee voters. It is not a direct burden on voting itself,” wrote the majority, which included Justices Edward Mansfield, Thomas Waterman, Christopher McDonald and Matthew McDermott.They argued that the rate of absentee ballot requests that have not been fulfilled by county auditors is “extremely low,” about 13,000 statewide as of Friday out of more than 842,000 requests. Most of those unfilled are in Johnson and Woodbury counties, two of the three that had to invalidate pre-filled requests mailed to registered voters.It is of “little significance” that the law was not passed in response to any instances of absentee ballot fraud since its burdens are so minimal, the majority argued.In a dissent joined by two colleagues, Justice Dana Oxley said that thousands more requests for absentee ballots may come before Saturday’s deadline and those missing information will go unfulfilled.She added that absentee voting by mail has become critically important as Iowa for weeks has suffered among the nation’s highest rates of coronavirus infection. Putting a “significant burden” on that option without any documented voter fraud or election integrity concerns is unconstitutional, she argued.As of Wednesday, more than 600,000 people had returned absentee ballots through the mail or in person for the election. Oxley said county auditors have kept up with requests for ballots but could be overwhelmed in coming days.“The majority’s position rests on the calm before the storm,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-ruling-could-block-thousands-of-iowa-ballot-requests/story-xyAAhHHbDhbYSaeLVVHIYJ.html
22-10-2020||World||US says Iran, Russia attempting to interfere in election||US officials warned that Iran and Russia are attempting to interfere with the presidential election, allowing the spread of false information.“We have confirmed that some voter registration information has been obtained by Iran, and separately by Russia,” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in a press conference Wednesday evening. “This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to convey misinformation.”“We ask every American to do their part to defend against those who wish us harm,” Ratcliffe said. “Do not allow these efforts to have their intended effect.”Ratcliffe, who was joined by FBI Director Christopher Wray, said Iran aimed to damage President Donald Trump’s re-election effort.“We have already seen Iran sending spoofed emails designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump,” he said.US intelligence agencies have previously said that, as in 2016, Russia sought to interfere to help Trump.In a joint statement, Marco Rubio, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner, the panel’s top Democrat. said, “Our adversaries abroad seek to sow chaos and undermine voters’ belief in our democratic institutions, including the election systems and infrastructure that we rely on to record and properly report expressions of the voters’ will.”Just before Ratcliffe and Wray announced the threat to the Nov. 3 election, the Washington Post reported that Trump is considering firing Wray after the election. Trump has faulted Wray for not providing fuel for the president’s contention that anti-Trump bias drove the FBI’s investigation into whether anyone involved in his 2016 campaign colluded in Russia’s interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-iran-russia-attempting-to-interfere-in-election/story-Vwo1tqGcMIH7cE6lnw6GxK.html
22-10-2020||World||‘Will come after you’: Democratic voters ‘threatened’ to vote for President Trump||Democratic voters in at least four battleground states including Florida and Pennsylvania received threatening emails, falsely purporting to be from the far-right group Proud Boys, that warned “we will come after you” if the recipients didn’t vote for president Donald Trump.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage)The voter-intimidation operation apparently used email addresses obtained from state voter registration lists, which include party affiliation and home addresses and can include email addresses and phone numbers. Those addresses were then used in an apparently widespread targeted spamming operation. The senders claimed they would know which candidate the recipient was voting for in the Nov. 3 election, for which early voting is ongoing.(Read more: US Election 2020: Donald Trump, Joe Biden tied in Texas, poll shows)Federal officials have long warned about the possibility of this type of operation, as such registration lists are not difficult to obtain.(Read more: Trump incapable of taking the job seriously’, says Obama)“These emails are meant to intimidate and undermine American voters’ confidence in our elections,” Christopher Krebs, the top election security official at the Department of Homeland Security, tweeted Tuesday night after reports of the emails first surfaced.He urged voters not to fall for “sensational and unverified claims,” reminding them that ballot secrecy is guaranteed by law in all states. “The last line of defense in election security is you - the American voter.”A spokesperson at FBI headquarters did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.Asked about the emails during an online forum on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said she lacked specific information. “I am aware that they were sent to voters in multiple swing states and we are working closely with the attorney general on these types of things and others,” she said.Bennett Ragan, the campaign manager of Florida statehouse candidate Kayser Enneking, said he got two of the emails and knew about 10 other people in Gainesville who also got them. Bennett said the home address included in the personalized email he received was not current so he figures the data on him was acquired from the 2018 primary election voter roll.The emails were sent by a group — its identity unknown — that put considerable time and effort into identifying vulnerable internet servers in several countries including Estonia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which they hijacked to send the emails, said security researcher John Scott-Railton, who examined dozens. Voters in Arizona and Alaska also received them, he said.The Associated Press obtained the personalized email from two Florida voters in different parts of the state.Scott-Railton, of the Citizen Lab online civil-rights project at the University of Toronto, said the Proud Boys email address that the spammers placed in the email’s sender field was “a flag of convenience.” The true addresses of origin — not readily visible but listed in email headers — were the hijacked servers. The emails reviewed by the AP both appeared to originate from a business in Estonia.And while the operation was not terribly sophisticated, it may still have been backed by a nation-state. There are documented cases in which Russian agents have sent threatening mail, including to US military spouses. Ukraine has also been hit by email hoaxes suspected to be the work of the Kremlin. Intelligence services like to use such techniques because they don’t bear the stamp of government, thus providing deniability.“We’ve definitely seen state actors impersonate political figures and factions in the past. It wouldn’t be unheard of for them to do that in this case,” said John Hultquist, director of threat intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. None of the Russian military hackers indicted by US prosecutors for interfering in the 2016 presidential election on Trump’s behalf have been brought to justice.“To me this is a canary case. And what it shows is that somebody with obvious malicious intent can get messages that leverage voter registration data in front of the eyeballs of a large number of Americans,” said Scott-Railton. The emails clearly penetrated the spam filters of email providers, he said, though some were likely blocked.Microsoft and Google, major email providers with top-notch security researchers and tools, did not immediately comment on how many of the spoofed mails may have been sent and what intelligence they may have about the sender’s identity.“The real question is just how well did this operation cover its tracks,” said Scott-Railton, who worries that the operation might have been a dry run. “Is someone testing a capability that they intend to use on a much larger scale in the future?”He urged the US government and its allies to be as transparent as possible about what they know about the operation as soon as possible to assure the public that it does not endanger election security.In a post on the messaging service Telegram, an account that claims to represent the Seattle Proud Boys said the group had no involvement with the emails, calling them a “false flag operation.” President Trump has been criticized for refusing to condemn the far-right group.Daniel Tokaji, dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School and an expert on voting rights, said he’s afraid we could see more of the type of voter suppression that the intimidation emails attempt — trying to scare people into not voting at all.Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor, said the use of voter roll information could make the emails especially frightening. “It puts so much unfair stress and responsibility on the voters and nobody should have to fear for their safety when deciding who to vote for — but that’s exactly the point of voter suppression.”—-Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., David Klepper in Providence, R.I, and Christina Cassidy in Atlanta contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-come-after-you-democratic-voters-threatened-to-vote-for-president-trump/story-rN1wARicorovu01oYnTPiO.html
22-10-2020||World||China struggles to fill Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ leadership void||As Donald Trump has pulled the United States inward under his “America First” presidency, China has had only halting success at capitalising on a global leadership vacuum, presenting openings for a more internationalist Joe Biden administration if he wins next month’s election.Under Trump, Washington abandoned the Paris climate pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the UN Human Rights Council and UNESCO, and ditched the Iran nuclear deal. It has announced that it will withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) next July and has crippled the World Trade Organization by blocking appointments to its appeals panel.Beijing, which accuses Washington of being “addicted to quitting”, has struck a more globalist posture under President Xi Jinping: Chinese officials head four of the 15 UN agencies, and Beijing has boosted its WHO commitment by $2 billion.As it has sought a seat at the table more befitting its status as the world’s number-two economy, China has also formed its own multilateral institutions, including the Belt and Road Initiative and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).“China has been trying its best to take advantage of the U.S. retreat to advance its own goals,” said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. “Nevertheless, China has had difficulty translating its growing influence into foreign policy success,” he said.While China has all-but-quashed the spread of coronavirus and is a leader in vaccine efforts, its early mishandling of the outbreak that began in Wuhan has triggered a global backlash.Beijing’s clampdown on Hong Kong, its mass detention of Uighur Muslims, its island-building in the South China Sea and sabre-rattling towards Taiwan as well as more aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy, have also eroded sentiment towards China - even as Trump’s policies have undermined U.S. standing.China has struggled to leverage the exasperation of some U.S. allies towards Washington under Trump, with State Councillor Wang Yi, the government’s top diplomat, facing pushback over Hong Kong and other issues during a recent five-country visit to Europe.“Many see the U.S. retreat from global institutions under Trump as ceding fertile ground to China in this area, but what is striking is how much China’s so-called ‘wolf-warrior’ diplomacy has undercut their ability to take advantage,” said Susan Thornton, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia early in the Trump administration.GLOBAL OPINIONA survey by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center found that unfavourable views towards China in advanced economies including the United States had soared over the past year.In April, an internal Chinese report warned that Beijing faced a rising wave of hostility in the aftermath of the coronavirus, with global anti-China sentiment at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, Reuters reported in May, citing people familiar with the matter.If Biden wins, he is expected to maintain a tough stance on China but also to engage with allies and international bodies in a more traditional way. He has said he would keep the United States in the WHO and rejoin the Paris climate accord.“On many issues of global governance, there is still much room for cooperation between the two countries,” such as climate and COVID-19, said Jia Qingguo, a professor at Peking University School of International Studies who has advised China’s government.MIXED SUCCESSDespite its growing economic and military might, China has been a sometimes-awkward multilateral leader, insisting that it is still a developing country and does not want to replace the United States.Its diplomatic ties tend to be transactional, with a policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries and a demand that it gets the same treatment, blasting what it calls Washington’s “long-arm jurisdiction.”Its Belt & Road initiative has been criticised for a lack of transparency, environmental concerns, and the financial sustainability of projects, although the AIIB has been credited with adhering to global standards.China’s success at putting one of its own as head of France-based police coordination agency Interpol ended disastrously when the chief, Meng Hongwei, resigned after going missing in China, where he was sentenced to jail this year for graft.“China’s explicit ambitions to ‘lead the reform of the global governance system’ have not been clearly defined,” said Julian Gewirtz, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “These statements are often swaddled in gauzy platitudes — and that means the rest of the world should judge China by its track record rather than its promises.” (Reporting by Tony Munroe; additional reporting by Gao Liangping; editing by Richard Pullin)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-struggles-to-fill-donald-trump-s-america-first-leadership-void/story-lORWq6lEcqrIv96Pd8B0NI.html

22-10-2020||World||Covid-19 cases spikes have officials looking to shore up hospitals||Hospitals across the United States are starting to buckle from a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, with several states setting records for the number of people hospitalized and leaders scrambling to find extra beds and staff. New highs in cases have been reported in states big and small — from Idaho to Ohio — in recent days.The rise in cases and hospitalizations was alarming to medical experts.“It’s really worrisome,” said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at George Mason University. Around the world, disease trackers have seen a pattern: First, the number of cases rises, then hospitalizations and finally there are increases in deaths. Seeing hospitals struggling is alarming, she said, because it may already be too late to stop a crippling surge.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“By the time we see hospitalizations rise, it means we’re really struggling,” Popescu said.In Kentucky, the governor called the number of daily confirmed cases “grim,” forcing another round of preparations to expand hospital capacity.“We are now going back to our plans about capacity in hospitals, looking — if we have to — at hotel options and the use of state parks,” Gov. Andy Beshear said during a recent briefing. “Ensuring that we have the operational plans to stand up the field hospital, if necessary.”The governor reported 776 people hospitalized, including 202 in intensive care and 96 on ventilators. There were 1,312 new Covid-19 cases statewide Tuesday — the fourth-highest one-day total since the pandemic began.At the other end of the country, Idaho reported its largest coronavirus spike, with new cases increasing by some 47% over the past two weeks. Idaho is currently sixth in the nation for new cases per capita, with a positivity rate of just over 15% — one of the country’s highest.Still, Gov. Brad Little has resisted calls for a statewide mask mandate, saying it’s up to individuals to take the necessary steps — wearing masks, social distancing and practicing good hygiene — to stem the surge.“As a health system, we’re all very concerned,” said Dr. Bart Hill, the vice president and chief quality officer of St. Luke’s Health System, the state’s largest. “It’s indicative of anticipating we’re going to see more hospitalizations affecting an older population in the next two, three, four weeks.”“The direction we’re heading is one that looks real problematic,” he said.Since the virus was first detected earlier this year, more than 40 million people around the globe have been infected and more than 1.1 million people have died. In the United States, there have been more than 8 million confirmed cases and more than 220,000 deaths. The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases has reached nearly 60,000 — the highest since July.In some cases, spikes are happening as schools reopen and as Americans grow weary of wearing masks and practicing social distancing.“At this point in the pandemic, everybody’s tired. Everybody’s craving human interaction,” Popescu, the epidemiologist, said. “I worry this is a ripe situation for us to really bubble over what we’ve seen.”Winter is a busy season for hospitals as influenza and other respiratory illnesses ramp up with more people congregating indoors. “I worry a Covid wave that causes a heavy surge on hospitals that are already very busy will further add stress to a system that is exhausted,” Popescu said.Selin Bert, 48, who lives in Portland, Oregon, told The Associated Press that her mother-in-law, who is in her early 70s and lives in Mesquite, Nevada, recently got a severe case of Covid-19 and had to be taken to the ICU in a Las Vegas hospital. She suspects her mother-in-law was infected during a visit from her grandchildren, who traveled from Montana.Her in-laws, Bert said, were religious about social distancing and wearing masks. But she’s not sure the grandkids were such sticklers.“They wear masks when they’re outside, the in-laws. I don’t know about the kids, but I do know that that part of the family isn’t big on the whole mask thing, especially because of where they live,” she said, adding she’s not sure the grandkids have since been tested.“I — we don’t want to even ask because now it’s become a very touchy subject. Because if someone says to you, ‘Hey, you potentially killed your mom, or could have killed your mom,’ it doesn’t really bode well for the family reunion.”Her mother-in-law had symptoms for a few days at home and her health deteriorated so much that she had to be rushed to the hospital after a family member found her on the bathroom floor. She’s now doing better, but remains severely fatigued, Bert said.Coronavirus cases are rising so fast in North Dakota that it’s taking officials up to three days to notify people after they test positive, and as a result the state has fallen way behind on tracing their close contacts who might have been exposed.Republican Gov. Doug Burgum and the North Dakota Department of Health announced late Tuesday that they’re shifting 50 National Guard members who had been working in contact tracing to simply notifying people who test positive. And public health officials will no longer notify close contacts of people who tested positive; instead those individuals will be instructed to self-notify their close contacts and direct them to the department’s website.North Dakota, with its loose regulations, has the country’s worst per-capita spread rate, with 1,224 new cases per day per 100,000 residents, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nebraska began imposing new coronavirus restrictions Wednesday, after the number of people hospitalized remained at a record level of 380 for two straight days and the state reported 11 new deaths from the virus.Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his hospital group is working to bring in nurses from other parts of the country to handle the additional cases.Over the past seven days, Nebraska has reported an average of 854 new cases per day, up significantly from two weeks ago when the state was reporting an average 525 cases per day, according to data from Johns Hopkins.The trend led Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts to announce new restrictions that took effect Wednesday. Hospitals now must keep 10% of their beds free for Covid-19 patients, and customers at restaurants and bars must remain seated at tables with no more than eight people.In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt and state health officials launched a new plan to handle a surge in virus hospitalizations that reached a record one-day high of 821. It includes transferring virus patients from facilities in regions where hospitalizations are high to those with more bed capacity.Meanwhile, Wyoming health officials reported the number of people hospitalized with the virus has increased to 73, the highest since March. Health officials say the increase mirrors an increase of newly confirmed Covid-19 cases reported across the state since late September. October has been a record-setting month for cases.Hospitalizations in Ohio have also hit a new high, with 1,154 people hospitalized and 158 on ventilators — the highest number since July.Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday he was caught off-guard by the spike in cases and pleaded again for Ohioans to wear masks and keep themselves socially distanced.And in Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh said public schools will switch to all-remote learning because of a rising number of cases. The city’s seven-day average positive test rate is currently 5.7%, an increase from 4.5% last week. Walsh said students will remain in remote learning until there are two full weeks of falling infection rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-spikes-have-officials-looking-to-shore-up-hospitals/story-xyju67lKQf5nwBYccnMv4H.html

22-10-2020||World||Defeat for Donald Trump would mean some other leaders also lose out||If Donald Trump is forced from the White House in the November election, he won’t be the only loser.Though many governments would likely celebrate the end of the most unconventional and at times chaotic U.S. presidency of modern times, others will have reason to miss it. For the leaders of Turkey, North Korea and Israel, the ledger has been almost entirely positive. Trump’s ejection would confront them with immediate challenges.The scorecard for countries like China is more nuanced. Even so, what the mostly authoritarian winners from Trump’s four years in office have in common is a fear his departure would spell the return of a more conventional U.S. foreign policy.That could see the U.S. mending alliances and promoting the universality of values such as democracy and human rights, or the fight against climate change. “This president embraces all the thugs in the world,” Trump’s opponent Joe Biden said at a recent town hall event, as he sought to highlight the political divide.Kim Jong UnNo relationship with the U.S. changed more under Trump than North Korea’s. What began with mutual threats and insults morphed into a sometimes bizarre love-in as Kim and Trump met three times and exchanged more than two dozen letters, showcasing their “mysteriously wonderful” chemistry.Still, the radically different U.S. approach has also failed to secure North Korea‘s denuclearization. Kim unveiled a huge new intercontinental ballistic missile on Oct. 10 that appears capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads.Biden has said he won’t meet without preconditions, making any rapid lifting of the sanctions that have tipped North Korea’s economy into its worst recession for two decades less likely.Mohammed bin SalmanTrump set the tone for his approach to international relations in Saudi Arabia, choosing Riyadh for his first foreign visit in 2017. He was greeted by a huge image of his own face projected onto the facade of the palatial hotel where his delegation stayed.The Saudi Crown Prince made important gains, above all Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, his country’s mortal rival. Trump also offered personal support and vetoed Congressional sanctions when MBS, as he’s known, was besieged by allegations he’d ordered the 2018 murder of prominent regime critic Jamal Khashoggi.There have been disappointments for Saudi, in particular Trump’s failure to strike back militarily after a 2019 attack on oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia that the U.S. attributed to Iran. Saudi leaders say they’re confident they could navigate a transition to Biden. Still, with Trump gone a more traditional U.S. focus on human rights is likely to return and a door could open to reviving the Iran accord.Recep Tayyip ErdoganIf anyone relies more on Trump than MBS for political protection, it’s Turkey’s president. Trump has stood virtually alone between Turkey and the imposition of Congressional sanctions over Erdogan’s decision to buy Russia’s S-400 air defense missile system, despite being a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally.Their personal bond enabled Erdogan to persuade Trump to withdraw U.S. troops from Kurdish areas of Northern Syria so Turkey could send its own forces to take control of the zone. Trump made that decision without consulting the Pentagon or U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, including the U.K., France and Kurdish fighters that Turkey regards as terrorists.With sanctions ready for enforcement and Biden previously calling on the U.S. to support Turkish opposition parties, Erdogan may have the most to lose from Trump’s departure.Xi JinpingTrump has been more aggressive toward China than any U.S. president in recent memory, slapping tariffs on Chinese goods and moving to restrict its access to key technologies. Yet Chinese officials have said on balance the leadership would prefer Trump to stay.Trump shook the system of post-World War II alliances that China sees as a constraint on its geopolitical ambitions, a considerable benefit. He also undermined America’s international stature by exiting agreements in pursuit of “America First” policies, creating openings for the Chinese president to fill the resulting void of leadership on everything from trade to climate change.Beijing’s concern about Biden is that he would try to create a more coordinated international front in dealing with China, while maintaining the pressure on trade and technology. Even so, China might benefit from a less emotive relationship with Washington if Trump loses, according to Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University. “Do people really want to see China and the U.S enter a cold war?”Vladimir PutinRussia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election produced a formal U.S. investigation and 448-page report. But in some ways, Putin hit the jackpot. In office, Trump has questioned the value of NATO and even the status of countries such as Germany as allies, weakening a transatlantic alliance that Russian and Soviet leaders back to Joseph Stalin have sought to break.There’s every reason to think the trend would continue during a second Trump administration. Yet Russia’s president secured few of the more concrete gains he wanted, from lifted sanctions to progress on arms control. Russian officials see few prospects for a thaw, and less so under a Biden administration.Rather than lament the anti-Russia mood, the Kremlin could try to change it, according to Fiona Hill, the National Security Council’s senior director for European and Russian affairs until 2019. “They could rein in the guys who are going around poisoning people right, left and center,” said Hill, now at the Brookings Institute. “When they’re having meetings with us, they could not poke us in the eye. They could just stop doing all that.”Jair BolsonaroFor Brazil’s president, Trump is a political soul mate. As U.S. opinion polls have turned for Biden, Bolsonaro has grown increasingly concerned for the future of his ties with the White House, according to a senior cabinet member.Since taking office in 2019, Bolsonaro has upended Brazil’s decades-old tradition of an equidistant foreign policy in favor of automatic alignment with the U.S. and its allies. In return, Trump lifted a ban on fresh-beef imports, supported Brazil’s bid to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and signed deals for defense and space-exploration cooperation.Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo has said Brazil would have no problem with a Biden administration, but Bolsonaro’s environmental policies would face strong opposition. Biden has suggested Brazil could face economic consequences if it does not stop Amazon deforestation.Benjamin NetanyahuTrump repeatedly broke with U.S. precedent to boost the Israeli leader’s nationalist agenda, recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the disputed Golan Heights and moving the American embassy to Jerusalem. Plans to annex parts of the Palestinian West Bank have been shelved, but could be revived in a second Trump term.The real payoff came in September, when Trump brokered normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, but there’s been a cost; bipartisan support for Israel in Congress has eroded. Many Israelis fear their country would face greater scrutiny under a Biden administration, while the security establishment worries about a U.S. return to the Iran nuclear deal.Andrzej Duda and Viktor OrbanOutsiders among more liberal European heads of state, the leaders of Poland and Hungary have found solace in Trump. In 2017 he chose Warsaw for a major speech in which he redefined the West in terms of conservative, Christian values -- validating Duda’s right-wing agenda, which Hungary’s Orban shares.The Hungarian prime minister has openly endorsed Trump ahead of the election, saying he does not want to see a return of the “moral imperialism” a Democratic administration would bring to the White House.The two men share Trump’s disdain for political correctness in ways that could cause friction with Biden. President Duda has cast the LGBTQ+ community as “enemies” of Polish families. In September, Biden weighed in on Twitter against Polish regions that had declared themselves “free from LGBT ideology.”In his comment on Trump’s fondness for “thugs,” Biden singled out Hungary and Poland, together with post-Soviet Belarus as he warned against risks to NATO from “the rise of totalitarian regimes around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defeat-for-donald-trump-would-mean-some-other-leaders-also-lose-out/story-tSSxUZkD1bsKjIvrnETleI.html
22-10-2020||World||China’s shaky victory at United Nations elections reveals its great fall | Analysis||There were hardly any celebrations in Beijing this month when President Xi Jinping’s China, often rebuked for human rights violations, made it back to the United Nations human rights council this month. Because tucked behind Beijing’s win, was a huge loss of support that many see as a reflection of China’s track record. Beijing secured only 139 votes for its inclusion in the world body’s 47-member Human Rights Council, the lowest vote among the 15 countries selected. Its tally also reflected a loss of support from 41 UN member states that had supported China in the 2016 election.China had then claimed its 180 votes - up from 167 in 2009 and 167 in 2013 - was evidence of “credit given by the international community to China for its achievement in developing human rights.” This time, the Chinese foreign ministry primarily focused on the fact that it was its fifth stint in the council.The seat on the rights panel, however, hasn’t insulated China. Twenty-three governments did hammer China for its abuses in Xinjiang at the General Assembly’s Third Committee in October 2019. A year later, the figure rose to 40 and the issue broadened to address concerns about Hong Kong and Tibet. In June, 50 UN human rights experts united to seek “decisive measures” to protect fundamental freedoms in China.Closer to the 14 October voting, a cross-regional group of 39 United Nations member countries reprimanded Beijing for violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. “We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang and the recent developments in Hong Kong,” German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said in a statement on behalf of the group to the UN General Assembly’s Third Committee.China watchers argue that the Beijing depleting support in the October election is also a reflection of President Xi Jinping’s belligerent diplomacy in the neighbourhood and beyond that has turned Beijing’s potential partners into adversaries and placed them on the same side. In less than 12 months, China has engaged in multiple border clashes with India in East Ladakh, flown military planes over Taiwan, clamped down on Hong Kong, launched trade wars with the United States and Australia, ignited a bitter back-and-forth with Canada and tried to consolidate control over the South China Sea, a major trade route for crude oil for the world.It is in this context that the United States emerged as the bulwark against Beijing, deepening partnerships with countries in Asia and Europe and building alliances such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with India, Australia and Japan.Last week, the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group returned to the South China Sea for the third time this year to demonstrate its commitment to “the lawful use of the seas and maintaining open access to the international commons” and engaged in joint exercises with Australia and Japan beginning Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-shaky-victory-at-united-nations-elections-reveals-its-great-fall-analysis/story-39qv9o7I1UE4frCgNZvJ6M.html
