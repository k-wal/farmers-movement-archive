German Chancellor Angela Merkel implored citizens to abide by distancing rules and avoid groups.French, Italian and Irish daily infections hit a record on Thursday, while Spain recorded the most new cases since April. The varied approaches around Europe to deal with the disease have caused confusion and stoked unrest amid the pandemic-weary public, especially amid low hospitalization and death rates -- which keep rising steadily.Also Read| Covid-19: IMF warns global economy could be permanently scarredLeaders have little recourse but to tell people to knuckle down. Johnson was adamant he did not want a second lockdown but now the prospect of a so-called “circuit-breaker” with schools closed for two weeks is in the air.From midnight on Friday, millions of residents in the UK capital won’t be able to socialize with other households behind closed doors, including in pubs and restaurants.“I know these restrictions are difficult for people, I hate that we have to bring them in, but it is essential that we do bring them in both to keep people safe and to prevent greater economic damage in the future,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Thursday.Whack-a-MoleOutside London, UK officials are also attempting to tame the virus with a regional “whack-a-mole” strategy that has created tensions with the poorer north where the number cases are rising rapidly.The government has earmarked Manchester for the toughest restrictions, but is stuck in talks with local leaders in the northern English city over financial support. There is also disparity within the UK itself on the best approach.This latest development comes as Germany, Italy, Austria and the Czech Republic all reported record increases in cases, and London approached an average of 100 infections per 100,000 people.European authorities are grappling with how to devise targeted strategies that slow the spread of the disease without resorting to the kind of broad national lockdowns which decimated economic activity in the second quarter.Merkel struggled to forge a consensus with regional German leaders in a meeting that dragged on into Wednesday night. The measures agreed for hard-hit areas -- including closing bars and restaurants at 11 p.m. and extending mandatory mask wearing -- appear insufficient but still state officials argued that they further curbs are unnecessary and ineffective.“The problem is that day by day with increasing numbers our local authorities are not able any more to trace,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said Thursday during a Bloomberg webinar. “And then you lose track” and the numbers are increasing exponentially.”France reported a record of 30,621 new infections on Thursday. Germany recorded 7,173 new cases in the 24 hours through Thursday morning, exceeding a high during the previous peak of the pandemic in late March.“Economically we can’t afford a second wave” Merkel said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEuropean infections began a resurgence in the late summer, fueled by returning travelers and young party-goers. Local family, work and social gatherings have since spurred further contagion. On Thursday, Germany declared that that all of continental France, the entire Netherlands and all of Slovenia will be considered a coronavirus risk area from Oct. 17 onwards.The region as a whole recorded almost 700,000 new cases last week, the most since the pandemic began, and taking the total to just below 7 million, according to the World Health Organization. Britain, France, Russia and Spain accounted for over half of all new cases.In France, daily cases have jumped to more than 17,000 from less than 12,000 a week ago, and more than 40% of intensive-care beds in the Paris region are taken by Covid-19 patients. Such is the worry, that there is now the suggestion regional elections in March will be delayed.Macron said Wednesday the situation in hospitals is “unsustainable” and the goal is to bring new cases down to 3,000 to 4,000 a day.“We are a united nation, and we will succeed,” he said.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that the nation will “be in trouble again” if the rising trend persists and for the first time declined to rule out a new nationwide lockdown. In the Naples area, authorities signed a decree ordering schools to close until Oct. 30, newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. The decree also bans parties, with guests from different households.In Spain, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya pushed back against reports that the spread of the virus and the political tussling over how to contain it are sparking concerns in Berlin. Spain detected 6,603 coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, the biggest daily increase since April.In an interview with Bloomberg Television, she insisted that the Spanish outbreak is “under control” and criticism of her government’s fight with the Madrid region over tighter restrictions is unfair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-and-paris-clamp-down-as-europe-hits-covid-19-records/story-LqHIuuxR9UDHn7WvyVFz6H.html
15-10-2020||World||Trump slams Facebook, Twitter as ‘third arm’ of the Democratic party||President Donald Trump has blasted Facebook and Twitter as the “third arm” of the Democratic party for blocking links to a news story that seeks to sully Joe Biden, his rival for presidential election, based on questionable information and allegations about his son’s business dealings.Allies of the president, who is trailing the Democrat ahead of close of polling on November 3, have sought to portray the story as potentially the “October Surprise” of the 2020 election, using a term for an unforeseen setback that leaves the targeted candidate with little or no time to recover.In a report headlined the “Smoking Gun Email”, the New York Post, a conservative-leaning publication owned by Rupert Murdoch, reported on Wednesday that Hunter Biden had sought to set up a meeting in 2015 between his father, then vice president, and an executive of a Ukrainian energy company that he was serving as a board member.The information about this meeting, which is not reported to have taken place at all, was obtained purportedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop at a Delaware repair store and was subsequently passed on to Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, who then provided it to the news publication.Facebook and Twitter blocked links to the article saying it needed to be cross-checked. Andy Stone of Facebook said in a tweet that “this story is eligible to be fact- checked by Facebook’s third-party fact checking” and the social media platform was “reducing its distribution” until then.President Trump blew up. “So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of ‘Smoking Gun’ emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost. It is only the beginning for them. There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician,” he vented on Twitter.He also called for repealing a statutory provision — Section 230 — that grants social media platforms the freedom to self-regulate their content, which has been in his administration’s crosshairs, for previous instances of blocking or tagging of posts by him, his allies and other conservatives.“It’s like a third arm, maybe a first arm, of the DNC (the Democratic National Committee),” Trump said on Fox Business Network Thursday, referring to Twitter and Facebook. “It’s a massive campaign contribution.”The president’s spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, who is working remotely after testing positive for Covid-19, followed up on Thursday assailing Big Tech for “censoring political speech”, which, she added, “you’d expect in countries like China, North Korea, or Iran — NOT America.”She added: “This should scare every single American who values free and open discourse. Do NOT let Big Tech silence YOU”.Earlier, on Wednesday, President Trump had also retweeted a clip from Fox News in which its anchor suggested the possibility of the New York Post story being the “October Surprise” of this election cycle.The president brought up the allegations in the article at an election rally later in Iowa, a state he had won comfortably in 2016. He called for Biden to apologise and “immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings and influence peddling around the world—including in China, including Russia.”President Trump and his allies have attacked Biden over his younger son’s — elder son Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015 — business dealing in Ukraine and China, alleging he had made “millions” by using access to his father. The former vice-president has denied he ever discussed his son’s businesses with him while in office and no evidence has been found yet of any wrongdoing by him.Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, sought to debunk the NYP report. These allegations had been investigated before by the press, Republican-led congressional bodies and others, he said, and they “all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing. Trump Administration officials have attested to these facts under oath”.Bates said further that the New York Post never checked “critical elements of this story” with the Biden campaign, which, he went on to add, has already “reviewed Joe Biden’s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-facebook-twitter-as-third-arm-of-the-democratic-party/story-lThkHp09abJCYO3R0EnMfN.html
15-10-2020||World||Israeli parliament rubber stamps Abraham Accords||Israel’s parliament on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in favor of formally ratifying the country’s historic agreement normalizing diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates.Israel and the UAE announced the U.S.-brokered agreement in August, and signed a deal in a White House ceremony last month. Thursday’s approval by the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, which passed in a 80-13 vote, was largely a formality.The UAE has become just the third Arab country to establish official ties with Israel, after Egypt and Jordan, and the first to do so in a quarter century. Bahrain is also in the process of formalizing ties with Israel, and the White House has suggested that other Arab countries will follow suit.The deals reflect a shift in the Middle East as Arab countries’ shared concerns with Israel about Iran outweigh their traditional support for the Palestinians.“Many Arab and Muslim countries want to get close to us,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech. “They see our military and intelligence, technological and economic power. They are changing their attitude toward us.”The Palestinians, who have long relied on unified Arab support to boost them against Israel, have condemned the deal and accused the UAE of betrayal.The Joint List, the main Arab-dominated faction in parliament, cast the lone opposing votes Thursday in solidarity with their Palestinian brethren.Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint List, said the only deal that would bring peace and prosperity to the region would be a peace agreement creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.“The deal being signed today is part of Trump’s dangerous vision that ... will perpetuate the military regime on millions of Palestinians, the settlements and the outposts,” he wrote in a tweet before the vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-parliament-rubber-stamps-abraham-accords/story-4bcDB9uNqzhKdswvJUHujL.html
15-10-2020||World||Tourists return to Hawaii amid ever-changing Covid-19 pandemic rules||Coronavirus weary residents and struggling business owners in Hawaii will be watching closely as tourists begin to return to the islands on Thursday without being required to self-quarantine upon arrival.A new pre-travel testing program will allow visitors who test negative for Covid-19 to come to Hawaii and avoid the two weeks of mandatory quarantine — a measure that’s been in place for all arriving passengers for most of the year.The state-run testing program is an effort to stem the devastating downturn the pandemic has had on Hawaii’s tourism-based economy.However, gaps in the pre-travel testing program coupled with increasing cases of Covid-19 across the U.S. and the world have raised questions about whether Hawaii is ready to safely welcome back vacationers.Officials touted the mandatory quarantine rule as an integral part of Hawaii’s early success in keeping the coronavirus at bay.But when local restrictions were eased before summertime holidays, community spread of the disease spiked to alarming levels, forcing a second round of stay-at-home orders for residents and closures for non-essential businesses.Opponents of the testing program have said a single test 72 hours before arrival — especially when coupled with the option to fly without a test and still quarantine — is not enough to keep island residents safe.But Hawaii has built an economy almost entirely around tourism and local families who rely on the sector to survive need to get back to work.More than 100 of Hawaii’s approximately 4,000 restaurants, bakeries and caterers have closed permanently and more than 50% predict they will not survive the coming months, officials have said.Monica Toguchi Ryan, whose family has owned and operated The Highway Inn restaurant on Oahu for over 70 years, said the lack of tourism has been crippling.“The restaurant and service industry has suffered so much during this pandemic,” Toguchi Ryan said. “Restaurants have not received any federal relief since the spring and are struggling to pay their expenses. Some restaurants have closed entirely, unable to pay for their rent, food supplies and staff wages.”Toguchi Ryan joined Democratic Gov. David Ige on Wednesday to talk about a new restaurant debit card that will give some unemployed Hawaii residents a $500 to spend at local restaurants over the next 60 days. The $75 million program is being funded by federal CARES Act money and is aimed at stimulating the local economy.“When restaurants like us have more customers, we buy more from our suppliers and we reinvest the money several times over in our local economy,” Toguchi Ryan said.Hawaii, which has about 1.4 million residents, reported 10 additional coronavirus deaths and more than 100 newly confirmed cases on Wednesday. On Oahu, home to the famed Waikiki Beach and the state’s most populated island, the positivity rate was nearly 4%.County mayors have criticized the state’s plan for a single test prior to flying and want a mandatory second test for all arriving passengers.Kauai island Mayor Derek Kawakami said last week that his initial proposal for secondary testing was rejected by the governor.Big Island Mayor Harry Kim said his county would opt out of the pre-travel testing program entirely and continue to require all arriving visitors to quarantine for two weeks. Both now have different plansThe governor said this week that mayors could implement certain secondary testing measures on their respective islands, but the cost and logistics of running such programs would be left to the counties.Maui and Kauai counties decided on voluntary secondary testing for visitors. The Big Island will require secondary rapid screening upon arrival for visitors to avoid quarantine. Oahu officials have said they want to put in place another layer of screening but do not yet have the testing capacity.The mixed bag of county and state rules could create chaos for vacationers who have not properly prepared for the various screening requirements, especially those traveling to the Big Island.“This second test upon arrival to Hawaii island will provide an extra layer of protection for our community,” said Big Island Mayor Harry Kim in a statement Monday. “Virtually, all medical and coronavirus experts agree for the necessity of more than one test.”Those arriving on the Big Island — home to Hawaii’s active volcanoes and the site of a 2018 eruption that wiped out entire neighborhoods — will take a mandatory rapid antigen test when they land.Results will be available in about 15 minutes and travelers who test negative will not be required to quarantine. People who test positive will be required to immediately get a more accurate PCR test and then quarantine until their results are available, usually within 36 hours.People who test positive in the state, whether on vacation or at home, are required to isolate and cannot fly until they no longer have the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tourists-return-to-hawaii-amid-ever-changing-covid-19-pandemic-rules/story-tv71O2udJtSVFC1u5FIGWP.html
15-10-2020||World||Herd immunity approaches to control Covid-19 ‘a dangerous fallacy’, say scientists||Managing Covid-19 by allowing herd immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,” warn an international group of 80 researchers in an open letter. The letter, published in The Lancet journal, referred to by its authors as the John Snow Memorandum, noted that any pandemic management strategy relying upon the population to develop immunity from natural infections for Covid-19 is flawed. In the face of a second wave of infection in several parts of the world, the scientists including Devi Sridhar from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, said there is currently renewed interest in herd immunity approaches allowing a large uncontrolled outbreak in low-risk populations while protecting the vulnerable. While some have argued this approach could lead to the development of infection-acquired immunity in the low-risk population, which will eventually protect the vulnerable, the researchers explained such uncontrolled transmission in younger people risks significant ill-health and death. Based on evidence from many countries, the scientists said it is not possible to restrict uncontrolled outbreaks to certain sections of society, adding that it is “practically impossible” and “highly unethical” to isolate large swathes of the population. While special efforts to protect the most vulnerable are essential, they said these must go hand-in-hand with multi-pronged population-level strategies. “Effective measures that suppress and control transmission need to be implemented widely, and they must be supported by financial and social programmes that encourage community responses and address the inequities that have been amplified by the pandemic,” they wrote in the letter. “Continuing restrictions will probably be required in the short term, to reduce transmission and fix ineffective pandemic response systems, in order to prevent future lockdowns,” the researchers said. According to the scientists, the restrictions can effectively suppress the number if infections to low levels that allow rapid detection of localised outbreaks. They said such measures can also compliment rapid response through efficient and comprehensive testing, contact tracing, isolation and support systems. “Protecting our economies is inextricably tied to controlling Covid-19. We must protect our workforce and avoid long-term uncertainty,” they said. The researchers cautioned that there is currently no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection. They said this waning immunity as a result of natural infection would not end the Covid-19 pandemic but instead result in repeated waves of transmission over several years. According to the scientists, vulnerable populations are at risk for the indefinite future, as natural infection-based herd immunity strategies would result in recurrent epidemics, as seen with many infectious diseases before mass vaccination. So they called for controlling the spread of the virus until the population can be vaccinated. Natural infection-based herd immunity approaches risk impacting the workforce as a whole and overwhelming the ability of healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care, the researchers warned. They said clinicians still do not understand who might suffer from ‘long Covid’ in which the symptoms linger for weeks. “The evidence is very clear: controlling community spread of Covid-19 is the best way to protect our societies and economies until safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics arrive within the coming months,” the scientists wrote. “We cannot afford distractions that undermine an effective response; it is essential that we act urgently based on the evidence,” they concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-approaches-to-control-covid-19-a-dangerous-fallacy-say-scientists/story-VXdNAEnKZWr6OJKIpWjnuM.html
15-10-2020||World||Director Roman Polanski pays respect to Polish couple who saved him from Holocaust||Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski returned to Poland, the country of his youth, and paid tribute on Thursday to a Polish couple who took him in and protected him when he was a child, saving him from the Holocaust.Stefania and Jan Buchala were posthumously declared as “Righteous Among the Nations,” an honour bestowed by Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, in a ceremony attended by their grandson.The 87-year-old Polanski, who now lives in France, travelled to Poland for the occasion. Poland is one of the very few countries Polanski can travel to safely given that he remains a fugitive from U.S. law after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 and fleeing the United States the following year.Polanski recalled Stefania Buchala as an “extremely noble and religious person” who had the courage to risk not only her own life in sheltering him, but also the lives of her children.The couple’s grandson, Stanislaw Buchala, received the distinction on behalf of his late grandparents from Israel’s deputy ambassador at a Jewish memorial center in Gliwice, a southern Polish city. City authorities also attended the ceremony.Polanski was nine years old when his parents made him escape from the Krakow Ghetto during the German occupation of Poland during World War II. Both of his parents were soon after deported to death camps.He was given shelter by the Buchalas from 1943-45, in the small southern village of Wysoka.They are among some 7,000 Poles now recognized by Yad Vashem for saving Jews from certain death at the hands of Nazi German forces. More people from Poland have been recognized for such heroism than from any other country.Polanski’s mother died in Auschwitz, but his father survived the Mauthausen camp and the two were reunited after the war.Among Polanski’s award-winning projects is a story of Holocaust survival, the 2003 film the “The Pianist.”Two years ago Polanski was expelled from the organization that bestows the Academy Awards for raping a minor. His request to have his membership reinstated was rejected this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/director-roman-polanski-pays-respect-to-polish-couple-who-saved-him-from-holocaust/story-UvVIciAJuCzseFowqO5vZI.html
15-10-2020||World||Twitter restricts Donald Trump’s campaign account from tweeting||Twitter Inc on Thursday temporarily restricted U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign account from tweeting, saying a video from the account about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son violated its rules.The video posted by the @TeamTrump account referred to a New York Post story from Wednesday that contained alleged details of Hunter Biden’s business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company and said the former vice president had met with an adviser of the company. “Joe Biden is a liar who has been ripping off our country for years,” the video was captioned.Twitter said the video violated its rules against posting private information, adding the account may need to delete the post in order to continue tweeting.“It’s going to all end up in a big lawsuit and there are things that can happen that are very severe that I’d rather not see happen, but it’s probably going to have to,” Trump said, when asked about the move by Twitter.Twitter said on Wednesday the Post story violated its “hacked materials” policy, which bars the distribution of content obtained through hacking that contains private information or trade secrets, or puts people at risk of physical harm. Facebook Inc and Twitter took proactive steps on Wednesday to restrict dissemination of the Post story in the hours after it was published.Twitter had placed similar restrictions on the account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday, after she shared the Post story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-restricts-donald-trump-s-campaign-account-from-tweeting/story-f2aNK9nqZWJGwExjF1oH3I.html
15-10-2020||World||EU sanctions 5 Russians officials and one institute over Navalny poisoning||The European Union and Britain imposed sanctions on six Russians on Thursday , some among the highest-ranked officials in the nation, and one organization over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a Soviet-era nerve agent.“The adopted restrictive measures consist of a travel ban to the EU and an asset freeze for individuals, and an asset freeze for the entity,” the EU said in a statement.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the move “a deliberate unfriendly step towards Russia” and said that the EU “inflicted damage” on the bloc’s relations with Russia.The move came a day after Russia’s foreign minister warned that Moscow might respond with similar measures. The decision was agreed upon among the 27 EU envoys to Brussels.The list includes Alexander Bortnikov, the chief of Russia’s Federal Security Service, the top KGB successor agency that is in charge of domestic security, and Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin’s deputy chief of staff. The EU is also targeting the State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology.EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed to impose the sanctions, following a push by France and Germany to freeze the assets of those suspected of involvement and ban them from travelling in Europe under sanctions to combat the use and spread of chemical weapons. The legal procedures were completed on Thursday.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the EU had acted “with exceptional speed, in keeping with the seriousness of this act and the methods used.”“This demonstrates a European Union that acts in the face of the new, unacceptable and destabilizing use of a chemical weapon,” he said at a meeting in Paris.The U.K. said it would also apply the EU sanctions and will continue them once it leaves a post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year. “Any use of chemical weapons by the Russian state violates international law. We are determined to hold those responsible to account,” said British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab .Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator and major political opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on August 20 during a domestic flight in Russia. He was flown to Germany for treatment two days later and is still recovering there.Russian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning and Russian doctors who first examined Navalny have said they found no signs of a poisoning.Last week, tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that Navalny was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, suggested that Moscow might even sever ties claiming on Wednesday that “the Germans are not planning to provide any facts, despite all international and legal obligations. We respond in kind. This is diplomatic practice.”“We probably simply have to temporarily stop talking to those people in the West who are responsible for foreign policy and don’t understand the need for mutually respectful dialogue,” he said.Lavrov specifically pointed at European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent statements ruling out a partnership with Russia, saying that scenario will play out if that’s what the EU wants.“Russia wants to understand whether it’s possible to do any business with the EU in the current conditions,” Lavrov said at a foreign policy conference attended by experts in Moscow.In a phone call on Tuesday with Lavrov, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell insisted that the EU “wishes to maintain open channels of communication with Russia and to enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest,” according to a statement from Borrell’s office.Borrell also underlined that Moscow “must do its utmost to investigate this crime thoroughly in full transparency and to fully cooperate” with the OPCW, and that the EU “will continue to defend its interests and values, including respect for international law and fundamental rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sanctions-5-russians-officials-and-one-institute-over-navalny-poisoning/story-ue0zgvnCzhsRwWc04AICqK.html
15-10-2020||World||Thailand declares emergency due to unprecedented student uprising||Thailand’s government declared a strict new state of emergency for the capital on Thursday, a day after a student-led protest against the country’s traditional establishment saw an extraordinary moment in which demonstrators heckled a royal motorcade.After the pre-dawn declaration, riot police moved in to clear out demonstrators who after a day of rallies and confrontation had gathered outside Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s office to push their demands, which include the former general’s stepping down, constitutional changes and reform of the monarchy.Several top leaders of the protest movement were taken into custody, with one later declaring on his Facebook page that he had been denied access to a lawyer and was being forced onto a helicopter and taken to a city in the country’s north. Police said they had made 22 arrests.Despite a new ban against large public gatherings, several thousand people answered calls to rally again in another area of the city later Thursday.The text of the emergency declaration said it was needed because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.”The protest on Wednesday in Bangkok’s historic district, not far from glittering temples and royal palaces, was the third major gathering by student-led activists who have been pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable — and legal — language by publicly questioning the role of Thailand’s monarchy in the nation’s power structure.Thailand’s royal family has long been considered sacrosanct and a pillar of Thai identity. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key member of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.The protest — held on the anniversary of a 1973 student-led uprising against a military dictatorship — was complicated by the presence of royalist counter protesters who had gathered both to show support for the government and to greet the royal family as they travelled to and from a religious ceremony in the area.That led to a moment captured in photos and video that circulated widely on social media in which what appeared to be protesters gestured and shouted just meters (feet) from the royal motorcade. Such actions are unprecedented in Thailand, where those waiting for a royal motorcade regularly sit on the ground or prostrate themselves.Some experts say a line may have been crossed.“What seemed to be a low-boil stalemate that the Prayuth government was managing with reasonable success has now, following the incident involving the procession of the queen’s motorcade down a street in which an active protest was under way and the arrests of protest leaders, become a full-blown crisis,” said Michael Montesano, coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Isak Institute in Singapore. “Unlike even 48 hours ago, the country is in dangerous territory now.”Government spokesman Anucha Buraphachaisri announced Thursday morning that the prime minister had ordered police to take strict action against those who obstruct a royal procession or otherwise insult the monarchy.One change is that police said they will install checkpoints around Bangkok for security purposes.Keeping order will be facilitated by the new emergency decree for Bangkok, which bans unauthorized gatherings of more than five people and gives authorities other powers they deem needed to prevent unrest, including detaining people temporarily without charge. It also outlaws news that distorts information or could cause a “misunderstanding.”Thailand is already under a national state of emergency as part of its efforts to fight the coronavirus, and it was not immediately clear how the new decree was different.Protesters gathered again in a Bangkok shopping district Thursday afternoon and into the evening. The crowd grew big enough to block a major intersection flanked by upmarket malls and a famous shrine, where they were addressed by a series of speakers denouncing the government.Police stood by while the crowd chanted rude slogans calling for the prime minister to step down. They also chanted “Free our friends,” in reference to the arrested leaders.“I want to fight for my future. I want to fight for my friends. I want to fight for my democracy. My country must be democracy,” said 24-year-old NGO worker Aitarnik Chitwiset.Deputy police spokesman Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen warned earlier that calling for such a protest or attending one was against the law.Human rights group Amnesty International criticized the crackdown as “unjustified.”“These moves are clearly designed to stamp out dissent, and sow fear in anyone who sympathizes with the protesters’ views,” the group said in a statement.The protest movement was launched in March by university students, but quickly put on hold as Thailand was gripped by the coronavirus pandemic. It came back in July, when the threat from the virus eased, and has since grown in size.The movement’s original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The movement took another stunning turn in August, when students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and issued calls for its reform. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticized the king’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany, not Thailand.Conservative royalist Thais accuse the protest movement of seeking to end the monarchy, an allegation its leaders deny.Nevertheless, analysts say the incident with the royal motorcade may harden positions.It “is not just unprecedented but will be shocking for many,” said Kevin Hewison, professor emeritus from the University of North Carolina and veteran Thai studies scholar. “Yet it is reflective of how a new generation of protesters sees the monarchy and military-backed regime as intertwined and that political reform demands reform of the monarchy as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-declares-emergency-due-to-unprecedented-student-uprising/story-OwpjdwC0QYSZ9DLByImdkN.html
15-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination: Judiciary panel sets October 22 for vote||The Senate Judiciary Committee convened on Thursday set an October 22 vote on Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination as Republicans race to confirm President Donald Trump’s pick before the November 3 election.The session is without Barrett after two long days of public testimony in which she stressed that she would be her own judge and sought to create distance between herself and past positions critical of abortion, the Affordable Care Act and other issues.Her confirmation to take the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems inevitable, as even some Senate Democrats acknowledged.Senator Lindsey Graham pushed past Democratic objections to set the panel’s October 22 vote on recommending her confirmation even before final witnesses testify for and against her nomination. The committee set the vote for next week.“This is a sham,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.In the minority, Democrats acknowledge there is little they can do to stop them from locking a conservative majority on the court for years to come. The shift would cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the court and would be the most pronounced ideological change in 30 years, from the liberal icon to the conservative appeals court judge.Facing almost 20 hours of questions from senators, the 48-year-old judge was careful not to take on the president who nominated her and sought to separate herself from writings on controversial subjects when she was an academic. She skipped past Democrats’ pressing questions about ensuring the date of next month’s election or preventing voter intimidation, both set in federal law, and the peaceful transfer of presidential power.She also refused to express her view on whether the president can pardon himself. “It’s not one that I can offer a view,” she said in response to a question Wednesday from Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont.Democrats raised those questions because President Donald Trump has done so himself.When it came to major issues that are likely to come before the court, including abortion and health care, Barrett repeatedly promised to keep an open mind and said neither Trump nor anyone else in the White House had tried to influence her views.“No one has elicited from me any commitment in a case,” she said.Nominees typically resist offering any more information than they have to, especially when the president’s party controls the Senate, as it does now. But Barrett wouldn’t engage on topics that seemed easy to swat away, including that only Congress can change the date that the election takes place.She said she is not on a “mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act,” though she has been critical of the two Supreme Court decisions that preserved key parts of the Obama-era health care law. She could be on the court when it hears the latest Republican-led challenge on November 10.Barrett is the most open opponent of abortion nominated to the Supreme Court in decades, and Democrats fear that her ascension could be a tipping point that threatens abortion rights.There was no hiding her views in at least three letters and ads she signed over 15 years and her membership in Notre Dame’s Faculty for Life. So Republican senators embraced her stance, proudly stating that she was, in Graham’s words, an “unashamedly pro-life” conservative who is making history as a role model for other women.Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said “there is nothing wrong with confirming a devout pro-life Christian.” Barrett refused to say whether the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights was correctly decided, though she signed an open letter seven years ago that called the decision “infamous.” Democrats pressed repeatedly on the judge’s approach to health care, abortion, racial equity and voting rights, but conceded they were unlikely to stop her quick confirmation.“When you are on the court,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., began one question in which he asked her to keep an open mind on the high court bench. Barrett readily agreed to do so.In an exchange with Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Barrett resisted the invitation to explicitly endorse or reject the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s comments about perpetuating “racial entitlement” in a key voting rights case.“When I said that Justice Scalia’s philosophy is mine, too, I certainly didn’t mean to say that every sentence that came out of Justice Scalia’s mouth or every sentence that he wrote is one that I would agree with,” Barrett said.She called the Voting Rights Act a “triumph in the civil rights movement,” without discussing the specifics of the earlier challenge to it. The court will hear another challenge to the law early next year.One of the more dramatic moments came late Wednesday when Barrett told California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, that she wouldn’t say whether racial discrimination in voting still exists nor express a view on climate change.Harris asked if she agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote in a 2013 voting rights case that “voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.” Barrett said she would “not comment on what any justice said in an opinion.” Asked whether “climate change is happening,” Barrett said she wouldn’t engage because it is “a very contentious matter of public debate.” Barrett did, however, say she believes the novel coronavirus is infectious and that smoking causes cancer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-s-nomination-judiciary-panel-sets-october-22-for-vote/story-wviqUocTHD50REu8qcBOkI.html

15-10-2020||World||Crackdown: Arrest warrant against Pak ex-prez, 450 booked before massive anti-govt stir||Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog on Thursday issued an arrest warrant against former president Asif Ali Zardari, while authorities booked more than 450 activists ahead of a massive rally planned by a joint opposition front that seeks to oust the Imran Khan government.The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) issued the warrant against Zardari in a suspicious transactions case worth 8 billion Pakistani rupees, an offshoot of a fake bank accounts scam.NAB asked the Islamabad High Court to deny him a pre-arrest bail, saying the co-chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was not entitled to it.Earlier this week, Zardari was shifted to a private hospital in Karachi after he felt unwell. In September, he was indicted in a money laundering case pertaining to the fake bank accounts.The Imran Khan government has been cracking down on opposition parties after they formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) with the aim to remove him.PDM has an action plan of a three-phased anti-government movement, starting with countrywide public meetings, protest demonstrations and rallies before a “decisive long march” towards Islamabad in January 2021.More than 450 workers from various opposition parties were booked in Lahore and other areas of Punjab province ahead of PDM’s first rally on Friday in Gujranwala city, some 80 km from Lahore.That rally will be followed by another on October 18 in Karachi. Marches will also be held in Quetta on October 25, Peshawar on November 22, Multan on November 30 and in Lahore on December 13.The Opposition leaders announced they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek the resignation of Imran Khan, whom they dubbed “the selected” prime minister.The Opposition parties have accused the powerful army of rigging the 2018 elections that brought Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party to power. They are openly opposing the military’s interference in politics and elections for the first time in the recent history of the country.Those booked by the Punjab police on Thursday were mostly workers of PML-N and scores of PDM activists from different parts of the province. They were rounded up ostensibly under Covid-19 regulations.Police stations in Gujranwala, Mandi Bahuddin and Lahore registered cases against over 450 Opposition workers under sections 269 and 188 of Pakistan Penal Code, for holding a public gathering without observing Covid-19 standard operating procedures.Former prime minister and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, who is London since November last year, tweeted that police should refrain from arresting the PDM leaders.“Police must NOT comply with Imran Niazi’s workers, raid their homes or hinder their travel to Gujranwala,” he said.Former premier and PDM leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the government’s panic over the first public meeting of Opposition has exposed its reality.“Blocking roads with containers, raiding corner meetings, arresting PDM workers across Punjab, won’t deter the spirits of the masses who have decided to rid the country of this selected and inept government.” He said, “People are starving and struggling to feed their families because of the unprecedented inflation and unemployment created by this government which is the most corrupt government in the history of Pakistan.”(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crackdown-arrest-warrant-against-pak-ex-prez-450-booked-before-massive-anti-govt-stir/story-5rk8SY2SvNZ9dNMpVxQcBN.html
15-10-2020||World||Herd immunity approach to Covid-19 is dangerous: Experts||A group of 80 researchers on Thursday warned that a so-called ‘herd immunity’ approach to managing Covid-19 by allowing immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence”.The warning is included in an open letter published by The Lancet and signed by international researchers with expertise spanning public health, epidemiology, medicine, paediatrics, sociology, virology, infectious disease, health systems, psychology, psychiatry, health policy, and mathematical modeling.The experts warn that natural infection-based herd immunity approaches risk impacting the workforce as a whole and overwhelming the ability of healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care. They note that it is still not understood who might suffer from ‘long Covid’. Herd immunity approaches place an unacceptable burden on healthcare workers, many of whom have died or experienced trauma as a result of having to practise disaster medicine, they added.“The evidence is very clear: controlling community spread of Covid-19 is the best way to protect our societies and economies until safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics arrive within the coming months,” the letter said.“We cannot afford distractions that undermine an effective response; it is essential that we act urgently based on the evidence.”“It is critical to act decisively and urgently. Effective measures that suppress and control transmission need to be implemented widely, and they must be supported by financial and social programmes that encourage community responses and address the inequities that have been amplified by the pandemic,” the open letter added.The experts acknowledged that ongoing restrictions have led to widespread demoralisation and diminishing trust among the public.In the face of a second wave of infection, there is renewed interest in herd immunity approaches, they noted, but added that any pandemic management strategy relying upon immunity from natural infections for Covid-19 is flawed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-approach-to-covid-19-is-dangerous-experts/story-PQnDUwNAWniHDQe5izEMxH.html
15-10-2020||World||Oxford experts develop five-minute Covid-19 test||Scientists from the University of Oxford have developed what is described as “an extremely rapid diagnostic test” for that detects and identifies viruses in less than five minutes, which could potentially aid testing at airports and help revive the airline, tourism and other sectors.The method, published on the preprint server MedRxiv, is able to differentiate with high accuracy SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for Covid-19, from negative clinical samples, as well as from other common respiratory pathogens such as influenza and seasonal human coronaviruses.The university said on Thursday that working directly on throat swabs from Covid-19 patients, without the need for genome extraction, purification or amplification of the viruses, the method starts with the rapid labelling of virus particles in the sample with short fluorescent DNA strands. A microscope is then used to collect images of the sample, with each image containing hundreds of fluorescently-labelled viruses. Machine-learning software quickly and automatically identifies the virus present in the sample. The scientists hope to start product development in early 2021, and have an approved device available within six months of that time.This approach exploits the fact that distinct virus types have differences in their fluorescence labelling due to differences in their surface chemistry, size, and shape, the university saidThe test uses a convolutional neural network to classify microscopy images of single intact particles of different viruses.The scientists worked with clinical collaborators at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to validate the assay on Covid-19 patient samples, which were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR methods.Achilles Kapanidis of the Department of Physics said: “Unlike other technologies that detect a delayed antibody response or that require expensive, tedious and time-consuming sample preparation, our method quickly detects intact virus particles; meaning the assay is simple, extremely rapid, and cost-effective.”The researchers aim to develop an integrated device that will eventually be used for testing in sites such as businesses, music venues, airports to establish and safeguard Covid-19-free spaces, the university added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-experts-develop-five-minute-covid-19-test/story-Vd2kaGByYeJuyFUAhD9UqI.html
15-10-2020||World||China sees red after US appoints top official for Tibetan issues||China on Thursday accused the US of trying to destabilise Tibet hours after Washington appointed a senior official to oversee Tibetan affairs as it mounts pressure on Beijing on human rights issues. The US secretary of state Michael Pompeo on Wednesday named Robert Destro as the new special coordinator for Tibetan issues. The US remains concerned with China’s “repression of the Tibetan community, including the lack of meaningful autonomy, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on Tibetans’ religious freedom and cultural traditions within China,” Pompeo said in statement. Reacting sharply, Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing will not allow foreign interference in its internal affairs. “Setting up of the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China’s internal affairs and destabilise Tibet,” said ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. “China firmly opposes this (the interference) and has never recognised this,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing when asked to comment on the appointment. “People of ethnic groups in Tibet are part of the big family of Chinese nation. Since its peaceful liberation, Tibet enjoyed prosperous economic growth, harmonious civil society, and prosperous culture. People enjoyed solidarity and mutual assistance and improved livelihood. All people in Tibet enjoy their full religious freedoms and their rights are fully respected and guaranteed. We believe Tibet’s future will be better,” Zhao added.Zhao said the US should stop interfering in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Tibet or destabilising it. “China will take all necessary measures to uphold our interests,” he said.Meanwhile in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR), top officials defended their labour practices in the remote region in the backdrop of growing concerns about rights abuses.According to a Bloomberg report from Lhasa, Tibet Governor Qi Zhala told a briefing on Thursday that forced labour transfer “does not exist,” maintaining that the local government was focused on “increasing the idle work force’s income through job-skills training.”Qi, who was speaking about poverty-alleviation efforts, maintained that the Tibetan government had provided travel subsidies for people to work in other regions, and that they were free to come and go at will.In September, a Reuters report had said that Beijing was pushing growing numbers of “Tibetan rural labourers off the land and into recently built military-style training centers where they are turned into factory workers, mirroring a program in the western Xinjiang region that rights groups have branded coercive labour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sees-red-after-us-appoints-top-official-for-tibetan-issues/story-BzaOK4YMtRjyAHTzF3946H.html
15-10-2020||World||Sanofi reports positive animal test results for potential Covid-19 vaccine||Clinical trials of an experimental vaccine against Covid-19 which is being developed by France’s Sanofi and U.S. biotech firm Translate Bio are on track to begin before the end of the year after positive results in tests on animals.Sanofi and Translate Bio said in a statement on Thursday that the results from pre-clinical trials showed two doses of the MRT5500 vaccine induced a “favourable” immune response in mice and monkeys.There is no internationally-approved vaccine to protect against Covid-19, which has killed more than 1 million people around the world and triggered economic chaos.More than 40 drugmakers and research groups are conducting human trials to develop vaccines, with seven which have progressed to the late stages of tests.The finding published on Thursday is similar to that released in August by Translate Bio, which at the time said it aimed to launch clinical trials in November.Sanofi and Translate Bio confirmed that a phase 1/2 trial on humans would begin in the fourth quarter to test for safety and to determine the dosage before a possible final Phase 3 trial.They did not provide a precise starting date.In mice, they said four dose levels had been assessed using a two-dose vaccination schedule, adding that the pre-clinical results were undergoing peer review for potential publication.“Two doses of MRT5500 induced neutralizing antibody levels significantly higher than those observed in Covid-19 patients,” the companies said.In non-human primates (NHPs), Sanofi said three dose levels had been evaluated with a similar two-dose approach.“The preclinical results we report in this paper demonstrate the ability of MRT5500 to elicit a favorable immune response in both mice and non-human primates,” Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive of Translate Bio, said.The vaccine candidate uses a technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) which instructs cells in the body to make specific coronavirus proteins that then produce an immune response.Several companies are also using this approach to develop a vaccine, including U.S. companies Moderna and Pfizer whose candidates have reached late-stage trials.Sanofi is also developing another Covid-19 vaccine candidate with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline and started a clinical trial in September, with the first results expected by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-reports-positive-animal-test-results-for-potential-covid-19-vaccine/story-jCPF8UGtONxRKvoVsvbTdP.html
15-10-2020||World||Covid-19: London on ‘high alert’ from Saturday after cases surge||London will move to ‘high alert’ from Saturday – the second of the three-tier system introduced by the Boris Johnson government earlier this week – as new Covid-19 cases surged across various boroughs of the British capital.“Things will get worse before they get better”, health secretary Matt Hancock said in the House of Commons, announcing new curbs in Essex, York and other areas.This means half of England’s population is now under local lockdowns.MPs and local leaders from Manchester were in intense talks with Downing Street over placing the Greater Manchester area in the highest Tier 3 level, which would mean closing pubs, restaurants and other venues, and other restrictions. Liverpool and some areas of Leicester are already under toughest curbs in Tier 3.Hancock said the pandemic has forced “some of the most difficult choices any government has to make in peacetime”.“We make these decisions with a heavy heart with the sole aim to steering our nation through troubled waters. Things will get worse before they get better but I know that there are brighter skies and calmer seas ahead.”Reiterating Labour’s call for another UK-wide lockdown, London mayor Sadiq Khan said it could save thousands of lives and drive the virus down to manageable levels: “We’re at a critical moment in our fight against Covid-19 in London. The virus is spreading rapidly in every corner of our city.”“We’ll soon reach an average of 100 cases per 100,000 people – with a significant number of boroughs already over that threshold. Hospital admissions are up. More patients are going into Intensive Care Units. And – sadly – the number of Londoners dying every day is increasing again.”As of Wednesday night, there were 19,724 new cases and 137 deaths across the UK in hospitals and care-homes. In London, there were 1722 new cases and 12 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-london-on-high-alert-from-saturday-after-cases-surge/story-NtKBmebjLN1rS4G6nsctuN.html
15-10-2020||World||Handwashing an effective tool to prevent Covid-19, other diseases: WHO||Ten months into the pandemic, handwashing with soap and other public health measures such as maintaining physical distance, practising cough etiquette and wearing a mask remain the best defense against coronavirus, the World Health Organisation said.Global Handwashing Day is observed on October 15 each year to raise awareness and highlight the importance of handwashing as an effective means of disease prevention. This year it marks a critical reminder for the world that this simple, cost-effective practice can save lives, WHO said.“Handwashing has always been one of the most effective ways of keeping diseases at bay. It is a simple act that pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key cornerstones of Covid-19 prevention.“Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with Covid-19, hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives as we live through this pandemic and beyond to protect us from diseases,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the regional director of WHO South-East Asia Region.The world health body said with Covid-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect -- through contaminated objects or surfaces -- or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with soap and running water is of critical importance.“To stop the spread of Covid-19, along with other Covid appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals or animal waste. Handwashing after touching common surfaces such as doorknobs or handles, or after one comes back home from visiting a public place will keep ourselves and others around us safe,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/handwashing-an-effective-tool-to-prevent-covid-19-other-diseases-who/story-DICPZjlAGq103VM9g53ljN.html
15-10-2020||World||Will provide citizenship to 11 million people if voted to power, says Joe Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to provide citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants if voted to power in the November 3 Presidential Elections.Biden identified this as one of his priorities in addition to beating the virus, rebuilding the economy, and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world.Responding to a question at a virtual fund raiser on Wednesday, Biden said there is a need to deal with what’s going on at the border. “We’re going to have to deal with the immigration crisis we have. I’m going to send the House and Senate an immigration bill that’s going to provide access to citizenship to 11 million people,” he said.According to the campaign, there were 37 attendees and the event was hosted by Jane Hartley, former US Ambassador to France and Monaco and current Chairman, Sesame Workshop; Blair Effron, Founder & Partner, Centerview Partners; Indian American Deven Parekh, Managing Director, Insight Partners; and Roger Altman, Founder & Senior Chairman, Evercore.When asked how he would envision his first 30 days in office in terms of both domestic and foreign policy, Biden said: “A lot more can go wrong between now and January 21, and I’m not being facetious. Four more years, we’re not going to have the country we have now”.“If the American people elect me, we’re going to have an enormous task in repairing the damage he’s done,” he added of Trump. “We have to be beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world,” Biden said.Biden said he would move quickly to implement his plan for dealing with the pandemic and reopening safely. The Democratic presidential candidate also made a note of the challenges facing “the so-called Z Generation, the very young.” “They’ve really gotten screwed since they got out of school,” Biden said. “The jobs aren’t there,” he added.“But guess what? They’re the most open, progressive and the brightest generation we’ve ever had,” he added. “And we have to embrace them. They know the change we need to make and how we need to be much more, much more integrated in everything we do,” he said. Biden was critical of the policies of President Donald Trump. “The rest of the world is wondering, what in the Lord’s name is happening? What we’re living through today is not normal,” he said.He reiterated his attacks on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting more than 215,000 Americans have died, and criticised the president for backing away from stimulus talks. “He didn’t walk away. He never was part of ‘em,” Biden said.“Three days later, after he said he was walking away, he said he’s coming back … One day, he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big … next day it’s too small. The longer he’s president, the more reckless he gets,” he added.While talking more broadly about the stakes of the election, Biden noted he just got off the phone with Warren Buffett.“We have to refuse to postpone what America has to do, the work we have to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity for God’s sake,” Biden said. “Just got off the phone with Warren Buffett and talking about how … we’re in a position, unlike we were 50, 70, 80 years ago, to lead the whole damn world in a way that no one else can. There’s no limit to America’s future. The only thing that’s going to tear America apart is America itself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-provide-citizenship-to-11-million-people-if-voted-to-power-says-joe-biden/story-PKcry4zLzYoIZtqii8HFTK.html
15-10-2020||World||World facing new Bretton Woods moment: IMF MD||The world is experiencing a new Bretton Woods moment, facing the twin task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic today and building a better tomorrow, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday. “Today we face a new Bretton Woods moment. A pandemic that has already cost more than a million lives. An economic calamity that will make the world economy 4.4 per cent smaller this year and strip an estimated USD 11 trillion of output by next year. And untold human desperation in the face of huge disruption and rising poverty for the first time in decades,” she said, addressing the annual meeting of the IMF’s Board of Governors. “Once again, we face two massive tasks: to fight the crisis today and build a better tomorrow,” she said. She said what was true at Bretton Woods, where allies at the end of World War II gathered for a conference to create the institutions that would use economic cooperation to prevent future conflicts, remains true today. Prudent macroeconomic policies and strong institutions are critical for growth, jobs and improved living standards, she added. Strong medium-term frameworks for monetary, fiscal and financial policies, as well as reforms to boost trade, competitiveness and productivity can help create confidence for policy action now while building much-needed resilience for the future, remarked Georgieva. “We know what action must be taken right now. A durable economic recovery is only possible if we beat the pandemic. Health measures must remain a priority. I urge you to support production and distribution of effective therapies and vaccines to ensure that all countries have access,” Georgieva said. She also urged countries to continue support for workers and businesses until a durable exit from the health crisis. “We have seen global fiscal actions of USD 12 trillion. Major central banks have expanded balance sheets by USD 7.5 trillion. These synchronised measures have prevented the destructive macro financial feedback we saw in previous crises,” she said. “But almost all countries are still hurting, especially emerging market and developing economies. And while the global banking system entered the crisis with high capital and liquidity buffers, there is a weak tail of banks in many in emerging markets. We must take measures to prevent the build-up of financial risks over the medium term,” she said. The IMF expects 2021 debt levels to go up significantly – to around 125 per cent of GDP in advanced economies, 65 per cent of GDP in emerging markets; and 50 per cent of GDP in low-income countries, Georgieva further said. The fund is providing debt relief to its poorest members and, with the World Bank, they support extension by the G20 of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative. “Beyond this, where debt is unsustainable, it should be restructured without delay. We should move towards greater debt transparency and enhanced creditor coordination. I am encouraged by G-20 discussions on a Common framework for Sovereign Debt Resolution as well as on our call for improving the architecture for sovereign debt resolution, including private sector participation,” she said. Georgieva said that to reap the full benefits of sound economic policy, they must invest more in people. That means protecting the vulnerable. It also means boosting human and physical capital to underpin growth and resilience, she argued. “Just as the pandemic has shown that we can no longer ignore health precautions, we can no longer afford to ignore climate change...We focus on climate change because it is macrocritical, posing profound threats to growth and prosperity. It is also people critical and planet critical,” said the IMF MD. The IMF, she said, is working tirelessly to support a durable recovery, and a resilient future as countries adapt to structural transformations brought on by climate change, digital acceleration and the rise of the knowledge economy. Since the pandemic began, IMF has committed over USD 100 billion and still has substantial resources from its USD 1 trillion in lending capacity, she said. “We will continue to pay special attention to the urgent needs of emerging markets and low income countries especially small and fragile states, helping them to pay doctors and nurses and protect the most vulnerable people and parts of their economies,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-facing-new-bretton-woods-moment-imf-md/story-kfxCJmQZqcn75GR2h7OvOP.html
15-10-2020||World||Russia says its third Covid-19 vaccine is ‘almost ready’||Russia announced its first vaccine Sputnik V in August becoming the first country to have come up with a Covid-19 vaccine. On October 14, the country approved a second Covid-19 vaccine. Reports said the country has claimed it has a third vaccine ready at Chumakov Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It is an inactivated vaccine, which once approved will take the country’s vaccine number to three, and this is likely to happen by December 2020, reports said. Russia at present is undergoing a second wave of Covid-19. On october 14, the country had 1,340,000 cases with an average daily increment rate of 1.1 per cent.Here is all you need to know about Russia’s vaccines:1. Russia is not doing large-scale trials of its vaccines and hence it has been able to announce two vaccines between August and September.2. The first vaccine is Sputnik V, an adenovirus vector-based vaccine. President Vladimir Putin’s daughter was inoculated with the vaccine.3. Post-registration clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine are going on involving 13,000 volunteers4. The second vaccine is EpiVacCorona, a synthetic vaccine based on peptides, which is being touted as safer than Sputnik V. It consists of short synthetic peptide fragments of virus proteins, which the immune system can use to identify and neutralise the virus. It should be pointed out that the peptide-based vaccine does not induce any reactogenic responses and is noted for its high level of safety.4. The clinical trials of the second vaccine involved 100 volunteers.5. The first batch of 60,000 vaccine doses of the second vaccine will be produced in the near future. Vektor Centre, which developed the second vaccine, will launch post-registration clinical trials in a number of Russian regions involving 40,000 volunteers. 6. The second vaccine will be tried on 150 people aged over 60 to check its efficacy among older population. 7. The third vaccine has received permission to conduct the first and second stages of clinical trials at medical facilities in Novosibirsk, St Petersburg and Kirov. During the first stage, 15 volunteers were inoculated with this vaccine on October 6. They have not reported any serious complications or side effects. 8. The second stage of the third vaccine will begin on October 19 on 285 volunteers. The clinical trials of this vaccine are expected to conclude by December.9. Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova and Chief Sanitary Doctor Anna Popova have received the second vaccine to test its effectiveness. Both of them reported no side effects.10. India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories was denied permission to conduct clinical trial of Russia’s first vaccine Sputnik V in India as Russia tested the vaccine among a small group and Dr Reddy’s proposed a larger size for the trial. Dr Reddy’s has again submitted a proposal to the Drug Controller General of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-its-third-covid-19-vaccine-is-almost-ready/story-0XPH4M7MFtd4UOUFA7RmgP.html

Workers were also assured that time spent on safety measures like washing their hands wouldn’t be counted against them under Amazon’s “Time Off Task” policy, which restricts the number of unproductive minutes allowed in their day.The company also submitted a statement by a U.S. human resources director that the more permissive policy dated back to March, when due to Covid-19 the company “ceased providing productivity rate feedback to associates and imposing any discipline related to low productivity rates.” Workers said the July message was the first time they heard of any such change, and in response to it they withdrew their request for a preliminary injunction in their lawsuit.However, in their new filing, the plaintiffs allege that in the lead-up to “Prime Day,” Amazon’s self-created labour intensive annual promotional holiday that started Tuesday and ends Wednesday, the company has once again been hassling employees about productivity, and warning them that slowness could get them terminated.Prime Day has become the starting point of the holiday shopping season, which will look vastly different this year because pandemic wary shoppers will avoid big store sales typically used to lure crowds. About half of the shoppers plan to do most or all of their shopping on the web, according to a Harris Poll conducted with Bloomberg, a demand that will strain Amazon’s warehouses and delivery stations.Amazon has faced criticism as it has scrambled to remain open throughout the pandemic and hire enough people to meet surging demands. Its vast network of warehouses have become a lifeline for people looking to avoid stores, but workers risk getting infected and potentially bringing the disease home. Last week, the California Department of Industrial Relations fined Amazon $1,870 for failing to train workers at two southern California warehouses on how to reduce Covid-19 exposure.The company has said that it has updated more than 150 of its processes to protect its employees from labouring through the pandemic, by including measures such as: additional paid time off, cleaning, mask distribution, and social distancing, and is ramping up an in-house Covid-19 testing program.On October 1, Amazon disclosed that almost 20,000 of its U.S. employees have tested positive for Covid-19, but that their infection rate was lower than the general population’s. In legal filings, the company has denied wrongdoing, called the New York lawsuit an effort to “exploit the pandemic,” and said that under federal law the workers’ claims should be brought to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration rather than the court.Productivity quotas have been a long-running flashpoint at Amazon. Covid-19 concerns have inspired a wave of walkouts and demonstrations, beginning with one in March at the Staten Island warehouse.Plaintiff Derrick Palmer said that over the past month he and other Staten Island employees have repeatedly been notified by supervisors that production quotas were being reinstated as of October. “I said, ‘You know the pandemic is still going on?’” Palmer recalled in an interview.“It’s like business over safety” Palmer said. “I’m just kind of sad that they would resort to this, and throw all the safety measures out the window.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-workers-say-prime-day-rush-breaks-virus-safety-vows/story-M5KbOlXxDf6PWPBQSVy6bK.html

It was the first time China has offered debt to US-based investors who were most active in the longer-dated tranches of the transaction.US investors, primarily fund managers, were the largest buyers of the 30-year tranche, picking up 47% of the $500 million sold, according to the term-sheet.The rising tensions between Washington and Beijing did not deter US-based investors from participating in the deal, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.The person could not be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.“We did not see the geopolitical situation scaring people away,” he said.The deal was finalised on Wednesday as the stand-off between Washington and Beijing showed no signs of easing.The US State Department has submitted a proposal for the Trump administration to add China’s Ant Group to a trade blacklist, according to two people familiar with the matter, before the financial technology firm is slated to go public in Shanghai and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-raises-6bn-as-us-investors-look-past-political-tensions/story-8HNR3FNYVOCxyZLnmBIRaI.html
15-10-2020||World||China defends controversial Tibet labour program, urges Tibetans against ‘overdoing religion’||Top officials in Chinese-administered Tibet on Thursday defended a vocational training program that some critics have called coercive, and urged Tibetans not to “overdo” religion, during a briefing with foreign journalists on a rare visit to the region.The transfer program, which involves government-set quotas for labourers and includes a focus on ideological training, has riled rights groups and Tibetan activists outside China, who say it is coercive - an assertion China rejects. The program, aimed at lifting skills and incomes, has involved about 15 percent of Tibet’s population of 3.51 million. China is embarked on a multi-year plan to eradicate deep poverty by the end of 2020.“There is no element of coercion,” Che Dhala, Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said in response to a question on whether nomads are forced to participate in the training programs, adding that people are trained in skills they want, such as driving or welding.Che also said that Tibetans should not “overdo” religious consumption, and should follow the country’s ruling Party for a “happy life”.Religion is a highly sensitive topic in Tibet, where the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, fled following a failed uprising against the Chinese administration in 1959.“As long as they work hard to get rich, listen to the party, follow the party, and get down to doing things, their future will be more beautiful,” Che said during the briefing, where officials outlined poverty alleviation efforts.“This kind of beautiful life needs to be achieved by correctly and rationally understanding religion. We hope that people will not overdo it, that is, religious consumption that exceeds the family’s capacity,” he said.By the end of 2019, all 628,000 registered poor living in Tibet had been lifted out of poverty and their average annual income had risen to 9,328 yuan ($1,388), local officials said on Thursday. That compares with an average monthly salary of 10,000 yuan in Beijing.Tibet is one of the most restricted and politically sensitive regions in the country, and foreign journalist visits are tightly controlled.    Asked about restrictions that bar foreigners from going to Tibet outside of government tours, Wu Yingjie, the Communist Party Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said officials believed the region’s environment was too dangerous for foreigners to travel independently.($1 = 6.7206 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Yew Lun Tian; Writing by Cate Cadell; Editing by Tony Munroe and Ana Nicolaci da Costa)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-defends-controversial-tibet-labour-program-urges-tibetans-against-overdoing-religion/story-hTeAEWHFnhNVWF1QfqqtkI.html
15-10-2020||World||Prez Xi Jinping pushes limits, not just with neighbours but at home too | Analysis||Chinese President Xi Jinping isn’t only flexing muscles with neighbours but has stepped up efforts to consolidate his leadership in the Communist Party that meets later this month. President Xi is expected to get the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) central committee to sign off on a new set of regulations that will let President Xi dictate the agenda for meetings of the party’s top panels.People familiar with the matter said this power appears to be a precursor to President Xi giving himself a huge promotion that would place him on par with communist China’s founding father Mao Zedong, the only leader in the party’s history to be designated as chairman. “President Xi Jinping’s actions to consolidate his power does suggest very clearly that he has decided to elevate himself,” a China watcher in New Delhi said.President Xi would be the first chairman of the party in 45 years if he goes through with it. Xi, like Mao Zedong, is already designated as the PLA commander-in-chief and the Middle Kingdom’s paramount leader. In October 2017, Xi was only the second Chinese leader after Mao to have had an eponymous ideology included in the party’s charter while in office. This year, he had the Xi Jinping Research Center for Diplomatic Thought opened.Also Read: From Mao to Xi, the changing Chinese positions on LadakhPresident Xi has been laying the groundwork to consolidate his control over China’s politics and the armed forces for years. As far back as 2016, according to one analysis, China’s commander-in-chief had ruthlessly purged 73 general-rank officers including 4-star generals and fast-tracked promotions to those loyal to him to ensure the PLA’s complete submission to him, not the party.Xi had also been able to induct 18 of the 25 Politburo members from his personal network by 2017, up from the 5 members he could count as his own in 2012 when the party’s 18th Congress was held. The 20th Congress is proposed to be held in June next year.That effort continues.Early this month, Xi Jinping continued to target Vice President Wang Qishan, placing the vice president’s close associate Dong Hong under investigation on suspicion of what was described as ‘disciplinary review and supervisory investigation’. Dong, according to articles in China’s state media, had worked closely with vice president Wang since the 1990s when their paths first crossed and was a senior disciplinary inspector under Wang when he was chief of China’s anti-corruption agency and powered Xi’s anti-corruption campaign during his first five-year term that often targeted rivals. A recent analysis in Asian Nikkei Review suggested that the equation between Xi and Wang could be up for a change.Dong Hong was the second close associate of vice president Wang to be implicated on October 2 after his high school friend and an ex-party member Ren Zhiqiang was handed an 18- year imprisonment. Ren Zhiqiang, the former chairman of state-owned real estate group Huayuan, was convicted for illegal gains totalling 112 million yuan ($16.5 million), a charge that was slapped on the 69-year-old after he called Xi Jinping “a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor” in March.Ren was promptly expelled from the communist party, investigated for a “serious disciplinary violation” and charged with offences such as using official funds on golf expenses and using office and residential spaces provided for free by businessmen. If Chairman Mao could purge his close associates such as Liu Shaoqi during cultural revolution, Comrade Xi is expected to follow his footsteps in pursuit of 2021 China Dream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-xi-jinping-aims-to-be-china-s-1st-party-chairman-in-45-yrs-steps-up-the-consolidation-analysis/story-AXITTmiBph5C4NwKCYSs1M.html
15-10-2020||World||French health minister among top leaders raided in Covid-19 probe||French police searched the homes of the former prime minister, the current and former health ministers and other top officials Thursday in an investigation into the government response to the global coronavirus pandemic.The Health Ministry confirmed the dawn searches, which included the offices of the current health minister Olivier Veran. They came a day after French President Emmanuel Macron announced curfews in the Paris region and eight other French metropolitan areas to deal with the rising toll of new infections.Covid-19 patients, doctors, prison personnel, police officers and others in France filed an unprecedented 90 complaints in recent months, notably over shortages of masks and other equipment.A special French court has ordered an investigation over the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.Among those whose homes were searched include former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, Veran, his predecessor Agnes Buzyn, the head of the country’s national health service Jerome Salomon, and Sibeth Ndiaye, a former government spokeswoman. Veran’s office was searched as well.Salomon abruptly canceled an early-morning live interview on the national BFM-TV due to “personal reasons,” according to the network.Jean-Luc Reitzer, an opposition member of the French parliament who was hospitalized with a severe case of coronavirus, said he was shocked by the searches.“Do our citizens seriously believe that the shortages, which were real, were voluntary?” he told BFM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-health-minister-among-top-leaders-raided-in-covid-19-probe/story-ryBBpDuEN1HMdhbFeFqpcN.html
15-10-2020||World||Restrictions back in Europe as coronavirus cases surge||Record daily infection figures in Germany, the Czech Republic and Italy added to fears on Thursday that Europe is running out of chances to control its latest coronavirus outbreak. France has set a 9 p.m. curfew for many of its biggest cities as governments across the continent take increasingly tough action.New infections have surged across Europe over recent weeks as the fall kicks in, prompting authorities in many places to start reimposing restrictions that were relaxed over the summer. The Czech Republic, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, France and Britain are among the countries causing particular concern.While Germany, the European Union’s most populous nation, is still in comparatively good shape, alarm bells have started ringing there too. On Thursday, the country’s national disease control center reported 6,638 cases over 24 hours — exceeding the previous record of nearly 6,300 set in late March, although testing in the country of 83 million has expanded greatly since then.Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany’s 16 state governors agreed Wednesday night to tighten mask-wearing rules, make bars close early and limit the number of people who can gather in areas where coronavirus infection rates are high. Merkel, who stressed the importance of keeping contact-tracing efforts on track, said “We must stop this exponential rise, the quicker the better.”Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s national disease control center, said “we can still repress the spread, the exponential growth” of the virus. But officials made clear that more efforts may be necessary.“I think yesterday’s decisions are an important step, but they probably won’t be enough,” Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told ARD television. “So now it is up to the population that we don’t just look at ‘what am I allowed to do now,’ but basically we must do more and be more cautious than what the governors decided yesterday.”Merkel noted that neighbouring countries are having to take “very drastic measures.”This week has seen the Netherlands close bars and restaurants and the Czech Republic and Northern Ireland close down schools. The Czech Health Ministry said the country, with a population of over 10 million, confirmed 9,544 new cases on Wednesday — over 900 more than the previous record, set less than a week ago. The government says hospitals could reach full capacity by the end of October.On Wednesday night, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 18 million residents in nine regions, including Paris, will have a 9 p.m. curfew starting Saturday until December 1.“We won’t go to restaurants after 9 p.m. We won’t see friends. We won’t party, because that’s how to pass on the virus,” Macron said.Paris restaurant, cinema and theatre owners are fuming at the new curfew rules, which effectively shut down evening activities. Tighter local restrictions in northern England and Northern Ireland have prompted the same emotions from business owners there. But health authorities across Europe are expressing urging people to obey the new restrictions.One of Belgium’s main universities said it is moving to online education whenever possible. Ghent University said the measure will begin October 26 and the Dutch-speaking Free University of Brussels said it already prepared its staff and facilities to do likewise if necessary.Italy, which so far has been spared the worst of the second wave, on Wednesday also recorded its biggest single-day jump in infections since the start of the pandemic. It added another 7,332 cases amid a resurgence that is threatening to bring the country’s contact-tracing system to its knees — topping a record set in late March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/restrictions-back-in-europe-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-FRMEGFkYq7L1MAKndyqNvO.html
15-10-2020||World||Japan Coast Guard testing unmanned aircraft to contain Chinese aggression||Days after two Chinese patrol ships illegally entered into Japan’s territorial waters off Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, Japan Coast Guard began test flights of an unmanned aerial vehicle SeaGuardian to learn whether it can be utilised to carry out the coast guard’s key duties, including search and rescue and maritime surveillance.The flights, starting on Thursday, will be conducted off the coast of Sanriku in northeastern Japan, as well as along the coasts of the Sea of Japan. The tests will involve the use of the 12-meter-long, 24-meter-wide UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) developed by US defence firm General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, reported NHK World.The aircraft will be based at the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s Hachinohe base in Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan and will either engage in pre-programmed flights or be remotely piloted from a ground control station.The SeaGuardian is equipped with radars and high-definition cameras and is capable of flying for more than 24 hours nonstop. Hence, it will cover the outermost exclusive economic zone of Japan. It will test the real-time ending of data and images to the ground and the safety of the vehicle.The coast guard is eager to step up its capabilities by considering the introduction of the UAV. It currently conducts search and rescue as well as maritime surveillance with 33 aircraft and 52 helicopters. The validation flights are scheduled to take place till November 10 at a cost of over 8.5 million dollars, reported NHK World.Earlier, Japan on Wednesday had unveiled its newest submarine with the aim to boost the country’s maritime security amid China’s growing aggression in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-coast-guard-testing-unmanned-aircraft-to-contain-chinese-aggression/story-kLtToiArx1YwCJLb2inxaO.html

15-10-2020||World||Spain pushes back on German concerns over handling of coronavirus outbreak||The coronavirus is “under control” in Spain and German government concerns about the scale of Spain’s recession aren’t justified, Foreign Affairs Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said.The government is focused on slowing the rate of infections while protecting the economy and tensions between the national administration and Madrid region are a consequence of the country’s decentralized system, Laya said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday.Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has been locked in an increasingly bitter struggle with the center-right government of Madrid which has been resisting restrictions in the Spanish capital, the epicenter of a fresh wave of infections. German government officials have privately voiced concern that the economic hit from the virus in Spain -- the most severe in Europe -- could have a knock-on effect for other member states.Read More: Spain’s Toxic Politics, Health Woes Have Got Merkel Worried“I don’t think this is fair,” Laya said.“What’s happening in Spain is not unlike what happens in the laender in Germany,” she added. “When the central government tells the regions they need to take tough measures, some of them are not happy about that and want to pass the buck onto the federal government.”Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to persuade German state leaders to take more decisive action to stop the contagion and voiced her frustration after eight hours of talks on Wednesday produced only limited measures.Sanchez declared a state of emergency in Madrid last week to force the regional government to impose restrictions on movement. Spain has registered 300,000 new cases over the past month bringing the total number of infections to almost a million and more than 3,000 people have died during that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-pushes-back-on-german-concerns-over-handling-of-coronavirus-outbreak/story-bg47nfUtmdECFMYR72hDeM.html
15-10-2020||World||Thailand declares emergency after major student-led protest in Bangkok||Thai authorities declared a strict new state of emergency for the capital on Thursday, a day after a student-led protest against the country’s traditional establishment saw an extraordinary moment in which demonstrators heckled a royal motorcade.After the pre-dawn declaration, riot police moved in to clear out demonstrators who after a day of rallies and confrontation had gathered outside Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s office to push their demands, which include the former general’s stepping down, constitutional changes and reform of the monarchy.Several top leaders of the protest movement were taken into custody, with one later declaring on his Facebook page that he had been denied access to a lawyer and was being forced onto a helicopter and taken to a city in the country’s north. Police said they had made 22 arrests.The text of the emergency declaration said it was needed because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.”The protest Wednesday in Bangkok’s historic district, not far from glittering temples and royal palaces, was the third major gathering by student-led activists who have been pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable — and legal — language by publicly questioning the role of Thailand’s monarchy in the nation’s power structure.Thailand’s royal family has long been considered sacrosanct and a pillar of Thai identity. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key member of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.The protest — held on the anniversary of a 1973 student-led uprising against a military dictatorship — was complicated by the presence of royalist counter protesters who had gathered both to show support for the government and to greet the royal family as they traveled to and from a religious ceremony in the area.That led to a moment captured in photos and video that circulated widely on social media in which what appeared to be protesters gestured and shouted just meters (feet) from the royal motorcade. Such actions are unprecedented in Thailand, where those waiting for a royal motorcade regularly sit on the ground or prostrate themselves.Some experts say a line may have been crossed.“What seemed to be a low-boil stalemate that the Prayuth government was managing with reasonable success has now, following the incident involving the procession of the queen’s motorcade down a street in which an active protest was under way and the arrests of protest leaders, become a full-blown crisis,” said Michael Montesano, coordinator of the Thailand Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Isak Institute in Singapore. “Unlike even 48 hours ago, the country is in dangerous territory now.”Government spokesman Anucha Buraphachaisri announced Thursday morning that the prime minister had ordered police to take strict action against those who obstruct a royal procession or otherwise insult the monarchy.Keeping order will be facilitated by the new emergency decree for Bangkok, which bans unauthorized gatherings of more than five people and gives authorities other powers they deem needed to prevent unrest, including detaining people at length without charge. It also outlaws the news that distorts information or could cause a “misunderstanding.”Thailand is already under a national state of emergency as part of its efforts to fight the coronavirus, and it was not immediately clear how the new decree was different.One change is that police said they will install checkpoints around Bangkok for security purposes.Protesters were undaunted and said they would gather again in a Bangkok shopping district Thursday afternoon.Deputy police spokesman Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen warned that calling for such a protest or attending one was against the law.“You cannot say that they are not aware of the order. We are making it clear,” Kissana said at a news conferenceHuman rights group Amnesty International criticized the crackdown. Its deputy regional director Ming Yu Hah urged Thai authorities to “engage in constructive dialogue with the protesters.”“The scale of today’s early morning arrests seems completely unjustified based on yesterday’s events. The assemblies were overwhelmingly peaceful. These moves are clearly designed to stamp out dissent, and sow fear in anyone who sympathizes with the protesters’ views,” the group said in a statement.The protest movement was launched in March by university students, but quickly put on hold as Thailand was gripped by the coronavirus pandemic. It came back in July, when the threat from the virus eased, and since grown in size.The movement’s original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The movement took another stunning turn in August, when students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and issued calls for its reform. Airing their grievances in direct language normally expressed in whispers, the speakers criticized the king’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany, not Thailand.Conservative royalist Thais accuse the protest movement of seeking to end the monarchy, an allegation its leaders deny.Nevertheless, analysts say the incident with the royal motorcade may harden positions.It “is not just unprecedented but will be shocking for many,” said Kevin Hewison, professor emeritus from the University of North Carolina and veteran Thai studies scholar. “Yet it is reflective of how a new generation of protesters sees the monarchy and military-backed regime as intertwined and that political reform demands reform of the monarchy as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-declares-emergency-after-major-student-led-protest-in-bangkok/story-9t6ddGJjpNHJY8nvoy19gL.html
15-10-2020||World||UN rights official calls for lifting North Korea sanctions citing Covid-19 pandemic||A UN human rights official has called on the international community to urgently consider lifting sanctions on North Korea that may be worsening problems from its coronavirus lockdown, according to a draft report released on Thursday.North Korea, which has not reported any confirmed infections, has been subjected to UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, with ever tighter measures imposed in recent years.It imposed strict border controls this year among tough measures against the virus, just when it was reeling from sanctions, as well as “systemic economic problems and unusually bad weather conditions,” Tomas Ojea Quintana wrote. While the North’s strictures aim to protect its people’s rights to life and health, the severe lockdowns have had a “devastating” effect on trade, added Quintana, who is the United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea.The fallout on trade, in turn, threatens food supplies and access to humanitarian aid, he said in the report, which is to be submitted next week to the UN General Assembly.“Under the unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Special Rapporteur believes that the international responsibility for re-evaluating the sanctions regime is more urgent than ever,” he concluded.Greater implementation of sanctions has started to “seriously affect the entire economy of the country,” with adverse consequences for people’s economic and social rights, he added.North Korea’s dire human rights situation also stands to be exacerbated by the pandemic, through increased surveillance and control of its population and reduced contact with the rest of the world, Quintana said.The recent shooting of a South Korean fisheries official by North Korean border troops appeared to be an unlawful and arbitrary killing of a civilian, in violation of international human rights law, he said in the report.He called for Pyongyang to provide more details of the case, while holding to account those responsible, compensating the man’s family, and preventing similar incidents in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-official-calls-for-lifting-north-korea-sanctions-citing-covid-19-pandemic/story-AV9KX4iqMbBw8jaEVUsRTI.html
15-10-2020||World||President of Kyrgyzstan steps down amid election turmoil||Kyrgyzstan President Sooronbai Jeenbekov announced his resignation on Thursday in a bid to end the turmoil that has engulfed the Central Asian nation after a disputed parliamentary election.In a statement released by his office, Jeenbekov, who has faced calls to step down from protesters and political opponents, said holding on to power wasn’t “worth the integrity of our country and agreement in society.”“For me, peace in Kyrgyzstan, the country’s integrity, the unity of our people and calm in the society are above all else,” Jeenbekov said.Kyrgyzstan, a country of 6.5 million people located on the border with China, was plunged into chaos following an Oct. 4 vote that election officials say was swept by pro-government parties. The opposition said the election was tainted by vote-buying and other irregularities.Protesters then took over government buildings, looting some offices and the Central Election Commission nullified the election. Opposition then announced plans to oust Jeenbekov and form a new government.The announcement Thursday came just a day after Jeenbekov dismissed a demand to step down from the country’s new prime minister, saying he would stay on the job until the political situation in the Central Asian country stabilizes.The president had insisted earlier that stepping down could trigger “unpredictable developments to the detriment of the state,” his office said. It emphasized that he will only agree to resign after “he takes the country back into the legal field, after holding parliamentary and calling presidential elections.”Hundreds of people rallied in the capital Bishkek on Wednesday, demanding his resignation, and the protests continued Thursday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-of-kyrgyzstan-steps-down-amid-election-turmoil/story-9J8BqMAZCYR3imect27SjI.html
15-10-2020||World||Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine trial remains on track, says CEO||Side effects that have emerged in a large late-stage trial of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE are in line with those seen in smaller early studies, a positive sign for one of the front-runners in the race for a shot.The partners haven’t had to stop their late-stage study over safety concerns, BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said in an interview. They’re sticking with their previously announced target of being able to provide preliminary data on whether the vaccine works as soon as this month, if a threshold for infections is reached; if so, any submissions for regulatory approval would come later.That would put Pfizer and BioNTech on track to potentially be the first to show the efficacy of a Covid-19 vaccine, in an environment of intense scrutiny over every possible complication. This week, Eli Lilly & Co. and Johnson & Johnson both said they had to pause research on potential therapies or shots because of safety concerns. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has touted unproven treatments and pushed for more rapid regulatory review.The pauses in other studies show “there is no room for ignoring facts,” Sahin said. “If there is a concern, the process stops. No one closes their eyes, and it should give people confidence that if a vaccine survives the development process and is approved, it should be regarded as safe.”Pfizer and BioNTech chose their candidate from a slate of four contenders, all of which relied on messenger RNA technology designed to teach the body’s cells to become vaccine factories in their own right.In what Sahin said is an unusual step, Pfizer and BioNTech published some of the data they used to narrow the field in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. The results show that people who took the experimental shot they chose had fewer so-called systemic side effects -- things like fever, chills and fatigue -- than those who got another jab in the partners’ portfolio.Because of the structure of the trial, BioNTech and Pfizer had first disclosed early results for another vaccine candidate, BNT162b1, in July. Investors were already optimistic about prospects for it, but after comparing data the companies decided instead to pursue another candidate, BNT162b2, Sahin said. That one performed as well in elderly people in the study as it did in young participants, he said, an important consideration for a coronavirus vaccine.Similar EffectsWith just 195 participants, the early study was too small to show the real safety implications of the experimental shot. Still, the side effects that have emerged so far in the 44,000-person late-stage trial are similar to those seen in these early studies, Sahin said.Safety is a key factor for any potential vaccine because the shots will be given widely to healthy people. The Food and Drug Administration has said it will require two months of safety data before reviewing any application for emergency authorization for a vaccine.Collecting the extra safety data probably won’t cause much of a delay once readout on the vaccine’s effectiveness is available, Sahin said.“Waiting another couple of weeks to complete the safety data should not be a concern,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-trial-remains-on-track-says-ceo/story-LUmVmcnTgEyo5h35XHXo3O.html
15-10-2020||World||‘They just took everything’: Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai on police raids||Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai said police raided his private offices earlier on Thursday, months after he was arrested on suspicion of violating the city’s national security law.Lai said police did not wait for his lawyers to arrive at his office and took away documents. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“They just wanted to get something to go against me,” Lai said outside a court, where he went for a hearing over unlawful assembly charges related to this year’s June 4 commemoration of China’s bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.“That’s not rule of law,” Lai said. “They just took everything.”Lai’s aide Mark Simon said on Twitter police did not leave any names or contacts for the 14 officers who searched the office.Lai was arrested in August on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces as around 200 police searched the offices of his Apple Daily anti-government tabloid, published by Next Digital Ltd. Police later also searched his yacht.He has not been charged.Lai had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a “traitor”.The security law was introduced on June 30 and punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.Critics say it crushes freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year.

15-10-2020||World||London readies for tightening of Covid-19 curbs as city inches towards average of 100 cases per 100,000 people||London is on course for an imminent tightening of coronavirus restrictions, as cases continue to rise in Britain and its response fragments.A change in the rules in the UK capital is likely in very short order, according to an official in London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s office. Khan and health leaders met Wednesday to discuss the potential move into stricter restrictions, which would ban two separate households from meeting indoors, the official said. London will soon hit an average of 100 cases per 100,000 people, the person said.The move by London would follow stricter measures taken by Northern Ireland and Wales to combat the virus. Northern Ireland is planning to close schools from Monday and impose new curbs on pubs and restaurants, while Wales wants to restrict travel from English hot spots, with new regulations coming into force Friday.Ministers and officials will brief MPs from northern England on Thursday morning on proposals for further curbs across large parts of the region, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock will update MPs in the House of Commons at about 11:30 a.m.The government has earmarked Greater Manchester for stricter restrictions, but has been locked in talks with local leaders over financial support for businesses and individuals affected by any new curbs.Growing angerThere was anger from all sides that people in the area had not been kept fully informed of the plans.“It is frustrating to keep learning of these developments from second-hand sources, alongside the speculation and hearsay,” William Wragg, the Tory MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, said on Twitter. “Says it all really,” he wrote, after discovering he had not been invited to a meeting of the region’s MPs.Britain’s increasingly fractured coronavirus picture comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson resists calls for a “circuit-breaker” national lockdown and continues to pursue a localized approach. He is trying to balance reducing virus transmission with keeping as much of the economy open as possible. He set out a three-tiered system of regional Covid alert levels this week to try to simplify the imposition of social-distancing measures.In England, the Liverpool region is currently the only area under the toughest rules in Johnson’s new three-tier system -- with any pubs not serving food forced to close. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who was briefed by government medical adviser Jonathan Van Tam on Wednesday evening, says he wants more support before agreeing to additional restrictions.New CurbsBusiness Minister Nadhim Zahawi appeared to confirm that new restrictions will be imposed in an interview with Sky News, before backtracking to say there needs to be agreement from local authorities.The meeting with MPs will be so “they can hear from the chief medical officer as to why we’re having to take this action,” Zahawi said. When pressed on whether that meant it was a foregone conclusion, he said “they need to see the data and of course that decision will be made jointly with local leaders.”Johnson is determined to avoid a national lockdown and pushed back against a proposal by Keir Starmer, leader of the oppisition Labour Party, for a two-to-three week “circuit breaker” to stem the spread of the disease.“Let’s try to avoid the misery of another national lockdown,” Johnson told the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I rule out nothing, of course, in combating the virus, but we are going to do it with the local, the regional approach that can drive down and will drive down the virus if it is properly implemented.”On Wednesday, the UK recorded 137 Covid-19 deaths, down marginally on Tuesday’s 143, which was the highest daily death toll since June. New cases rose by 19,724, compared to 17,234 the day before. Scientists warn numbers will continue to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-readies-for-tightening-of-covid-19-curbs-as-city-inches-towards-average-of-100-cases-per-100-000-people/story-I5bZbFifmW0tu7DnTR8OlM.html

Further details, including the launch date, will be fleshed out in coming weeks, they said. “It is a safe, careful but significant step forward to revive air travel, and provide a model for future collaboration with other parts of the world,” Singapore’s Ong said.For Hong Kong, which has banned non-residents since March, the deal with Singapore is its first resumption of travel ties with another city. Travellers from mainland China and neighbouring Macau still face 14 days in quarantine.Singapore has already announced pacts on essential business and official travel from China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and opened unilaterally to general visitors from Brunei, New Zealand, Vietnam and most of Australia.This week, Singapore eased quarantine to just seven days for travellers from Hong Kong, from 14 earlier. It has put the city on its list of low-risk places.International travel in Asia has collapsed during the pandemic because of border closures, with passenger numbers down 97% in August, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines says.Following the news, shares in Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific surged more than 7 percent in afternoon trade. Hong Kong’s daily coronavirus infections have dropped mostly into single digits since August and it has eased some social distancing curbs. Singapore has similarly seen its daily cases fall below 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-singapore-announce-plans-for-travel-bubble/story-oz2Y1FJIKwa5TpWaMEqAmJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Biden assures immigration bill to provide citizenship access to 11mn people||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has vowed to provide citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants if voted to power in the November 3 presidential elections.Biden identified this as one of his priorities in addition to beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world.Responding to a question at a virtual fund raiser on Wednesday, Biden said there is a need to deal with what’s going on at the border. “We’re going to have to deal with the immigration crisis we have. I’m going to send the House and Senate an immigration bill that’s going to provide access to citizenship to 11 million people,” he said.According to the campaign, there were 37 attendees and the event was hosted by Jane Hartley, former US Ambassador to France and Monaco and current Chairman, Sesame Workshop; Blair Effron, Founder & Partner, Centerview Partners; Indian American Deven Parekh, Managing Director, Insight Partners and Roger Altman, Founder & Senior Chairman, Evercore.When asked how he would envision his first 30 days in office in terms of both domestic and foreign policy, Biden said: “A lot more can go wrong between now and January 21, and I’m not being facetious. Four more years, we’re not going to have the country we have now”.“If the American people elect me, we’re going to have an enormous task in repairing the damage he’s done,” he added of Trump. “We have to be beating the virus, rebuilding the economy and figuring out how to restore American leadership around the world,” Biden said.Biden said he would move to quickly implement his plan to deal with the pandemic and reopen safely. The Democratic presidential candidate also made a note of the challenges facing “the so-called Z Generation, the very young.” “They’ve really gotten screwed since they got out of school,” Biden said. “The jobs aren’t there,” he said.“But guess what? They’re the most open, progressive and the brightest generation we’ve ever had,” he added. “And we have to embrace them. They know the change we need to make and how we need to be much more, much more integrated in everything we do,” he said. Biden was critical of the policies of President Donald Trump. “The rest of the world is wondering, what in the Lord’s name is happening? What we’re living through today is not normal,” he said.He reiterated his attacks on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, noting more than 215,000 Americans have died, and criticised the president for backing away from stimulus talks. “He didn’t walk away. He never was part of ‘em,” Biden said.“Three days later, after he said he was walking away, he said he’s coming back … One day, he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big … next day it’s too small. The longer he’s president, the more reckless he gets,” he added.While talking more broadly about the stakes of the election, Biden noted he just got off the phone with Warren Buffett.“We have to refuse to postpone what America has to do, the work we have to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity for God’s sake,” Biden said. “Just got off the phone with Warren Buffett and talking about how … we’re in a position, unlike we were 50, 70, 80 years ago, to lead the whole damn world in a way that no one else can. There’s no limit to America’s future. The only thing that’s going to tear America apart is America itself,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-assures-immigration-bill-to-provide-citizenship-access-to-11mn-people/story-GqSiOBy44SWBnKchwq4EYJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Production hurdles hurt Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine targets||Russia is going to miss its target of making 30 million doses of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine this year due to setbacks maintaining the serum’s stability while expanding production.“The main task is to scale up production,” Industry Minister Denis Manturov said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “To have 30 million doses by year-end is impossible, it is nonsense.”The Kremlin has pinned great hopes on the Sputnik V vaccine, which President Vladimir Putin promotes as the first registered inoculation in the world, to help establish Russia as a leader in the race to subdue the global coronavirus pandemic. The vaccine’s name is a nod to the world’s first artificial satellite that was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.The vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, the Defense Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, was approved for public use despite the fact that it is currently undergoing Phase 3 trials to determine if it is safe and effective.RDIF chief Kirill Dmitriev said in July the fund is aiming to produce 30 million doses this year.With a second wave of coronavirus cases sweeping Russia, the Kremlin needs the vaccine as it battles rising daily infection rates while seeking to avoid a repeat of a nationwide lockdown in the spring that battered the country’s economy. Russia has had more than 1.3 million infections, the fourth highest globally after the US, India and Brazil, and added a record 14,231 new cases Wednesday.RDIF says more than 50 countries have expressed interest in Sputnik V, with orders for 1.2 billion doses.However, ramping up production of the inoculation is proving more difficult than anticipated. Manturov said Russia will have made 40,000 doses by the end of this month, with the maximum possible by the New Year 2.3 million. Monthly output could exceed 10 million doses early next year, he said.“We believe these are very conservative projections and see the potential to produce 10 million doses of vaccines in December,” a spokesman for RDIF said. “Also, a significant part of production will be in India, China, Korea, Brazil and other countries.”Putin said at a government meeting Wednesday that foreign countries should be responsible for handling their own production even as Russia promotes its Covid-19 vaccines abroad. He also announced the approval of another vaccine ahead of final-stage trials.Manturov stood by Sputnik V, which has been questioned by international medical professionals who claim it needs more testing to prove it’s safe and provides immunity against the virus. Manturov said he and members of his family, including his 84-year-old mother, have received the shots.Putin has not received the vaccine, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/production-hurdles-hurt-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-targets/story-eotVJVx7jluutGOULlqPDJ.html

Interestingly, the WHO Director-General tweeted in Hindi. Earlier, in a video message, the Director-General urged the countries to opt for “case finding, isolation, testing, compassionate care, contact tracing, quarantine, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks, respiratory etiquette, ventilation, avoiding crowds and more” instead of herd immunity.Informing about the herd immunity, he said, “There has been some discussion recently about the concept of reaching so-called “herd immunity” by letting the virus spread. Herd immunity is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95 per cent of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5 per cent will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. In other words, herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not exposing them to it.”He further said, “Allowing a dangerous virus that we don’t fully understand to run free is simply unethical. It’s not an option. But we do have many options. WHO recommends case finding, isolation, testing, compassionate care, contact tracing, quarantine, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks, respiratory etiquette, ventilation, avoiding crowds and more. This is what countries are proving works, every day.”According to the latest update by the Johns Hopkins University, 38,441,934 people globally have till now tested positive for coronavirus and 1,091,439 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-s-ghebreyesus-urges-leaders-to-protect-the-vulnerable-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-wVjXRg6W9VrTVJ2kzFf1ZM.html

The storms had paralysed the transportation system and destroyed thousands of houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-visits-sites-for-rebuilding-towns-hit-by-typhoons-floods/story-KCH9tTaOed4ms9izIdBq4M.html
15-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Canadian universities likely to lose billions of dollars in revenue due to travel curbs||With Canada’s data agency warning that the country’s universities could lose billions of dollars in revenue after pandemic-related travel curbs led to a fall in the enrollment of international students, those from India securing study permits this year have shown a sharp drop of over 50% compared to 2019.Indian students in Canada comprised the largest bloc of international scholars in the country - with 219,855, a record number - as of 2019 end, according to official data. The number of Indian students who were issued valid study permits grew in the first quarter of 2020, going up from 13,965 to 16,105. After that, the Covid-19 outbreak began, and the number plummeted from 27,395 in the second quarter of 2019 to 16,250 in 2020. The precipitous drop was even more in evident in the third quarter when the real rush begins as the new academic year commences in September. In 2019, 58,565 Indians students held the permits, while between July and August this year, the total number was only 15,700. Overall, the first eight months of 2019 had logged 99,925 for Indian students, while this year, the comparative figure is at 47,220 - a decline of over 50%.The surge of Indian students going to Canadian institutions of higher education began in 2017, as they overtook the Chinese for the first time to become the largest segment, with 82,955 permits. That increased to 107,085 in 2018 and further to 138,930 last year, according to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).This trend has led the country’s data agency, Statistics Canada or StatCan, to forecast a drop in earnings for universities this year. It said in a report, “It is estimated that international students paid almost 40% of all tuition fees and accounted for almost $4 billion in annual revenue for Canadian universities in 2017-2018.” Such students, including those from India, paid tuition fees that were almost five times the average for domestic students, which was $6,610.“The number of student permits issued from June to August in 2020 fell by over half (-58%) compared with 2019,” StatCan noted in a statement. It estimated that “depending on the size of the reduction in international student enrollments and the subsequent loss in tuition fees (unadjusted for inflation)”, Canadian universities could possibly “lose between $377 million (0.8% of projected revenues) and $3.4 billion (7.5% of projected revenues) in 2020-2021”.Indian students are estimated to have added between $6 billion and $10 billion to the Canadian economy in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canadian-universities-likely-to-lose-billions-of-dollars-in-revenue-due-to-travel-curbs/story-EtOxv7If8ttCxSfWxJpZMP.html
15-10-2020||World||In China’s Qingdao, two officials punished for latest Covid-19 case outbreak||The Chinese city of Qingdao said on Thursday it had suspended its health commission head and sacked a hospital director following an outbreak of coronavirus infections that ended China’s run of about two months without reporting a local case.The coastal city has reported 13 recent infections, most of them linked to the Qingdao Chest Hospital, where infected travellers arriving from overseas had been treated in an isolation area.One of the cases involved a dock worker who had earlier tested positive for the virus but only developed symptoms after about 20 days, the city said.Qingdao announced this week that it would test all of its 9 million residents for the virus over a five-day period. More than 7 million results had come back as of Thursday morning, with no infections beyond those reported, it said.The novel coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.After early missteps, China has taken aggressive measures to curb its spread, including mass testing campaigns when clusters appear, and has managed to nearly stamp out domestic transmission.The total number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in mainland China stands at 85,622, with 4,634 deaths.

15-10-2020||World||Only 28% companies prepared to deliver Covid-19 vaccines, survey shows||The medical industry’s dash to produce the world’s first coronavirus vaccines in just a few months is heightening the urgency for the workhorses of global trade to be ready for the historic charge to defeat the disease.Only 28% of companies involved in supply-chain logistics feel well prepared to handle Covid-19 vaccines and 19% characterized their readiness as very unprepared, according to a survey released Wednesday that showed a wide swath between optimists and pessimists. The poll, conducted in mid-September by the International Air Cargo Association and Pharma Aero, is part of an effort to coordinate widespread delivery of the immunizations.Just over half of 181 respondents already have the vehicles, containers and the connections needed to move hundreds of millions of vials in a constant deep-freeze. Almost a quarter said they’re still trying to procure such equipment, the survey of airlines, freight forwarders, airport operators and ground handlers showed.The preparedness of those responsible for moving the medicine from manufacturing sites to health clinics worldwide is paramount because the doses, once in transit, must stay ultra-cold as they traverse a world economy where supply chains are already at capacity. The industry is also trying to avoid bidding wars, shortages and every-country-for-itself attitudes that sparked a stampede for personal protective equipment in the initial months of the pandemic.“This is the greatest challenge that the logistics industry is facing today or maybe ever,” said Emir Pineda, manager of aviation trade and logistics at Miami International Airport and a board member of the association, known as Tiaca. “The supply chain is made up of many links and if one of those links breaks, then we’re going to have an issue.”With little precision about when drug makers will produce enough vaccines for mass distribution, logistics estimates are hard to come by and inherently unreliable. Pineda said that the Covid-19 vaccine rollout alone may generate 65,000 tons of air freight, more than four times the amount of vaccines transported in 2019 and enough to fill 930 Boeing Co. 747 freighters.Different BallgameThe drug industry has been transporting vaccines for many years without much fanfare, so the expertise exists. But the magnitude and complexity of this effort will require much more coordination between private industry, customs officials, governments and non-governmental organizations.“Before Covid-19, it was 100% scalable: We knew how many flus there were in the world, we know how many cases of meningitis there were,” said Frank Van Gelder, secretary-general of Pharma.Aero. “But suddenly you have a pandemic, which captures the entire global population and then you start to play a different ballgame.”Such a large airlift would be difficult in normal times. The task looks especially daunting on top of the sustained, solid demand for online merchandise and basic necessities like groceries that are already filling cargo planes and container ships. The cost of air freight is up about 50% from a year ago, and seaborne shipping-container rates have tripled since the start of the year.Meanwhile, transport companies have starting mapping out where the bulk of the vaccines will be produced -- in places like Illinois, North Carolina and the Northeast in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland and Germany in Europe, and in Asia’s pharma hubs in India and China.While companies like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. are investing in freezer space, there’s still concern about addressing “the last mile” of distribution, particularly in remote and often impoverished regions hard to reach with extreme refrigeration -- anywhere from -20 to -80 degrees Celsius (-4 to -12 degrees Fahrenheit) that will be required.Along parts of the vaccines’ journey, there will be electricity available for refrigeration and battery-powered coolers. On other legs, though, the survival of the doses will depend on dry ice packed in boxes, raising a range of risks including premature thawing to safety questions for handlers because of the fumes emitted when it sublimates.The complexity of the mission could exert strains on the logistics industry so great that it may require military might, through authorities like the U.S.’s Civil Reserve Air Fleet, a program established in 1951 after the Berlin airlift that lets the Pentagon use commercial aircraft for national-security reasons.Cold Corridor“It’s an iPhone 12 launch on steroids,” said Neel Jones Shah, global head of air carrier relationships at San Francisco-based freight forwarder Flexport and a Tiaca director. “I would still say that the confidence in our state of readiness is maybe a 6.5 out of 10.”That cautious optimism may grow as more companies step in to help. Among the leaders in cold-chain refrigeration is Thermo King, part of Trane Technologies Plc, a Dublin-based maker of industrial equipment. It’s positioning its line of units for each step of the cold corridor that the logistics industry is trying to establish.“We’re trying to make all our capacity available,” Francesco Incalza, the head of Thermo King’s business in Europe. “When I hear, for instance, that there is not enough capacity in the supply chain to move 8 billion doses of vaccine -- if you get organized, there is capacity.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-28-companies-prepared-to-deliver-covid-19-vaccines-survey-shows/story-YpZG1rIlqGnDSPABEQZqZO.html

She is also chair of the Sikh Police Association.The QPM will be handed over to Atwal in the coming months.During her 24-year career, the police force said she has worked in 18 areas of policing - including neighbourhood policing, youth offending, operational planning, intelligence gathering, and counterterrorism. She is also a trained hostage and crisis negotiator.Until July 2019, Atwal spent more than two years as the Commander of the City Neighbourhood Policing Area before taking up roles working with partners to help tackle and prevent serious violent crime. Atwal’s force said she has been highlighted as an “exemplary advocate for those under-represented in policing”, providing coaching to a number of officers through promotion and personal development programmes.After being named in the royal honours list, she said, “It is such an honour and I feel truly grateful to have even been nominated, especially when I think of all the amazing people who deserve recognition for the incredible work they do.”Atwal added, “It sounds like a cliché, but policing was something I’d always wanted to do from a young age growing up in Derbyshire.

15-10-2020||World||Joe Biden and Democrats raised record $383 million in September for White House bid||Democrat Joe Biden and his party raised a record-shattering $383 million in September for his presidential bid, likely bolstering his financial advantage over President Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 3 election.The campaign had $432 million in cash at month’s end, campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said on Twitter.The haul outstripped the $365 million that Democrats raised in August, which was itself a monthly record for any US presidential campaign.“To every person who chipped in a few dollars last month - thank you,” Biden wrote on Twitter in announcing the sum. “I’m incredibly humbled.”The Trump campaign has not yet announced its September total, but it pulled in $210 million in August along with the Republican National Committee.Biden has held a significant lead over Trump in national polls for months, although Reuters/Ipsos polling shows a somewhat closer race in the battleground states likely to decide the winner.As of Aug. 31, Democrats had $466 million available to spend on the presidential race, compared with $325 million for Republicans.The figures cap a stunning turnaround for the Biden campaign, which emerged from a crowded Democratic primary field earlier this year with little cash. The Trump campaign, which began raising money almost as soon as he took office in 2017, had once appeared to be a financial juggernaut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-and-democrats-raised-record-383-million-in-september-for-white-house-bid/story-eklMQlhkI8YNyZDYF0gILI.html
15-10-2020||World||Jacinda Ardern set for historic election win in Covid-free New Zealand||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is widely expected to win a second term this weekend, buoyed by a decisive yet compassionate leadership style under crisis, with polls showing her centre-left Labour Party comfortably in front.Ardern’s globally lauded responses to the country’s worst mass shooting and the coronavirus pandemic were also well received at home, although questions have been asked of Labour’s credentials to tackle the looming economic crisis.While it was initially thought Ardern could lead Labour to the country’s first outright majority government since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996, more recent polls have indicated she may need to lean on support from the minor Green Party.That would produce the country’s first pure left-leaning government since 1999. Current coalition partner, nationalist New Zealand First, led by deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, is likely to exit parliament, according to the polls. “It is hard to see an election outcome which does not return Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister,” said former Prime Minister Helen Clark and co-chair of a World Health Organization (WHO) panel looking at the global coronavirus response.“The election occurs in the context of the pandemic, and her response to it has been highly rated,” said Clark. Ardern, 40, worked a researcher in Clark’s office shortly after graduating university.Ardern removed all coronavirus restrictions last week after a second series of lockdowns and social distancing measures to eliminate COVID-19 transmission in the country of 5 million.She this week joined 31,000 rugby fans at a Wellington stadium to watch the All Blacks take on the Australian Wallabies, becoming one of the first international sporting events to allow spectators.“I say to the world ... welcome to paradise,” one fan was captured shouting to television cameras broadcasting the game. Ardern herself is often mobbed at public events by fans bearing selfie sticks. Still, National leader Judith Collins has clawed back some support for her party by focusing on the tough financial challenge ahead as unemployment rises, recession looms and government coronavirus support packages expire. Collins has warned a left-leaning coalition would mean more taxes and a business-unfriendly environment. Ardern has long had a small but vocal band of critics at home. Early in her leadership she was labelled ‘Stardust’ and ‘part-time PM’ by her critics for turning up more often on the cover of the Vogue magazine than in the corridors of parliament.Some critics suggest the extraordinary events that have shaped her first term - the pandemic, the Christchurch mosque shootings and the White Island volcano explosion - have masked some shortcomings.A flagship affordable housing building programme was set back by embarrassing blunders, economic growth has flattened, and her government fell embarrassingly short of its aspirational goals of reducing child poverty and inequality.MAORI CONCERNSThousands of indigenous Maori - traditionally a key part of Labour’s support base - took to the streets last year over land and civil rights. Those protests were viewed as a proxy for a wider disenchantment within the indigenous community over inequalities that leave Maori lagging on social indicators like housing, education and health.“Jacinda Ardern’s Labour-led government ushered in an impressive number of Māori MPs – in fact, a record number. It sounds good but something has been missing. None of them have been a staunch enough voice for Māori,” Leigh-Marama McLachlan, a communications leader for her Maori tribe, wrote in an opinion piece in The Guardian this week. Still, Ardern retains a solid international following as an ‘anti-Trump’, promoting issues such as social justice, multilateralism, environmental protection and equality in high-profile international forums including the United Nations.“In a world where the news cycle focuses a lot on the latest utterances of the world’s populist and authoritarian leaders, Jacinda Ardern represents a refreshing and sharp point of difference,” said Clark.The challenge for Ardern will be to redirect some of her international shine homeward while tackling an unprecedented economic crisis.

15-10-2020||World||Trump administration’s new appointment to scrutinise China’s human rights violations in Tibet||The Trump administration appointed a senior official to oversee Tibetan issues after a vacancy for almost four years, as the US increases pressure on China over its human rights record, including the use of forced labor among ethnic minorities.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Wednesday named Robert Destro as the US’s new Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. Destro will primarily be responsible for advancing dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama and protecting the religious, cultural and linguistic identity of Tibetans, according to the State Department.“The United States remains concerned with the PRC’s repression of the Tibetan community, including the lack of meaningful autonomy, the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas, and severe restrictions on Tibetans’ religious freedom and cultural traditions within China,” Pompeo said in a statement, referring to the People’s Republic of China.Destro is currently assistant secretary of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. According to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, the special coordinator post had been vacant since January 2017. The commission had urged the State Department to fill the job, saying the role was “crucial to raising the profile of religious freedom issues in Tibet and mobilizing government resources to address the issue.”China’s authority over Tibet has long been an irritant in US-China relations, with support for the region’s autonomy and its exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, often a bipartisan issue in Washington. The US in July imposed travel restrictions on Chinese officials determined to be “substantially involved” in restricting access to Tibet.Tibet and the neighboring region of Xinjiang have long endured intense social, security and religious controls, as China seeks to suppress what it calls terrorist and separatist elements. Last month, prominent researcher Adrian Zenz released a report alleging that China is instituting a mass labor system in Tibet similar to the one that has ensnared Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.In response to Zenz’s research and additional reporting on the subject by Reuters, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement to the news organization saying that forced labor “simply does not exist” in the country and that workers participated voluntarily and were properly compensated.“We hope the international community will distinguish right from wrong, respect facts, and not be fooled by lies,” according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-new-appointment-to-scrutinise-china-s-human-rights-violations-in-tibet/story-0VOTchIqbaurHGWwYnXuQP.html
15-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Donald Trump accuses China of spreading Covid-19 around world||Terming the Covid-19 outbreak as a ‘horrible situation’, President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) hit out at China for allowing Covid to spread outside Beijing while preventing the spread in its own country.“We came together and what happened was that we then got hit by the plague (Covid-19). We were really coming together and then we got hit by this horrible situation--it could have been stopped. China stopped it from going into the rest of China but they did not stop it from coming out and going to Europe, the United States and the rest of the world,” Trump said here at a rally organised for his re-election to the Presidency.He added, “We are now putting it together. We had it done and now we are doing it again and next year we will be stronger. This coming year will be even better.”The US president further hit out at the former Vice President and his Democratic counterpart Joe Biden for supporting China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), stating that it was a “catastrophe for our nation”.“Since the ChinaVirus, we have created a record of 11.4 million jobs. We have cut the unemployment rate by half. We are down to 7.8 per cent. Jobs have been recovering 23 times than the Obama-Biden recovery,” he said.“He supported NAFTA--a disaster, he supported China’s entry into the World Health Organisation-- a catastrophe for our nation. China tries to get away with the fact that they are a developing nation. Not anymore; if Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, China will own our country.”The US presidential elections are scheduled to be held on November 3, this year.

15-10-2020||World||China blames US for undermining peace and stability in Taiwan Strait||China said on Thursday the United States was seriously undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait after a US Navy destroyer sailed through the waters amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Zhang Chunhui, spokesman for China’s eastern theatre command, said in a statement that the Chinese military followed and monitored the USS Barry when the destroyer made what the US Navy called a “routine Taiwan Strait transit” on Wednesday. China considers Taiwan a wayward province that needs to be reunited with the mainland, by force if needed. The United States government, on the other hand, has stepped up support for the island recently to support what it considers an important democratic outpost. Beijing has accused Washington and Taipei of “collusion” towards the island declaring formal independence and recently ramped up air force activity near Taiwan in a show of force.The White House is pushing forward to sell to Taiwan sophisticated military equipment including MQ-9 drones and a coastal defensive missile system, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, fuelling further tensions in what is already an increasingly adversarial Sino-US relations. Zhang said the United States should stop its provocative words and actions in the Taiwan Strait, adding the Chinese military will resolutely defend the country’s territorial integrity and maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a separate statement that the USS Barry sailed in a northerly direction through the strait and that its forces also monitored the warship, adding that the situation was as normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-us-for-undermining-peace-and-stability-in-taiwan-strait/story-eyQM5KfTWuFpwpwjuruWUL.html

The proposals would see the restrictions kick in once an area records 35 new infections per 100,000 people over seven days. Previously, Germany had used a yardstick of 50 new infections per 100,000.In the UK, the opposition Labour and experts on Wednesday called for another lockdown following advice that the new three-tier alert system may not effectively suppress the recent surge in new Covid-19 cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson resisted the calls after Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded the second lockdown. The PM is facing criticism for ignoring advice from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies as early as September 21 for a short “circuit-breaker”. As the three-tier system came into effect in England on Wednesday, Northern Ireland announced a partial lockdown. Bars and restaurants will close across Spain’s northeastern Catalonia region for the next 15 days as the country tackles one of the highest rates of infection in the European Union, with nearly 900,000 infections and more than 33,000 deaths.Italy registered 7,332 new infections in 24 hours, its highest ever daily tally since the pandemic began, and steeply up from 5,901 on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Czech schools and bars were shut, while Dutch restaurants were closing.Meanwhile, Russia has granted regulatory approval to a second Covid-19 vaccine, President Vladimir Putin said.

15-10-2020||World||Communist Party of China consistently violates basic, fundamental human rights of the Chinese people, says Pompeo||The Communist Party of China (CPC) is in consistent violation of the most basic and fundamental human rights for its own people, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. The violation of human rights and curbing the freedom of its people are the core challenges that the US has identified from the CPC, he said. “They are in consistent violation of the most basic and fundamental human rights for their own people,” Pompeo told reporters at a news conference here. “This is what Communist parties have a history of doing. It’s what President (Donald) Trump has directed us all to work to try and preserve; as much freedom, as much dignity, for every citizen of China as we possibly can when they are confronted with these massive human rights violations that are being conducted by the Chinese Communist Party,” he said. That is true, whether it is Xinjiang, what is taking place there, whether it is Tibet; and the inner Mongolians’ simple desire to live in freedom and exercise their own understandings of what freedom and human dignity look like, he said. “In each of those places, and I’d add Hong Kong, in each of those places, we simply are demanding from the Chinese Communist Party what we ask of every nation, is to preserve basic freedom, human dignity, religious freedom for every one of their citizens. “We’ll work hard to do everything we can to build out a coalition all across the world that comes to understand how important that is alongside of us, and works to impose costs on the Chinese Communist Party when they act in ways that are inconsistent with those basic fundamental human freedoms,” said the top American diplomat. Pompeo noted that a day earlier, the State Department had publicly announced its policy requesting that think tanks, which accept money from foreign governments including China, publicly disclose that information. “We think it’s important and want the American people to know who’s influencing our think tanks so that they can better evaluate the work that they publish,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/communist-party-of-china-consistently-violates-basic-fundamental-human-rights-of-the-chinese-people-says-pompeo/story-G62QKQaWDokM3i1GU37V2O.html
15-10-2020||World||Pompeo calls inclusion of Russia, China on UNHRC a ‘win for tyrants’||The election of countries like China, Russia and Cuba on the Human Rights Council is a win for tyrants and embarrassment for the United Nations, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, China as well as Russia and Cuba won seats on the Human Rights Council, which is a win for tyrants and embarrassment for the United Nations, Pompeo told reporters at a news conference here. “It’s an example, an indication of why we were right to leave that body. When institutions are irredeemable as was demonstrated yesterday, the United States under President (Donald) Trump simply will not participate,” he said. In 2018, President Trump withdrew the US from the UN Human Rights Council due to its well-established pattern of anti-Israel bias and membership rules that allow the election of the world’s worst human rights abusers to the Council. Prior to making this decision, and after its exit, the United States urged the UN member states to take an immediate action to reform the Council before it became irreparable, Pompeo had said in a statement a day earlier. “Unfortunately, those calls went unheeded, and today the UN General Assembly once again elected countries with abhorrent human rights records, including China, Russia and Cuba. Venezuela was elected in 2019,” he said. These elections only further validate the US decision to withdraw and use other venues and opportunities to protect and promote universal human rights, he alleged. For example, in September, the US hosted a landmark side event during the UN General Assembly’s high-level week centered on the continuing significance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Last year, Trump hosted a landmark event on religious freedom, he said. Pompeo said that the US’ commitment to human rights consists of far more than just words. “Through the State Department’s action, we have punished human rights abusers in Xinjiang, Myanmar, Iran and elsewhere. Our commitments are spelled out clearly in the UN’s declaration, and in our record of action. The United States is a force for good in the world and will always be,” he said. Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley supported the US statement. The UN Human Rights Council just voted to let even more human rights abusers join its ranks, she tweeted. “The council voted in Communist China, Communist Cuba and Russia, joining Venezuela, Sudan and Libya. This further validates the US decision to leave the Human Rights Council in 2018,” Haley said. Commenting on China’s appointment to the UN Human Rights Council, the East Turkistan Government in Exile’s prime minister Salih Hudayar said, “China’s election as a member of the UN Human Rights Council is equal to the Nazis being elected. By voting for China, the UN General Assembly is only empowering China to continue its brutal campaign of colonisation and genocide in Occupied East Turkistan.” The Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) said that it is dismayed by the election of China to the UN Human Rights Council, and urges member states to take immediate steps to hold China accountable for ongoing and egregious abuses targeting Uyghurs. “Governments committing genocide shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the Human Rights Council,” said UHRP Executive director Omer Kanat. “It’s clear from the vote, however, that China has been losing the confidence of the international community over time,” Kanet added.

15-10-2020||World||TikTok looks forward to blocking second round of US restrictions||TikTok Inc. asked a federal judge to block a broad set of government restrictions designed to curb use of the Chinese-owned video-sharing app in the US, less than three weeks after the company succeeded in halting the Trump administration’s ban on new downloads.US District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington blocked the download ban on Sept. 27, ruling that the US likely exceeded its legal authority under the emergency powers statute it invoked to justify the prohibition. TikTok on Wednesday asked Nichols to issue an injunction against proposed rules forbidding companies from providing the underlying web services that make the app accessible in the USIf those prohibitions go into effect on Nov. 12, people who currently have TikTok installed on their phones would still be able to use it, but the app’s functionality would degrade over time.The US contends that TikTok is a national security threat because its ownership by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. gives the Chinese government access to the personal data of millions of Americans. President Donald Trump has demanded that ByteDance find an American buyer for TikTok, and the company is seeking US approval for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc.A lawyer for TikTok argued at a hearing last month that it “makes no sense” for the government to ban the app while ByteDance is still in talks for the deal the president sought.Last week, the Trump administration appealed Nichols’ ruling blocking the download ban to the US Court of Appeals in Washington. The court on Wednesday issued a briefing schedule for the appeals process: The government will submit an opening brief by Oct. 16, with TikTok required to respond by Nov. 6.The Court of Appeals case is TikTok v.

15-10-2020||World||Donald Trump heads to Iowa looking to galvanize his base, gain boost against Joe Biden||US President Donald Trump headed to Iowa on Wednesday seeking to make up ground against Democrat Joe Biden as part of a three-week sprint to Election Day on Nov. 3.Trump, a Republican who is trailing Biden in national and some key state opinion polls, will stage a rally at the Des Moines, Iowa, airport. Biden has a virtual fundraiser and plans to give pre-recorded remarks to a Muslim advocacy group. Trump’s Iowa stop is part of a barnstorming tour in states critical to deciding who will won the election.On Thursday he will be in North Carolina and Florida, on Friday he will campaign in Florida and Georgia and on Saturday he will speak in Michigan and Wisconsin. He is expected to spend Saturday night in Las Vegas, Nevada, and then launch into a western swing.Trump on Wednesday pulled into a statistical tie with Biden in Florida, a key battleground, at 47% vs 49% with a credibility interval of four points, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed though Biden’s lead widened in Arizona and he had a 10 percentage point advantage nationally among likely voters.On Thursday, Trump and Biden, who had been due to hold a second presidential debate, will instead take part in dueling televised town halls. NBC News said Trump’s event in Miami would take place outdoors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Biden’s ABC News event will take place in Philadelphia.That Trump, who battled the virus earlier this month, is traveling to Iowa so close to Election Day suggests his campaign is concerned about voter support there for his re-election. Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state by almost 10 percentage points in 2016, but opinion polls have shown Iowa to be competitive.More than 13 million Americans have cast ballots, setting a record early pace, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida. Many seek to avoid the large crowds expected on Election Day.In the last presidential election, some 1.4 million Americans had cast early votes as of Oct. 16, 2016.About two dozen people showed up more than two hours before polls opened in Memphis, Tennessee, to claim spots in line, local media reported, as voting opened in Kansas, Rhode Island and Tennessee.In Georgia, where long lines snaked out of polling places and down sidewalks on the first two days of early voting this week, Gwinnett County election officials reported waits of up to three hours to cast early ballots on Wednesday.A US District Court judge extended voter registration in Virginia through Thursday after a severed cable line caused the state’s website to crash on Tuesday, the final scheduled day of registration.Biden widens lead Trump looks to be spending much of the week aiming to galvanize his white, conservative base rather than seeking to appeal directly to undecided voters, many of whom live in the country’s suburbs.On Thursday, he heads to Greenville in rural North Carolina, a closely fought state where early voting will begin that day, then on to rural Georgia and central Florida the next day.Reuters/Ipsos polling released this week showed Biden widening his lead in the key states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – states Trump won in 2016.Iowa has experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases, with hospitalizations at an all-time high. Republican Governor Kim Reynolds has resisted any statewide containment measures such as a mandate to wear masks and urged Trump supporters on social media to turn out en masse for the president.Trump’s bout with coronavirus has put the focus of the campaign’s closing stretch squarely on his response to the pandemic, with Biden repeatedly criticizing Trump’s handling of a virus that has infected more than 7.8 million people in the United States, killed more than 214,000 and put millions out of work.In Florida on Tuesday, Biden told seniors at a community center that Trump had recklessly dismissed the threat that the virus had posed to their at-risk population.“To Donald Trump, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable,” Biden said.Trump has touted his handling of the crisis.The Trump campaign said it would conduct temperature checks and hand out masks at his rallies but not require attendees to wear them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-heads-to-iowa-looking-to-galvanize-his-base-gain-boost-against-joe-biden/story-AJ1NREMHyqxzUyAEUYSMsJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Trump infuriated at Twitter, Facebook restrictions over article linking Bidens to Ukrainian energy company||President Donald Trump and his political allies reacted with fury after Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. on Wednesday restricted a New York Post article linking Joe Biden and his son Hunter to a Ukrainian energy company that figured in the impeachment investigation of Trump.Facebook said it would reduce distribution of the article, seeking to slow the pace of its spread before the social network’s fact-checkers have a chance to evaluate its authenticity.Twitter inserted a warning to people who clicked on the article. The company later said it took action to block links to the story because some of the article’s images contained material that violated Twitter’s rules about sharing personal information and hacked materials.“So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of ‘Smoking Gun’ emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost,” Trump wrote on Twitter as he headed to a rally in Iowa. “There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician. REPEAL SECTION 230!!!”The president was referring to part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that protects technology companies from being sued over users’ content on their platforms.Trump used the article in an extended attack on the Bidens at the rally in Des Moines.Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, accused the companies of “censorship” and his office said in a statement that he had written letters to Facebook’s Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, charging that they were trying to influence the presidential election.Another Republican, Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has emerged as a prominent critic of US technology giants and their influence since his arrival in Washington last year, tweeted: “Next week when the full Senate returns we should VOTE on my bill allowing Americans to sue #BigTech for censorship & unfair treatment.”Neither Facebook nor Twitter immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump’s tweet and Cruz’s letters.Facebook has warned that the US’s foreign adversaries, including Russia, may seek to trick journalists into amplifying hacked or inaccurate content they want to spread ahead of an election. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, issued this warning again Wednesday on Twitter, “given this morning’s news cycle.” He did not directly say whether this was why Facebook took action on the New York Post content.According to the Post, emails that the newspaper said were from Hunter Biden show he introduced his father, then the vice president, to Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of the energy company, Burisma. The younger Biden served on the board.The paper claimed that the communication contradicts an assertion by Joe Biden that he hadn’t spoken to his son about his business dealings. A purported email from April 17, 2015, shows the Ukrainian energy executive thanking Hunter for the introduction. Bloomberg News hasn’t independently verified the authenticity of the purported emails.Yet the Post offered no proof that the meeting took place, or that the Bidens discussed the matter.The Post’s story said the emails came from data recovered from a laptop and hard drive left at a repair shop in Delaware in April 2019.The Post reported that it had obtained the emails from Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, whose attempts to obtain disparaging information on the Bidens from Ukrainian officials last year contributed to Trump’s impeachment by the US House. Trump was acquitted early this year at a Senate trial.Trump claims that Joe Biden’s actions in Ukraine, in which he pushed for the dismissal of the country’s prosecutor general, were to benefit Hunter Biden and Burisma.That accusation has been widely debunked. In pushing for the firing of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, Biden was acting in concert with official US foreign policy and other allied nations that viewed Shokin as corrupt.A Ukrainian investigation into Burisma had long been dormant by the time Joe Biden was pushing for Shokin’s ouster in early 2016, a former Ukrainian official told Bloomberg News in May 2019.And in September, the Treasury Department sanctioned one of the Ukrainians that Giuliani met with, Andrii Derkach, calling him a Russian agent who is trying to interfere in the 2020 election.The Biden campaign said Wednesday that the former vice president did not meet with the Burisma executive.“We have reviewed Joe Biden’s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,” campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.The Post report said that Pozharskyi thanked Hunter Biden in the April 2015 email for inviting him to Washington and “giving an opportunity to meet your father.” Hunter had joined the company’s board about a year earlier, according to the Post.The salvos fired at Twitter and Facebook by Trump and the others are part of a larger conflict over the power of technology giants and a growing willingness by the administration and lawmakers of both parties to bring them to heel. Conservatives will likely argue that the restrictions imposed by Facebook and Twitter amount to fresh evidence for a longstanding complaint: That social media platforms silence their views.On Wednesday evening, Trump said that Twitter had locked the personal account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany after she tweeted about the Post article.Not long afterward, McEnany commented on her White House account: “Censorship should be condemned!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-infuriated-at-twitter-facebook-restrictions-over-article-linking-bidens-to-ukrainian-energy-company/story-YBNa3TVvknBn0RzyTYIlSO.html
15-10-2020||World||‘Long Covid’ may affect multiple parts of body and mind, say doctors||Ongoing illness after infection with Covid-19, sometimes called “long Covid”, may not be one syndrome but possibly up to four causing a rollercoaster of symptoms affecting all parts of the body and mind, doctors said on Thursday.In an initial report about long-term Covid-19, Britain’s National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) said one common theme among ongoing Covid patients - some of whom are seven months or more into their illness - is that symptoms appear in one physiological area, such as the heart or lungs, only to abate and then arise again in a different area.“This review highlights the detrimental physical and psychological impact that ongoing COVID is having on many people’s lives,” said Dr Elaine Maxwell, who led the report.Many thousands of people worldwide have linked up on social media platforms and online forums to share their experiences of ongoing Covid-19 symptoms. Some call themselves “long haulers” while others have named their condition “long Covid”.According to UK-based patient group LongCovidSOS, data from a King’s College London-devised symptom tracker app shows that 10% of Covid-19 patients remain unwell after three weeks, and up to 5% may continue to be sick for months.Maxwell, who presented the findings of the “Living with Covid” report in an online media briefing, said health services are already struggling “to manage these new and fluctuating patterns of symptoms and problems”.She and her co-authors urged patients and doctors to log and track symptoms so that health researchers can learn more about the condition and how to ease it as swiftly as possible.“Despite the uncertainties, people need help now,” she said. “We need to collect more data.”For this initial report, Maxwell’s team held a focus group with 14 members of a Facebook group called Long Covid.Their testimony suggested ongoing Covid can be cyclical, Maxwell said, with symptoms fluctuating in severity and moving around the body including around the respiratory system, the brain, cardiovascular system and heart, the kidneys, the gut, the liver and the skin.“There are powerful stories that ongoing COVID symptoms are experienced by people of all ages, and people from all backgrounds,” the report said.Maxwell said an urgent priority is to establish a working diagnosis recognised by healthcare services, employers and government agencies to help patients get support.“While this is a new disease and we are learning more about its impact..., services will need to be better equipped to support people with ongoing COVID, as emerging evidence is showing there are significant psychological and social impacts that will have long term consequences,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-covid-may-affect-multiple-parts-of-body-and-mind-doctors-say/story-Upcf9zbGTsX6HYro4DTQVJ.html

The nation pulled in more than $30 billion of investor bids, which includes $10.8 billion of joint lead-manager interest.The country’s ministry of finance raised about $6 billion via the new deal. The shorter-dated bonds have lower premiums than during the final price guidance marketing phase of the nation’s last dollar bond sale in 2019.The ministry of finance opened up its bond sale to a broad pool of US investors for the first time, potentially diversifying its investor base and setting aside concerns of decoupling in credit markets.The deal includes China’s debut issuance of 144A notes, as well as previously sold Regulation S senior bonds, allowing participation from a wider range of potential international investors compared to last year’s jumbo global offering of $6 billion dollar bonds and 4 billion euro notes ($4.7 billion).“144A issuance shows that China is keen to promote its USD bonds globally, including to U.S. investors,” according to Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “China has taken a pragmatic approach to deepen and liberalize its financial markets, and this is likely to continue with or without political tensions with the U.S.”Officials at the ministry weren’t available to comment.The fresh sovereign debt sale this week comes as uncertainties ahead of the U.S. elections in November are beginning to weigh on investor sentiment. Issuing the notes in October helps avoid potentially less receptive market conditions, according to analysts.China’s business-as-usual approach contrasts with rising concern about a decoupling between the world’s two largest economies. The ministry of finance said during its 2017 resumption of dollar-debt sales that it would help build a benchmark yield curve for Chinese issuers, which range from developers to local governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-targets-us-buyers-with-6-billion-dollar-debt-sale/story-6enWKh9tvgx7qE5gF5BKJI.html
15-10-2020||World||Trump’s court pick Barrett calls presidential self-pardon an ‘open question’||President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, said on Wednesday it was an “open question” whether Trump could pardon himself and added that the top US judicial body “can’t control” whether a president obeys its decisions.She also sought to allay Democratic fears that she would be an automatic vote to strike down the Obamacare healthcare law in a case due to be argued Nov. 10, promising an “open mind.”Barrett wrapped up about eight hours of questioning on the third day of her four-day Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. The committee will hear on Thursday from witnesses both for and against her confirmation, but Barrett herself will not be present.Trump has said he has the “absolute power” to pardon himself, part of his executive clemency authority. Asked by Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy whether a president could pardon himself for a crime, Barrett said the “question has never been litigated.”“That question may or may not arise but it’s one that calls for legal analysis of what the scope of the pardon power is. So because it would be opining on an open question when I haven’t gone through the judicial process to decide it, it’s not one on which I can offer a view,” Barrett added. Trump also has issued executive clemency to political allies and friends.Barrett, a conservative federal appellate judge, is Trump’s third selection for a lifetime Supreme Court post. Trump has asked the Senate, controlled by his fellow Republicans, to confirm Barrett before the Nov. 3 US election.While saying that “no one is above the law,” Barrett twice declined to answer directly when Leahy asked whether a president who refuses to comply with a court order is a threat to the US constitutional system of checks and balances within the three branches of government.“The Supreme Court can’t control whether or not the president obeys,” Barrett said.Supreme Court rulings, Barrett said, have the “force of law,” but the court lacks enforcement power and relies on the other branches of government.“A court can pronounce the law and issue a judgment but it lacks control over how the political branches respond to it,” Barrett added.Barrett declined to discuss whether Trump was violating the US Constitution’s “emoluments” clause with his business dealings. The provision bar presidents from taking gifts or payments from foreign and state governments without congressional approval. “I don’t know if I would characterize it as an anti-corruption clause,” Barrett said, disagreeing with Leahy, adding that it was designed to “prevent foreign countries from having influence.”Obamacare case Barrett could be on the high court for arguments in a challenge by Trump and Republican-led states to the 2010 law formally called the Affordable Care Act that has helped millions of Americans obtain medical coverage and includes protections for people with pre-existing conditions.Responding to Democratic suggestions that she would vote to strike down Obamacare in its entirety if one part is deemed unlawful, Barrett said if a statute can be saved, it is a judge’s duty to do so. Barrett added that she would approach any ACA case “with an open mind.”Barrett has criticized previous Supreme Court rulings upholding Obamacare. Senator Kamala Harris, who is Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s running mate, said that the proceedings “lack legitimacy in the eyes of the people of our country” because they want the winner of the election to decide who fills the court’s vacancy. “Americans right now are suffering from a deadly pandemic and we are also suffering from a historic economic crisis,” Harris said. “The Senate should be working day and night to provide economic relief to families and not rushing a Supreme Court confirmation.”Barrett, 48, would be the fifth woman ever to serve on the court. As a devout Roman Catholic, Barrett personally opposes abortion.“This is history being made folks,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the panel. “This is the first time in American history that we’ve nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology, and she’s going to the court.”Barrett would not say if the landmark 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut ruling that protects the right of married couples to use contraceptives without government restrictions was properly decided, but said it was “very unlikely” to be imperiled. Some conservatives including Barrett’s mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, have criticized the ruling, which recognized a constitutional right to privacy and paved the way for the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide as well as decisions recognizing LGBT rights.Democratic Senator Cory Booker raised concerns to Barrett about racial issues, noting that Black Americans are disproportionately affected in criminal sentencing and restrictions on voting access.“In my private life, I abhor racial discrimination and obviously for both personal reasons and professional reasons I want to ensure that there’s equal justice for all,” added Barrett, who has two Black adopted children from Haiti among her seven children.Barrett’s confirmation would give the court a 6-3 conservative majority. Republicans have a 53-47 Senate majority, making Barrett’s confirmation a virtual certainty.Republicans are preparing for a committee vote next week and a final Senate confirmation vote before the end of October. Trump nominated Barrett on Sept. 26 to replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-court-pick-amy-coney-barrett-calls-presidential-self-pardon-an-open-question/story-QFr92q6yd5N82WJguCVIFL.html
15-10-2020||World||US book stores launch ‘Boxed Out’ campaign against Amazon||The American Booksellers Association has launched an advertising campaign against Amazon to alert the public to what it calls the growing danger that book stores are under from the online goliath during the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign, the first of its kind, was sparked by Amazon’s “Prime Day” on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which Amazon offers bargains on products.Since the pandemic began, 35 book stores belonging to the ABA have had to shut their doors for good, the association told AFP, adding that some 20 percent of independent bookstores are under threat of closure. “When these independent bookstores close Covid will be listed as the cause of death, but the pre-existing condition for many may be listed as Amazon,” the association said in a statement.Dubbed “Boxed Out,” the campaign plays on the delivery boxes that have become the hallmark of Amazon home deliveries.For Allison K. Hill, the director general of the ABA, the rise of the online commercial giant represents “the loss of local jobs and local tax dollars; the loss of community centers; and the loss of opportunities for readers to discover books and connect with other readers in a meaningful face-to-face way.”According to the ABA, in 2019, 104 bookshops opened during the year. Only 30 have opened in 2020.The ABA campaign was launched on social media but also in bookshops themselves, of which 1,750 are ABA members.Some, like Solid State Books, in Washington, have covered their front windows with a giant brown cardboard, reminiscent of the Amazon delivery boxes.“Buy books from people who want to sell books, not colonize the Moon,” said the logo on the cardboard, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ space travel side-project, Blue Origins.Another caustic message read, “If you want Amazon to be the world’s only retailer, keep shopping there.”Turnover from sales from bricks-and-mortar bookstores was down 31 percent in the first seven months of 2020, according to the census office. At the same time, in the third quarter of 2020 online sales were 16.1 percent of all retail sales, a record and up by a third from the first quarter, the same source said.tu/la/jh/dwAMAZON.COM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-book-stores-launch-boxed-out-campaign-against-amazon/story-AJp7NDD3CxTPcleOmbbmYJ.html
15-10-2020||World||Paris goes under curfew as Europe ramps up Covid-19 restrictions||France on Wednesday became the latest European country to toughen anti-coronavirus measures, imposing a curfew in Paris and eight other cities from Saturday, while Germany and Ireland also ramped up restrictions. “We have to act. We need to put a brake on the spread of the virus,” President Emmanuel Macron told public television, announcing a shutdown between 9:00 pm and 6:00 am that will remain in force for as long as six weeks.Other major French cities such as Lyon, Mediterranean port Marseille and southwestern Toulouse will similarly impose curfews, with around 20 million people affected in all, out of a total population of some 67 million.Just minutes before Macron’s announcement, his government had said it would prolong a state of health emergency.With over one million coronavirus deaths and nearly 40 million cases worldwide, regions like Europe that suppressed the first outbreak are again facing tough choices on how to control a new wave without the economic devastation wrought by nationwide lockdowns.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced tougher measures on gatherings and mask-wearing. “I am convinced that what we do now will be decisive for how we come through this pandemic,” the leader said. New infections in Germany continued to rise Wednesday, pushing past 5,000 cases in 24 hours -- a level not seen since a lockdown imposed on Europe’s biggest economy in the spring.“We’re in a situation where I think we can still flatten the exponential growth,” Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s disease control agency said. “But for that we all need to make an effort.”Worsening situationIn Spain, bars and restaurants will close across the northeastern region of Catalonia for the next 15 days as the country tackles one of the highest rates of infection in the European Union, with nearly 900,000 cases and more than 33,000 deaths.Measures also came into force across the Netherlands, including restrictions on alcohol sales and new mask requirements, while Northern Ireland announced a four-week closure of pubs and restaurants. Ireland’s prime minister Micheal Martin announced a raft of new curbs along the border with the British province of Northern Ireland, including the closure of non-essential retail outlets, gyms, pools and leisure centres.Earlier on Wednesday Northern Ireland’s devolved government announced plans to shut pubs and restaurants for four weeks, tighten restrictions on social gatherings and extend the mid-term school break to counter soaring case numbers there.Infection rates “must be turned down now or we will be in a very difficult place very soon indeed,” First Minister Arlene Foster told lawmakers in the Northern Ireland Assembly.Lockdown ‘disaster’British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also under increasing pressure to impose more stringent measures to cut spiralling rates in England, including a two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown.Johnson said a new UK-wide lockdown would be a “disaster” but refused to rule it out as the government’s science advisory committee endorsed a temporary shutdown.And in Italy, authorities recorded 7,332 new cases on Wednesday -- the highest daily count the hard-hit country has yet seen.Rome has already imposed new, tougher rules to control the virus’ resurgence, including an end to parties, amateur football matches and snacking at bars at night.Beyond Europe, Iran on Wednesday announced new travel restrictions affecting the capital Tehran and four other major cities, as well as new single-day records in both Covid-19 deaths and new infections.And neighbouring Iraq’s death toll since the start of the pandemic passed 10,000 people.At least 1,089,039 people worldwide have died of the coronavirus since it emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late in 2019, according to an AFP tally using official figures. At least 38.3 million cases have been recorded around the world.Also Read: Pressure on UK PM Johnson to impose second national lockdownIn online talks, G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to extend a moratorium on debt repayments by the world’s poorest countries for a further six months and trailed another prolongation in spring.The virtual talks, hosted by current G20 president Saudi Arabia, came a day after the International Monetary Fund warned that global GDP would contract 4.4 percent in 2020 and the damage inflicted by the pandemic would be felt for years.Drug setbacksAs Europe imposed new restrictions, hopes for vaccines or treatment to provide relief suffered a blow with the suspension of two clinical trials in the United States.US pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly said it had suspended the Phase 3 trial of its antibody treatment over an unspecified incident, the second in less than 24 hours after Johnson & Johnson ran into a similar problem with its vaccine candidate.Despite the setbacks, which health experts say is normal as testing scales up massively in its later stages, the World Bank approved $12 billion for developing countries to finance the purchase and distribution of vaccines, tests and treatment.Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow had registered a second vaccine dubbed “EpiVacCorona”, developed by a top-secret Siberian laboratory, to follow its first “Sputnik” jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-goes-under-curfew-as-europe-ramps-up-covid-19-restrictions/story-qefEMaJQb5S2dIrOyjP76K.html
15-10-2020||World||Top Russian diplomat skeptical about nuclear pact extension with US||Russia’s top diplomat voiced doubt Wednesday that Moscow and Washington could negotiate an extension of their last arms control pact still standing, even as the United States offered a more optimistic view.Speaking in an interview with several Russian news outlets, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia can’t accept the conditions put forward by the United States for the extension of the New START treaty.“I personally don’t see the prospect,” Lavrov snapped when asked if the extension is possible before the pact expires in February. “We will never say that we will shut the door and cut all contacts. But we explain that it’s impossible to talk on the basis of an ultimatum they put forward that fully ignores the principles which were acknowledged as the basis for all our agreements for decades.”Lavrov’s pessimistic view contrasted with the statements from US diplomats, who said that Moscow and Washington were close to a deal.“We would welcome the opportunity to complete an agreement based on understandings that were achieved over the last couple weeks about what the range of possibilities look like for an extension of New START and an outcome that benefits the entire world, increased stability of the most dangerous weapons in the world,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday.Pompeo said that “I am hopeful that the Russians will find a way to agree to an outcome that, frankly, I think is in their best interest and in our best interest,” voicing hope that China will eventually join the talks too.A person familiar with the talks told The Associated Press Friday that US and Russian negotiators have agreed in principle to continue freezing their nuclear warhead stockpiles in a bid to salvage the New START. The person, who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it’s not yet clear if the agreement for a freeze will succeed or translate into an extension of the pact.If it works, the person said an agreement could be announced before the Nov. 3 presidential election with an eye toward extending the accord and eventually bringing China into it, a longtime demand by President Donald Trump’s administration.The New START treaty was signed in 2010 by US President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.After both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, the New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries.Russia has offered its extension without any conditions, while the Trump administration has pushed for a new arms control agreement that would also include China. Moscow has described that idea as unfeasible, pointing at Beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its much smaller nuclear arsenal.Lavrov specified Wednesday that Russia can’t accept the US proposal to limit battlefield nuclear weapons alongside nuclear warheads that arm strategic missiles and bombers until the US agrees to withdraw its tactical nuclear weapons from Europe.He also noted that Moscow wouldn’t agree to the US demand to have intrusive verification measures like those that existed in the 1990s when inspectors were positioned at missile factories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-russian-diplomat-skeptical-about-nuclear-pact-extension-with-us/story-PSMvm9LeywqWPvLteO3KcN.html
15-10-2020||World||First Lady Melania Trump says son Barron had Covid but is negative now||President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron, tested positive for coronavirus while his parents recovered from Covid-19 but never showed symptoms of the disease, his mother said.First Lady Melania Trump said in a post on the White House website on Wednesday that Barron Trump, 14, initially tested negative after his parents both contracted the virus.“I couldn’t help but think ‘what about tomorrow or the next day?,” she wrote. “My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms.”She added: “He has since tested negative.” She didn’t say precisely when Barron Trump was tested for infection.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House on Wednesday, the president said: “Barron’s fine.”The president announced that he and his wife had contracted Covid-19 on Oct. 2, and he was hospitalized later that day. Melania Trump never required hospital care.“I am happy to report that I have tested negative and hope to resume my duties as soon as I can,” she said in her post. “Along with this good news, I want people to know that I understand just how fortunate my family is to have received the kind of care that we did.”The White House physician, Sean Conley, cleared the president to resume his normal activities on Saturday and he returned to the campaign trail on Monday with a rally in Florida. He rallied Tuesday in Pennsylvania and will visit Iowa on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-lady-melania-trump-says-son-barron-had-covid-but-is-negative-now/story-xz0dHoZd2WVbgl0woHh2VM.html

She is also chair of the Sikh Police Association.During her 24-year career, the police said she has worked in 18 different areas of policing – including neighbourhood policing, youth offending, operational planning, intelligence gathering and counter terrorism. She is also a trained hostage and crisis negotiator.Until July 2019 she had spent more than two years as the Commander of the City Neighbourhood Policing Area before taking up roles working with partners to help tackle and prevent serious violent crime. The QPM will be handed over later in the coming months.Atwal’s force said she has been highlighted as an “exemplary advocate for those under-represented in policing,” providing coaching and mentoring to a number of officers through promotion and personal development programmes.She said after she was named in the royal honours list: “It is such an honour and I feel truly grateful to have even been nominated, especially when I think of all the amazing people who deserve recognition for the incredible work they do”.“It sounds like a cliché but policing was something I’d always wanted to do from a young age growing up in Derbyshire. I’d seen a female Asian officer working in the city centre and I thought ‘I’d like to do that’.”Chief constable of the force Simon Cole added: “Manjit has led the way on so many policing issues and has been instrumental in working with local communities, especially through our Sikh Police Association. She really is a role model to so many colleagues across the force”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truly-inspiring-uk-cop-manjit-atwal-gets-royal-honour/story-jeFNzZ49A0lG2vbXQn1q3K.html
