Prior to that proclamation, the government tried for more than a year to revoke the exemption, only to get repeatedly thwarted by the trade court.Court of International Trade Judge Gary Katzmann issued a temporary restraining order that effectively prevents the tariff exemption from being removed for two weeks, unless the court takes other action during that time.A spokesman for the US Trade Representative didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.In early 2018, Trump approved four years of tariffs on solar panel imports, starting at 30% and to be reduced by 5 percentage points in each subsequent year. The tariffs were part of a campaign promise to get tough on China, which dominates solar-panel manufacturing, and to boost the US industry.But his administration surprised many in the sector when it granted an exclusion for bifacial panels in 2019. While bifacial was considered a niche product, the tariffs had encouraged some new solar manufacturing in the US, and duty-free module imports exempt from those duties posed a threat.In the October proclamation, Trump said it was necessary to revoke the bifacial exemption because the loophole has “impaired and is likely to continue to impair the effectiveness” of the tariffs intended to bolster US solar manufacturing.That’s why he also said it was necessary to set tariffs on most imported solar cells and modules at 18% starting in February, instead of reducing them to 15% from 20% as originally planned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-thwarted-in-latest-bid-to-kill-solar-tariff-loophole/story-BIRsniCxWMdP14ipPtgoyK.html
24-10-2020||World||Thai protesters’ deadline passes, but PM Prayuth Chan-ocha says he won’t quit||Thailand’s government and the country’s pro-democracy movement appeared no closer to resolving their differences Saturday, as the protesters’ deadline for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to step down came and went with no new action from either side, and no backing down.After the 10 p.m. deadline passed, protesters called another rally for central Bangkok on Sunday, at a major intersection in the capital’s main shopping district where they have gathered before.Prayuth told supporters Saturday evening as he left a Buddhist temple where a prayer session was held for national peace and prosperity that he would not quit.“The government is sincere in solving the problem and committed to following the law in doing so,” he told reporters.Prayuth’s office had issued a statement earlier in the day repeating his plea to resolve differences through Parliament, which will discuss the political situation in a special session starting Monday.“Although the ongoing political situation comprises many opposing views among different groups, we should rather take this as an opportunity for Thais to consult each other on what is best for the nation,” the statement said.Prayuth this past week issued a call to allow Parliament to seek a solution to the crisis and, in a gesture to appease the protesters, revoked a state of emergency for Bangkok he had imposed a week earlier that made protest rallies illegal.“If all parties are committed to exercise full restraint and flexibility, the circumstances would be more conducive to de-escalating the current tense political conflict and reaching an outcome that is acceptable to all stakeholders,” said Saturday’s statement, quoting government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri.The protesters, however, said they would stick to their deadline for Prayuth to meet their demands that he resign and that their arrested comrades be released from jail. They have shown no enthusiasm for leaving matters in the hands of Parliament.On Saturday morning, one of the protest leaders, Jatupat “Pai Dao Din” Boonpattararaksa, had told a crowd outside Bangkok Remand Prison that protesters should gather there and consider their next step as they waited for a response from Prayuth.Protesters rallied outside the prison on Friday to press for their comrades’ release. They welcomed the release of Jatupat, who called for seven others still imprisoned to be freed.However, three prominent protest leaders were denied release on bail Saturday morning.In addition to calling for Prayuth’s resignation, the protesters’ core demands include a more democratic constitution and reforms to the monarchy.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as then-army commander led a 2014 coup, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters also say that a constitution written and passed under military rule is undemocratic.The implicit criticism of the monarchy, which protesters believe wields too much power, has irked conservative Thais because it traditionally has been treated as sacrosanct and a pillar of national identity.There is concern that the situation may become more volatile, because in the past week there has been a mobilization of forces who claim to be defenders of the monarchy.Royalists held rallies in several cities, in many cases led by local civil servants. On Wednesday, a small counter-protest in Bangkok turned violent when a few attendees attacked anti-government student activists.King Maha Vajiralongkorn made a rare appearance Friday night as he and Queen Suthida and other members of the royal family walked through a crowd of ardent royalists who had gathered on a street to cheer him as he passed by.The king, in an unusually informal manner, was seen on a widely circulated video giving thanks to an onlooker who earlier in the week had held up a sign supporting the monarchy in the midst of anti-government supporters. The video showed the queen pointing out the man to the king.Vajiralongkorn also spoke briefly with Suwit Thongprasert, a royalist activist who had been part of a group whose violent protests in 2014 put pressure on an elected government that helped trigger the coup led by Prayuth. Suwit was a Buddhist monk known as Buddha Issara when he was a leader of the right-wing People’s Democratic Reform Committee during the 2014 protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-deadline-passes-but-pm-prayuth-chan-ocha-says-he-won-t-quit/story-1x4ZuAaXIYtlt2G5KbaXEJ.html

Jan is known for criticism of Pakistan’s military and security agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-pakistani-tv-reporter-is-found-after-72-hours/story-rCn9TOROvZghJfUoxeEtqO.html
24-10-2020||World||IS group claims responsibility for deadly Afghan suicide attack that killed 18 people||A suicide bomber struck near an education centre in the Afghan capital Kabul on Saturday, killing at least 18 people in an attack claimed by the extremist Islamic State that rocked the conflict-wracked country.Violence on the ground has spiked in recent weeks despite the Taliban and the Afghan government holding peace talks in Qatar to end the country’s grinding war.The suicide attack, which also left 57 wounded, happened in the late afternoon at the centre in a western district of Kabul, which offers training and higher education courses.“A suicide bomber wanted to enter the education centre,” interior ministry spokesman Tareq Arian said in a statement.“But he was identified by the centre’s guards, after which he detonated his explosives in an alley.”He confirmed the attack had killed 18 people and wounded 57.The extremist Islamic State group subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack.A suicide bomber “set off towards a gathering... in Kabul, where he detonated his explosives jacket” in the crowd, IS said in a statement posted on its social media channels.Witness Ali Reza said the blast sent dust and smoke swirling all around him.“I was standing about 100 metres from the centre when a big blast knocked me down,” said Reza, who had gone to hospital with his cousin, who was wounded in the blast.“Dust and smoke were all around me. All those killed and wounded were students who wanted to enter the centre.”Residents later gathered at the site where pools of dried blood could be seen where the bomber had detonated his explosives-laden vest.Residents in several districts of western Kabul belong to the minority Shiite Hazara community, and are often targeted by Sunni extremists of IS.- ‘World must take notice’ -In the past, extremists have targeted several education centres and other facilities in the area.In May, a group of gunmen launched a brazen daylight attack on a hospital in west Kabul that left several mothers dead. The gunmen were shot dead after hours of fighting with security forces.Washington blamed IS for that attack.Saturday’s suicide attack came hours after a roadside bomb tore through a bus east of the capital, killing nine civilians. Officials blamed that explosion on the Taliban.On Friday, rights group Amnesty International said at least 50 people had been killed in attacks in the preceding week, accusing both the Taliban and the government of failing to protect civilians.“The world must sit up and take notice. Afghan civilians are being slaughtered on a daily basis,” said Omar Waraich, Amnesty’s head of South Asia.“The international community must make the protection of civilians a core demand for their ongoing support of the peace process.”Despite holding peace talks with government negotiators in Doha since last month, the Taliban have only increased violence, in a bid to wield leverage at the bargaining table.The top US envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said earlier this week that fighting was threatening the peace process.US influence over Afghanistan’s battlegrounds is on the wane, however, with the Pentagon looking to withdraw all its remaining troops by next May.The Taliban have been quick to exploit the apparent lack of resolve, and began to push for fresh military gains as soon as they signed a withdrawal deal with the US in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-group-claims-responsibility-for-deadly-afghan-suicide-bombing-that-killed-18-people/story-jWB8nGl3N183MoCwv9UGuK.html
24-10-2020||World||18 killed, 57 injured in suicide bombing in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul||The death toll from the suicide attack on Saturday in Afghanistan’s capital has risen to at least 18 killed and 57 people wounded, including schoolchildren, the interior ministry said.The explosion struck outside an education centre in a heavily Shiite neighbourhood of western Kabul, Dasht-e-Barchi.The interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian says that the attacker was trying to enter the centre when he was stopped by security guards.According to Arian, the casualty toll may rise further as family members of victims of the suicide bombing are still searching the several different hospitals where the wounded have been taken.No group claimed immediate responsibility for the bombing. The Taliban rejected any connection with the attack.An Islamic State affiliate claimed responsibility for a similar suicide attack at an education centre in August 2018, in which 34 students were killed. Within Afghanistan, IS has launched large-scale attacks on minority Shiites, Sikhs and Hindus, whom it views as apostates.Hundreds of Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan fled the country in September after a gunman loyal to the militant group killed 25 members of the shrinking community in an attack on their share a place of worship in Kabul.The US signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February, opening up a path toward withdrawing American troops from the conflict. US officials said the deal would also help refocus security efforts on fighting the Islamic State, which is a rival of the Taliban in Afghanistan.There has been an upsurge in violence between Taliban and Afghan forces in the country recently, even as representatives from the two warring sides begin their own peace talks in Doha to end the decades-long war in Afghanistan.Earlier Saturday a roadside bomb killed nine people in eastern Afghanistan after it struck a minivan full of civilians, a local official said.Ghazni province police spokesman Ahmad Khan Sirat said that a second roadside bomb killed two policemen, after it struck their vehicle that was making its way to the victims of the first explosion.Sirat added that the bombings had wounded several others, and that the attacks were under investigation.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. The provincial police spokesman claimed the Taliban had placed the bomb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/18-killed-including-children-in-suicide-bombing-in-afghanistan-capital-kabul/story-DII12Gmhiq6ghRCVrNe6XI.html
24-10-2020||World||Poland’s president has coronavirus, apologizes to contacts||Polish President Andrzej Duda says he feels well despite testing positive for the coronavirus, and he apologized Saturday to everyone who must quarantine because they had contact with him.Duda, 48, said in a recording published on Twitter that he was experiencing no Covid-19 symptoms “but unfortunately, the test result is absolutely unambiguous.”“I would like to apologize to all those who are exposed to quarantine procedures because of meeting me in recent days,” he said. “If I had had any symptoms of coronavirus, please believe me, all meetings would have been canceled.”Duda’s diagnosis comes amid a huge surge in confirmed new cases of Covid-19 and virus-related deaths in Poland, a nation of 38 million that saw very low infection rates in the spring.The president’s key constitutional roles include guiding foreign policy and signing legislation. But many of his duties are ceremonial, and most of the responsibility for running the country lies with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki’s government.Poland on Saturday reported 13,628 new confirmed cases and a record daily number of Covid-19 deaths, 179. The daily case count was the nation’s second-highest of the pandemic after a record number set Friday.Social tensions are also growing in the country.Police used pepper spray Saturday on protesters angry over new virus restrictions, a group that includes entrepreneurs, far-right politicians, football fans, virus deniers and vaccine opponents. The protesters, many wearing no protective masks, violated a limit on public gatherings.Police said some protesters threw bottes and other objects at them, and that they were forced to respond.At the same time, people took to the streets in Warsaw and other cities for a third day to protest a Polish court ruling that declared abortions of fetuses with congenital defects unconstitutional. The decision further restricted what was already one of Europe’s strictest abortion laws.Critics accuse Poland’s right-wing ruling party of using the cover of the pandemic and a constitutional court it has filled with loyalists to impede abortion access in a legally dubious manner. They also accuse the Law and Justice party of seeking to exacerbate social conflicts to distract attention from soaring Covid-19 infection rates.The fast spread of the virus is pushing Poland’s strained health system to the breaking point. Doctors say patients are dying not only from Covid-19, but from other illnesses that overwhelmed hospitals are unable to treat.The government is preparing to open field hospitals, but it is not clear where it will find the doctors and nurses to staff them.Duda on Friday visited the National Stadium in Warsaw, which is being transformed into one of the field hospitals. He also bestowed state honors Friday on Iga Swiatek, the 19-year-old Polish tennis player who won the French Open this month, and her father and trainer, Tomasz Swiatek.Duda and the Swiateks wore masks and gloves but stood very close and shook hands as the president fastened honorary pins on them.Iga Swiatek said she and others on her team have no symptoms but would go into quarantine following Duda’s positive test. She said they are tested regularly and would be tested again in three days.The Polish government imposed new restrictions starting Saturday that are just short of a lockdown in hopes of bringing the country’s outbreak under control. The prime minister appealed to Poles to strictly observe these “serious restrictions” in order to protect lives.The country currently has some 11,500 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 and 911 of them on respirators, the Health Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poland-s-president-has-coronavirus-apologizes-to-contacts/story-J6uVqmGBY18oQwKAlSWCZL.html

Nagorno-Karabakh’s ethnic Armenian administration says its forces have repulsed attacks.President Ilham Aliyev told French newspaper Le Figaro that Azerbaijan was ready to sit down for negotiations but blamed Armenia’s actions for the continued hostilities.“We are ready to stop even today,” Aliyev was quoted as saying. “But, unfortunately, Armenia grossly violated the ceasefire. If they don’t stop, we will go to the end with the aim of liberating all the occupied territories.”US President Donald Trump said “good progress” was being made on the issue but did not elaborate and declined to say if he had spoken with the leaders of either country.Asked how his talks went, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan told reporters “very good” as he exited the US State Department, and added that work on a ceasefire would continue.World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.Shortly before the Washington talks, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul that he hoped Moscow and Ankara could work together on resolving the conflict.Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict.Pompeo had said ahead of Friday’s talks that he hoped the “right path forward” could be found.But Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he saw no diplomatic resolution of the conflict at this stage, and Aliyev has described the prospects of a peace settlement as “very remote”.About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland; Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-clashes-in-nagorno-karabakh-after-washington-talks/story-hCCM4khXqwf0GMmvaAbOqM.html

He will be joined by musician Jon Bon Jovi at one of them.“I voted for a guy named Trump,” the president said jokingly to reporters when asked who he voted for, at an early polling station in West Palm Beach. “We’re going to make three stops today, big ones, big rallies, three big ones … I don’t think there’s ever been anything like this, tremendous spirit.”ALSO READ | Donald Trump says India’s air is filthy during US presidential debateMore than 54 million Americans have already cast their ballots either through early in-person voting or mail, of an estimated 240 million eligible voters in all.President Trump’s first rally of the day was in Fayetteville in North Carolina, a battleground state he won in 2016, but where he is now trailing Biden by a thin margin of 1.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. His next stops were Columbus, Ohio and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, also states he won in 2016. But he now trails Biden in Wisconsin by 4.6 points and Ohio, which he won by 8.1% then, he leads only by 0.6 points.At his rallies, Trump has sought to build a momentum using talking points from the last presidential debate to play on what he believes are Biden’s vulnerabilities — shifting positions on fossil fuel and fracking, for instance, and social security funding.ALSO READ | US presidential election 2020: Donald Trump says final debate went ‘really well’“That could be one of the biggest mistakes made in presidential debate history,” Trump said about Biden’s remarks at the debate on transitioning from oil. “The oil industry pollutes, significantly. ... It has to be replaced by renewable energy over time,” Biden had said.The former vice-president kept his focus on his key case against the president: his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic. “Last night, we saw the President of the United States lie to the American people — repeatedly — about the state of this pandemic,” Biden said in a speech from Wilmington, Delaware, referring to the Thursday night debate.After reiterating his criticism of Trump’s response to the epidemic, which has killed more than 224,000 Americans and infected nearly 8.5 million, Biden spoke at length about his own plan if elected and it included ramped up production and availability of testing kits and protective gear for healthcare professional, a mask mandate in federal buildings and free vaccines.“Once we have a safe and effective vaccine, it has to be free to everyone, whether or not you are insured,” he said, “Let me say that again.

24-10-2020||World||Covid: Spain’s regions urge govt to impose state of emergency to allow curfews||Spanish regions are urging the central government to take measures that would give them legal backing to impose curfews as the country battles a resurgent coronavirus epidemic.As of Saturday, 10 of Spain’s 17 regions, including Asturias, Castilla-La Mancha and the Basque Country, had called on the government to decree a state of emergency, which would allow regions to limit people’s movement. Regions expect the government to call a special Council of Ministers meeting on Sunday to approve the measure, Spanish media including El Pais reported. “I would say with almost total certainty there will be one. But it has not officially been called yet,” a source from the Spanish government told Reuters.Meanwhile the Valencia region announced its own curfew from Saturday night until Dec. 9.Valencia region president Ximo Puig said the curfew, between midnight and 6am, would be covered by a law on procedural measures to deal with Covid-19 which “implicitly” states that such measures could be taken without the need for a state of emergency. While many regions favour some form of curfew, the Madrid region opposes it, a stance which has so far prevented a nationwide decision.Spain has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 infections in Western Europe. Total cases rose to 1,046,132 on Friday, while the death toll is nearing 38,000.Catalonia said on Friday night it would impose a curfew across the region, which includes Barcelona, as soon as the central government acted. “We need a decentralised state of emergency in which the Catalan government maintains all management capacity,” deputy Catalan leader Pere Aragones told a news conference. Other regions could follow Valencia and impose curfews by alternative means, such as going through regional courts, if the central government does not act. “If the central government does nothing, we will approve a curfew,” Murcia’s regional president Fernando Lopez Miras, told Spanish broadcaster TVE on Saturday.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s government would likely have enough votes to pass the measure in parliament. It would have the votes of the Basque Nationalist Party and other regional parties who support the measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-spain-s-regions-urge-govt-to-impose-state-of-emergency-to-allow-curfews/story-bNR8kvuDBmMRYJecSjaX6O.html

Much more secure than when you send in a ballot, I can tell you that,” said Trump, who insists without giving evidence that mail-in voting leads to fraud.“Everything was perfect, very strict, right by the rules. When you send in your ballot, it could never be secure like that,” he said.Trump is waging a frenetic last-ditch drive to catch up with Biden in the final days of the race, with rallies planned Saturday in North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, all of them battleground states.“You’re going to be very busy today, because we’re going to work you hard,” Trump told reporters traveling with him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-casts-early-ballot-in-florida-in-presidential-election/story-BY98IpjYaJzD9Yd9f4XvBN.html

The government has resisted a total lockdown fearing it would further devastate its economy, already weakened by unprecedented US sanctions.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told officials during a meeting with the country’s top counter-coronavirus committee that “the main priority in decision-making is people’s health.”Khamenei urged “all organizations” to follow strictly the health ministry’s guidelines to help restrict the virus’ spread, “regardless of other considerations.”Some hardliner lawmakers have criticized Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s management of the pandemic and demanded his resignation. Rouhani is a reformist politician and also championed Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which began collapsing after the U.S.’s unilateral withdrawal.Lawmaker Mojtaba Zolnouri, who heads parliament’s influential committee for national security and foreign policy, called on his Twitter account for Rouhani’s “hanging a thousand times until people’s hearts are satisfied.”Khamenei indirectly condemned such inflammatory statements in the meeting, calling it “wrong.” He said there is a difference between criticisms and insults.Iran shattered its single-day death toll record on Monday, and recorded consecutive daily infection highs on Tuesday and Wednesday — then again on Friday.A top health official stressed this week that the true number of deaths from the outbreak is likely 2.5 times higher.On Saturday, the Iranian health ministry put the official death toll from Covid-19 at 32,320, adding 335 casualties from the past twenty-four hours.Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari raised the total number of confirmed cases to 562,705.Khamenei added the government’s management of the pandemic is very important.“In some countries, such as the United States, the worst management has been applied. But we must try to pass this incident, which is related to people’s lives and health and their security and economy, with the best management,” he said.Iranian health minister Saeed Namaki said in the meeting that the pandemic could only be controlled by enforcing tighter restrictions.“We must curb the disease by enforcing regulations and tightening legal restrictions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fighting-coronavirus-trumps-other-concerns-says-iran-s-supreme-leader/story-DZfPtR7xjNTRyP76jjndYM.html
24-10-2020||World||No escaping from Wales: UK police to enforce travel ban||A police force in England says it will try to stop people from leaving Wales, which has started a 17-day lockdown to slow a surging rate of coronavirus infections.The Gloucestershire Constabulary will patrol routes from Wales and pull over drivers they believe are making long journeys. Travelers without a good excuse will be asked to turn around. If they don’t comply, officers will inform their Welsh counterparts so they can take action because Gloucestershire police don’t have the authority to fine people traveling from Wales, the department said.The situation illustrates the patchwork of coronavirus restrictions imposed by authorities throughout the UK, which has Europe’s deadliest coronavirus numbers, with 44,661 confirmed virus deaths. Some 1,756 of those occurred in Wales, which has a population of about 3 million.Under the UK’s system of devolved authority, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have established their own public health rules. Meanwhile, the national government in Westminster has created a three-tiered virus alert system that applies to England alone.South Yorkshire on Saturday became the latest region to enter Tier 3 — the tightest level of virus risk restrictions in England — following Liverpool, Greater Manchester and Lancashire.But it is the Welsh government that has imposed one of the U.K.’s strictest lockdowns, including a ban on non-essential travel. Under rules that took effect Friday evening, Wales also closed most businesses and restricted high schools to online instruction.Another English police force, West Mercia, also said it will be working with their Welsh counterparts to “enforce, where necessary, the relevant rules for the area we serve.’’New infections are continuing to rise across Britain. Professor Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the U.K.’s original lockdown in March, told the BBC that the current situation was “worrying.’‘“We are in a critical time right now,’‘ he said. “The health system will not be able to cope with this rate of growth for much longer.”___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-escaping-from-wales-uk-police-to-enforce-travel-ban/story-l8ghaI9gBD6UyGUT68ZJjM.html

There are at least two protests planned for Bangkok on Saturday and nine in other provinces, according to Free Youth.“If tonight passes and the government still ignores the demands of the people, we’ll step up the pressure so that these demands could come true,” the Thammasat group posted on its Facebook page on Saturday.The withdrawal of a state of emergency in Bangkok and the convening of a special session of parliament next week have failed to placate protesters. Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri on Saturday said a solution through the parliamentary process was the most appropriate because elected lawmakers represent all sections of society.Anucha declined to comment on the protesters’ deadline for the premier to quit, but Prayuth said this week the government and activists should “each take a step back” and “find solutions to the problems.”Parit Chiwarak, a protest leader who was re-arrested this week, said in a note from jail that “if Prayuth wants to see the country move forward, he would need to resign” as the public demanded.The youth-led protesters are calling for the constitution, drafted by a military-appointed panel after the 2014 coup, to be reworked, claiming it was instrumental in helping Prayuth retain power after the 2019 elections. The issue will be on the agenda of a special parliament session, Anucha said.On Saturday, an appeal court refused bail of five protest leaders including Parit, according to the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.The prime minister has become “vulnerable” after failing to stem the protests, which may eventually pave the way for his ouster, said Christopher Ankersen, associate professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies Center for Global Affairs.“It’s feasible that he could be removed from office either through a political machination of some kind within his own party, or via a military coup, an autogolpe, or some other route, such as a formal royal intervention,” Ankersen said. “Such a move could be used as a sop to the protesters, a way of forestalling real change, while addressing at least one of the main protest demands.”The protesters have broken long-held taboos about publicly criticizing the royal family, with demands for the monarch to no longer endorse coups, provide transparency in how funds are spent, and get rid of laws that stifle discussion of the royal family. The unprecedented targeting of the monarchy has also triggered rallies by pro-royalists, raising fears of clashes between the rival groups.King Maha Vajiralongkorn greeted some pro-royalist supporters at an event on Friday and he praised a man for holding up a royal portrait among the anti-government protesters, according to a video posted on social media. It was a signal that the king acknowledged the challenge to his authority by the protests, while showing his support to the pro-royalist movement, according to James Buchanan, a visiting lecturer at Mahidol University in Thailand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-braces-for-more-rallies-as-prime-minister-ignores-calls-to-quit/story-Pbf600AGeuDrjuOXgMTumM.html
24-10-2020||World||Italy mulls curfew, Covid-19 aid as Naples protest turns violent||The Italian government is expected to approve further virus containment measures as soon as Sunday and is mulling additional economic support even as the threat of tighter restrictions prompts protests.New infections soared above 19,000 cases Friday, just a day after Naples -- Italy’s hardest-hit city -- imposed a night-time curfew in a bid to contain the spread that contributed to violent protests. While Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has repeatedly ruled out a new national lockdown, he is running out of options as less restrictive measures have failed to damp the latest spread. Patients in intensive care units surpassed more than 1,000 for the first time since the pandemic’s peak.The government may may also adopt new support measures to limit the economic impact of the virus, Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri said. The government is mulling a 4 to 5 billion-euro ($4.7 to $5.9 billion) emergency decree to aid workers by extending furloughs and banning dismissals, according to people familiar with the matter.On Friday, Campania President Vincenzo De Luca called for a new national lockdown and said he will soon impose one in his region, which has Naples as the capital. “We are one step away from a tragedy, don’t want to see coffins on the streets,” he said.Within hours of De Luca’s announcement on Friday, protesters poured into the streets of Naples where some police vehicles were targeted by demonstrators and damaged by explosives. A television news reporter was also beaten.Interior Vice Minister Matteo Mauri called the protesters “urban guerrillas” and said the demonstrations were “not spontaneous but organized by soccer hooligans, criminals and political extremists,” the Ansa news agency reported on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-mulls-curfew-covid-19-aid-as-naples-protest-turns-violent/story-RK8jZxzBZQcRtArrkiUDIM.html
24-10-2020||World||Nations mulling Gilead’s Covid-19 drug should consider trial flop, too: WHO||Health officials reviewing Gilead Science Inc’s remdesivir against Covid-19 should consider all evidence, including a trial in which the medicine failed, before giving it the green light, the top WHO scientist said on Friday.U.S. regulators appeared not to have done so when approving the drug this week, Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Gilead’s antiviral drug for treating patients hospitalized with Covid-19, making it the first and only drug approved for the disease in the United States.The FDA decision came a week after the release of the results of the World Health Organization’s Solidarity trial, which concluded remdesivir has little or no impact on a patient’s chances of surviving Covid-19.The FDA said its approval was based on three trials, including a 1,062-patient study by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which found that remdesivir reduced hospital stays to 10 days from 15 days, and helped reduce the risk of death in some patients who were receiving oxygen. The drug did not improve overall survival.“The Solidarity results do not refute these findings of benefit to patients,” the FDA said in a statement posted on its website.Remdesivir is also approved for treatment of patients with severe Covid-19 in Japan, Taiwan, India, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the European Union. Gilead is allowing generic companies to manufacture the drug for supply to 127 low-income countries.“We believe our results are very robust,” the WHO’s Swaminathan said, when asked about the FDA move. “We hope that people who are doing treatment guidelines in other countries, as well as regulators around the world, will take note of our study results, in addition to the other evidence.”For the remdesivir arm of the WHO’s Solidarity trial, 2,743 patients were given the treatment, compared to 2,708 in the control group. Gilead, which has raised the possibility of bias in the “unblinded” WHO study because patients and their doctors were aware of which treatments were being used, got initial data from the trial in late September, the WHO has said. “We have apprised FDA of the topline WHO Solidarity trial results and the draft manuscript” submitted to a publication, the company said. “However, at this time Gilead has not received the requested datasets from WHO for the Solidarity trial results.”The WHO also said on Friday that its formal guidelines on use of remdesivir for Covid-19 should be ready for release in three to four weeks, after a separate group within the United Nations health agency reviews data from the study.An independent WHO panel will convene next week to look at all evidence of the effectiveness of Gilead’s drug, Janet Diaz, the WHO’s top official for clinical care responses, said.“We would anticipate that the guidelines will be available within three to four weeks,” Diaz said. “What we’re doing now in the pandemic is to try to continue with that approach in a transparent and trustworthy way, but do it faster.” (Reporting by John Miller, Stephanie Nebehay and Michael Shields; Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Writing by Peter Graff and John Miller; Editing by Kevin Liffey, Andrew Cawthorne and Richard Chang)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-mulling-gilead-s-covid-19-drug-should-consider-trial-flop-too-who/story-jh1mM6HS9w0tF5pdHYPx8H.html
24-10-2020||World||Passengers board parked jet for dining experience||Hundreds of travel-starved diners ate lunch and watched seat-back films aboard two parked Singapore Airlines jets turned into pop-up restaurants on Saturday.With the aviation industry in deep crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, airlines have turned to alternative ways to raise cash, from offering “flights to nowhere” to tours of aircraft.Singapore’s flag carrier, which has cut thousands of jobs and grounded nearly all its planes this year, offered passengers the chance to dine on board two A380 superjumbos -- the world’s biggest passenger jet.On Saturday more than 400 diners checked in at Changi Airport and went through the usual security checks before arriving at the aircraft for lunch.“The food is pretty amazing, it’s better than the one they serve during the flight,” Zhou Tai Di, a 17-year-old student in economy class, told AFP as he tucked into his soy sauce-glazed chicken with spicy fried eggplant and rice. Some settled in for a nap while waiting for their meals to be served, while others watched movies on the seat-back entertainment systems. About half the seats were left empty, in keeping with social-distancing guidelines.Calvin Teo, a 29-year-old civil servant and aviation buff, paid Sg$321 ($236) to be served a six-course meal in business class, saying he missed flying and hoped to recreate the experience.“Of course the feeling of actually flying will be better, because there’s the excitement of going to a new destination, to explore a new destination, and even though we can’t do it now due to Covid, this is a good substitute to recreate the feels of taking a long-haul flight,” he told AFP. The most expensive option is a Sg$642 eight-course meal in a first-class suite, while the cheapest costs Sg$53 and consists of a three-course meal in economy class.A limited number of diners were also able to tour the double-decker aircraft and take selfies with pilots in the cockpit. The tarmac meals proved surprisingly popular -- the airline announced six additional sessions after more than 900 lunch tickets sold out within 30 minutes of bookings opening earlier this month.The airline is also offering home deliveries of plane meals, but it has ditched plans for “flights to nowhere” -- short journeys starting and ending at the same airport -- following an outcry over the potential environmental impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/passengers-board-parked-jet-for-dining-experience/story-FeHgs5sQSMeUyhpTI8SZrK.html
24-10-2020||World||US sets coronavirus infection record; deaths near 224,000||The US coronavirus caseload has reached record heights with more than 83,000 infections reported in a single day, the latest ominous sign of the disease’s grip on the nation, as states from Connecticut to the Rocky Mountain West reel under the surge.The US death toll, meanwhile, has grown to 223,995, according to the Covid-19 Dashboard published by Johns Hopkins University. The total US caseload reported on the site Friday was 83,757, topping the 77,362 cases reported on July 16.The impact is being felt in every section of the country — a lockdown starting Friday at the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s reservation in South Dakota, a plea by a Florida health official for a halt to children’s birthday parties, dire warnings from Utah’s governor, and an increasingly desperate situation at a hospital in northern Idaho, which is running out of space for patients and considering airlifts to Seattle or Portland, Oregon.“We’ve essentially shut down an entire floor of our hospital. We’ve had to double rooms. We’ve bought more hospital beds,” said Dr. Robert Scoggins, a pulmonologist at the Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d’Alene. “Our hospital is not built for a pandemic.”In the southern Idaho city of Twin Falls, St. Luke’s Magic Valley Medical Center said it would no longer accept children because it is overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Except for newborns, all under age 18 will be sent 128 miles (206 kilometers) away in Boise.Among those in northern Idaho joining Scoggins at a meeting of Idaho’s Panhandle Health District was board member Walk Kirby.“People are dying, they’re going to keep dying and catching this stuff,” Kirby said. “How many people won’t wear a mask? The same people that won’t get vaccinated for it.”Utah’s Gov. Gary Herbert proclaimed Friday to be “a record day for Utah — but not a good one” as Covid-19 cases reached an all-time high for the state.“Up until now, our hospitals have been able to provide good care to all COVID and non-COVID patients who need it,” he said. “But today we stand on the brink. If Utahans do not take serious steps to limit group gatherings and wear masks, our healthcare providers will not have the ability to provide quality care for everyone who needs it.”By public health order, masks are required in 21 counties, said Herbert, urging Utah residents to wear one whenever they are around someone outside their immediate household.The seven-day rolling average for new daily Covid-19 cases in the U.S. surpassed 61,140 Thursday, compared with 44,647 two weeks ago. The record was reached July 22 when the rolling average was 67,293 in the midst of a summer outbreak driven largely by surges of the virus in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California.The US surge mirrors a similarly widespread spike in Europe, where Rome, Paris and other major cities are reining in nightlife as part of the increasingly drastic measures undertaken to slow the spread of the pandemic. French authorities said the country had recorded over 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, becoming the second country in Western Europe after Spain to reach that number.The head of the World Health Organization warned that countries in the Northern Hemisphere are at a “critical juncture” as cases and deaths continue to rise.“The next few months are going to be very tough and some countries are on a dangerous track,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a press briefing on Friday.Some of the latest developments in the United States:SOUTH DAKOTAIn South Dakota, the Oglala Sioux Tribe ordered a one-week lockdown of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in response to a surging number of Covid-19 cases in the state. Through the morning of Oct. 30, all non-essential travel is banned and non-essential businesses must close.The tribe posted on its Twitter page that there were 391 active Covid-19 cases as of Thursday on the reservation, which has about 20,000 residents.The lockdown comes as South Dakota surpassed 9,000 active coronavirus cases on Thursday and reported an all-time high of 973 new cases in one day.___FLORIDAThe top health official in one of Florida’s most populous counties discouraged parents from hosting birthday parties for their children, no matter the size.Dr. Raul Pino, a state health officer in Orange County, said half of the 30 attendees at a recent Sweet 16 party in the Orlando area came down with the virus. Last month, an Orange County high school closed for two weeks after students who had attended a birthday party tested positive.“Those parties will not only affect those people participating in that activity, but also everyone else they come into contact with when they leave,” said Pino. “We will continue to see consequences if we don’t act super-responsibly.”___TEXASIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott is sending more medical reinforcements to the El Paso area in response to a surge of coronavirus infections. The Texas Department of State Health Services and the Texas Division of Emergency Management will provide more medical personnel and equipment this week.El Paso County reported 3,750 new coronavirus infections this week, including 1,161 on Thursday. That number accounts for 17.5% of the 21,321 cases reported this week by the state’s 254 counties.___IDAHOEven as the health-care situation worsened in northern Idaho, a regional health board voted to repeal a local mask mandate. It acted moments after hearing how the Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d’Alene had reached 99% capacity.Kootenai is the third-most populous county in conservative Idaho.The state is experiencing its largest coronavirus spike since the pandemic began, with new cases increasing statewide by 46.5% percent over the past two weeks. Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, has declined to take steps such as requiring masks statewide to slow the virus’ spread.Dr. Joshua Kern, vice president of St. Luke’s in the Magic Valley region that includes Twin Falls and Jerome, said Thursday during a virtual press conference that he and other medical professionals are scared.“The purpose of any intervention around coronavirus has been to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed, and here I am today saying the hospital is being overwhelmed,” he said.A day later on Friday, his hospital announced the move to send younger patients to Boise.__NEW JERSEY and CONNECTICUTFor a while, as new Covid-19 cases surged in the Midwest and elsewhere, the level of new cases remained low in the Northeast, which had been hit hard earlier in the pandemic. Several states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, imposed 14-day quarantine requirements for travelers arriving from dozens of states with higher rates of positive tests.This week, however, rates in New Jersey and Connecticut rose to the point where they qualify for their own quarantine restrictions.After some confusion, the Democratic governors of New Jersey, Connecticut and New York, where rates remain lower, decided to keep their travel rules in place, but not add each other to their quarantine lists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-coronavirus-infection-record-deaths-near-224-000/story-FYQ0n5l2qGQgpT5tL5bSyM.html
24-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Countries battle rising cases as WHO sees ‘exponential’ rise||Grim data highlighted the struggle for authorities around the world to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control Saturday, as the US reported 80,000 infections in a single day, France extended a curfew to two-thirds of citizens and Germany’s death toll passed 10,000.The World Health Organization had earlier warned of an “exponential” rise in infections threatening health systems’ ability to cope.But populations weary of social isolation and economic hardship have pushed back against fresh restrictions to slow the resurgent virus’ spread, including overnight clashes in hard-hit Naples between Italian police and hundreds of protesters.In the US, Covid-19 has become a central election issue ahead of a November 3 vote, with President Donald Trump on Friday promising attendees at a Florida rally that “we’re going to quickly end this pandemic, this horrible plague.”Meanwhile challenger Joe Biden matched Trump’s vow to make a vaccine available for free to all who want it “whether or not you’re insured” and said the Republican incumbent has “given up” on controlling the outbreak.Johns Hopkins University had earlier reported 79,963 new American cases in 24 hours, a new record, although the number of daily deaths has remained broadly stable since the beginning of autumn at between 700 and 800.Overall, more than 223,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US.France on Friday followed Spain past the milestone of one million cases, while the government extended an overnight curfew designed to slow the spread to affect some 46 million people.“Whatever we do in the coming days and weeks, the toll will grow heavier,” Health Minister Olivier Veran told lawmakers.And after Germany recorded its 10,000th death from the coronavirus, Chancellor Angela Merkel told citizens that “the order of the day is to reduce contacts, to meet as few people as possible” in a weekly video podcast.In Poland, President Andrzej Duda tested positive for Covid-19, although an aide wrote on Twitter that he was “fine”.- ‘Close to capacity’ -WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had on Friday warned that “too many countries are seeing an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close to or above capacity -- and we’re still only in October.”“We urge leaders to take immediate action to prevent further unnecessary deaths.”That message was echoed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), whose director Andrea Ammon warned of a “highly concerning epidemiological situation”.But moves to reintroduce restrictions were met with protest in parts of the continent.In Naples, hundreds of demonstrators turned out after a call on social media to resist a new curfew in parts of Italy, throwing objects at police and setting rubbish bins on fire.The country is reeling from its worst post-war recession after a gruelling two-month national lockdown prompted by one of Europe’s worst outbreaks, and authorities have so far been reluctant to repeat the drastic quarantine restrictions seen then.Wales entered a full lockdown on Friday evening, a day after Ireland shut down, while Poland adopted a nationwide “red zone” lockdown mandating the partial closure of primary schools and restaurants.Only Sweden, which famously refused to lock down earlier this year, continued to stick to its guns despite a rise in cases.After Spain became the first European country to officially record a million Covid-19 cases earlier in the week, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Friday the real number of infections was likely more than triple that number.- ‘We’re overwhelmed’ -Across the planet, Covid-19 has now claimed the lives of 1.1 million people and infected close to 42 million, with the WHO warning the northern hemisphere was at a critical juncture.Belgium has seen one of Europe’s deadliest per capita outbreaks and has found itself suffering some of the highest second-wave infection rates in Europe. “We’re losing. We’re overwhelmed. We’re bitter,” said Benoit Misset, head of the intensive care unit at the University Hospital in the city of Liege, where several of his staff are having to work despite being positive -- if asymptomatic -- themselves.Work has continued on the international quest to find a vaccine for the disease, with clinical trials for one candidate developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University resuming in the United States on Friday, six weeks after a test subject became ill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-countries-battle-rising-cases-as-who-sees-exponential-rise/story-nbF2DA9dBYw3UwVtWHDvHL.html
24-10-2020||World||Californians face biggest power shut-offs this year on wildfire risk||Californians are facing the largest mass blackout so far this year as the state’s biggest utility, PG&E Corp., prepares power shut-offs to prevent its equipment from igniting wildfires during ferocious winds.The company may pre-emptively cut power to 466,000 homes and businesses -- an estimated 1.4 million people -- across Northern California starting early Sunday, according to its website. The outages are poised to hit large swaths of the San Francisco Bay area, the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Central Valley and the Central Coast.The potential blackouts would be the latest blow for a state that’s been battered by extreme weather and has already seen a record 4.1 million acres scorched this year. PG&E has pre-emptively cut power four times in 2020 to prevent falling wires from igniting blazes in a region that’s tinder dry from heat and drought. The new round of outages would be the biggest by far, stretching across 38 counties.Winds starting this weekend are forecast to reach 70 miles (113 kilometers) per hour in the northern part of the state, with gusts expected to last through Tuesday morning. Weather extremes are colliding to make for particularly dangerous conditions, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E’s head of meteorology and fire science.California is facing “extremely high winds, extremely low humidity, extreme dry fuels due to the hottest average temperatures over the last six months, according to records that go back 126 years, and extreme drought across the territory given lack of rainfall,” Strenfel said in a statement.The blackouts may hit densely populated parts of the San Francisco metropolitan area, including portions of Oakland, Berkeley and Marin County -- cutting power to many residents as they are working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic. San Francisco, at relatively low risk of fires, is the only county in the Bay Area region not expected to be affected.PG&E isn’t the only utility warning of outages. Pacific Power, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said Friday that it could switch off power for about 5,800 customers in Northern California and Southern Oregon on Sunday due to the gusts, according to a statement.Much of the US West is at risk from wildfires as dry weather and stiff winds turn hillsides, forests and scrub land into tinderboxes. In Colorado, two of the largest fires in state history have forced the closure of Rocky Mountain National Park and triggered the evacuation of nearby towns. And in Utah, Berkshire’s Rocky Mountain Power warned earlier this week it may cut power to about 1,800 customers in Sundance and Summit Park due to fire risk.More than 3.1 million people across California will be in high-risk zones, including the cities of Sacramento, Stockton, and Fairfield, the US Storm Prediction Center said in its long-range forecast.The looming outages come on the heels of a blistering heat wave that gripped California earlier this month, driving temperatures to record daily highs. In August, a freak lightning storm sparked more than 150 wildfires in 24 hours. Days before that, the state’s grid operator ordered the first rotating outages since the Enron-era energy crisis of 2001 as scorching weather sent electricity demand surging.PG&E began resorting to preventative shut-offs after its equipment caused some of California’s worst blazes, forcing the company into bankruptcy last year. PG&E emerged from Chapter 11 in July after having paid $25.5 billion to resolve fire claims.“They have a lot of work to do not just to restore their power but to restore the trust that they have failed to earn over the course of decades,” Governor Gavin Newsom said during a briefing Friday. “That is self-evident to anyone living in the Bay Area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/californians-face-biggest-power-shut-offs-this-year-on-wildfire-risk/story-LjKV0U3tP6DrSWxpFEBgjI.html
24-10-2020||World||In Asia next week, Pompeo expected to bolster allies against China||US Secretary of State of Mike Pompeo is flying to India next week to strengthen strategic ties with a nation that is locked in a military standoff with China, in Washington’s latest effort to bolster allies against Beijing.As part of an intensifying push back against China’s growing economic and military power in the region, Pompeo will also travel to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, two Indian Ocean countries struggling with a mountain of Chinese debt incurred to finance big infrastructure projects. Pompeo will conclude his trip, which comes in the final week before the US Presidential election, in Indonesia, which is also locked in territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.“We’re looking forward to strengthening critical relationships with our friends and partners, emphasizing our deep commitment to the Indo-Pacific, and advancing our vision for long-term partnership and prosperity in the region,” said Dean Thompson, principal deputy assistant secretary at the State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs.Washington has been ramping up diplomatic pressure on China, and President Donald Trump has made being tough on Beijing a key part of his campaign to secure a second term. Pompeo led a meeting of foreign ministers from India, Japan, and Australia this month in Tokyo, a grouping which has been named the Quad, and could be a bulwark against China’s growing assertiveness in the region.“This is more about real foreign policy than domestic politics,” said Greg Poling, maritime security expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Yes, Pompeo’s anti-China rhetoric is largely about the election, but State’s broader push to strengthen the Quad, tighten relations with Taiwan, heighten attention on the South China Sea and more, are being driven as much by the policy professionals as the politicians.” Next month, India hosts ‘Malabar’, the biggest naval wargames in years, with the other Quad members , an exercise that China has in the past opposed.India’s decision on expanding the exercises comes at a time when it is locked in a military stand-off on the disputed land border with China.Thousands of troops are in close proximity in the western Himalayas, where India says Chinese troops have intruded across its side of the de-facto border. Beijing denies any intrusion and says India has been building roads and other infrastructure in the disputed area, causing the crisis.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday the United States was bullying countries to pick sides over their links to China, but such efforts would not succeed.During Pompeo’s trip, which Defense Secretary Mark Esper will join, India is expected to sign an agreement that will give it access to sensitive US satellite data to help improve targeting of missiles and drones, Indian officials said.“There is great further potential in our defence cooperation,” an Indian official said. In what will be the first visit by a U.S. Secretary of State to Sri Lanka in over a decade, Pompeo will advise leaders in Colombo to scale back dependence on China, which has invested billions of dollars building ports and highways but left the island nation in debt, Thompson said.“We urge Sri Lanka to make difficult but necessary decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity,” Thompson added. The island is a key part of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative but Colombo has in recent years sought to improve ties with India, United States, and Japan.Similar efforts are under way to push back against Chinese influence in the Maldives, tropical islands that lie on key shipping lanes.Pompeo’s visit to Indonesia comes amid an escalating US-China rivalry that is being vigorously contested in Southeast Asia, especially in the South China Sea, which China claims as almost entirely its own territory. The claim is opposed by many states in the region, including Indonesia.The State Department this week approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion.Taiwan, which China says is a renegade province, also claims large parts of the South China Sea.Washington asked Indonesia in July and August to grant landing and refuelling rights to its P-8 surveillance planes, which monitor Chinese military activity in the resource rich waterway.The request was rebuffed by President Joko Widodo, according to four senior officials. “There are commercial issues, security issues and diplomatic issues where the United States has already improved the relationship between the countries,” Pompeo said this week. “But there’s more that we can do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-asia-next-week-pompeo-expected-to-bolster-allies-against-china/story-XBc6zr7nCqkxVh4wY2fnoL.html
24-10-2020||World||Asia becomes second region to exceed 10 million coronavirus cases||Asia surpassed 10 million infections of the new coronavirus on Saturday, the second heaviest regional toll in the world, according to a Reuters tally, as cases continue to mount in India despite a slowdown and sharp declines elsewhere.Behind only Latin America, Asia accounts for about one-fourth of the global caseload of 42.1 million of the virus. With over 163,000 deaths, the region accounts for some 14 per cent of the global Covid-19 toll.The Reuters tally is based on official reporting by countries.The true numbers of cases and deaths are likely much higher, experts say, given deficiencies in testing and potential underreporting in many countries.Despite the Asian spikes, the region overall has reported improvement in handling the pandemic in recent weeks, with daily caseloads slowing in places like India, a sharp contrast to the Covid-19 resurgence seen in Europe and North America.Within the region, South Asia led by India is the worst affected, with nearly 21 per cent of the reported global coronavirus cases and 12 per cent of deaths. This contrasts with countries like China and New Zealand that have crushed infections and Japan, where Covid-19 had been stubbornly entrenched but not accelerating.India is the worst-hit country in the world after the United States, although infections are slowing in the world’s second-most populous country. India is reporting more than 57,000 cases of the virus a day, viewed on a weekly average, with 58 new cases per 10,000 people in Asia’s third-largest economy, according to a Reuters analysis.India is averaging 764 Covid-19 deaths a day, the worst in the world and accounting for one in every 13 global pandemic deaths. The country has reported nearly 7.8 million infections, behind the US tally of 8.5 million, and nearly 118,000 deaths, versus 224,128 in the United States. Unlike the recent US surge, however, India’s slowdown saw the lowest daily caseload in nearly three months on Wednesday. But India’s infections may surge again, doctors fear, with a holiday approaching and winter bringing more severe pollution from farmers burning stubble, worsening the breathing difficulties that many Covid-19 patients suffer. India’s eastern neighbour Bangladesh is Asia’s second worst hit country, with nearly 400,000 cases, but daily infections have slowed to 1,453, less than 40 per cent of the July peak.Although the pandemic is slowing in Bangladesh, the world’s biggest apparel producer after China faces harsh recession as a second wave of Covid-19 hits key markets in Europe and the United States.Even if the country is making progress on controlling the disease, leaders of the key garment sector say international retailers are delaying orders or demanding steep price cuts, forcing them to lay off their workers. Some 1 million workers were furloughed or laid off. About one-third of those have been rehired since July, according to union leaders.In Southeast Asia, Indonesia surpassed the Philippines last week as the worst-hit nation with more than 370,000 infections.The world’s largest Muslim majority nation, Indonesia has struggled to get its outbreak under control. With the country due to host soccer’s Under 20 World Cup next year, the Government is racing to secure a supply of vaccines still under development, which some epidemiologists say means seeking a “silver bullet” solution before full vaccine efficacy and safety is known.The Philippines, which last week reported its biggest daily tally in a month, has put partial coronavirus restrictions around the capital Manila until Oct. 31 to check Covid-19. Despite Asia’s patchy record, a World Health Organization expert said on Monday that Europe and North America should follow the example of Asian states in persevering with anti-Covid measures and quarantine restrictions for infected people.Mike Ryan, head of the United Nations agency’s emergencies programme, said the global death toll from Covid-19 could double to 2 million before a successful vaccine is widely used and could be even higher without concerted action to curb the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-becomes-second-region-to-exceed-10-million-coronavirus-cases/story-vLz6JhhDOvi0OHOPXPus5K.html
24-10-2020||World||Australia explores lifting state border closures by Christmas||Australia is considering reopening state borders in time for Christmas and is also weighing plans to create alternative options to hotel quarantine so that more of its citizens can return from abroad.All states and territories except for Western Australia agreed to a framework that would end regional border closures before Dec. 25, according to a statement from Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s office.The details will be finalized by the next meeting of federal and state leaders, scheduled for Nov. 13. Work continues on efforts to increase the number of Australians allowed to return from overseas, with options such as quarantining at home or in university housing or with private providers.Australia is taking steps to kick-start its economy with Covid-19 cases having dwindled in the worst-hit state of Victoria, from a daily peak of over 600 cases to just a handful.The relaxation of rules on gatherings in Sydney and steps toward allowing people to cross state borders come as the U.S. and Europe battle with increasing infection rates and hospitalizations.“National Cabinet continues to work together to address issues and find solutions to the health and economic consequences of Covid-19,” Morrison said in the statement. “Australia has done well on both the health and economic fronts compared to most countries around the world.”There have been more than 27,000 coronavirus cases in Australia and some 905 people have died. Active cases are down to about 220 from 1,100 five weeks ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-explores-lifting-state-border-closures-by-christmas/story-7b6vxuUDg9da3S2jyz1c5L.html
24-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Work already underway for presidential inauguration||While much of Washington is twisted in knots over the upcoming election, there’s another contingent already busy trying to figure out how to stage an inauguration for the to-be-determined next president during a pandemic.Visitors to the US Capitol and the White House can already see preparations underway for the Jan. 20 ceremony, a date set by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, for whoever emerges as the winner. And low-flying helicopters are swooping around town as part of beefed-up security precautions.Construction work is taking place with the mindset that it is easier to scale down, if the coronavirus makes that necessary, than to scale up, said Paige Waltz, a spokesperson for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.The committee has voted to hold the inaugural ceremonies on the West Front of the Capitol, a tradition that began under Ronald Reagan. The Architect of the Capitol is busy constructing the inaugural platform from scratch. The platform traditionally holds more than 1,600 people, including the president and vice president, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, and the outgoing president and vice president. Bleachers above the platform hold 1,000 additional people. The view from the West Front stretches the length of the National Mall, where Americans from around the country gather to catch a glimpse of history.But in recognition that life has changed as a result of Covid-19, lawmakers are leaving all options on the table when it comes to safety precautions that could be taken. Will attendees be required to wear a mask? Or have their temperatures taken? Or social distance to the extent possible? Such precautions are being discussed, though no final determinations have been made with the ceremony still about three months away.Waltz said the six-member committee overseeing the inaugural ceremonies is “committed to traditional, inclusive, and safe ceremonies and will continue to monitor the situation and provide information as it comes available.”After the ceremony, the president and vice president will attend a luncheon in National Statuary Hall that includes speeches, gifts and toasts. The format used today began in 1953 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife and 50 other guests of the joint committee dined on creamed chicken, baked ham and potato puffs in the Old Senate Chamber.Then it’s on to the parade and inaugural balls. A Presidential Inaugural Committee, a nonprofit representing the president-elect, will be organized following the November 3 election. The committee oversees inaugural events held away from the US Capitol.In the meantime, the National Park Service is preparing for the construction of the reviewing and media stands used by the president-elect, his staff and family for the Presidential Inaugural Parade. It has closed a portion of Lafayette Park and the White House sidewalk to allow construction to begin.The Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department, has begun conducting low-altitude helicopter flights around the capital during the daytime. The department said the aircraft contain state-of-the art radiation-sensing technology, and the flights are part of standard preparations to protect public safety.For the Washington, DC, metro area, the inauguration has traditionally provided an economic boost as visitors fill local hotels and restaurants. The 2021 inauguration comes at a difficult time for the district. Visitor spending was down 80%, or $6.9 billion, from March 8 to October 10, compared to the same period last year, according to Tourism Economics. That translated to $313 million in lost tax revenue for the District of Columbia.Many of the region’s restaurants are shuttered, while hotel room demand was down nearly 5 million rooms, or 83%, from the same time period in 2019, according to STR Inc., which tracks the hotel industry.“Traditionally, a second-term inauguration is not as big as the first, and if we have a new president taking office, numbers are typically larger,” said Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, the district’s marketing organization. “However, visitation to Washington, DC, during inauguration will depend on what people are able to do in the city based on Covid-19’s impact this winter, which remains to be seen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-work-already-underway-for-presidential-inauguration/story-dOTPdrjxy0PsEpMq01kO9L.html
24-10-2020||World||Facebook, Twitter chiefs to testify before Senate on November 17||The chief executive officers of Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. have agreed to testify on Nov. 17 before a Senate panel looking into restrictions their companies put an on article about the son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.The Judiciary Committee on Thursday authorized subpoenas for both Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Twitter’s chief, Jack Dorsey. The committee announced on Friday evening that they would appear voluntarily.Senate Republicans and the Trump administration have been heightening pressure on the companies and other technology giants over allegations that they are biased against conservatives. At the same time, there is a growing willingness by members of both parties to confront the powerful technology companies and bring them to heel.Dorsey and Zuckerberg, who have been called to Washington to explain their content policies, are also due to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee next Wednesday, along with Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai. The questions will focus on their liability protections for user content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.President Donald Trump and other conservatives claim the law enables the companies to silence their views and content.“I would say that big tech is not distinguishing itself,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Pensacola, Florida, on Friday night. “They don’t want to put something on, they don’t put it on. But you know what? Can I tell you what? People are wise to it.”Facebook confirmed that Zuckerberg would appear, but declined further comment. Twitter said that Dorsey would testify virtually and also declined to elaborate.Senate Republicans demanded to question the CEOs after their companies moved to limit the spread of a New York Post article on Biden’s son Hunter and what the Post said were his exchanges with a Ukrainian executive. The article said emails purportedly from Hunter Biden, and provided by allies of the president, show he introduced an executive at a Ukrainian energy company to his father when he was vice president.The paper claimed the communication contradicts Joe Biden’s assertion that he hadn’t spoken to his son about his business dealings. The emails didn’t say definitively whether Joe Biden actually met the executive. The Biden campaign said the former vice president’s schedules show that no such meeting took place.The details of the Post article haven’t been independently confirmed by Bloomberg News.The Judiciary hearing would mark the third congressional appearance in 2020 for Zuckerberg, after next week’s Commerce Committee testimony and a July hearing on antitrust before a House subcommittee.Zuckerberg and other technology executives face growing hostility not just on Capitol Hill, but in the Trump administration and among state attorneys general.Amid Republican complaints regarding the Post article, the Federal Communications Commission said last week that it would review the liability shield for Facebook and Twitter.And on Tuesday, the Justice Department, in the most significant antitrust case against an American company in two decades, sued Alphabet-owned Google, kicking off what promises to be a volley of legal actions against the search giant for allegedly abusing its market power.Google, which controls about 90% of the online search market in the US, is the “unchallenged gateway” to the internet and engaged in a variety of anticompetitive practices to maintain and extend its monopoly, the government said in a complaint filed Tuesday in Washington.Google called the government’s case “deeply flawed” and said it would actually hurt consumers because it would “artificially prop up” lower-quality search options and raise phone prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-twitter-chiefs-to-testify-before-senate-on-november-17/story-JovIvvVj4aQ1FvnO76xj5N.html
24-10-2020||World||Americans are learning to die with coronavirus: Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Friday said Americans are not learning to live with COVID-19, but learning to die with it as the pandemic has dwarfed anything that the country faced in recent history and is not showing any signs of slowing down. More than 220,000 Americans have lost their lives, which is more than one-fifth of the total global death, Biden said in a major policy speech on the coronavirus, a day after the final presidential debate he had with the Republican incumbent Donald Trump.Biden, in his speech in his home state of Delaware, blamed the policies of Trump for the deadly spread of the virus that has had a devastating impact on the country’s economy.“President Trump said we’re rounding the corner, it’s going away, we’re learning to live with it.They are quotes. But as I told him last night, we’re not learning to live with it. We’re learning to die with it. This is a dark winter ahead,” Biden, 77, said.“Already more than 220,000 people in the US have lost their lives to this virus. Worse yet, a new study from Columbia University suggests that anywhere between 130,000 and 210,000 of those deaths were avoidable,” he said.“Covid-19 dwarfs anything we’ve faced in recent history and it isn’t showing any signs of slowing down.The virus is surging in almost every state. We passed 4.8 million cases. And when Trump was asked this week what he’d do differently to get the pandemic response right from the start his answer was and I quote, ‘Not much. Not much.’,” said the former vice president.Alleging that Trump does not have a plan to fight the coronavirus, Biden said the longer he is the President, the “more reckless” he gets.“We don’t have to be held prisoner by this administration’s failures. We can choose a different path. We can do what Americans have always done: come together and meet the challenge with grit, compassion, and determination,” he said.Revealing his plan, if voted to power in November, Biden said he would immediately put in place a national strategy that will position the country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back the lives.Biden said he will ask the new Congress to put a bill on his desk by the end of January with all the resources necessary to see how both the public health and economic response can be seen through the end what is needed.Biden said he will go to every governor and urge them to mandate wearing masks in their states. “And if they refuse, I’ll go to the mayors and county executives, and get local masking requirements in place nationwide,” he said, adding that as President he will mandate mask wearing at all federal buildings and all interstate transportation.“Because masks save lives,” he said, adding that he will put a national testing plan in place with a goal of testing as many people each day as they are currently testing each week. The Democratic presidential candidate said the vaccine would be free and freely available to everyone.Describing this as a Biden-Harris agenda, he said that it is going to take all Americans working together. “And that’s not hyperbole, all of us working together, watching out for one another. We’re all still going to have to wear a mask or practise social distancing a while longer. It’s going to be hard,” he said. “But if we follow the science and keep faith with one another, I promise you, we’ll get through this and come out the other side much faster than the rate we’re going now. Look, you all know this.The American people have always given their best to this country in times of crisis. And this time isn’t any different,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-are-learning-to-die-with-coronavirus-biden/story-ftgcYpcoia7xGD0SxYzvUL.html
24-10-2020||World||U.S. breaks daily record for Covid cases with over 84,000 new infections||The United States broke its daily record for new coronavirus infections on Friday as it reported 84,218 new cases due to outbreaks in virtually every part of the country, according to a Reuters tally.The spike in cases comes less than two weeks before the presidential election on Nov. 3 and is hitting battleground states such as Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Thursday, the United States reported a near-record 76,195 new cases. The previous record was 77,299 new cases on July 16. At the time, hospitalizations for Covid-19 patients hit 47,000 and two weeks later deaths rose to an average of 1,200 per day.Now, hospitalizations are over 41,000 and deaths average nearly 800 per day. Sixteen states had record one-day increases in new cases on Friday and 11 reported a record number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.Health experts have not pinpointed the reason for the rise but have long warned that colder temperatures driving people inside, fatigue with Covid-19 precautions and students returning to schools and colleges, could promote the spread of the virus.The United States has the most cases in the world at 8.5 million and the most fatalities with 224,000 lives lost. The United States has reported over the past week an average of 60,000 new cases per day, the highest seven-day average since early August.The Midwest has been the epicenter of the latest surge but infections are rising nationwide. The Northeast reported an 83% increase in cases in the past month. New cases have doubled in Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey in the past four weeks as compared to the prior four weeks, according to a Reuters analysis.Western states including Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming have reported a 200% increase in cases in the past four weeks when compared with the previous four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-breaks-daily-record-for-covid-cases-with-over-84-000-new-infections/story-DiPITlh4Z99Fs2LYhyhBRI.html
24-10-2020||World||US closely monitoring India-China border row, does not want it to escalate: Official||The US is closely monitoring the border row between India and China and does not want the situation to escalate, a senior Trump administration official has said.The official told the reporters during a conference call on Friday, ahead of the next week’s 2+2 India-US Ministerial in New Delhi, that the Trump administration was providing support to India through defence sales, joint military exercises and information sharing.“We as a government are covering the situation in the Himalayas closely, and understandably. We certainly want to ensure that the situation doesn’t escalate,” the official said.“These are all areas where we cooperate with the Indians on, and not just as it relates to the tensions in the Himalayas,” the official said.India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May that has significantly strained the bilateral ties.Both sides have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Lake in the last week of August.In response to a question, the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the US was having an ongoing dialogue with Indian about increased cooperation in Southeast Asia, and not simply about the South China Sea.“And we encourage their involvement. That cuts across development investments, it cuts across security cooperation, and then it also involves presence. So, we welcome greater Indian participation in Southeast Asia across all three of those areas,” said the official.The senior official’s remarks came in the midst of a growing global concern over China’s expansionist behaviour.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.The South China Sea and the East China Sea are stated to be rich in minerals, oil, and other natural resources. They are also vital to global trade.Although the US lays no claims to the disputed waters, it has challenged China’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea by deploying warships and fighter jets to assert freedom of navigation and overflight patrols in the strategically vital region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-closely-monitoring-india-china-border-row-does-not-want-it-to-escalate-official/story-Lmv2ezXR3prEfQIzkFi3dI.html
24-10-2020||World||November 3 poll choice between super recovery and Joe Biden depression: Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump on Friday said this election for Americans is a choice between a “super recovery” by his administration and a “depression” by his Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Hitting the campaign trail from the battleground State of Florida, a day after the final presidential debate, Trump said “Biden proved last night that he’s not capable of being president of the United States”. “The country saw first-hand that this election is a choice between a Trump recovery , and I’ll call it because that’s what’s happening, it’s a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression. Because you will have a depression,” said Trump amidst applause from thousands of his supporters. The November 3 presidential elections, he said, is choice between optimism, patriotic vision for American success and Biden’s “dark, dismal, gloomy” vision.“It’s a gloomy vision. We’re about the American Dream. All about the American Dream. The greatest country in the world,” he said.Trump alleged that Biden is totally controlled by the radical, socialist Left.“This country will never be a socialist country. Never. One of the most stunning moments last night was when Joe Biden admitted that he wants to abolish the oil industry,” he said.And Biden’s running mate Senator Kamala Harris, he alleged, is a “super radical Left”.“She’s against fracking. If they get in they’ll end your energy independence. We have energy independence right now. They will end it very quickly,” he said.Trump said that during the debate, Biden outlined a plan to create socialized medicine, “raiding Medicare to fund his government takeover”. “Biden’s running mate, the most liberal member of the US Senate, and by the way Kamala will not be your first female President. She will not be your first female President,” he said. “It’s not the way it’s supposed to be. We’re not supposed to have a socialist, we’re not gonna be a Socialist nation. We’re not gonna have a socialist President, especially a female socialist President. We’re not gonna have it. We’re not gonna put up with it. It’s not gonna happen,” Trump said. “Socialist healthcare programs like the one supported by Biden and Harris always end up denying coverage to the sick and the elderly in order to reduce the soaring cost,” the President alleged. “Our opponents want to turn America into a Communist Cuba, into a socialist Venezuela. If you look at the ideology that these people are talking about, take a look at Portland with the anarchists all over the place,” he said. If Biden wins, he alleged, the radical Left will “transform this country into something that people will not recognize”. They want to “shatter” the middle class with trillions of dollars in new taxes and pack the Supreme Court with far-Left judges, Trump said. “If you want your grandchildren to grow up in a free nation where they can speak their minds and pursue the American dream, you must defeat sleepy Biden and the radical Left. You have to do it,” Trump said. Biden, he claimed, does not have a clue, but is surrounded by people who have got some problems. “You gotta reject the Left-wing fascism and vote for American freedom. Our country is set to be greater than ever before. Watch. Watch. We’re set,” he said. Referring to the comments made by Biden that America is entering a dark winter, Trump said his rival is “trying to scare people”. “He’s trying to get something cause he’s been such a failure at every level of government that this is something. But what they don’t remember is the swine flu and how bad it was. I bring that up whenever I can. But we’re not entering a dark winter. We’re entering the final turn in approaching the light at the end of the tunnel. That’s the way I look at it,” he asserted.Trump said he is working to make available for free to anybody that needs the antibody treatment that he received. He said he felt like a superman after being treated with that medicine.“You will get a vaccine that ends the epidemic or the pandemic, and it ends it and eradicates it. But without it, it goes away, but with it, it goes away faster, and it’s going to happen very, very soon. You’re going to have it very soon,” the President hoped.“But under Biden’s plan, Americans will be locked down for years. The cure will be worse than the problem itself,” Trump said.Biden, he said, will “trap” America in nothing but endless Middle East wars and other wars. “I did more in 47 months than sleepy Biden did in 47 years. That’s true,” Trump claimed.“A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s a vote for the American Dream. Over the next four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already started,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/november-3-poll-choice-between-super-recovery-and-joe-biden-depression-donald-trump/story-NPlvqXI9Tus6pTq4P2zk0K.html
24-10-2020||World||Kamala Harris calls president Donald Trump a ‘racist’||Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris called Donald Trump a “racist” and said his racism is a “pattern”, as she cited the President questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor Barack Obama. “People have asked me, Do you think he’s a racist?” Harris told a crowd at an outdoor rally at Morehouse College in the US state of Georgia. “Yeah. Yeah,” she said, answering the question, according to a report in The New York Times. “Because you see, it’s not like it’s some random one-off,” she said. “We’ve seen that pattern. Going back to him questioning the legitimacy of Barack Obama. Going back to Charlottesville,” she said, adding that Trump had said “there are fine people on both sides.”  Harris, Joe Biden’s running mate, said America needs a President who “acknowledges systemic racism, history of America and uses that bully pulpit and that microphone in a way that speaks truth with an intention to address the inequities and bring our country together.” The report said polls are showing Democratic Presidential candidate Biden tied with Trump in Georgia. With less than two weeks to go for the elections, Harris urged the crowd to honour civil rights leaders by voting. “It has to do with those men and women who shed blood on Edmund Pettus Bridge and so many other places,” she said. “We’re not going to let anyone mess with our right to vote.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-calls-president-donald-trump-a-racist/story-L8WoiEhH1Nk8vGT9rNcXCI.html
24-10-2020||World||Erdogan’s Turkey sole supporter of Pak for removal from Grey List at FATF Paris Plenary||Turkey was the only country out of 39 members of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which spoke for Pakistan to be removed from the Grey List at the Paris Plenary meeting on Friday.The Pakistan-Turkey growing equation is development of a new found radical Islamic axis seeking to upstage the established order led by Saudi Arabia. Turkey led by Racep Tayyip Erdogan, who is trying to revive the Ottoman empire legacy for his political sustenance, along with Pakistani deep state are sending irregulars to Azerbaijan in the age old conflict with Armenia.According to diplomats based in Paris and Brussels, all the countries except Turkey were in favour of retaining Pakistan in the Grey List for the lack of compliance with all the deadlines expired. For the record Pakistan addressed only 21 out of 27 action plan items with another review looming in February 2021. The Paris Plenary was held between October 21-23.While in the meeting of International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) before the Plenary, Turkey, China and Saudi Arabia spoke for Pakistan to be removed from the Grey List on technical grounds, only Turkey was left to support its new friend Pakistan in the Plenary.“Turkey has been fomenting trouble everywhere from Iraq, Syria to Libya and Azerbaijan. They, along with Pakistan, with ISI and military experience of organizing terrorism and Islamist insurgencies, are at the sharp edge of violence, instability and unrest in different parts of the world,” said a Middle-East watcher.Like Pakistan, Turkey is a pariah state at odds with Russia over Syria and Armenia-Azerbaijan, with US for buying Russian weapons, with EU over migrant issues and with India over its uncalled interference in Jammu and Kashmir. Istanbul has hardly any relations with Beijing even though the former being a major trade power. Pakistan depends on Turkey for defence cooperation and for making statement against India on the J & K issue.While Pakistan’s FATF Grey List case comes up for review in February 2021, all anti-India terrorists groups and mafia dons are based in that country, be it 1993 Mumbai blast accused Dawood Ibrahim, 2008 Mumbai massacre accused Hafiz Saeed and 2016 Pathankot air base attack accused Masood Azhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-s-turkey-sole-supporter-of-pak-for-removal-from-grey-list-at-fatf-paris-plenary/story-LjYBAT94ILijqGkNthnllI.html

The claim that the virus that causes Covid-19 could spread to North Korea from the Gobi desert, 1,900 km (1,200 miles) away, appears unsupported. Two metres (6 feet) is a common social-distancing metric, although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says droplets containing the virus can sometimes linger in the air for hours.The North Korean newspaper said citizens should refrain from outdoor activities and must follow prevention guidelines such as wearing masks when they go outside. North Korea has reported no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, a claim that health experts question. Pyongyang has imposed strict border controls and quarantine measures to prevent an outbreak. Analysts say an outbreak could be devastating for the economically and politically isolated country.State-run KRT television said on Wednesday the yellow dust and fine dust may contain harmful substances, such as heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms including viruses.“People must pay attention to personal hygiene after returning from outside,” a news reader said. “Also, workers should avoid outdoor construction work even at reconstruction sites.” On Thursday, the Russian embassy in North Korea wrote on Facebook that North Korea’s Foreign Ministry had ordered all visitors to the country and its staff to wait out the dust storm inside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-china-dust-could-spread-covid-19-warns-people-to-stay-inside/story-HZM9UJHBkddigsDLlhAk0L.html

And I was the only one who said no way. That’s a phony guy. And I don’t find him funny.”Trump said the incident happened about 15 years ago, meaning he was likely referring to Baron Cohen’s 2003 interview with him while playing Ali G, where the wannabe gangster pitches his latest business venture to Trump -- special gloves for eating ice cream. “To me he was a creep,” Trump said.While the plot of the new Borat film is under wraps, word of Baron Cohen’s latest outrageous ambushes on unsuspecting participants has spread like wildfire.On Wednesday Giuliani issued an angry denial after being tricked into a fake hotel room “interview” with a young woman.In the film, the encounter appears to leave the 76-year-old former New York mayor in a highly compromising situation, caught with his hands down his pants in the bedroom.Giuliani said Wednesday the scene was “a complete fabrication.”“I was tucking in my shirt after taking off the recording equipment. At no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate,” he tweeted.“If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.”Trump made the comments after taking off from Pensacola, Florida on his way to West Palm Beach.The Republican president, former reality TV star and real estate mogul launched an intense last-ditch reelection push Friday in Florida.Polls show him well behind Democratic challenger Joe Biden ahead of the November 3 presidential election.jca-mjs/rma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-no-fan-of-sacha-baron-cohen-says-to-me-he-was-a-creep/story-nJmiIfvpTFcHdpr27I9juK.html

Given China’s increasingly aggressive behavior across the India-Pacific from the Himalayas to the South China Sea, it’s more important than ever that we work with like-minded partners such as India.” Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is the informal strategic dialogue between India, USA, Japan and Australia. Earlier this week, India had announced the participation of Australia in the upcoming Malabar exercise alongside the US and Japan.Talking to media persons, the State Department official said the foundational concept behind the Quad is one of the vibrant democracies working together towards a common vision of a free and open India-Pacific region. The official further said that Quad is not an alliance and there’s no reciprocal obligation among the countries who are involved. “Well, on the Quad, I should tell you it’s not an alliance. You mentioned that - you said it was an alliance and I want to push back on that. There’s nothing about the Quad that is an alliance. It doesn’t have - it is not formalized. There’s no reciprocal obligation among the countries that are involved. It’s not an organization that solicits membership,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/working-with-like-minded-partners-essential-to-contain-china-says-us/story-JTy2tCPETxmw6cxTPdxEiO.html
24-10-2020||World||Always felt deeply connected to Indian American community, says Joe Biden||I have always felt deeply connected to the Indian American community because of the values we share which were passed down from my Irish ancestors who risked everything for a better life in America, said Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.In an op-ed for Indiawest, Biden said he “always felt deeply connected to the Indian American community because of the values we share: duty to family and elders, treating people with respect and dignity, self-discipline, service, and hard work.”“For me, these values were passed down from my Irish ancestors who risked everything for a better life in America, and they have shaped me as a son, brother, husband, father, grandfather, and a man of faith and a lifelong public servant,” he said.He further talked about the stories he has exchanged with Indian American staff over the years, about their families’ sacrifice.“And I’ve seen how those shared values, that immigrant story, forged my lasting relationship with Indian American constituents in Delaware and with Indian American staff both in the United States Senate and in the Obama-Biden Administration, where we’d exchange stories of our families’ sacrifice and marvel that only in America would we be living their dream,” he said.On her running mate Kamala Harris, Biden said that she “is smart, tested, and prepared. But another thing that makes Kamala so inspiring is her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. We feel Kamala’s pride when she talks about her. She was from Chennai, where her father, Kamala’s grandfather, was active in the fight for Indian independence.”Slamming US President Donald Trump, he said “President Trump doesn’t share our values. As a result, today’s America doesn’t feel like the America of our dreams.”“We value education, courage, and resilience. But faced with the deadly pandemic, Donald Trump panicked. He is erratic. He doesn’t believe in science or respect experts like Dr. Fauci. His negligence has cost lives and livelihoods and the pandemic is worsening with Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations increasing across the country.”The final debate between Trump and Biden took place at the Curb Event Center at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee on Friday. The election is scheduled for November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/always-felt-deeply-connected-to-indian-american-community-says-joe-biden/story-XEZ5istb7J7MgsUt3Wq5aK.html
24-10-2020||World||Trump says virus spike ‘gone’ in Texas while El Paso surges||President Donald Trump downplayed the toll of the coronavirus during Thursday’s final debate with Joe Biden, and specifically mentioned tamping down the surge in Texas.“There was a very big spike in Texas, it’s now gone,” Trump said.But in the border city of El Paso, Covid-19 is the worst it’s been since the pandemic began.Health officials in the El Paso area reported 969 new coronavirus cases Friday, leading to more than 10,000 active cases in the region as figures soared over the past week to record highs. Hospitalizations increased by 107 over Thursday, bringing the total to 678 total, with 195 of those people in intensive care.At least 571 people in the area have died since the pandemic began.Local officials have tightened virus restrictions, cutting back capacity at non-essential businesses to 50 per cent, stopping visitations at facilities that care for the elderly, and banning home gatherings — the first major county in Texas to scale back since Gov. Greg Abbott loosened rules in September.The virus is taking a toll on the mostly Hispanic area in more ways than one, according to Salvador Perches, CEO of Perches Funeral Homes, which does business in El Paso and neighbouring Juarez, Mexico. Families are asking for bodies to be transferred across the border as the death tolls rise in the US and Mexico, Perches added, noting that he has added a refrigeration unit inside one of his chapels to accommodate the growing number of bodies.Over the last two to three weeks, Perches said he has seen an increase in requests for funeral services, not only due to Covid-19 deaths, but also untreated health conditions and suicides because of depression from isolation and job loss.“People can’t celebrate their loves ones, we can’t mourn,” Perches said.Dr. Hector Ocaranza, the city and county health authority, called the situation critical. An additional 500 medical personnel plus medical equipment sent by Abbott helps, but he said it is necessary for El Paso residents to “realize we are in a dire situation” and take personal responsibility to stop the spread.“The spike in El Paso has continued,” Ocaranza said, noting that other Texas metropolitan areas aren’t seeing the same surge. “El Paso, we are in a different situation and we continue to see the rise.”El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said because the county is isolated from other metropolitan areas, it is easy for the rest of the Texas to be blind to El Paso. He added that they have reached out to neighbouring cities in Texas and New Mexico in addition to coordinating with the Mexican embassy and Juarez mayor Armando Cabada, who recently tested positive to Covid-19, to mitigate the spread together.Samaniego said he will work with state leaders to revisit increasing restrictions in the county in two weeks if the latest restrictions don’t help as much as they hope.Covid-19’s resurgence throughout the US is again pushing some hospitals to the limit, and the nation is approaching a record for the number of new daily coronavirus cases. The seven-day rolling average for new daily Covid-19 cases in the US surpassed 61,140 Thursday, compared with 44,647 two weeks ago. The record was reached July 22 when the rolling average was 67,293 in the midst of a summer outbreak driven largely by surges of the virus in Florida, Arizona, California, and Texas.More than 17,000 people have died in Texas since the start of the pandemic.Cecilia Sobalvarro, 57, lives in El Paso and said it was difficult for her to not be with her brother and nephews when her sister-in-law died of cancer on Monday.“Us not being able to be there for her and to say goodbye over the phone, it is heart-wrenching and it takes a toll on you because we want to be there for her,” Sobalvarro added. “But of course we couldn’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-virus-spike-gone-in-texas-while-el-paso-surges/story-dpyjbVf1sEjtJc9UoFmyAL.html
24-10-2020||World||Some hospitals in crisis as US nears high for Covid-19 cases||The United States is approaching a record high number of new daily coronavirus cases in the latest ominous sign about the disease’s grip on the nation, as states from Connecticut to Idaho reel under the surge.The impact is being felt in every section of the country, a lockdown starting Friday at the Ogala Sioux Tribe’s reservation in South Dakota, a plea by a Florida health official for a halt to children’s birthday parties, and an increasingly desperate situation at a hospital in northern Idaho, which is running out of space for patients and considering airlifts to Seattle or Portland.“We’ve essentially shut down an entire floor of our hospital. We’ve had to double rooms. We’ve bought more hospital beds,” said Dr. Robert Scoggins, a pulmonologist at the Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d’Alene. “Our hospital is not built for a pandemic.” Among those joining Scoggins at a meeting of northern Idaho’s Panhandle Health District was board member Walk Kirby.“People are dying, they’re going to keep dying and catching this stuff,” Kirby said. “How many people won’t wear a mask? The same people that won’t get vaccinated for it.”The seven-day rolling average for new daily Covid-19 cases in the US surpassed 61,140 Thursday, compared to 44,647 two weeks ago.The record was reached July 22 when the rolling average was 67,293 in the midst of a summer outbreak driven largely by surges of the virus in Florida, Texas, Arizona, and California.The U.S. recorded 71,671 new cases Thursday, with several states setting records across the Midwest and West.The surge in the United States mirrors a similarly widespread spike in Europe, where Rome, Paris and other major cities are reining in nightlife as part of the increasingly drastic measures undertaken to slow the spread of the pandemic. In the Netherlands, a helicopter flew a Dutch Covid-19 patient to an intensive care unit in Germany, the first such international airlift since the pandemic first threatened to swamp Dutch hospitals in the spring.The head of the World Health Organization(WHO) warned that countries in the Northern Hemisphere are at a “critical juncture” as cases and deaths continue to rise.“The next few months are going to be very tough and some countries are on a dangerous track,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a press briefing on Friday.Some of the latest developments in the United States: South Dakota- In South Dakota, the Oglala Sioux Tribe ordered a one-week lockdown of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in response to a surging number of Covid-19 cases in the state. Through the morning of Oct. 30, all non-essential travel is banned and non-essential businesses must close.The tribe posted on its Twitter page that there were 391 active Covid-19 cases as of Thursday on the reservation, which has about 20,000 residents.The lockdown comes as South Dakota surpassed 9,000 active coronavirus cases on Thursday and reported an all-time high of 973 new cases in one day.Florida- The top health official in one of Florida’s most populous counties discouraged parents from hosting birthday parties for their children, no matter the size.Dr. Raul Pino, a state health officer in Orange County, said half of the 30 attendees at a recent Sweet 16 party in the Orlando area came down with the virus. Last month, an Orange County high school closed for two weeks after students who had attended a birthday party tested positive.“Those parties will not only affect those people participating in that activity, but also everyone else they come into contact with when they leave,” said Pino. “We will continue to see consequences if we don’t act super responsibly.”  Massachusetts- Massachusetts on Friday implemented a two-week shutdown of indoor ice skating facilities across the state in response to several Covid-19 clusters linked to ice hockey games and practices.There have been at least 30 clusters of Covid-19 , resulting in 108 confirmed cases, associated with organized hockey activities involving residents from more than 60 cities and towns, according to the state Department of Public Health.College and professional programs are exempt from the order.Texas- In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott is sending more medical reinforcements to the El Paso area in response to a surge of coronavirus infections. The Texas Department of State Health Services and the Texas Division of Emergency Management will provide more medical personnel and equipment this week.El Paso County reported 3,750 new coronavirus infections this week, including 1,161 on Thursday. That number accounts for 17.5 per cent of the 21,321 cases reported this week by the state’s 254 counties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-hospitals-in-crisis-as-us-nears-high-for-covid-19-cases/story-VftKPBFsUMzhXrhQFXqMFP.html
24-10-2020||World||People in China are travelling across the country amid global pandemic. Here’s why||Amid the ongoing global pandemic, people in China are travelling across the country not because travel restrictions have been eased as the Covid-19 wave ebbed in the country, but in search of vaccine shot. As the country is offering experimental vaccine shots in select places, reports claim that people who are planning to leave the country for education and business purposes are travelling to those places. China launched its emergency vaccine programme in July for essential workers. Now it has broadened the programme and Zhejiang’s Shaoxing residents aged between 18 and 59 can now apply online for inoculation, which will cost 400 yuan (60 dollars) for two doses, with an additional fee of 28 yuan per dose. China’s Zhejiang has become the first Chinese province to offer inoculation to non-priority residents. Zhejiang’s Yiwu is also offering voluntary vaccine shots. For these vaccine shots, which are still under trial, the applicants have to mention why they need emergency vaccine. China’s Global Times has, however, said the Covid-19 vaccine shots are “restricted to key groups with urgent need”. “Local residents who come to seek advice could leave their names and contact information and wait for further notice,” it said quoting a health worker from Jiaxing in Zhejiang.It added that the emergency use strictly follows the review procedure in China as well as WHO rules, and has been reported to the WHO for ratification, quoting Zheng Zhongwei, an official from the National Health Commission in charge of technology development.Three vaccine manufacturers in China, Sinovac, Sinopharm and CanSino, have been conducting clinical trials in Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, the UAE, Egypt, Russia and Pakistan, recruiting hundreds and thousands of volunteers, Global Times said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-in-china-are-travelling-across-the-country-amid-global-pandemic-here-s-why/story-X7Rvta2VhvxGbTQJQOAlsL.html
24-10-2020||World||Quad aimed at promoting rules-based order in Indo Pacific region: US||Quad -- comprising Japan, India, Australia and the United States --- is not an alliance but a grouping of countries which are interested in strengthening a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region, the US has said.The four countries had in 2017 given shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the “Quad” or the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. “There’s nothing about the Quad that it is an alliance. It is not formalized. There’s no reciprocal obligation among the countries who are involved. It’s not an organization that solicits membership,” a senior administration official said during a conference call with reporters ahead of the next week’s 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue between India and the US. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Defence Secretary Mark Esper are travelling to India to hold talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh. The visiting American officials would also be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi. To a query, the official said the Quad ministerial meeting that they had in Tokyo in October just demonstrated the strong ties among the Indo-Pacific democracies. “I would say it’s a grouping of countries who are interested in strengthening a rules-based order in which all nations are sovereign, strong, and prosperous. It’s an opportunity for us to carry out continued dialogue and to work towards mutually agreed-upon outcomes. “It’s a grouping of countries that’s driven by shared interests and values rather than binding obligations. That’s an example of effective multilateralism at its best,” the official said, requesting anonymity. As the US, Japan, Australia, and India are getting together to cooperate on one issue or another, if there are other countries that want to participate in those discussions or those activities, the door is always open, the official said. The cooperation of the US and India on the Quad along with Australia and Japan really reflect a convergence of common values and interests in the region, the official said. “We’re the two largest democracies in the Indo-Pacific region, and we have shared values and interests with all four countries. It’s not an exclusive grouping by any means. All four countries are interested and eager in welcoming other countries to the table for individual elements of cooperation that we do, some of them under the Quad framework but not all of them. That’s for sure,” the official said. “It is something that’s flexible and reflects our common values and interests, and I think is really for the long term,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-aimed-at-promoting-rules-based-order-in-indo-pacific-region-us/story-LEkNyiGv4CAJ3SI2XPdO7I.html
24-10-2020||World||2 onboard US Navy training plane killed in Alabama crash||A US Navy training plane that took off from Florida crashed Friday in an Alabama residential neighbourhood near the Gulf Coast, killing both people in the plane, authorities said. Zach Harrell, a spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Forces, said both people in the T-6B Texan II training plane died, but they weren’t immediately releasing their names. No injuries were reported on the ground. Foley Fire Chief Joey Darby said responders encountered a “large volume of fire” with a home and several cars engulfed in flames. Firefighters were able to make “a quick stop on the fire,” the chief told local news outlets. The crash occurred southeast of Mobile, near the city of Foley and the town of Magnolia Springs. Darby called the neighbourhood a “heavily populated” residential area. No firefighters were injured, he added. The plane had flown out of Naval Air Station Whiting Field, about 48.28 kilometers northeast of Pensacola, Florida, Navy spokeswoman Julie Ziegenhorn said. The US Department of Defence and the Navy were set to handle the investigation, the Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-2-onboard-training-plane-killed-in-alabama-crash/story-dH9jaEbzHbFa3Lw2brz2XM.html

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak a ‘pandemic’ in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-tally-crosses-42-million-mark/story-zPiYMrDWEaPMGyuI6H7dJM.html
24-10-2020||World||White House race enters last mile||Having wrapped up their final debate, US President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden began a sprint through the final 11 days of the race for the White House on Friday.Trump will hold two rallies in the battleground state of Florida, where Biden holds a thin 1.5% lead in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. He also plans to vote in person on Saturday in Florida.Biden will deliver a speech in his home state of Delaware on his plans for leading a recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.With 11 days to go for the polling to end, more than 51 million Americans have already cast ballots - a pace that could lead to the highest turnout since 1928. The turnout by Friday morning accounts for 21% of the 240 million eligible voters and more than 36% of the total votes in the 2016 election, according to the South University of Florida tracker of early votes.On Friday, Trump believed he “did great” in the final debate. “It’s two different styles,” he told reporters of his disciplined performance in contrast to the first debate on September 29 in which he had constantly interrupted Biden and talked over him and the moderator. “I can do different styles.”The White House on Thursday released raw footage from an interview that Trump did with 60 Minutes reporter Lesley Stahl, breaking an agreement with CBS channel to keep material from the highly anticipated clash private until an edited version could air this weekend.The footage shows Stahl asking direct questions and refuting some of Trump’s answers on topics, including health care and the government’s response to the pandemic. “Look at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS,” Trump said in post on his Twitter profile, with a link to his Facebook page, where he posted the nearly 38-minute interview. The White House had kept a single-frame copy of the interview, in which only Trump is visible but Stahl can be heard asking questions. It shows Trump repeatedly asking Stahl and her employer, CBS News, to ask tough questions of Biden. CBS News blasted Trump’s “unprecedented decision” to disregard an agreement to keep the footage private, but said the move would not defer the show “from providing its full, fair and contextual reporting which presidents have participated in for decades”.On Thursday, the US sanctioned five Iranian entities for attempting to interfere in the US elections. Authorities suspect elements of Iranian government “disguised as news organisations or media outlets, have targeted” the election. “The Iranian regime uses false narratives and other misleading content to attempt to influence US elections,” treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said. Top US national security officials on Wednesday warned of election interference attempts by Iran and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-race-enters-last-mile/story-TbimD7bBjqtxIlV6BgoccK.html

But scepticism over whether the agreement would hold began emerging almost immediately.The breakthrough, which among other things orders foreign mercenaries out of the country, sets the stage for political talks in November to find a lasting solution to the chaos unleashed after a 2011 Nato-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.Previous diplomatic initiatives to end the conflict have repeatedly collapsed - but the UN-brokered deal aims to cement a months-long lull in fighting and gives a boost to the political process. “I am honoured to be among you today to witness a moment that will go down in history,” Stephanie Turco Williams, the top UN envoy for Libya who led mediation talks this week, said at the signing in Geneva. She did, however, express some caution, noting that a “long and difficult” road remains ahead.It’s not clear how the cease-fire will be enforced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-s-warring-factions-sign-un-brokered-permanent-ceasefire/story-hGY8XEU2LnCeawiuy5PoUL.html

A US astronaut cast her ballot from the International Space Station on Thursday, making her voice heard in the presidential election despite being 408km above the Earth.“From the International Space Station: I voted today,” crew member Kate Rubins, who began a six-month stint aboard the orbiting station last week, said on Nasa’s Twitter account.The post featured a photo of Rubins, her hair floating in the zero-gravity environment, in front of an enclosure with a sign that reads “ISS voting booth”.Rubins and Nasa described the process as a form of absentee voting. A secure electronic ballot generated by a clerk’s office in Harris County, home of Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, was sent up via email to the ISS. Rubins filled out the ballot in the email and it was downlinked and delivered back to the clerk’s office.Rubins had cast her vote from the ISS during the 2016 election as well. “We consider it an honour to be able to vote from space,” she said in a video before she and two Russian cosmonauts launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on October 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronaut-votes-from-space/story-znQ8Glr9iXoN4TzYeHSyRJ.html

Originally scheduled for this month, the COP15 negotiation of nearly 200 countries is tasked with setting new goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-measures-will-not-save-nature-warn-world-s-leading-scientists/story-fbJP9HD4CAlZBk7GMoZhxK.html

Even if mask compliance was only 85%, lives saved compared to that baseline would still top 95,000, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine. In mid-July, IHME modellers accurately predicted 224,000 deaths by November 1.The EU’s disease control agency on Friday joined frantic health workers across Europe in sounding the alarm about the surge in coronavirus infections.Several countries in Europe are reporting infection rates higher than during the first wave of the pandemic in March and April, with Spain saying it has more than three million cases. Governments across the continent are slapping urgent new restrictions, with France extending a curfew to cover 46 million people and Ireland locked down again.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said all EU countries except Cyprus, Estonia, Finland and Greece fell into a “serious concern” category, as did the UK.In Britain, a government-led project said traces of the virus have been detected in sewage, providing an early warning for outbreaks in local areas or institutions across the UK.Pope Francis has been warned of potential exposure to Covid-19 after a Vatican diplomat was infected, Australian media reported. Archbishop Adolfo Tito Yllana had a meeting with Francis at the Vatican on October 6, less than two weeks before he tested positive in Australia.The World Health Organization is preparing guidelines on use of the drug remdesivir for Covid-19 and may release them in three to four weeks.

24-10-2020||World||Joe Biden pledges free Covid vaccine for ‘everyone’ in US if elected||Democrat Joe Biden said Friday that if elected president he would mandate coronavirus vaccines be free for all Americans, part of a national strategy to “get ahead of this virus.”“Once we have a safe and effective vaccine, it has to be free to everyone -- whether or not you’re insured,” Biden said in a speech laying out his pandemic response plan just 11 days before the US presidential election. President Donald Trump, who trails Biden in the polls, has also stressed that a vaccine -- which he says will be ready in the coming weeks -- should be free.But Democrats led by Biden have hammered Trump for failing to lay out and implement a nationwide response to a pandemic that has now killed more than 223,000 Americans.“Covid-19 dwarfs anything that we’ve faced in recent history, and it isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. The virus is surging in almost every state,” Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. “We’re more than eight months into this crisis and the president still doesn’t have a plan,” the 77-year-old former vice president said.“He’s given up. He’s quit on you. He’s quit on your family. He’s quit on America.”Biden said that if elected he would “immediately” put in place a national strategy “to finally get ahead of this virus, and get back our lives.”That would include consulting governors of all 50 states during the presidential transition. Were he to take office, Biden would urge Congress to pass a major bill outlining everything needed to combat the virus, implement a national mask mandate in federal buildings and interstate transportation and implement a national testing plan equivalent to a seven-fold increase over today’s testing level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-pledges-free-covid-vaccine-for-everyone-in-us-if-elected/story-HBiZ0sbdX9myoexIjIPuIM.html
24-10-2020||World||Astrazeneca cleared by US regulators to resume vaccine trial||AstraZeneca Plc, the U.K. drugmaker developing a Covid-19 vaccine with the University of Oxford, has been cleared by U.S. regulators to restart a trial halted in the country for more than a month on concerns about a volunteer who became ill.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the trial to resume Friday, according to statements from AstraZeneca and Oxford. The FDA reviewed data from global studies and decided it was safe to begin testing again, the partners said.The decision removes a significant impediment for the partners trying to get their coronavirus shot across the line. They are among the front-runners in the global quest for a vaccine, along with developers such as Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. Astra’s U.S. trial will test the shot on 30,000 volunteers, taking the total number of participants in advanced trials for the jab to 50,000, according to Oxford.“We should be reassured by the care taken by independent regulators to protect the public and ensure the vaccine is safe before it is approved for use,” Pascal Soriot, the drugmaker’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. This “allows us to continue our efforts to develop this vaccine to help defeat this terrible pandemic.”A representative for the FDA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Unprecedented SpeedTrials of the Astra-Oxford vaccine resumed weeks ago outside the U.S., in countries including the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. Symptoms that prompted the partners to pause the studies were unlikely to be linked to the shot, or there was insufficient evidence to say for sure, according to documents sent to participants. The safety reviews began after volunteers developed unexplained neurological symptoms including limb weakness or “changed sensation,” a document posted by Oxford shows.Tests to decide whether experimental Covid-19 shots are safe and effective are progressing at an unprecedented speed as drugmakers and governments look for a way out of the crisis. The virus has continued to advance, killing more than 1.1 million people worldwide.Results from the late-stage trials of the Astra-Oxford shot are expected later this year, and will depend on local rates of infection where the studies are taking place, according to Astra.The British pharmaceutical company faced a flurry of headlines this week when it emerged that a participant in the Brazil vaccine trial had died. It was quickly determined the volunteer was in the control arm of the study and hadn’t received the shot. Brazil’s health authority said an international committee had reviewed the event and the trial would continue.Another vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, said in mid-October that it would pause its trial to investigate an illness in a study participant. Operation Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui said in an interview earlier this week that both the Astra and J&J trials could resume in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-cleared-by-us-regulators-to-resume-vaccine-trial/story-xgDrEvMUeVravpH4tilq2K.html
