12-10-2020||World||Coronavirus may stay for weeks on banknotes and touchscreens||The new coronavirus may remain infectious for weeks on banknotes, glass and other common surfaces, according to research by Australia’s top biosecurity laboratory that highlights risks from paper currency, touchscreen devices and grab handles and rails.Scientists at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness showed SARS-CoV-2 is “extremely robust,” surviving for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as glass found on mobile phone screens and plastic banknotes at room temperature, or 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit). That compares with 17 days survival for the flu virus.Virus survival declined to less than a day at 40 degrees Celsius on some surfaces, according to the study, published in Virology Journal. The findings add to evidence that the Covid-19-causing coronavirus survives for longer in cooler weather, making it potentially harder to control in winter than summer. The research also helps to more accurately predict and mitigate the pandemic’s spread, the scientists said.“Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious on surfaces for long periods of time, reinforcing the need for good practices such as regular hand washing and cleaning surfaces,” said co-author Debbie Eagles, the center’s deputy director, in an emailed statement Monday.The coronavirus is transmitted mostly through direct contact with an infected person, especially the virus-laden particles they emit while coughing, sneezing, speaking, singing and even breathing. SARS-CoV-2 may also contaminate surfaces when these particles settle, creating so-called fomites that the researchers said may play a lesser, though important role in transmission of the virus.“It does raise some critical issues around the need to keep on disinfecting surfaces, even when community cases are low,” said Trevor Drew, the center’s director and another co-author, in an interview. “We still need to carry out those disinfection regimes, both personally and at a public level, even when there don’t seem to be any cases around because theremay well be some residual virus that you’ve missed.”SARS-CoV-2 spread via fomites is plausible, researchers at Kansas State University said in a study released ahead of publication and peer review in August. They analyzed the coronavirus’s stability on a dozen surfaces and found it survived five-to-seven times longer under cooler, less-humid spring/fall conditions compared with the average temperature and humidity in summer.‘Big Surprise’The finding bodes badly for controlling Covid-19 during the Northern Hemisphere winter, said virologist Juergen Richt, who led the research. “If we couldn’t control it very well during the summer, we are in for a big surprise,” Richt said in an interview.Scientists at the Australian government laboratory have determined virus survival previously for hundreds of different viruses. They found in the case of SARS-CoV-2 that it survives longer on nonporous or smooth surfaces, compared with porous complex surfaces, such as cotton.The research received funding from Australia’s defense department. It involved drying the coronavirus in an artificial mucus on different surfaces, at concentrations similar to those reported in samples from infected patients, and then re-isolating the virus over a month. The study was also carried out in the dark, to remove the effect of ultraviolet light, as research has demonstrated direct sunlight can rapidly inactivate the virus.The time taken to achieve a 90% reduction in the amount of virus present on the surfaces studied under different temperatures is tabled below:“While the precise role of surface transmission, the degree of surface contact and the amount of virus required for infection is yet to be determined, establishing how long this virus remains viable on surfaces is critical for developing risk mitigation strategies in high contact areas,” Eagles said.Transmission RiskThe persistence on glass is an important finding, given that touchscreen devices such as mobile phones, bank ATMs, supermarket self-serve checkouts and airport check-in kiosks are high touch surfaces which may not be regularly cleaned and therefore pose a transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, the researchers said in the paper.They found the longer survival time of SARS-CoV-2 than seasonal flu on banknotes “of particular significance, considering the frequency of circulation and the potential for transfer of viable virus both between individuals and geographic locations.”Before SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic, China had started decontaminating its paper currency, suggesting concerns over transmission via paper banknotes existed at the time, the researchers said, noting that the U.S. and South Korea have also quarantined bank notes as a result of the pandemic.The survival of the coronavirus on stainless steel at cooler temperatures may help explain Covid-19 outbreaks linked to meat processing and cold storage facilities, the authors said. Their data support the findings of a study showing the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on fresh and frozen food as well, they said.A reduction in temperature to about 6 degrees Celsius correlates with about a 10-fold increase in the virus’s survival, Drew said. Blood and oils associated with fresh meat and fish processing and handling may also help to preserve the virus.“It’s going to survive for much longer in cooler conditions, and that’s irrespective of whether it’s on a surface or whether it’s in the air,” Drew said. “This may help to explain why the sort of environments, such as slaughterhouses, would be potentially a more hazardous area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-may-stay-for-weeks-on-banknotes-and-touchscreens/story-bca77EGNC8p6rr6J9Z3QEM.html
12-10-2020||World||Health care is focus as Barrett Supreme Court hearing opens||Senate Democrats branded Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett a threat to Americans’ health care during the coronavirus pandemic Monday at the start of a fast-tracked hearing that Republicans are confident will end with Barrett’s confirmation to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before Election Day.In a competing effort to approvingly define the 48-year-old Barrett, who sat silent and wearing a face mask, Republican senators called President Donald Trump’s pick a thoughtful judge with impeccable credentials.Barring a dramatic development, Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm Barrett to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. If she is confirmed quickly she could be on the Supreme Court when it hears the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, a week after the election.One after another, Democrats sought to tie her nomination to the upcoming court case.“They are trying to get a justice onto the court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act,” said Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Harris, speaking from her Senate office because of Covid-19 concerns, also said the confirmation should not go forward so close to the election, especially after millions have voted.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said the nomination is a “judicial torpedo aimed” at the law’s protection for people with pre-existing health conditions among its provisions. The Trump administration wants the court to strike down the entire law popularly known as “Obamacare” on Nov. 10. Barrett has criticized the court’s two earlier major rulings supporting the law.Among Republicans, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, dismissed warnings Barrett will undo the Obama-era healthcare law as “outrageous.”Trump himself seemed to be watching, tweeting several times about the hearing. In one message, he tweeted that he’d have a “FAR BETTER” health care plan, with lower costs and protections for pre-existing conditions. But he has not, as yet, discussed an actual health care plan.Republicans also warned against making Barrett’s Catholicism an issue in the confirmation debate, especially in regard to her stance on abortion, with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri lambasting what he called a “pattern and practice of religious bigotry” by Democrats. However, Democratic senators made clear in advance of the hearing that they didn’t plan to question the judge on the specifics of her religious faith.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, also a practicing Catholic, told reporters ahead of a campaign trip to Ohio that he doesn’t think “there’s any question about her faith.”The Senate Judiciary Committee, meeting on a federal holiday, kicked off four days of statements and testimony in an environment that has been altered by the coronavirus pandemic. Some senators were taking part remotely, and the hearing room itself was arranged with health concerns in mind.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., opened the hearing acknowledging “the COVID problem in America is real.” But he said, “We do have a country that needs to move forward safely.”Graham acknowledged the obvious: “This is going to be a long, contentious week.”Protesters rallied outside the Senate buildings with the hearing room largely closed to the public. Capitol Police said 22 people were arrested and charged on suspicion of crowding, obstructing or other violations.Barrett, a federal appeals court judge, was to tell senators that she is “forever grateful” for Ginsburg’s trailblazing path as a woman. But she is resolved to maintain the perspective of her own mentor, the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and “apply the law as written,” according to her prepared opening remarks for the hearings.“Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” Barrett says in the remarks, which The Associated Press obtained.Republicans are moving at a breakneck pace to seat Barrett before the Nov. 3 election to secure Trump’s pick, which would put her on the bench for any election-related challenges.Democrats are trying in vain to delay the fast-track confirmation by raising fresh concerns about the safety of meeting during the pandemic after two GOP senators on the panel tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, one of those who tested positive, was in the hearing room Monday after his spokesman said he was symptom-free. The other affected senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, was participating remotely, though he too is symptom-free, his spokesman said. Both tested positive 10 days ago.Trump chose Barrett after the death last month of Ginsburg, a liberal icon. It’s the opportunity to entrench a conservative majority on the court for years to come with his third justice.Outside groups are pushing Democrats to make a strong case against what they call an illegitimate confirmation, when people are already voting in some states, saying the winner of the presidency should make the pick. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential contest.The country will get an extended look at Barrett over the next three days in hearings like none other during the heated election environment and the pandemic limiting public access.Faith and family punctuate her testimony, and she said would bring “a few new perspectives” as the first mother of school-age children on the nine-member court.Barrett says she uses her children as a test when deciding cases, asking herself how she would view the decision if one of her children were the party she was ruling against.“Even though I would not like the result, would I understand that the decision was fairly reasoned and grounded in the law?” she says in the prepared remarks.A Roman Catholic, she says she believes in the “power of prayer.” Barrett’s religious views and past leadership role in a Catholic faith community pose a challenge for Democrats as they try to probe her judicial approach to abortion, gay marriage and other social issues without veering into inappropriate questions of her faith.Ordinarily, Barrett would get to show off her family and seven children. But the White House event announcing her nomination, in which most of the audience did not wear masks, has been labeled a “superspreader” for the coronavirus.More than two dozen people linked to the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event, including the two GOP senators, have contracted COVID-19 since then. Barrett and her family went maskless at the event. She and her husband, Jesse, tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, two administration officials have said.Democrats already were enraged that Republicans are moving so quickly having refused to consider President Barack Obama nominee in February 2016, well before that year’s election.Barrett is the most openly anti-abortion Supreme Court nominee in decades and her vote could provide a majority to restrict if not overturn abortion rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-care-is-focus-as-barrett-supreme-court-hearing-opens/story-nAFboaeNtODSjYhXkyRYZM.html
12-10-2020||World||Iran shatters single-day record for new deaths, coronavirus cases||For the second day in a row, Iran shattered its single-day record for new deaths and infections from the coronavirus, with 272 people confirmed dead among more than 4,200 new cases on Monday.Like in many other countries, the spiraling outbreak in Iran reflects the government’s contradictory virus response. This month, as the daily recorded death toll reached the triple digits, authorities announced tighter restrictions for the hard-hit capital of Tehran. Recently reopened universities and schools, as well as libraries, mosques, cinemas, museums and beauty salons, shut down. On Saturday, the government mandated that all Tehran residents wear face masks outdoors and in public places, warning violators would be fined. Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei promised those who tested positive would be closely tracked.And yet enforcement and measures like contact-tracing in the country of 80 million remain a challenge. Those who disobey face fines of just 500,000 riyals, or $1.60, roughly the price of a burger downtown. Many residents, tired of staying home, now ignore the rules about masks and social distancing to pack indoor cafes and restaurants. As residents defy coronavirus precautions and the government resists a lockdown to salvage its economy, Iran’s caseload is skyrocketing.Iran’s health minister Saeed Namaki made an appeal on Sunday for harsher punishments, according to the state-run IRNA news agency, noting the meager fines for maskless residents would do nothing to boost vigilance. Lamenting that the health ministry’s 7,000 inspectors couldn’t handle the sprawling city of over 10 million, he empowered the police and Basij forces, a paramilitary wing of the Revolutionary Guard used for internal security, to help enforce pandemic rules. In the coming weeks, Namaki added, authorities plan to extend the mask mandate to other major cities.Iran emerged early in the pandemic as a global epicenter of the virus and has since seen the worst outbreak in the Middle East, with more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 28,800 deaths. Leaders first played down the virus’s risks and, as hospitals filled up, international experts suspected Iran was hiding the true number of infections and deaths. Authorities have since admitted that the outbreak is more severe than reported, with a recent parliamentary report putting the number of infections at “eight to 10 times” higher than official numbers.Movement restrictions this spring somewhat checked the spread of the disease. Then the government swiftly reopened the country, desperate to boost its stricken economy. Since June, the case count has steadily increased — and spiked to new heights in recent weeks.Long before the virus hit, Iran’s economy was ailing, pummeled by U.S. sanctions after the Trump administration’s unilateral withdrawal in 2018 from Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers. As the death toll soared on Sunday, the nation’s currency plunged to its lowest level ever, following the U.S. administration’s decision last week to blacklist Iranian banks that had so far escaped the bulk of re-imposed American sanctions.As in the White House, where U.S. President Donald Trump and a growing circle of his aides and staff recently tested positive for the coronavirus, the disease has spread to the highest levels of Iran’s government, even killing a senior adviser of the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A number of Cabinet ministers have contracted the virus, as well as top officials including senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri and Vice President Massoumeh Ebtekar. The head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who had urged the public not to panic over its spread was among the first officials to contract the virus in late February. On Sunday, local media reported the head of the country’s atomic energy organization and the country’s vice president in charge of budget and planning had also tested positive for the virus.Iran’s initial outbreak coincided with major political events — the 41st anniversary of its 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought its clerical leadership to power, as well as parliamentary elections in which the government desperately sought to boost turnout. Religious considerations also played a role in the Shiite theocracy as authorities declined for weeks to close shrines where the faithful touch or kiss the tombs’ protective bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-shatters-single-day-record-for-new-deaths-coronavirus-cases/story-Hiqnd7mgKAnEBDNXoNN5jM.html
12-10-2020||World||More UK areas under new Covid curbs as cases surge||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday unveiled a new three-tier system of local Covid-19 restrictions in north England as the number of cases and hospital admissions surged beyond those in March, when the first nationwide lockdown was imposed.The three levels of the new system are: One baseline, minimum restrictions applicable to all of England, fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 population; Two, triggered when a rise in transmission cannot be contained, cases above 100 per 100,000 population; Three, triggered when level two measures have not contained the virus, or when there has been a significant rise in transmission.There were 13,972 new cases as of Monday evening – nearly three times the daily peaks of April and May – and 50 new deaths. Overall, the number of UK-wide cases touched 617,688, with 42,875 deaths.Johnson set out the measures in the House of Commons as top government advisers went on television to describe the surge in its various dimensions and announced that emergency hospitals set up earlier this year are being put on stand-by to deal with new admissions.Johnson said he did not agree with those who recommended another national lockdown, since it would deprive children and students of education, among other social and economic implications. Instead, the three-tier system will be implemented at local levels.The Liverpool city region has been placed in Tier Three due to high infection rates in recent weeks, while Nottinghamshire and Cheshire are in Tier Two. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality centres in areas under Tier Three will remain closed.“I must warn the House the weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country,” Johnson told MPs. “I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed.” Labour leader Keir Starmer said he remained “deeply skeptical” of the new plans announced, adding he was not convinced that Johnson had a strategy to deal with the disease. Public confidence in the government had been eroded, he said.Three emergency hospitals – called ‘Nightingale’ hospitals – have been asked to stand by in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate, ready to admit people with Covid-19 or other conditions to relieve pressure on the National Health Service.In a briefing described a ‘grim’, government advisers Stephen Powis and Jonathan Van-Tam outlined the scale of new infections, deaths and hospital admissions. Van-Tam said: “Unfortunately the virus thrives on what we like most, which is human contact…We have increasingly strong evidence about shouting and singing as pressure points on the virus, in terms of making the expulsion of virus-laden particles go further and the transmission therefore to become more intense.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-uk-areas-under-new-covid-curbs-as-cases-surge/story-d6faDBJdODsQEKGK9EB32J.html

It is also Facebook’s latest attempt to take action against conspiracy theories and misinformation ahead of the US presidential election on November 3.“We’ve long taken down posts that praise hate crimes or mass murder, including the Holocaust. But with rising anti-Semitism, we’re expanding our policy to prohibit any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust as well. If people search for the Holocaust on Facebook, we’ll start directing you to authoritative sources to get accurate information,” Zuckerberg said in a blog post on Monday.Also read | Facebook set to tighten rules on what its staff can discussZuckerberg said that he believes the new policy strikes the “right balance” in drawing the lines between what is and isn’t acceptable speech. “I’ve struggled with the tension between standing for free expression and the harm caused by minimizing or denying the horror of the Holocaust. My own thinking has evolved as I’ve seen data showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies on hate speech,” he wrote.“Enforcement of these policies cannot happen overnight. There is a range of content that can violate these policies, and it will take some time to train our reviewers and systems on enforcement,” he said.

He was indicted last week in the Park Lane properties and Thatta water supply cases, and had pleaded not guilty.A spokesperson for Zardari said that doctors are conducting necessary medical tests in a private hospital in Karachi.Zardari is being tried in different corruption cases launched by the government through the anti-corruption watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).On October 5, an accountability court indicted Zardari in the Park Lane properties and Thatta water supply cases.During the hearing, the PPP leader pleaded not guilty. The court also indicted 19 other accused in the Park Lane and 15 accused in the Thatta water supply cases.On September 28, an Islamabad accountability court had indicted Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur, and other accused in a supplementary reference filed against them by NAB in a mega-money laundering scam.On September 23, the court had dismissed the ex-president’s applications seeking acquittal in the three supplementary references.Zardari’s hospitalisation comes ahead of a planned national agitation by a joint front of 11 Pakistani opposition parties, including his PPP, against the Imran Khan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-former-president-asif-ali-zardari-hospitalised/story-RqKIosA1yA0LFh62pSoDsM.html
12-10-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic leads to high level of stress, less employee engagement: Study||Researchers have suggested coronavirus pandemic may lead people to ponder their own mortality. This study suggested these people were the ones who showed the highest levels of stress and the least engagement at work. But the research also uncovered a bright spot: The right kind of boss helped reduce stress and increase engagement and pro-social behavior in their workers who were anxious about COVID-19.The researchers conducted three studies in China and the United States, which was published online recently in the Journal of Applied Psychology.“A global pandemic can lead some people to think about their own mortality, which will understandably make them more stressed and less engaged at work,” said Jia (Jasmine) Hu, lead author of the study and associate professor of management and human resources at The Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business.“But business leaders who are attentive to employees’ emotional needs and unite them behind a common purpose made a positive difference and helped workers stay engaged at work and contribute to their communities.”One study involved 163 workers at an information technology company in eastern China who filled out surveys twice a day over three weeks while cases of COVID-19 were surging in the country.The results projected that the employees felt more anxious on the thought about COVID-19 related deaths and the less engaged they were in their jobsBut the employees’ anxiety and engagement were influenced by the type of boss they had. Employees did better if their boss exhibited what is called ‘servant leadership.’ As the name implies, servant leaders prioritize fulfillment of others’ needs, attend to employees’ emotional suffering, work to empower employees, and emphasize serving the community.Employees in the study rated on a scale of 1 to 7 of how much ‘My supervisor makes my career development a priority’ and other statements that measured servant leadership.Those who rated their supervisors higher on servant leadership showed less anxiety and were more engaged with their jobs than other employees, Hu said.“Servant leaders care about their employees’ well-being and prioritize their personal growth and happiness at their jobs,” she said. “These types of leaders made it easier for their employees to deal with the anxiety associated with the pandemic.”But servant leaders did more than that, they helped their employees channel their stress into positive behaviors.The findings showed that employees who rated their bosses as higher on servant leadership were more likely to report that they engaged in pro-social behavior, such as volunteering for a charitable group in their community.“Servant leaders encouraged their employees to find meaning in the pandemic by channeling their anxiety into helping less fortunate people in their communities,” Hu said.These results were confirmed in two US studies in which participants were told to imagine they were consultants advising a retail company on how to increase sales. The researchers recruited Americans online who said they had full-time jobs.In both studies, the researchers had participants first read about COVID-19. Half read the information that was designed to make them think about how dangerous and deadly the disease is. The other half read less stressful information about COVID-19, such as how to prevent transmission.Half of the participants read a scenario in which their boss exhibited servant leadership and other half read a scenario in which their boss was less supportive.In one of the two studies, the researchers asked specifically about how much participants were worried about their own deaths.Results were similar to the study in the Chinese company.Those who read the more alarming news about COVID-19 reported more anxiety - general anxiety in study two and anxiety related to their own death in study three - than those who read the neutral news.But once again, in both American studies, those who had servant leaders in their scenarios showed less anxiety, even after reading about how deadly the disease was. Similarly, in Chinese employees, the type of leadership had an impact on pro-social behavior.Overall, the three studies showed that companies play an important role in helping their employees cope with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hu said, which benefits both the firms and their communities.“We found that the servant leaders who keep their employees’ well-being as a top concern can help their anxious workers stay engaged at work and encourage them to contribute to the broader community,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-leads-to-high-level-of-stress-less-employee-engagement-study/story-3gjqPM2rd5RmCU3RM3ZIyN.html

Lt Gen (retd) Asim Saleem Bajwa resigned as special assistant on information and broadcasting but will continue to be the chairperson of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority. Bajwa confirmed on Twitter that his request for stepping down as special assistant had been approved by Prime Minister Khan. The Pakistani premier had refused to accept the resignation when Bajwa put in his papers in August.“I requested the honourable Prime Minister to relinquish me from the additional portfolio of SAPM on Info & broadcasting. He very kindly approved my request,” Bajwa tweeted.On August 27, Facts Focus—a website run by local journalists—published a story claiming that Bajwa’s family had set up 99 companies spanning four countries, including a pizza franchise with 133 outlets.The website further claimed that Bajwa’s wife was a shareholder in at least 86 companies. Of them, 71 were set up in the US, seven in the UAE and four in Canada. In response, in an extensive statement shared on Twitter, Bajwa said all the allegations levelled against him and his family in the report were “materially false”.Bajwa has earlier served as director general of the military’s public relations wing –the Inter-Services Public Relations—from 2012 to 2016 and as commander of the Pakistan Army’s southern command before his retirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-s-close-aide-resigns-after-investigative-report-on-wealth/story-nDpi7e9ccZbsUSXHjEYVGM.html
12-10-2020||World||FATF regional group keeps Pak in ‘follow-up list’ as govt dials friendly countries||FATF’s regional group for Asia-Pacific has retained Pakistan in its ‘Enhanced Follow Up’ list due to the country’s poor compliance on terror financing and money laundering.Pakistan fully complied with only two of the 40 recommendations of Financial Action Task Force, said the 14-page follow-up report from the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) released on Monday ahead of the FATF plenary on October 21-23. That meeting will decide if Pakistan should be retained on the Paris-based watchdog’s ‘grey list’.Based on its review until February this year, the APG noted that Pakistan was non-compliant on four counts, partially complied with 24 recommendations, and was largely compliant on nine. “Whilst Pakistan published a National Risk Assessment (NRA) on Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing in 2017, the mutual evaluation report (MER) identified gaps in the process of developing and identifying threats, vulnerabilities and risks. The assessment of terrorist-financing risk was identified as ‘perfunctory only’,” the APG report said.“The MER also found that the 2017 NRA had not yet been widely circulated to private sector stakeholders and that sectors assessed as higher risk or higher vulnerability in Pakistan were not yet subject to comprehensive Anti-money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT) measures.” Pakistan will remain in “enhanced (expedited) follow-up” and will have to “continue to report back to the APG on progress to strengthen its implementation of AML/CFT measures,” it added.Ahead of the crucial FATF meeting, Islamabad is reaching out to friendly FATF member states to seek their support, local media reported.Over the weekend, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan would participate in the virtual meeting on the FATF to be held in Paris and hoped it would upgrade the country to its white list.Qureshi telephoned his Saudi, Turkish and Malaysian counterparts to brief them about Pakistan’s “significant progress” to implement the FATF’s plan of action, the reports said.Officials in Islamabad have said that Pakistan is unlikely to be placed on the FATF’s black list given that it has the support of at least three countries --China, Malaysia and Turkey-- to veto any such move.

12-10-2020||World||‘Will go in handcuffs’: PoK ‘PM’ accused of sedition pans Imran Khan||Pakistan-occupied Kashmir leader Raja Farooq Haider on Monday said the sedition case filed against him and leaders of the Pakistan Muslim Leage-Nawaz had “hurt” him and vowed to present himself in handcuffs if he is summoned by the Imran Khan government. The case was registered against Raja Farooq Haider, the so-called prime minister of PoK, as part of a crackdown on opposition leaders ahead of their planned joint rally and nationwide protest movement later this month. The protests are seen as the worst crisis being faced by Prime Minister Imran Khan.Last Monday, sedition cases were registered against ousted former premier Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and PoK ‘PM’ Raja Farooq Haider. The same day, a court in Islamabad charged former president Asif Ali Zardari in two corruption cases.The case against Haider had particularly riled political circles in Pakistan, as Khan often attempts to portray himself as the saviour of Kashmir and Kashmiris.Journalist Hamid Mir had said in a tweet that Khan “always claimed to be an ambassador of Kashmiris,” while slamming the move.Khan has repeatedly blamed India for the opposition’s moves against his government and their criticism of the overbearing role played by the country’s military leadership, which Nawaz Sharif had described as a ‘state above the state’.In an interview to Geo New channel on Monday, the PoK ‘PM’ specifically blamed Imran Khan for the case against him. A sedition case can only be filed on the instructions of the prime minister, Haider told the channel, noting that even Fatima Jinnah, known as Pakistan’s Mader-e-Millat (Mother of the Nation), had once been dubbed a traitor. That tradition continues, he said.Haider also lamented the statement by Khan, who branded most leaders of the 11-party opposition alliance, Pakistan Democratic Movement, as agents of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Imran Khan has also attempted to link New Delhi to the continuing sectarian violence in the country.Haider said Imran Khan’s move would weaken the ‘federation’ of Pakistan.“To file sedition charges against opposition party leaders or to brand them traitors is wrong and hurtful,” he said.Haider said that politics was being given precedence over Pakistan, adding people of PoK “had tremendous respect for the Pakistan PM but such statements create uncertainty.”Haider’s comments came even as the federal government continued to insist that the sedition cases were registered not at the instance of the state or its institutions, but on a complaint by a private citizen.Over the weekend, information minister Shibli Faraz said neither Khan, not his government were involved in the registration of the cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-go-in-handcuffs-pok-pm-accused-of-sedition-pans-imran-khan/story-JmgZ9R0CHIOHfUilGn0rLP.html

The commission said the whole city will be tested within five days.China, where the pandemic began in December, has reported 4,634 deaths and 85,578 cases, plus nine suspected cases that have yet to be confirmed.The last reported virus transmissions within China were four patients found on August 15 in the northwestern city of Urumqi in the far western Xinjiang region. All the cases reported since then were in travellers from outside the mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-test-all-9-million-people-in-qingdao-city-for-covid-19/story-3qaNqZp7LDVie9UhDPk6bL.html
12-10-2020||World||EU ministers agree to sanction Lukashenko: Report||EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed to impose sanctions on Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, as the bloc seeks to step up pressure over his regime’s crackdown on protesters.Two diplomatic sources said the 27 ministers meeting in Luxembourg had agreed Lukashenko’s name should join a list of 40 of his officials already sanctioned by the EU.The 40 already hit with travel bans and asset freezes are blamed for rigging an election in August that returned Lukashenko to power and for a brutal crackdown on mass protests that have rocked the country since the vote.The EU had held back from penalising Lukashenko himself, hoping to persuade him to engage in dialogue with opposition forces to resolve the crisis.But a fresh crackdown on protests in Minsk on Sunday, which saw police use water cannon and stun grenades to break up a protest in Minsk and make hundreds of arrests, prompted a change.As he arrived for the meeting in Luxembourg, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said it was time to expand the sanctions list to include the strongman leader.“The violence continues, perpetrated by the Lukashenko regime -- there are still arrests of peaceful demonstrators, so we have to consider how to proceed,” said Maas, whose country currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency.“I have suggested that we establish a new package of sanctions. And Lukashenko should be among the people who will then be sanctioned.”The EU has rejected the results of the August 9 election and said it does not regard Lukashenko as the legitimate president.- Novichok plot -After getting the political green light from ministers, the new sanctions listings will be processed in detail by the EU’s legal services before they enter into force.The ministers were also to discuss a joint French-German proposal for sanctions over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.Germany and France last week accused Moscow of responsibility for poisoning Navalny with the Soviet-developed Novichok nerve agent, saying “no credible explanation has been provided by Russia”.France and Germany said they would push for sanctions targeting “individuals deemed responsible for this crime and breach of international norms, based on their official function, as well as an entity involved in the Novichok programme”.The ministers on Monday extended the EU’s chemical weapons sanctions framework, under which four Russians accused of involvement in the Novichok poisoning of an ex-double agent in England have already been listed.Any sanctions related to the Navalny case would be made under this framework, which has also been used against Syrian officials for carrying out chemical weapons attacks on their civil war foes.The sanctions call came after UN chemical weapons watchdog OPCW confirmed Germany, France and Sweden’s finding that the Russian opposition leader was poisoned by a nerve agent of the Soviet-developed Novichok group.Monday’s meeting will also take stock of EU-brokered talks between Serbia and Kosovo, as well as the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-ministers-agree-to-sanction-lukashenko-report/story-Pma3FNinCGqkGdyVvc36DO.html

12-10-2020||World||Cloth masks may protect from Covid-19 only if washed daily, says study||Cloth masks may reduce the transmission of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, only if they are washed daily at high temperatures, according to a study. “Both cloth masks and surgical masks should be considered ‘contaminated’ after use,” said Professor Raina MacIntyre, from the University of New South Wales in Australia. “Unlike surgical masks, which are disposed of after use, cloth masks are re-used. While it can be tempting to use the same mask for multiple days in a row, or to give it a quick hand-wash or wipe-over, our research suggests that this increases the risk of contamination,” Maclintyre said. The researchers analysed data from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) they published in 2015. The latest study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is still the only RCT ever conducted on the efficacy of cloth masks in preventing viral infections, they said. The researchers did a deep dive into the 2011 data on whether the health workers in their study washed their masks daily, and if so, how they washed their masks. The team found that if cloth masks were washed in the hospital laundry, they were as effective as a surgical mask. Given the study was conducted over five years ago, the researchers did not test for SARS-CoV-2. Instead, they included common respiratory pathogens such as influenza, rhinoviruses and seasonal coronaviruses in their analysis. It is based on self-reported washing data and was conducted by health workers in high risk wards in a healthcare setting. “While someone from the general public wearing a cloth mask is unlikely to come into contact with the same amount of pathogens as healthcare worker in a high risk ward, we would still recommended daily washing of cloth masks in the community,” Maclntyre said. According to the analysis, handwashing the masks did not provide adequate protection. Healthcare workers who self-washed their masks by hand had double the risk of infection compared to those who used the hospital laundry, the researchers said. The majority of people in the RCT handwashed their masks, and this may be why the cloth masks performed poorly in the original trial, they said. “The WHO recommends machine washing masks with hot water at 60 degrees Celsius and laundry detergent, and the results of our analysis support this recommendation,” said Maclntyre. “The clear message from this research is that cloth masks do work -- but once a cloth mask has been worn, it needs to be washed properly each time before being worn again, otherwise it stops being effective,” said Maclntyre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cloth-masks-mayy-protect-from-covid-19-only-if-washed-daily-says-study/story-v2g2ZKF8drQvQObMFkrYtK.html

12-10-2020||World||AstraZeneca starts late-stage trials of Covid-19 antibody medicine||AstraZeneca Plc started late-stage trials for an antibody medicine against Covid-19 with a large investment from the U.S., after President Donald Trump credited a similar therapy with aiding his recovery.Two trials for more than 6,000 people are starting in the next few weeks looking at prevention, with plans for a further 4,000 adults to test the antibody medicine as a treatment, Astra said in a statement. The drug will be assessed for its ability to avoid infections for as much as a year in some people and as a pre-emptive medicine once patients have been exposed to the virus in others.Astra is one of a number of companies exploring monoclonal antibodies as a way to prevent and treat Covid-19, which could be key for high-risk populations who may not respond well to a vaccine. The U.S. has already secured hundreds of thousands of doses of the experimental treatments.Eli Lilly & Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. last week asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency-use authorizations but haven’t yet received clearance. Trump has said Regeneron’s antibody cocktail was key to his apparent recovery from coronavirus.Lilly, RegeneronEarly data from both Eli Lilly and Regeneron suggest the medicines are effective in keeping infected people out of the hospital. GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Vir Biotechnology Inc. also started advanced tests on a possible antibody treatment last week.Astra has agreed to supply as many as 100,000 doses to the U.S. by the end of 2020, with an option for the country to purchase one million additional doses in 2021. The U.S. previously gave the British pharmaceutical company $25 million for the discovery and evaluation of the monoclonal antibodies, and the phase I trial started in August.Astra shares were little changed early Monday in London.The company’s long-acting antibody “has the potential to provide immediate and long-lasting effect in both preventing and treating Covid-19 infections,” Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in a statement released Friday.(Updates with more detail on trials, U.S. agreement)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-starts-late-stage-trials-of-covid-19-antibody-medicine/story-jTo7kLXZI3kZbWe9QbAK6O.html

It’s essential for companies to keep working, and children to keep going to school, he said.Also Read: Soaring coronavirus cases put more French cities on alertFrance has emphasized local measures to combat a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks after a two-month national lockdown in the spring devastated the economy. With new infections spiking to fresh highs, there’s little evidence the piecemeal approach is working.Toulouse and Montpellier this weekend joined other French cities that have been placed on maximum alert as the number of coronavirus cases in the country rose by nearly 27,000 on Saturday. Bars, casinos and exhibitions in the cities will close while restaurants, cinemas and museums have to abide by stricter health rules starting Monday.New phone appThe government plans to release a new “stop-covid” mobile-phone app on Oct. 22 to help contain the virus, Castex said. The government is also considering additional unspecified measures if the situation doesn’t improve in the next 15 days, he said.Separately, President Emmanuel Macron will not be isolating after coming into contact with French Polynesia President Édouard Fritch, who has tested positive for the coronavirus, because Macron has followed sanitary protocols meticulously, with masks and social distancing, according to the Elysee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-must-avoid-general-covid-19-lockdown-by-all-means-says-pm-castex/story-9iJVNhWTuuah4xGSkUvGsI.html
12-10-2020||World||Hong Kong’s Carrie Lam postpones policy speech after being ordered to travel to China||Hong Kong’s leader on Monday announced she had postponed a policy speech after being ordered to travel to mainland China for meetings with central government officials. Chief executive Carrie Lam had been due to make a key annual address on Wednesday outlining her administration’s plans for the politically restless city.But the speech clashed with a sudden announcement that Chinese President Xi Jinping would make a visit that day to the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen.Lam said she would also travel to Shenzhen, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a special economic trade zone, ahead of a visit to Beijing later in the month.Her speech, she added, would now be delivered in late November.“The best way forward is for the chief executive to go to Beijing and personally explain why these measures are important for Hong Kong,” Lam said of the speech.Hong Kong is ruled under a “One Country, Two Systems” model that allows it to retain a degree of autonomy and some freedoms that are denied to citizens on the authoritarian mainland.But last year’s huge and often violent pro-democracy protests prompted Beijing to ramp up control over a city it now sees as a national security threat.In June it imposed a sweeping new security law on the restless hub which criminalised a range of political offences.It also allowed mainland security agents to operate openly in the city for the first time, as well as grant Beijing jurisdiction over especially serious cases.The Chinese government has thrown its full support behind Lam, a pro-Beijing appointee, despite her dismal approval ratings.Millions hit the streets last year for seven straight months of protests calling for greater freedoms and police accountability.Both Beijing and Lam have rejected those demands and dismissed the unrest as part of a foreign plot.Businesses in the city would have watched Lam’s speech this week closely.The national security law and deteriorating US-China relations have raised doubts over Hong Kong’s future as a regional trading powerhouse, with the city mired in a recession even before the coronavirus outbreak.A lack of affordable housing in what is one of the world’s most expensive cities has also helped fuel resentment towards Beijing.Mass arrests and an anti-coronavirus ban on public gatherings have largely kept a lid on protests this year. But residents remain deeply polarised, with no reconciliation measures yet unveiled to bridge the divide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-carrie-lam-postpones-policy-speech-after-being-ordered-to-travel-to-china/story-TB9i5V8LP5Y7wmURL0QaaJ.html

12-10-2020||World||Covid-19: China launches mass tests in eastern city of Qingdao after local cases emerge||China has launched mass nucleic acid tests in the eastern coastal city of Qingdao after 12 Covid-19 infections including six asymptomatic cases, mostly related to a chest hospital, were reported in the past 24 hours.More than 9 million residents of the city, located on the Yellow Sea coast, will be tested for the coronavirus over five days, city officials said on Monday.Mass testing was launched on Sunday evening after reports of the new cases were confirmed.By Sunday night, photos were circulating online showing residents lining up for tests.Six confirmed locally transmitted cases and six more asymptomatic ones were reported on Sunday, triggering worries of a new outbreak.Local media reports said that as of Sunday night, all the cases were connected to Qingdao Chest Hospital, which was treating “imported” cases of the deadly disease.According to local health authorities, the hospital has been sealed and all doctors and medical staff were being tested.Buildings, where the families of the infected live, have been locked down; family members and relatives are being tested.The five districts of Shinan, Shibei, Licang, Laoshan and Chengyang, home to about six million people, will be fully covered in the next three days, health authorities said.The rest of the city’s population will be covered by the end of the week.A coastal tourism hub with a German concession area, millions of domestic tourists from across the country had come to the city in the first week of October during China’s National Day holidays before returning to their hometowns.“Data from the Qingdao municipal bureau of culture and tourism showed that Qingdao received 4.47 million passenger trips during the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays,” the tabloid Global Times reported on Monday.The number of daily Covid-19 cases in mainland China has fallen drastically from peaks seen in February this year. But the country and its health officials remain on high alert in order to prevent lockdowns that had led to a contraction of the world’s second largest economy for the first time in decades.Since the peak number of cases earlier this year, smaller outbreaks have been reported in Beijing in June, in the northeastern city of Dalian and in Urumqi, the capital of the remote northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stood at 85,578, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.More than 3,000 imported cases of Covid-19 have been reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-launches-mass-tests-in-eastern-city-of-qingdao-after-local-cases-emerge/story-TomLcd0hF6Le9HPI7HYWdM.html
12-10-2020||World||Covid-19: England to have 3-tier lockdown system amid ‘tipping point’||Millions of people in northern England are anxiously waiting to hear how much further virus restrictions will be tightened in coming days as the British government confirmed Sunday that it will be introducing a new system for local lockdowns.In response to the virus’ resurgence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce in Parliament on Monday a three-tier local lockdown system, formally known as “Local Covid Alert Levels,” for England, his office said.Under the new system, the country will be placed into “medium,” “high” and “very high” alert levels. Johnson’s office said the government is working with local leaders to decide which areas are covered by the very high alert level, and the appropriate interventions in those areas.Details of what is involved at each level haven’t been confirmed but the highest level is widely expected to involve the closure of pubs and restaurants and the banning of household mixing, both indoors and outside, among other measures.The new lockdown system, which is intended to simplify the process by which local restrictions are imposed, has been widely anticipated for a couple of weeks following a sharp increase in new cases. Following further discussions early Monday, Johnson will inform lawmakers of the new system before hosting a briefing along with Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and the government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, warned that the UK is at a “tipping point” akin to where the country was in March.“But we can prevent history repeating itself if we all act now,” he said . “Now we know where it is and how to tackle it — let’s grasp this opportunity and prevent history from repeating itself.”All across Europe including the UK, there have been huge increases in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks following the reopening of large sectors of the economy, as well as schools and universities. Infection levels — and deaths — in the UK are rising at their fastest rates in months.Without quick action, there are fears that UK hospitals will be overwhelmed in the coming weeks at a time of year when they are already at their busiest with winter-related afflictions like the flu. The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,825, up another 65 on Sunday.Although coronavirus infections are rising throughout England, northern cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen a disproportionate increase. While some rural areas in eastern England have less than 20 cases per 100,000 people, some major metropolitan areas have recently recorded levels above 500 per 100,000, nearly as bad as Madrid or Brussels.As a result, national restrictions such as a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants have been supplemented by local actions, including in some cases banning contacts between households. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have already closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.Liverpool’s local leader has said he expects his city to face the most onerous restrictions from Wednesday.Local leaders across northern England have vented their fury at the Conservative government over what they see as an “inadequate” wage support scheme that it announced Friday and for not properly telling them about the upcoming restrictions. The wage plan aims to help employees in companies that are forced to close because of virus restrictions, but mayors say it’s not generous enough in paying only two-thirds of employees’ wages and doesn’t compensate those indirectly hit by any business closures, such as drink suppliers to pubs.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick on Sunday sought to assuage concerns that the government was being overly hierarchical in its approach. He also indicated that local authorities will be given more control over the national test and trace program, which has struggled to live up to Johnson’s prediction that it would be “world-beating.”“In addition to the national infrastructure which is developing and increasing with every passing week, we’re also going to be making use of local councils to do contact tracing in particular, because there is clear evidence that local councils are good at that, as you’d expect,” he told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-england-to-have-3-tier-lockdown-system-amid-tipping-point/story-dQVKXnfb4ldmkBPxjYbYiM.html
12-10-2020||World||Supreme Court nominee Barrett faces Senate despite Covid-19 spread||Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett are set to begin as a divided Senate charges ahead on President Donald Trump’s pick to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and cement a conservative court majority before Election Day.Barrett, a federal appeals court judge, will tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is “forever grateful” for Ginsburg’s trailblazing path as a woman. But she is resolved to maintain the perspective of her own mentor, the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and “apply the law as written,” according to her prepared opening remarks for the hearings, which start Monday as the country is in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic.“Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” Barrett says in the remarks, which The Associated Press obtained.Republicans, who control the Senate, are moving at a breakneck pace to seat Barrett before the Nov. 3 election to secure Trump’s pick and hear a high-profile challenge to the Affordable Care Act and any election-related challenges.Democrats are trying in vain to delay the fast-track confirmation by raising fresh concerns about the safety of meeting during the pandemic after two GOP senators on the panel tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., have not said if they will attend in person. Lee’s spokesman said the senator is symptom-free but would be making a decision on whether to attend Monday morning, per his doctor’s orders. A spokesman for Tillis did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Both tested positive 10 days ago.Key Democrats are staying away. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee and a committee member, plans to participate remotely from her Senate office due to coronavirus concerns, her spokesman said Sunday.The committee released a letter from the Architect of the Capitol on Sunday that says the hearing room has been set up in consultation with the Office of Attending Physician with appropriate distance between seats and air ventilation systems that meet or exceed industry standards.“We’re going to work safely,” said the committee’s chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” He said he took a coronavirus test last week and is “negative.”Trump chose the 48-year-old judge after the death last month of Ginsburg, a liberal icon. It’s the opportunity to entrench a conservative majority on the court for years to come with his third justice.Outside groups are pushing Democrats to make a strong case against what they call an illegitimate confirmation, when people are already voting in some states, saying the winner of the presidency should make the pick. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential contest.“The public is with them that this shouldn’t happen before the election,” said Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice, which advocates against right-leaning nominees.The country will get an extended look at Barrett over the next three days in hearings like none other during the heated election environment and the pandemic limiting public access.Faith and family punctuate her testimony, and she said would bring “a few new perspectives” as the first mother of school-age children on the nine-member court.Barrett says she uses her children as a test when deciding cases, asking herself how she would view the decision if one of her children were the party she was ruling against.“Even though I would not like the result, would I understand that the decision was fairly reasoned and grounded in the law?” she says in the prepared remarks.A Catholic, she says she believes in the “power of prayer.” Barrett’s religious views and past leadership role in a Catholic faith community pose a challenge for Democrats as they try to probe her judicial approach to abortion, gay marriage and other social issues without veering into inappropriate questions of her faith.Ordinarily, Barrett would get to show off her family and seven children. But the White House event announcing her nomination, in which most of the audience did not wear masks, has been labeled a “superspreader” for the coronavirus.More than two dozen people linked to the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event, including the two GOP senators, have contracted COVID-19 since then. Barrett and her family went maskless at the event. She and her husband, Jesse, tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, two administration officials have said.Democrats already were enraged that Republicans are moving so quickly having refused to consider President Barack Obama nominee in February 2016, well before that year’s election.Barrett is the most openly anti-abortion Supreme Court nominee in decades and her vote could provide a majority to restrict if not overturn abortion rights. Democrats have made clear that they will press Barrett on health care, abortion and other issues where her vote could push the court further to the right.Republicans will highlight Barrett’s belief in sticking to the text of laws and the original meaning of constitutional provisions, both Scalia trademarks as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-court-nominee-barrett-faces-senate-despite-covid-19-spread/story-bJ8fHDQJNdQQl5A70sR3DO.html

Water cannons and stun grenades were used against the protesters,” Hanusevich said.She noted that the police had repeatedly asked residents to refrain from participating in the unsanctioned rally. According to Hanusevich, over 20 protesters have already been detained.In the meantime, security measures in the city have been stepped up, according to a Sputnik correspondent. Several special equipment units were deployed near the Central House of Officers located on the other side of Independence Avenue.Armoured personnel carriers, water cannons and vehicles with barbed wire in their trailers are parked at the Sapiorau Street in the immediate vicinity of the Independence Palace, which serves as the presidential residence.Earlier in the day, the A1 Belarus telecom provider said that the bandwidth of mobile internet in Minsk had been reduced.“In compliance with the order of the authorized state bodies on October 11, the bandwidth of the mobile Internet was reduced in Minsk. Fulfillment of this requirement leads to a deterioration in the quality of the data transfer service or temporary unavailability of the service,” the operator said on Twitter.Nationwide protests in Belarus are ongoing since the August 9 presidential election in which President Alexander Lukashenko was re-elected for a sixth term. The opposition did not accept the election result and has insisted its candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya won.

The employer has been contacted by the kidnappers and shown photographs as proof that the Indian nationals were safe and keeping well,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in his weekly press conference.In September 2015, an advisory had been issued for Indian nationals to avoid travelling to Libya in view of the security situation there.Later, in May 2016, the Government imposed a complete travel ban irrespective of the purpose in view of the much-deteriorated security situation. This travel ban is still in force.

Montoya said two guns were recovered from the scene.Richardson said on Instagram that the shooting victim, who she said was with the patriot rally, and the other man “exchanged heated words” before violence ensued.The “patriot hit the man in the face, then backed up to spray what looked like pepper spray at him,” Richardson wrote. “Literally in that split second the man who had gotten hit by the patriot pulled out a gun from his waistband and shot the patriot.”By all accounts, nobody from the side of the Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist counter-rally was directly involved in the deadly confrontation. Dolloff made his first court appearance on Sunday, where a magistrate judge ordered the arrest warrant affidavit sealed and ruled that the suspect be held without bond, local media reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-guard-held-on-suspicion-of-murder-in-shooting-at-denver-political-rallies/story-zCN6r7980miEPVgCrCi4OI.html
12-10-2020||World||Battered by Hurricane Delta, Louisiana vows to rebuild: ‘We can’t lose our momentum’||Back-to-back hurricanes in the space of six weeks left parts of Louisiana blanketed Sunday with tarpaulins, mangled metal and downed power lines — but not necessarily despair.Utility crews fanned out across the battered southwestern part of the state to restore electricity in the wake of Hurricane Delta, and residents began returning home along roads lined with debris and houses missing roofs. Some were grateful that the damage was not as bad as it could have been.A 70-year-old woman in Iberia Parish died in a fire likely caused by a natural gas leak following damage from Hurricane Delta, the Louisiana Department of Health said Sunday.Louisiana officials also blamed the death of an 86-year-old man on the hurricane. The St. Martin Parish resident died in a fire that erupted after he refueled a generator in a shed, Gov. John Bel Edwards said. He said it didn’t appear the generator had cooled down before the man refilled it.A third storm-related death was reported in Florida, where a 19-year-old tourist from Illinois drowned after getting caught in a rip current caused by the storm off Destin, authorities said.Roughly 350,000 customers in Louisiana remained without power two days after Delta blew ashore near the town of Creole with winds of 100 mph (155 kph), slamming a part of the state still recovering from Hurricane Laura’s 150 mph (241 kph) onslaught on Aug. 27. Laura was blamed for 32 deaths, many of them caused in the storm’s aftermath by carbon monoxide poisoning from generators.The remnants of Delta, meanwhile, dumped heavy rain on parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia.The storm was also blamed for washing out a railroad track and causing the derailment of a freight train in the Atlanta area that sparked a small fire and briefly forced some residents from their homes. Two crew members were taken to a hospital for observation and later released.Clair Hebert Marceaux lost her home in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, during Hurricane Laura and said the community was hard at work on rebuilding when Delta struck.“We can’t lose our momentum,” she said, though she added there was “utter devastation” in the area.Marceaux, who was born and raised in Cameron Parish, is the director of the community’s busy port, which hosts fleets of shrimp and crab boats and serves as a key link in the region’s oil and gas industry.Vessel traffic was halted until port authorities and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers could take stock of the damage. Sunken boats, utility poles and other flotsam filled waterways.“We are still in an assessment phase,” Marceaux said, “but we will be limping along as best as we can.”Lynn Nguyen and her four children fled to Fort Walton, Florida, ahead of the storm and returned home to Abbeville, Louisiana, on a circuitous route to avoid flooded roads. Her home was spared major damage, though a fence was flattened.“For the most part, I’m just glad I still have a job and a roof over my head,” said Nguyen, who works at a seafood market.Earnestine and Milton Wesley had decided to ride out Delta in their Lake Charles home, damaged by Laura. As the wind rustled the roof tarp above them, they grabbed it through the hole in the ceiling and held on tight. Water poured in, flooding their den.“We fought all night long trying to keep things intact,” Milton said. “And with God’s help we made it.”After blowing ashore, Delta moved over Lake Charles, a city where Laura damaged nearly every home and building. More than 8,000 Louisiana residents who evacuated because of Laura were still in shelters as of Sunday, Edwards said. Roughly 850 people were in shelters because of Delta.Before Friday’s storm, the streets of Lake Charles were already lined with mountains of debris from the previous hurricane — soggy insulation, moldy mattresses, tree limbs, twisted metal siding, ruined family treasures. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter estimated hundreds of already damaged homes took on water from Delta, which dumped more than 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain on the city over two days.Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, was the 10th to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a record set in 1916, Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach said.The floodwaters surged up the Wesley family’s front yard, and they were terrified it would pour inside, but it stopped short of the door. It carried with it bags of trash and muck, swept up from their neighbors’ piles of debris from the prior storm.“The water was something else last night,” Milton said. “We’ve never seen it flood so bad out here, to the point I could have swam out here last night, that’s just how deep it was.”___Calvan reported from Tallahassee, Florida; Associated Press contributors include Sudhin Thanawala and Sophia Tulp in Atlanta; Gerald Herbert in Lake Charles; Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge; Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battered-by-hurricane-delta-louisiana-vows-to-rebuild-we-can-t-lose-our-momentum/story-PdpXXJ6EcJTN5SlWqjajSM.html

The Armenian military has refuted Baku’s statements. The shelling, which reportedly left seven dead and 34 others injured, took place amid the ceasefire, which the two sides to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict had earlier agreed in Moscow.“We have treated 20 patients, two of them in severe condition. There are five children under three among the patients who are currently receiving psychological assistance and undergoing rehabilitation. The others have been discharged, they are under medical supervision,” Ibragimov said.The doctor added that a female traumatologist who worked for the hospital had been killed in the shelling.“This employee had two sons who are now at the frontline [in the Karabakh conflict] ... And she was in a peaceful and quiet city ... unfortunately, we lost her,” the chief physician said.Journalists had an opportunity to see two hospitalized men who had been injured in the attack. One is a emergency worker in his 40s who lives in one of damaged residential buildings. According to doctors, the man fought in the Nagorno-Karabakh war in the 1990s. The patient slept during reporters’ visit.Another patient received wounds to both legs as the rocket smashed windows in nearby houses. According to 20-year-old Isa Rzayev, he woke up at night to the noise of two powerful explosions. Neighbors helped him get out of the house. Isa said that he was demobilized in April.

The deal stipulated that the truce should pave the way for talks on settling the conflict.Crowds gathered in front of the Turkish Consulate in California’s largest city Sunday afternoon, waving Armenian flags, chanting and toting signs that said “peace for Armenians,” among other messages. Earlier, groups gathered along streets, with some climbing on top of cars to wave the banners.The demonstrations appeared to be largely peaceful.Southern California is home to the largest Armenian population in the United States and an East Hollywood neighborhood was designated Little Armenia in 2000.The recent bout of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces started Sept. 27 and left hundreds of people dead in the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh since a separatist war there ended in 1994. The region lies in Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia. Armenians refer to it as Artsakh.Turkey is supporting Azerbaijan and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently said “our Azerbaijani brothers are now waiting for the day they will return to their land.”As protestors gathered Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted in support, also attaching a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from a group of mayors across the country urging the United States to help deescalate tensions in the conflict.“We welcome the ceasefire and it must be respected,” Garcetti tweeted. “We need our national leadership to step up (and) help bring peace to the region. Turkey must disengage.”Thousands blocked freeways recently in the Los Angeles area, and assembled in front of the buildings of CNN and the Los Angeles Times and demonstrated outside the Azerbaijan Consulate, the Los Angeles Times previously reported. Several Armenian Americans have returned to the region to volunteer for their home country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-armenia-demonstrations-in-los-angeles-slogans-raised-against-azerbaijan-turkey/story-7Z4RrWNGcSYA9J8t1OnMQO.html

The study was published in Virology Journal.By comparison, Influenza A virus has been found to survive on surfaces for 17 days.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage CSIRO’s research involved drying virus in an artificial mucus on a range of surfaces at concentrations similar to samples from Covid-19 patients and then extracting the virus after a month.Experiments done in controlled laboratory environments at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C showed that the survival time declined as the temperature increased.Also Read: Will Covid-19 cases increase in India during winter? Likely, says Harsh Vardhan“Establishing how long the virus really remains viable on surfaces enables us to more accurately predict and mitigate its spread and do a better job of protecting our people,” CSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall said in a statement.Proteins and fats in body fluids can also sharply increase virus survival times.“The research may also help to explain the apparent persistence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in cool environments with high lipid or protein contamination, such as meat processing facilities, and how we might better address that risk,” said Trevor Drew, director of the CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness.Also Read: India considers using more than one Covid-19 vaccineAustralia has fared much better than most other rich nations in combating Covid-19, with a total of about 27,000 infections and 898 deaths in a population of 25 million.The epicentre of the country’s second wave of infection, Victoria state, reported 15 new cases on Monday, well shy of a target of less than five which the government has set for the easing of a hard lockdown in the state capital Melbourne.

That came days after Trump abruptly called off negotiations until after the Nov. 3 election in which he is seeking re-election.Trump’s reversal and higher offer drew criticism from Senate Republicans, some of whom are uneasy about the national debt and whether a deal would cost Republicans votes next month.Federal Reserve officials have urged Congress to be aggressive.

Measures include the closing of cafes and bars. The southwest city of Toulouse was doing likewise after a day of meetings between mayors of surrounding towns and the prefect, the local state authority, the Toulouse newspaper La Depeche reported.Soaring infections and increased hospitalizations put four other cities on the maximum alert list on Saturday: Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne in the southeast and Lille in the north.National health authorities reported on Saturday nearly 26,900 new daily infections in 24 hours. The count dropped to 16,100 on Sunday, but the rate of positive tests climbed to 11.5%. There were nearly 5,100 new hospitalizations over the past week, with 910 people in ICUs. As of Sunday, there were 32,730 Covid-19 deaths, but the actual number is likely higher due to deaths at home and incomplete reporting from hospitals or rest homes.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhile France girded itself for a climb in critical numbers, a consultation by the National Order of Nurses published Sunday suggested that a significant number of respondents feel tired and fed up, with 37% saying the coronavirus pandemic is making them want to change jobs.Nearly 59,400 nurses responded to the Oct. 2-7 internal survey on the impact of the health crisis on their working conditions, out of 350,000 in the Order of Nurses. A spokesman for the order, Adrien de Casabianca, described the survey as a “consultation” without the classic methodology of a poll.The numbers suggested that French medical facilities may not be keeping pace with the growing need, despite lessons from the height of the virus crisis last spring.The National Order of Nurses notes that 34,000 nurses’ jobs in France are currently vacant.Nurses and other health professionals in France and elsewhere have sporadically demonstrated for higher salaries, better working conditions and more personnel. They were given small salary hikes in France starting this fall.“Today, nurses must deal with a growth in Covid-19 cases and feel unarmed to do so,” the president of the National Order of Nurses, Patrick Chamboredon, said in a statement accompanying the survey.With nurses “indispensable” to the functioning of the health system, “we cannot accept that,” he said.The head of the infectious diseases unit at Paris’ Bichat Hospital, a major Covid-19 treatment center, Yazdan Yazdanpaneh, questioned whether so many nurses really want to change jobs because “despite it all, these are people who adore their work.”“They are tired ... it’s stress, it’s tension, it’s lots of work,” he said on BFMTV. “Truly, we must take care of them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soaring-coronavirus-cases-puts-more-french-cities-on-alert/story-x9j4K8NDLabkJ9XcD5j9IK.html

In body-camera video, one officer could be heard twice saying that leading Neely by rope down city streets would look “bad”.The lawsuit accused the city and the department of negligence, and stated that the officers should have known Neely would consider it offensive to be led on the rope “as though he was a slave.” “Neely felt as though he was put on display as slaves once were,” the lawsuit stated.In a statement at the time, Police Chief Vernon Hale called the tactic a “trained technique and best practice in some scenarios”. However, he said he believed his officers “showed poor judgment,” adding that the department since changed its policy to prevent use of the technique.A Texas Rangers investigation determined the officers didn’t break the law. Neely’s criminal trespass charge was dismissed in court. His lawsuit also alleges malicious prosecution connected to the charge.City officials declined to comment on the lawsuit to news outlets.A status conference was set for January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-man-who-police-led-by-rope-sues-texas-city-for-1-million/story-hG15RhRIuGicxji7LvCpcK.html

I’m down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. It’s every single day. So, I can’t imagine that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more.”In his statement Sunday, Fauci said, “The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.”Trump defended the clip, and his handling of pandemic, and rebutted the doctor’s criticism.“They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words.

12-10-2020||World||Joe Biden harnesses history to describe urgency of 2020 campaign||Presidential hopefuls tend to declare every upcoming election the most important one that voters have faced in their lifetime. Joe Biden goes bigger.The Democratic nominee portrays 2020 as an entanglement of social, economic, political, environmental and public health crises as threatening to America’s stability as the Civil War and the Great Depression. Biden points to the presidents of those times -- Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- for inspiration, even using one of the nation’s most hallowed battlefields, where Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address in 1863, as a backdrop for his closing argument against President Donald Trump.“A century and a half after Gettysburg, we should consider again what can happen when equal justice is denied and when anger and violence and division are left unchecked,” Biden said in rural Pennsylvania.He pledged, as president, to “marshal the ingenuity and good will of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together.” Refashioning Lincoln’s words, Biden added: “It cannot be that here and now, in 2020, that we will allow the government of the people, by the people and for the people to perish from this Earth. It cannot, and it must not.”The approach, Biden aides say, is more than lofty presidential rhetoric; it’s necessary groundwork for governing. Being a steady alternative to Trump, the ex-reality television star Biden describes as “erratic” and “dangerous,” may be enough to win in November, they argue.But once in office, Biden would need a clear mandate from a splintered electorate if he hopes to enact the kinds of comprehensive proposals he proposes to control the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, combat the climate crisis and confront centuries of racial and economic inequities.“A lot of good work and thinking is going into how to actually tackle the challenges in this moment of crisis that the Trump administration has failed to address and resolve,” Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden confidant, said in a recent interview.“It’s simple,” added Coons, who holds the same Senate seat Biden occupied for 36 years. “But it’s complicated.”A Biden aide who was not authorized to publicly discuss strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity said the campaign is considering at least one more major speech before the Nov. 3 election with the kind of historical sweep and imagery that Biden mustered in Gettysburg.There are hazards and unknowns in Biden’s approach.“Tom Dewey,” quipped Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker and Trump ally. He was referring to Republicans’ 1948 presidential nominee, who appeared a sure victor over President Harry S. Truman at a time of domestic uncertainty after World War II.“Dewey spent a large part of October talking about how great a president he’d be, and Truman spent October taking Dewey apart” on the particulars, Gingrich said of Truman’s comeback victory.As dire as Trump’s political standing appears to be, Republicans have countered Biden’s argument for an ambitious presidency with equally stark warnings that the longtime center-left deal-maker is in fact a vessel for a leftward lurch toward socialism.In Trump’s telling, Biden’s ideas to combat the pandemic would cripple economic activity; his tax plans are confiscatory wealth redistribution; health care insurance expansion amounts to a government takeover; his energy overhaul to stymie climate change would kill millions of jobs; and his talk of racial injustice amounts to declaring the whole country racist.Biden has from the start of his campaign talked of Trump as an existential threat to the “soul of the nation.” He nodded to racial injustice with frequent reminders that “we haven’t always lived up to those values” in the Declaration of Independence. During the primary campaign he made standard Democratic arguments about bolstering the middle class.But the coronavirus, its economic damage and a summer of protests of police violence against Black Americans have accelerated Biden’s rhetoric.“The blinders have been taken off. People realize what’s at stake here,” Biden said Saturday in Erie, Pennsylvania, repeating what has become a go-to line in nearly every campaign setting. Another line: “The country is ready. They get it.”And he swats away Trump’s caricatures. “Do I look like a socialist?” he said recently in Miami.Biden’s tack bears cursory resemblance to some of Trump’s stagecraft.The president made Democrats seethe in August as he used the White House as his backdrop to accept the Republican nomination for a second term. Before that, Trump traveled to Mount Rushmore on the weekend of July Fourth for a dramatic address. His backdrop: the carved likenesses of Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.“I’ve done more for the Black community than any other president ... with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln,” Trump said in September, four months after conducting an interview with Fox News from the feet of the Lincoln Memorial.Biden described his Gettysburg speech as “dramatic” in a preview to donors hours before he delivered it. Yet while Trump makes explicit comparisons to his predecessors in terms of accomplishment and renown, Biden’s language more carefully calls upon them as inspiration.In a Sept. 22 fundraiser, a top Biden supporter recalled urging the former vice president to run against Trump.“I was grabbing you by the lapels and said, ‘You’re the Harry Truman of our time. You’ve gotta run.’ I know you remember that,” Dennis Mehiel, chairman of U.S. Corrugated, Inc., told Biden, drawing laughter from the candidate.Then Mehiel pivoted, declaring a national “tipping point” that requires more. “I’ve changed my mind,” he told Biden. “You must be the Franklin Roosevelt of our time. ... We had wonderful success in many areas following his leadership.”Biden walked a fine line in response.“I have trouble thinking of myself in terms of FDR,” Biden said of the Democrat whose New Deal policies vastly expanded the federal government’s size and scope. “But one thing I do agree on ... whoever is the next president is going to inherit an economic circumstance that is as dangerous, as consequential as Roosevelt did.”Gingrich said Biden “has no choice” but to reach for a mandate as he tries to parlay a national lead into an expanded House majority and a new Democratic-run Senate. The raw political realities of the eras Biden cites as guideposts demonstrate why.Lincoln managed the Civil War as an iron-fisted commander in chief, often governing through executive orders his congressional opponents could do nothing about. His staunchest enemies weren’t on Capitol Hill for him to navigate at all: They’d seceded.Roosevelt, meanwhile, was vilified by Republicans and Wall Street titans as a socialist. But he commanded overwhelming Democratic majorities in Congress, margins Biden likely would never enjoy.“For Biden to do what he wants to do,” Gingrich said, “he needs to sweep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-harnesses-history-to-describe-urgency-of-2020-campaign/story-gMtygV73d6fMR2lVMmfDPK.html

Islamabad, however, requires support of at least 12 out of 39 member states to remove its name from the grey list and this will largely depend on the approach the US will take at the Paris plenary.Also Read: China has itself to blame for strong QUAD | AnalysisAccording to diplomats based in the US and Paris, the Pakistan foreign ministry has hired Houston (in Texas) based lobbying firm Linden Strategies to push its case with the Trump administration. The lobbying firm website describes it as a “government relations and business development firm providing strategic analysis and advisory to domestic and international clients, including sovereign nations.” The firm’s specialisation is in government relations, strategic communication, business advisory and political consulting with clients spanning the globe.Also Read: Pakistan opposition parties accuse army of meddling with pollsApparently, the narrative that Pakistan wants the Houston firm to communicate to Trump administration is as follows:■ Main leadership of the Taliban, Haqqani network, al Qaeda and Daesh global terrorist groups is based in Afghanistan with sufficient funds available to them. This means that Islamabad has disavowed that Taliban shura and the Haqqani network operate from Quetta, across Bolan Pass, and Peshawar, across Khyber Pass, and there is no hand of Pakistan’s deep state in al Qaeda and Daesh or so-called Islamic state in Afghanistan. The fact is that Haqqani network chief Sirajiuddin Haqqani is the sword arm of the Taliban as its deputy leader with Maulvi Hibatullah Akhunzada being a cleric.■ While Pakistan claims that Muridke based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) remains defunct, terror financing cases have been registered against most of the identified leaders of Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniat foundation. The fact is that LeT chief Hafiz Saeed, main accused in 26/11 attacks, has handed over the reins of the proscribed group to son Talha, who is instigating violence and in touch with sleeper cells across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.■ The Imran Khan government claims that Bahawalpur based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist group follows a unique Afghan war based model of operation. While its key leaders are not in Pakistan, the group is operating through its sympathisers. The fact is that JeM’s emir Masood Azhar has a serious medical condition and is bed-ridden in Bahawalpur. His brother Mufti Rauf Asghar now operates the group with training camps both in Pakistan as well as across the Durand Line in Afghanistan. The JeM’s main operator in Kashmir is Kasim Jan, 2016 Pathankot attack accused, who gets instruction from Asghar. The JeM is a family enterprise with terrorism as its main product.■ Pakistan claims that it has successfully convicted four designated persons and two other senior leaders, and that terror financing cases have been instituted against 11 designated persons (61 cases) and eight other leaders (37 cases). The fact, however, is that according to FATF’s 2019 mutual evaluation report there were 66 organisations and approximately 7,600 individuals proscribed under UN Security Council resolution 1373, which was passed to prevent and suppress financing of terror acts post 9/11 attacks.Also Read: Pak cleric murder: Imran Khan blames India for triggering sectarian rift but fails to provide evidenceDespite hiring a top lobbying firm and offering its leverage with Taliban to US for reduction of violence in Afghanistan, Pakistan will not be able to escape the grey list this time as its 2019 mutual evaluation report leaves a lot to be desired and it is still to comply with all the 27 points of FATF action plan of the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hires-top-lobbyist-firm-for-a-us-bailout-from-fatf-grey-list/story-UXWYNT0L208gjGln6GrTdN.html
