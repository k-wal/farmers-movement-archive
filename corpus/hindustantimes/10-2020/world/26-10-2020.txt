This could signal relief for ravaged economies and overworked healthcare systems in major nations battling the viral contagion that has claimed 1.15 million lives.According to British and Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, the drug AZD1222 has shown immune response in older and younger adults, with reduced adversarial effects among the elderly. Officials from the vaccine developer have said that it is ‘encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher’.“The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,” an AstraZeneca spokesperson said.Here are the other Covid-19 vaccine developments you need to know today:- Fauci says vaccine verdict due by early DecemberStating that a verdict on safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccine is likely to emerge in early December, US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said more widespread vaccination would not be likely until later in 2021.“We will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December,” Fauci said, according to Reuters. “When you talk about vaccinating a substantial proportion of the population so that you can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak, that very likely will not be until the second or third quarter of the year,” Fauci said.- Qatar signs deal to buy Moderna Covid-19 vaccineJoining the league of countries queuing up to buy Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine, Qatar has signed an agreement with the drugmaker. The country will buy the potential vaccine once it clears the approval round and is made available for global use, Reuters reported.“Negotiating early and securing a number of agreements enhances our chances of getting sufficient quantities of the vaccine early,” said Abdullatif al-Khal, chair of a national Covid-19 health group and head of infectious diseases at Hamad Medical Corporation.Moderna, it said, is on track to produce 20 million doses of its vaccine by the end of the year, while maintaining its goal of readying 500 million to 1 billion doses in 2021.- Israel in global race of Covid-19 vaccine human trialsAnnouncing its plan to join the global race of running human trials of Covid-19 vaccine, Israel said its potential drug will be developed by a research institute and will be overlooked by the country’s defence ministry on November 1 after receiving regulatory approval.- UK not hopeful of Covid-19 vaccine this yearA top UK official on Monday said he saw abysmal hopes of the country securing a Covid-19 vaccine and said that it is placing its central expectations in the first half of 2021. “On my central expectation, I would expect the bulk of the rollout to be in the first half of next year,” Matt Hancock, the British health secretary, said. On some people receiving a vaccine this year, he replied: “I don’t rule that out but that is not my central expectation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-oxford-shot-sees-immune-response-fauci-makes-a-verdict/story-qCJIINWDaMFFQHEIYfyG4K.html
26-10-2020||World||UK judge rejects Nirav Modi’s bail request. It was his sixth||Diamantaire Nirav Modi, who was arrested in London in March 2019, was on Monday denied bail for the sixth time after the Westminster Magistrates Court refused to accept a ‘change of circumstances’ since his last application.The magistrates court has now refused him bail four times; the high court of England and Wales, as well as the appeals court, had earlier rejected similar requests. “There was a hearing for bail application today, it was not granted. The next hearing is listed for November 3,” a spokesperson of the Westminster Magistrates Court said.Nirav Modi, 49, remains lodged in the Wandsworth prison, awaiting further hearings in his extradition case. The case was heard over five days in September and is scheduled for further hearings on November 3 and December 1 in the magistrates court. The grounds mentioned by his legal team for seeking bail have included his worsening medical condition and threats to him in jail.Modi has offered progressively higher amounts (4 million pounds in March) and to follow more stringent conditions as part of bail packages, but judges have rejected the applications on the ground that he potentially poses a flight risk.Modi is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the other by the Enforcement Directorate. Under UK extradition rules, the court needs to determine whether there is a prima facie case based on material supplied by the Indian government.Also Read: ‘Nirav Modi won’t get fair trial in India’: Ex-SC judge Katju tells London courtThe charges against Modi involve loans in excess of Rs 11,300 crore extended by the Mumbai branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB) to his companies.The CBI case accuses him of large-scale fraud by fraudulently obtaining loan agreements, formally referred to as Letters of Understanding (LOUs); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of this alleged fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case. It was certified by home secretary Priti Patel on February 20 as required under the 1993 India-UK extradition treaty.The additional offences relate to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”).India’s case is that Modi and his companies obtained loans without credit facilities in place; without providing the requisite cash margin; without proper documentation; without paying a proper commission and LOUs not being properly recorded in PNB’s systems; and the proceeds of which were wrongly diverted either to repay earlier loans and/or to the benefit of a series of linked Modi-controlled companies.The Indian government, which is represented in the court by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), has alleged that the fraudulent LOUs would not have been issued without the active involvement of the co-accused PNB officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-judge-rejects-nirav-modi-s-bail-request-it-was-his-sixth-application/story-iy9RgtnORuhD8qW69m3GeO.html
26-10-2020||World||Germany warns of ‘consequences’ if Thai king breaches law||Germany warned of “immediate consequences” if Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn broke the law on its soil as thousands of protesters gathered outside its embassy in Bangkok on Monday, stepping up the pressure in their campaign for changes to the monarchy.The demonstrators submitted a letter questioning the king’s legal status in the European country and requesting Germany to probe whether he has exercised royal authority during his time there in violation of the country’s law. The petition is meant to help Thailand return “to the path of truthful constitutional monarchy,” according to a joint statement issued by protest organizers.“We have not only been looking into that in recent weeks, but on a regular basis,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said at a news conference. “If there are things we consider to be illegal, that will have immediate consequences.”The king, who is currently in Bangkok, spends much of his time in Germany. Calls to the Bureau of the Royal Household seeking comments went unanswered.The march came as lawmakers began a debate on the pro-democracy demonstrations that pose a challenge to the royalist elite that has run Thailand for much of its history. The protesters want Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha to resign, changes to a constitution written after a 2014 coup and greater accountability and transparency for the monarchy — the most powerful institution in the country.Parliament DebatePrayuth, who has ignored calls to quit, said on Monday parliament will consider the process of charter amendment next month with a target to wrap it up in three readings in December. But the new constitution will not come into force until extensive public hearings are concluded, he said.The prime minister has previously said the government is open to amending some unspecified parts of the constitution though parliament last month stalled the charter amendment process. Protesters say the constitution, which allows a military-appointed Senate to vote for the prime minister, was instrumental in helping Prayuth maintain power.Sompong Amornwiwat, a leader of the opposition Pheu Thai Party, said Prayuth must resign to de-escalate the situation and urged the government to consider protesters’ demand for amending the constitution without any delay. He also called for the immediate release of arrested pro-democracy activists and an end to harassment of those opposed to the government.The protesters said the parliament sitting was being used to insult and slander the anti-government movement. “If politics is good, there would be no protests today,” the Thammasat group said on Facebook.The protesters also asked Germany to clarify if King Vajiralongkorn will be liable to pay inheritance tax given his long stay in the European country and investigate the human rights record of the king and his courtiers, a copy of the letter released by the pro-democracy groups show.Prayuth has struggled to quell the protest movement, forcing him to withdraw a state of emergency in the capital within a week of its imposition and asking protesters to “take a step back” to de-escalate the situation. But protesters rejected the olive branch and called for more protests.Prayuth’s PerformanceAn opinion poll by Suan Dusit University showed that more than 62% of respondents felt discontent with Prayuth’s performance was the key reason for the escalating protest movement. Another survey by the National Institute of Development Administration showed 59% of the 1,336 respondents are worried the protests will lead to violence and conflict.The Thai government may be drawn into a “prolonged stand-off with the protesters, coupled with the arrests and harassment of leaders, in hopes of the movement’s losing momentum,” said Christopher Ankersen, associate professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies Center for Global Affairs.If the government is forced to make some compromise, a drafting of a new constitution -- “a slow, long and arcane process” — could be used to buy time, Ankersen said, adding that Prayuth’s resignation could also be on the table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-warns-of-consequences-if-thai-king-breaches-law/story-ye1mDLiIbv7ezczaFSt37K.html
26-10-2020||World||Imran Khan drags India into his letter to Facebook opposing Islamophobia||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has written a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, calling for a ban content promoting Islamophobia on the social network, and took potshots at India while championing his newly found cause.“I am writing to draw your attention to the growing Islamophobia that is encouraging hate, extremism and violence across the world and especially through the use of social media platforms including Facebook,” he wrote.Noting that Facebook took steps to ban any posting that criticises or questions the Holocaust, a similar pogrom against Muslims in different parts of the world has been witnessed.In response to Khan’s appeal, a Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters the company was against all forms of hate and that it did not allow attacks based on race, ethnicity, national origin or religion.“We’ll remove this hate speech as soon as we become aware of it,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, adding that the company had “more work to do”.In some states, Muslims are being denied their citizenship rights and democratic personal choices from dress to worship, Khan said in the letter.“In India, anti-Muslim laws and measures such as CAA and NRC as well as targeted killings of Muslims and blaming Muslims for coronavirus are reflective of the abominable phenomenon of Islamophobia,” he said.He added that in France, Islam has been associated with terrorism and publication of blasphemous cartoons targeting Islam and the Holy Prophet has been allowed. “This will lead to further polarisation and marginalisation of Muslims in France. How will the French distinguish between radical extremist Muslim citizens and the mainstream Muslim citizenry of Islam?”PM Imran said marginalisation of any community leads to extremism, adding this is “something the world does not need.”“Given the rampant abuse and vilification of Muslims on social media platforms, I would ask you to place a similar ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam for Facebook that you have put in place for the Holocaust,” the Pakistan PM urged the Facebook CEO.Imran Khan said that the message of hate must be banned in totality. “While hate messages against some are unacceptable, they cannot be allowed against others.”The world should not have to wait for a pogrom against Muslims, which he claimed is “ongoing in countries like India” before Islamophobia is banned. “This in itself is reflective of prejudice and bias that will encourage further radicalisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-drags-india-into-his-letter-to-facebook-opposing-islamophobia/story-ttTfvAzIIovaZ4ywL9t3KO.html
26-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: What is early voting and how will it impact the White House race?||Eight days before the November 3 US presidential elections, early voting has surpassed all the pre-poll ballots from 2016. The US Election Project run by the University of Florida said that as of October 25, more than 59 million people have already voted early in the elections. In 2016, 57 million people had voted early or by mail, according to the US Election Assistance Commission website.Here’s everything you need to know about early voting:What is early voting?Early voting is a convenient way of voting in which people are allowed to vote before the scheduled election day. This can be done either in- person at early voting stations or by post. This is a complex process as different states in the United States have different rules with respect to early voting. Also, voting early does not mean voting easily as in-person polling stations can also have long lines and some states have elaborate mail-in ballot processes. Why are people voting early in the elections?The major reason attributed to the increase in early voting is the Covid- 19 pandemic. Standing in long lines on the election day is certainly not conducive to the social distancing measures that need to be adopted because of the pandemic and thus more and more people are choosing to vote early. Also, at least US 30 states have made adjustments to make it easier for people to vote early and through absentee ballots. Also Read: Trump deploys 2016 playbook, Biden expands 2020 battle groundWhat is the stand of President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden on early voting?Trump has been claiming since the beginning of the election cycle that mail-in ballots can lead to voter fraud even though he voted early in person in Florida. On the other hand, Democratic nominee Biden has continuously encouraged early voting.Will early voting impact the election?An increase in early voting will obviously increase the overall turnout of the election. This means that counting of the votes will take much more time and the results of the election could be delayed. President Trump has also claimed that postal voting leads to fraud in the elections although there has been no evidence of fraud in the system. But the results of the elections could be questioned by Trump if they aren’t in the favour of the Republican Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-what-is-early-voting-and-how-will-it-impact-the-white-house-race/story-ph443pCkImuZJn45mBfmYI.html
26-10-2020||World||China to sanction US firms over arms sales to Taiwan||China will impose unspecified sanctions on Boeing Co.’s defense unit, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. after the US State Department approved $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taiwan last week.The sanctions will be imposed “in order to uphold national interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters Monday in Beijing. Boeing Defense would be among those sanctioned, he said.The action follows the State Department’s approval last week of $1.8 billion in new weapons for Taiwan and submission of the package to Congress for a final review. The new arms sale, and an earlier one involving Lockheed F-16 fighters, have taken place amid rising tension between the superpowers ahead of the U.S. election next week.The new package includes 135 SLAM-extended-range land attack missiles from Boeing, Himars mobile artillery rocket systems from Lockheed, and Raytheon surveillance and reconnaissance sensors to be mounted on aircraft.Shares of Boeing, down almost 50% this year, slipped 1.5% from Friday’s closing price to $164.85 in premarket New York trading on Monday. Boeing Defense is one of the Chicago-based aerospace manufacturer’s three business units, according to its website. It also makes aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner and 737 Max that are sold to Chinese airlines.Boeing emphasized the firm’s 50-year relationship with China in aviation, citing the company’s role in helping the country’s “safe, efficient and profitable aviation system to keep pace with the country’s rapid economic growth” in an emailed statement. “It’s been a partnership with long-term benefits and one that Boeing remains committed to.”One China PrincipleLockheed Martin said foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions. It works closely with U.S. authorities and its presence in China is limited, it said in an email.“We do business with more than 70 nations around the world, and all of our international sales are strictly regulated by the U.S. government,” the Bethesda, Maryland-based defense contractor said.Representatives from Raytheon weren’t immediately available for comment outside of normal U.S. business hours.In August, the U.S. and Taiwan completed the sale of 66 new model F-16 Block 70 aircraft from Lockheed. Zhao, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, condemned it at the time, saying it violates the One China principle, interferes in China’s internal affairs and will have a “major impact” on U.S.-China relations.In July, China -- which considers Taiwan part of its territory and resists any recognition of its de facto independence -- had announced sanctions on Lockheed Martin for a previous arms sale to the island.Taiwan will continue to urge the U.S. to fulfill its security pledge and sell weapons to the Asian country for defense needs, its foreign ministry spokeswoman, Joanne Ou, said in a statement delivered by text.Sales LimitsUS arms manufacturers face strict limitations on what kind of business they can do with countries deemed by Washington to be strategic rivals, such as China. Lockheed generated 9.7% of its revenue in the Asia-Pacific region last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, though that’s not broken down by individual countries.China has previously threatened to sanction U.S. companies, including General Dynamics Corp. and Honeywell International Inc., on numerous occasions over arms sales to Taiwan. It also warned it could blacklist FedEx Corp., while Ford Motor Co.’s main joint venture partner in China was fined 162.8 million yuan ($24.3 million) last year, days after the U.S. put a ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies Co.While China has often invoked the threat of putting U.S. companies on a blacklist -- or list of “unreliable entities” -- in response to various actions by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration over the past year, it has yet to name any, at least publicly.Delicate TimeFor Boeing, China’s action comes at a delicate time. The company, reeling from the hit to air travel from the coronavirus pandemic, is trying to get its besieged 737 Max plane back into the air after two fatal crashes saw it grounded around the world. China was the first place to ground the plane also has the world’s biggest 737 Max fleet.“There are a number of intangibles that could affect recertification of the Max in China and this could potentially add another dimension,” said John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting. “China took the lead in grounding the Max and it is very conscious of its role in aviation safety. There’s also the dimension of the trade tensions with the U.S., as well as the U.S. presidential election and how that turns out.”Europe’s top aviation regulator said earlier this month the plane will be safe enough to fly again before the end of this year. U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson flew the Max in September and said the controls were “very comfortable.”China, which had nearly 100 Max planes in operation prior to the grounding, doesn’t have a clear timetable for allowing the plane back into the air, Feng Zhenglin, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters in Beijing last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-sanction-us-firms-over-arms-sales-to-taiwan/story-2WCzjTKPJUbQfSdN4GEU3K.html

France posted more than 50,000 daily cases for the first time on Sunday, while the continent passed 250,000 deaths.Governments have been desperate to avoid the lockdowns which curbed the disease at the start of the year at the cost of shutting down entire economies. But the steady rise in new cases has forced them to ratchet up controls steadily.Despite deaths, South Korea urges flu vaccinationsSouth Korea urged citizens to get vaccinated against influenza and reduce the chances of an outbreak that coincides with the battle against the coronavirus, as it began free inoculations for the last eligible group.Public anxiety over the safety of flu vaccines has surged after at least 48 people died this month following vaccinations.Authorities have said they found no direct link between the deaths and the flu shots and have sought to reassure South Koreans about the safety of the vaccines against flu.Pandemic gives African money transfer firms a boostAfrica-focused money transfer companies are seeing a boom, despite predictions from the World Bank of a historic 20% drop to $445 billion in remittances to poorer countries this year due to a pandemic-induced global economic slump.Many migrant workers are turning to digital transfer services, often for the first time, to send money back home to African countries, according to executives in the mobile financial services industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-right-now/story-eCUKjOfwytFGQ6e0eA4yNK.html

Kramp-Karrenbauer said in February she no longer wanted to succeed Merkel and would stand down as CDU leader.So far, Armin Laschet, premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, erstwhile Merkel rival Friedrich Merz, and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen are running to be chairman.Laschet, who is positioning himself as the continuity candidate to succeed Merkel, had pushed for a postponement of the party congress, saying the CDU could not justify holding a conference at a time of rising coronavirus infections.Merz, in contrast, has spoken out against a delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-s-party-postpones-december-4-congress-to-choose-new-leader-sources/story-LGApyS8cj6einLQMmMJaOK.html
26-10-2020||World||Democrats ask Mike Pence to skip Barrett vote over Covid-19 risk||A deeply torn Senate is set to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, but Democratic leaders are asking Vice President Mike Pence to stay away from presiding over Monday’s session due to potential health risks after his aides tested positive for Covid-19.Barrett’s confirmation is not in doubt, as Senate Republicans are overpowering Democratic opposition to secure President Donald Trump’s nominee the week before Election Day. Pence has not said if he plans to attend as is customary for landmark votes.But Democrats said in a letter to Pence on it’s “not a risk worth taking,” according to copy obtained by The Associated Press.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and his leadership team wrote that not only would Pence’s presence violate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, “it also be a violation of common decency and courtesy.”Under the Constitution, the vice president serves as the largely ceremonial role of Senate president and can break a tie vote. Pence’s vote isn’t expected to be needed. Senate Republicans control the chamber and steered their majority to seize the opportunity to install a third Trump justice, securing a conservative court majority for the foreseeable future.“Nothing about your presence in the Senate tomorrow can be considered essential,” the Democrats wrote. They warned of the risk not just to senators but the police, restaurant workers and others who keep the Capitol running.The 48-year-old appellate judge’s rise opens up a potential new era of rulings on abortion, gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act. A case against the Obama-era health law is scheduled to be heard Nov. 10.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scoffed at the “apocalyptic” warnings from critics that the judicial branch was becoming mired in partisan politics as he defended its transformation under his watch.“This is something to be really proud of and feel good about,” the Republican leader said Sunday during a rare weekend session.McConnell said that unlike legislative actions that can be undone by new presidents or lawmakers, “they won’t be able to do much about this for a long time to come.”Pence would typically preside over Monday’s vote, but after a close aide and others on his staff tested positive for the coronavirus, it was unclear whether he would attend. He is scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Minnesota, arriving back in Washington ahead of the expected evening vote.Schumer, of New York, said the Trump administration’s drive to install Barrett during the coronavirus crisis shows “the Republican Party is willing to ignore the pandemic in order to rush this nominee forward.”To underscore the potential health risks, Schumer urged his colleagues Sunday not to linger in the chamber but “cast your votes quickly and from a safe distance.” Some GOP senators tested positive for the coronavirus following a Rose Garden event with Trump to announce Barrett’s nomination, but they have since said they have been cleared by their doctors from quarantine.The confirmation was expected to be the first of a Supreme Court nominee so close to a presidential election. It’s also one of the first high court nominees in recent memory receiving no support from the minority party, a pivot from not long ago when a president’s picks often won wide support.Barrett presented herself in public testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee as a neutral arbiter and suggested, “It’s not the law of Amy.” But her writings against abortion and a ruling on “Obamacare” show a deeply conservative thinker. She was expected to be seated quickly on the high court.“She’s a conservative woman who embraces her faith. She’s unabashedly pro-life, but she’s not going to apply ‘the law of Amy’ to all of us,” the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News Channel.At the start of Trump’s presidency, McConnell engineered a Senate rules change to allow confirmation by a majority of the 100 senators, rather than the 60-vote threshold traditionally needed to advance high court nominees over objections. It was escalation of a rules change Democrats put in place to advance other court and administrative nominees under President Barack Obama.On Sunday, the Senate voted 51-48 to begin to bring the process to a vote by launching the final 30 hours of Senate debate. Two Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted against advancing the nominee, and all Democrats who voted were opposed. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the vice presidential nominee, missed the vote while campaigning in Michigan.Monday’s final tally was expected to grow by one after Murkowski announced her support for the nominee, even as she decried filling the seat in the midst of a heated race for the White House. Murkowski said Saturday she would vote against the procedural steps but ultimately join GOP colleagues in confirming Barrett.“While I oppose the process that has led us to this point, I do not hold it against her,” Murkowski said.Collins, who faces a tight reelection fight in Maine, remains the only Republican expected to vote against Trump’s nominee. “My vote does not reflect any conclusion that I have reached about Judge Barrett’s qualifications to serve,” Collins said. “I do not think it is fair nor consistent to have a Senate confirmation vote prior to the election.”By pushing for Barrett’s ascension so close to the Nov. 3 election, Trump and his Republican allies are counting on a campaign boost, in much the way they believe McConnell’s refusal to allow the Senate to consider Obama’s nominee in February 2016 created excitement for Trump among conservatives and evangelical Christians eager for a Republican president to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Barrett was a professor at Notre Dame Law School when she was tapped by Trump in 2017 for an appeals court opening. Two Democrats joined at that time to confirm her, but none is expected to vote for her now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-ask-mike-pence-to-skip-barrett-vote-over-covid-19-risk/story-wjidID42yTHoJ37wyMqBBP.html
26-10-2020||World||House already won? Nancy Pelosi thinks so, and reaches for more||Speaker Nancy Pelosi once predicted she’d have the House majority won by November — of 2019.Now, days before the November 3 election, she seems to have done it.With control of the House hardly contested, Pelosi is expanding her reach to fortify Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and win extra House seats in case Congress is called on to resolve any Electoral College dispute with President Donald Trump.Pelosi said she feels so confident Democrats will keep the House this election, she’s already preparing to win the next one in 2022.“This year, I’m trying to win it two years in advance — by being so substantial in this election that as soon as we start into the next year, people will see our strength,” Pelosi told The Associated Press in an interview.“We intend to hold the House and grow our numbers,” she said about the election Nov. 3, and “contribute to winning the Senate and the presidency.”It’s a stunning turnaround for the speaker, who just two years ago was being challenged for her job leading House Democrats. Pelosi rose as the face of party, the House impeached the president and emboldened Democrats are on the march to pick up House seats deep into Trump country.Democrats are working to reelect some 40 House freshmen elected in the 2018 midterm to win the majority, most of them from districts Trump won in 2016. They’re digging deeper for additional seats in historically out-of-reach Republican strongholds including Nebraska, Indiana and even Alaska and Montana, where winners could tip the balance in an Electoral College dispute.To wrest control, Republicans need to gain some 20 seats, but even the House GOP leadership has downplayed their chances. Strategists say Trump is a drag at the top of the GOP ticket. Even though Republicans recruited more female and minority candidates to compete with Democrats in suburban swing districts, the battle for the House is something of an afterthought in the marquee contests for control of the White House and the Senate.“A rising tide lifts all boats, and right now it seems a Democratic tide is rising,” said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist and former top aide to House GOP leadership.Steel said it has less to to with Pelosi’s planning than the national political environment. “I attribute the presumed success of her efforts to keep the majority more to Trump’s failures than to her stated leadership,” he said.Those close to Pelosi’s political operation did not always join her prediction that Democrats would handily keep control.Trump wasn’t on the ballot when they picked up the majority two years ago, and freshmen are often the most vulnerable to defeat as they seek reelection, especially this class of lawmakers now having to run alongside the president in districts often off-limits to Democrats.Pelosi pushed ahead with the risky House vote to impeach the president in late 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine only to see the Senate, controlled by Republicans, vote to acquit him of the charges in a highly charged political environment early this year.When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Capitol abruptly shuttered. Pelosi engineered a rules change to allow the House to vote by proxy and work online, but it left lawmakers largely away from Washington. Now Pelosi is holding out for a robust Covid-19 aid package with the Trump administration, another risky move, seeking a $2 trillion-plus deal Republicans don’t want to give.Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill, who is the chairwoman of the party’s campaign arm in the House, said she counseled the new lawmakers not to get swept up in the national political debate but “run your race like you’re running for mayor” — meeting with constituents and responding to issues close to home.“When we set out to do this work in 2019 we had no idea what this cycle would hold,” said Lucina Guinn, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s executive director.The goal, she said, was to make the incumbents “as strong as possible” while also recruiting new candidates “to set up a big battlefield.”Money helps. Pelosi is on track to be a $1 billion fundraiser for her party — an eye-popping sum during nearly two decades in leadership.This election cycle she raised $227.9 million for Democrats — most of it for the House campaign arm — but she also shoveled $4 million for Biden from an August event and sent nearly $5 million to the state parties.“We are ready,” Pelosi said.She said she believes Democrats would sweep if the election were today, but it’s still a week out. “It doesn’t keep me up from the standpoint of worrying about it,” she said, “but it does get me up early to do something about it.”It’s another surprising turn that the Affordable Care Act, which helped cost Pelosi her House majority in the 2010 election after Democrats passed “Obamacare,” is now a political calling card being used to win over Trump voters during the Covid-19 crisis.Voters have come to rely on the health care law’s guarantees that those with preexisting health conditions can access insurance and parents can keep their adult children on family policies. A decade after President Barack Obama signed the ACA into law, Republicans are still trying to undo it, including in a court case heading to the Supreme Court a week after the election.“Progressive ideas are actually popular, not just with progressives but also with moderate voters, with independent voters and maybe even with some Republican voters,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a co-chair of the progressive caucus.As Pelosi, of California, becomes an even more public presence for the party, Republicans run countless campaign ads against her. But she also has a following from those celebrating her high-profile standoffs with Trump. Since the spring Covid-19 crisis, she has appeared 20 times on the Sunday morning news shows and done more than 150 national television and radio interviews, her office said.“I would not miss any opportunity, on behalf of my colleagues, to make sure that there’s clarity on where we’re coming from on some of these issues,” she said.She plans to run again for speaker, if Democrats keep control of the House: “Definitely.”But that’s for later. Pelosi notes experts have suggested Democrats will pick up between five and 15 House seats.“Our goal originally was to hold the House,” she said. “Everything we get after that will just be a further enhancement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-already-won-nancy-pelosi-thinks-so-and-reaches-for-more/story-wtlq9cPgheIatSQX9wOE5J.html
26-10-2020||World||Joe Biden calls Russia as ‘the biggest threat’ to US security, alliances||US President Donald Trump’s Democratic challenger Joe Biden says he thinks the biggest security threat to America is Russia.“I think the biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our-- our security and our alliances is Russia. Secondly, I think that the biggest competitor is China. And depending on how we handle that will determine whether we’re competitors or we end up being in a more serious competition relating to force,” Biden said in an interview with CBS’s Norah O’Donnell.During the final round of the presidential debate, Trump claimed that Biden had received $3.5 million from Russia through Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump also said during the debate that Biden’s son, Hunter, allegedly maintains business relations with Elena Baturina, the wife of former Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.Biden rejected ever taking “a penny” from foreign sources and also expressed a belief that Russia did not want his victory in the November election.Putin refused to comment on Trump’s claims that Russia allegedly sponsored Biden. “No comment,” the Russian leader said on Sunday, as aired by the Rossiya 1 broadcaster.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday commenting on the final US presidential debate that the contenders in the presidential race in the United States “compete for who dislikes Russia more.”The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any attempts to meddle in the US domestic affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-russia-as-the-biggest-threat-to-us-security-alliances/story-9l1UXqSIzqu3tdwUXmcECN.html
26-10-2020||World||‘Smear campaign’: Joe Biden dismisses Republican questions on son Hunter||Joe Biden dismissed Republican questions about his son Hunter Biden’s business entanglements as a “smear campaign” and suggested the possibility that the release of documents allegedly belonging to the younger Biden was part of a Russian disinformation campaign.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage)“When you put the combination of Russia, Giuliani, the president, together -- it’s just what it is,” Biden said, referring to President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. “It’s a smear campaign because he has nothing he wants to talk about. What is he running on? What is he running on?” the Democratic presidential nominee said in an interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes.”The interview with the former vice president aired Sunday but was conducted on Oct. 19, just as Trump began a week of publicizing unverified documents from a laptop that he and his allies purport belonged to Hunter Biden as proof of a son eager to make money off his father’s name. He also accused Joe Biden of profiting from his son’s foreign business dealings, a claim the Democratic nominee has flatly denied.(Read: Facebook prepares ‘emergency’ measures to calm possible violence during US elections)Evidence of corruption has failed to materialize regarding the laptop documents or claims made by Tony Bobulinski, who says he is a former business associate of Hunter Biden.Biden has argued that the documents could be emerging as part of a Russian disinformation campaign.“From what I’ve read and know the intelligence community warned the president that Giuliani was being fed disinformation from the Russians,” he said on “60 Minutes.” Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, he added, “is trying very hard to spread disinformation about Joe Biden.”’(Read: Trump, Biden to step up campaigning in final week before polls)Biden’s claim has not been substantiated. He said during Thursday’s debate that “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant,” the letter he referred to doesn’t conclude that Russia planted the documents. Rather, the letter noted that Russian spies had targeted Giuliani and that they were thus “deeply suspicious” that the Russian government had a role in the effort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/smear-campaign-joe-biden-dismisses-republican-questions-on-son-hunter/story-XkeCai2U2oFL1zmM4pAymO.html
26-10-2020||World||Japan will achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050, announces PM Suga||Japan will achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared Monday, outlining an ambitious agenda as the country struggles to balance economic and pandemic concerns.The policy speech at the outset of the parliamentary session was Suga’s first since he took office on September 16 after his boss Shinzo Abe resigned over health reasons. It reflects Suga’s pragmatic approach to getting things done, though it’s unclear he will have the political heft needed to overcome vested interests in weaning this resource-scarce nation from its reliance on imports of oil and gas.Suga just returned from a trip last week to Vietnam and Indonesia, where he pushed ahead with Abe’s efforts to build closer ties and promote a regional vision for countering growing Chinese influence.Now out of Abe’s shadow, back home Suga has been pumping out consumer-friendly policies. He has earned a reputation as a cost cutter.He said he intends to make a sustainable economy a pillar of his growth strategy and “put maximum effort into achieving a green society.” That includes achieving a carbon-free society by 2050.The European Union and Britain have already set similar targets for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and China recently announced it would become carbon-free by 2060. Japan previously targeted a 80% reduction by 2050.Suga portrayed the need to shift away from fossil fuels to counter climate change as an opportunity rather than a burden.“Global warming measures are no longer obstacles for economic growth, but would lead to industrial and socio-economic reforms and a major growth,” he said. “We need to change our mindset.”Japan’s current energy plan, set in 2018, calls for 22-24% of its energy to come from renewables, 20-22% from nuclear power and 56% from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas.Progress toward reducing reliance on fossil fuels has been hindered due to the prolonged closures of most of Japan’s nuclear plants after the meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant due to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in the northeastern Tohoku region.Energy experts are now discussing revisions to Japan’s basic energy plan for 2030 and 2050. The 2050 emissions-free target would require drastic changes and likely prompt calls for more nuclear plant restarts.About 40% of Japan’s carbon emissions come from power companies, and they must use more renewable sources of energy while stepping up development of technologies using hydrogen, ammonia and other carbon-free resources, experts say.Suga said he will speed up research and development of key technologies such as next generation solar batteries and carbon recycling. He also promised to reduce Japan’s reliance on coal-fired energy by promoting conservation and maximizing renewables, while promoting nuclear energy.Environmental groups welcomed his announcement. “Carbon neutrality is no longer a lofty, faraway dream, but a necessary commitment,” in line with international climate change agreements, Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement.In the short term, Japan’s top priority is to curb the pandemic while reviving the economy, Suga said.Turning to Japan’s biggest long-term problem, a low birthrate and shrinking population, Suga reiterated a pledge to provide insurance coverage for infertility treatments. He also said he would promote paternity leaves for working fathers to ease the burden of child-rearing and home-making on working mothers. He promised more help for single-parent households, more than half of which are living in poverty.Among other highlights, Suga said:—The Japan-US alliance, a cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy and security, is key to achieving a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” regional economic and security framework to counter China’s sway.—Japan, meanwhile, seeks to have stable ties and cooperate with China.—Japan is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to resolve conflicts over abductions of Japanese citizens years ago and wartime compensation and to normalize diplomacy with Pyongyang.—South Korea is “an extremely important neighbour,” but it should drop its demands for compensation over Korean wartime forced laborers to restore “healthy” bilateral relations.Since taking office Suga has crafted a populist and pragmatic image, winning public support for his relatively modest background and low-profile, hardworking style.He has ordered his Cabinet to step up implementation of pet projects such as lowering cellphone rates and accelerating use of online government, business and medical services.“I will break administrative divisions, vested interests and bad precedents to push for reforms,” Suga said.But he also said Japanese should try to help themselves before looking to the government for assistance, in line with what experts say is a conservative stance that is unsympathetic to the disadvantaged.Suga is best known for his effectiveness in corralling powerful bureaucrats to force through Abe’s policies.His hardline approach has sometimes drawn criticism. Earlier this month, he was accused of seeking to muzzle dissent by choosing not to appoint six professors out of a slate of 105 to the state-funded Science Council of Japan.The flap triggered massive protests from academics and took the public support rating for his Cabinet down about 10 points to just above 50%.Opposition lawmakers are expected to raise the issue during the 41-day session through December 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-achieve-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-announces-japan-pm-suga/story-2GU64BvBu01yqNBSs1BPSM.html
26-10-2020||World||Malaysian PM faces calls to resign after king declines proposal for Covid-19 emergency||Malaysia’s prime minister faced calls to resign from both sides of the political aisle Monday after the king rebuffed his proposal for a coronavirus emergency that critics saw as an undemocratic attempt to hold onto power.Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s proposal for the king to declare a state of emergency over a new Covid-19 outbreak would have suspended Parliament and let him dodge an imminent test of his support.Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah “is of the opinion that there is currently no need for His Majesty to declare a state of emergency in this country or any part of Malaysia,” the palace said Sunday.Malaysia’s coronavirus cases doubled to more than 26,000 in just three weeks following a new outbreak, mainly in Sabah state on Borneo island. Politicians from both sides of the divide as well as legal and medical experts have said an emergency declaration is unnecessary and there are sufficient laws to curb public movement and impose penalties to curb the virus.Some have warned that declaring an emergency could ruin the economy and plunge Malaysia into a dictatorship. Emergency laws were last invoked nationally in 1969 during deadly racial riots.In the statement from the palace, the king said the government has handled the pandemic well and he believed Muhyiddin was capable of coping with the crisis, though he also called for a halt to “all politicking” that could disrupt the government’s stability.Hours later, Muhyiddin said the Cabinet noted the king’s decision and will further discuss the decree. Local media said the Cabinet is expected to meet later Monday. His aide couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.“The priority of the Cabinet and the government at this time is to protect citizens from the Covid-19 disease,” he said in a brief statement. He also welcomed the king’s advice to ensure his government’s stability.Muhyiddin took power in March but holds only a two-seat majority in Parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has majority support but needs the monarch’s approval to form a new government, and the biggest party in the ruling coalition is angry about being sidelined in Muhyiddin’s government.A key test comes in early November when his government is due to seek approval for its 2021 budget in Parliament. If he is unable to pass the bill, pressure will build for him to resign or call new elections. A state of emergency could allow him to approve the budget without a vote and consolidate support, and he could govern through ordinances that could not be challenged in court.“In whatever way you look at it, indications are that the PM has realized that he has effectively lost his majority,” said Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid, political science professor at Malaysia’s University of Science.Calls for Muhyiddin to resign were being made on both sides.Puad Zarkashi, a senior official in the biggest Malay party in his ruling coalition, said the king thankfully wasn’t influenced by the political game that could plunge the country into a deeper crisis. He wrote on Facebook that “Muhyiddin should step down.”Opposition lawmaker Wong Chen called for the premier to resign or fire ministers who proposed the emergency.Despite the king’s rejection of the call for a state of emergency, his endorsement of Muhyiddin’s government could offer a reprieve and help the premier get the budget bill passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-pm-faces-calls-to-resign-after-king-declines-proposal-for-covid-19-emergency/story-sZyPKfKWjj2aJzLlIFzRaL.html
26-10-2020||World||Donald Trump again shadowed by coronavirus as he enters final swing||President Donald Trump enters the final week before Election Day with a surge in US coronavirus cases and another White House outbreak threatening efforts to reverse his political fortunes with a string of barnstorming rallies.Trump started the weekend on a strong note, with campaign aides believing his improved performance in the final debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden could provide a boost among voters still making up their minds.But once again, coronavirus intervened.On Saturday night came news that several people in Vice President Mike Pence’s inner circle had contracted the potentially deadly virus.Those testing positive included Pence’s longtime political adviser, Marty Obst, and the vice president’s chief of staff, Marc Short. Another member of Pence’s staff has also been diagnosed with the virus in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.Pence had been mostly untouched by the coronavirus cases that swept through the White House in the past month, infecting Trump, the first lady, their teenage son, and several top aides. In a twist, Pence also happens to lead the White House coronavirus task force.Despite the new outbreak within his office -- and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that suggest he should quarantine unless performing essential work, which should be conducted wearing a mask -- Pence said he would proceed with his official and campaign schedules.“The Vice President will maintain his schedule in accordance with the CDC guidelines for essential personnel,” Pence press secretary Devin O’Malley said in a statement.Those duties were expected to include a visit to the Senate Monday night to preside over the vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett -- Trump’s third nominee to the US Supreme Court.“As vice president I am president of the Senate. And I’m going to be in a chair,” Pence said Friday, before the outbreak in his inner circle became known. He added that he would not “miss that vote for the world.”The vice president’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on Sunday about whether Pence would continue with his plans. But his attendance would risk making coronavirus once again the center of attention at what was intended as a celebratory moment for the White House, as it did in the flurry of cases that followed Trump’s Sept. 26 Rose Garden announcement of Barrett’s selection.In a letter on Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged colleagues to “cast your votes quickly and from a safe distance” and avoid congregating on the Senate floor.“Their carelessness with the health and safety of their colleagues and Capitol employees mirrors their carelessness with the health and safety of Americans during this crisis,” Schumer wrote.Meadows RemarksDeepening the administration’s woes were comments from White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who in an interview Sunday with CNN said the US was “not going to control” coronavirus, which has killed more than 225,000 Americans.“We are not going to control the pandemic,” Meadows said. “We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation areas.”Top Democrats -- including former President Barack Obama -- seized on the remarks to argue that the Trump White House was abandoning efforts to suppress the virus.“Eight months into the pandemic, as new cases are breaking records, we need an administration that’s not going to wave the white flag,” Obama tweeted Sunday.Biden, in a statement, said the comments from Meadows signaled that “they’ve given up on their basic duty to protect the American people.”The latest White House outbreak and Meadows’ comments were amplified by a rising national case load.The US on Saturday reported record coronavirus infections for the second day in a row, adding 85,317 cases, with the nation averaging over 800 deaths a day. Hospitalizations are rising steadily, and Trump’s first Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, warned Sunday that the nation had hit “a dangerous tipping point.”Poll NumbersThe administration’s pandemic response has weighed on Trump’s campaign all year. The RealClearPolitics national polling average shows Biden with an 8-point advantage. Some 57% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of the virus with just 39% approving, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released last Wednesday.It’s also distracted from the president’s efforts to pivot to what he considers winning issues, from Biden’s remarks during last week’s debate saying he wanted to eliminate federal support for the oil industry, to questions over foreign business dealings by the Democratic nominee’s son.Still, Trump hopes a breakneck campaign schedule can help activate voters in the swing states he needs to win. The president plans three rallies in Pennsylvania on Monday, with a trip to Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nebraska slated for Tuesday.One plus for Trump is that many Republican voters aren’t that worried about Covid-19. CBS polling released on Sunday showed that in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, only between 12% and 15% of likely Trump voters said they were “very concerned” about getting the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-again-shadowed-by-coronavirus-as-he-enters-final-swing/story-kvDRWcKcTaaOhfF01f44dO.html

26-10-2020||World||Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trials produce robust immune response in elderly||The Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc produces a robust immune response in elderly people, the Financial Times said on Monday, citing early results.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, hammered the global economy and shuttered normal life across the world. The Oxford vaccine triggers protective antibodies and T-cells in older age groups, the FT said https://on.ft.com/3kxKyJI, citing two people familiar with the finding.Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated “robust immune responses” in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the newspaper reported.Oxford and AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the FT said. It did not name the publication.The FT cautioned that positive immunogenicity tests do not guarantee the vaccine will ultimately prove safe and effective in older people.AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, is seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine to protect against COVID-19.OXFORD VACCINEThe vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate.The vaccine is likely to provide protection for about a year, CEO Pascal Soriot said in June.Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine was developed by Oxford University scientists and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, which took on the task of scaling trials and production.The British drugmaker has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial. AstraZeneca resumed the U.S. trial of the experimental vaccine after approval by U.S. regulators, the company said on Friday.Staff at a major London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches of the vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc, The Sun newspaper reported on Monday.The Sun said the hospital, which was not identified, was told to prepare for the vaccine from the “week commencing the 2 November”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trials-produce-robust-immune-response-in-elderly/story-Ix7h4epigxh0kaLbnlvCEJ.html
26-10-2020||World||Archbishop Wilton Gregory to be Vatican’s first Black Cardinal from US||Pope Francis on Sunday named 13 new cardinals, including Washington DC Archbishop Wilton Gregory, who would become the first Black US prelate to earn the coveted red hat.In a surprise announcement from his studio window to faithful standing below in St. Peter’s Square, Francis said the churchmen would be elevated to a cardinal’s rank in a ceremony on Nov. 28.Francis asked for prayers so the new cardinals “may help me in my ministry as bishop of Rome for the good of all God’s faithful holy people.”The selection of Gregory won praise from LGBTQ advocates in the United States, days after Pope Francis grabbed headlines for voicing support for civil unions for gay couples.Other new cardinals include an Italian who is the long-time papal preacher at the Vatican, the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, who is a Franciscan friar; the Kigali, Rwanda, Archbishop Antoine Kambanda; the Capiz, Philippines, Archbishop Jose Feurte Advincula, and the Santiago, Chile, Archbishop Celestino Aos Braco.Another Franciscan who was tapped is Friar Mauro Gambetti, in charge of the Sacred Convent in Assisi. The pope, when elected in 2013, chose St. Francis of Assisi as his namesake saint. Earlier this month, the pontiff journeyed to that hill town in Umbria to sign an encyclical, or important church teaching document, about brotherhood.Gambetti was so surprised, at first he thought the pope was joking when he heard he was named, convent spokesperson the Rev. Enzo Fortunato said. Gambetti quickly pledged to “put himself at the service of humanity at a time so difficult to us all,” including offering compassion to the needy, Fortunato said in reference to the coronavirus pandemic.In a reflection of the pope’s stress on helping those in need, Francis also named the former director of the Rome Catholic charity, Caritas, the Rev. Enrico Feroci, to be a cardinal.The prestigious Washington archdiocese traditionally brings elevation to cardinal’s rank, so the appointment of Gregory, 73, last year by the pope had positioned him to be tapped for the honor.Still, the timing of his rise to cardinal is noteworthy, coming in the thick of increased US attention on racial injustice following the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minnesota this year. Gregory was publicly critical of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the St. John Paul II National Shrine in Washington a day after civil rights demonstrators were forcibly cleared from a square to facilitate the president’s visit to an Episcopal church in the US capital.Gregory has had his pulse on factions in the US Catholic Church, which has both strong conservative and liberal veins since he served three times as the head of the US Conference of Bishops.Conservative prelates in the United States have openly lambasted Francis for his more liberal stands, including his support for same-sex civil unions that came out in a new documentary this week.Gregory said in a statement that becoming a cardinal would allow him to work more closely with the pontiff in caring for the Catholic Church.While Gregory headed the Atlanta diocese earlier in his career, he wrote positively in a column about his conversations with Catholic parents of LGBTQ children. An advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, Francis DeBernardo, told The Associated Press that choosing Gregory for a cardinal’s post signals Francis wants “LGBTQ people to be part of the church, and he wants church people to respect them.”DeBernardo linked the appointment to Francis’ recently reported comments supporting civil unions for same-sex couples.He also praised the elevation to cardinal’s rank of a Vatican bishop who comes from Malta, a tiny, traditionally Catholic nation which has made significant progress in LGBTQ civil rights and protections in recent years.DeBernardo was referring to Mario Grech, 63, who serves at the Vatican as secretary general of the Synod of Bishops office and who formerly headed the diocese on the Maltese island of Gozo.“Since naming cardinals also affects who the next pontiff will be, the pope also shows that he is planning for the future of the church to continue in this affirming posture on issues of sexual orientation and gender identity,” the US-based DeBernardo said in a written statement.Not all of the pope’s picks might stir positive recollections.In 2010, while preaching at a Good Friday service attended by the then-pope, Benedict XVI, Cantalamessa upset both Jewish and sex abuse survivors’ groups when he likened allegations that the pontiff had covered up sex abuse cases against clerics to the “more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism.” The Vatican quickly distanced Benedict from Cantalamessa’s remarks.Nine of the new cardinals are younger than 80, and thus eligible to elect the next pontiff in a secret conclave. Some cardinals head powerful Vatican offices, and pontiffs frequently turn to cardinals for advice.No details were immediately given by the Vatican about the formal ceremony to make the churchmen cardinals, especially in view of travel restrictions involving many countries during the Covid-19 pandemic.As he has in other groups of cardinals he tapped in his papacy, Francis in this selection reflected the global nature of the Catholic Church and his flock of 1.2 billion Catholics.Others receiving the honor include Monsignor Marcello Semeraro, an Italian serving as prefect of the Vatican office which runs the saint-making process; Bishop Cornelius Sim, a Brunei native who serves as apostolic vicar of Brunei; the Italian archbishop of Siena and nearby towns in Tuscany, Augusto Lojudice; the retired bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, Monsignor Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel; and an Italian former Vatican diplomat, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi.Churchmen over 80 who are named cardinals are chosen to honor their life of service to the church. Those in this batch too old to vote in a conclave are Cantalamessa, Tomasi, Feroci and Arizmendi Esquivel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/archbishop-wilton-gregory-to-be-vatican-s-first-black-cardinal-from-us/story-nY2HwsOZ8ndyDmP2KFYL0J.html
26-10-2020||World||Singapore halts usage of South Korean flu vaccine as precaution||Singapore has temporarily halted the use of two influenza vaccines as a precaution after some people who received them in South Korea died, becoming among the first countries to publicly announce a halt of the vaccines’ usage.South Korea reported that 48 have died as of Saturday after getting flu shots, but said it would carry on with the state-run vaccination programme as they found no direct link between the deaths and the shots.No deaths associated with influenza vaccination have been reported in Singapore to date, but the decision to halt the use of SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra was precautionary, the health ministry and the Health Sciences Authority (HAS) said in a statement late on Sunday.The HSA is in touch with the South Korean authorities for further information as they investigate to determine if the deaths are related to influenza vaccinations. SKYCellflu Quadrivalent is manufactured by South Korea’s SK Bioscience and locally distributed by AJ Biologics, while VaxigripTetra is manufactured by Sanofi
26-10-2020||World||New analysis shows Mexico’s Covid-19 deaths higher than earlier estimates||Mexican health authorities acknowledged Sunday that the country’s true death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is far higher than thought, saying there were 193,170 “excess” deaths in the year up to September 26, with 139,153 of those judged to be attributable to Covid-19.That is about 50,000 more deaths than Mexico’s official, test-confirmed death toll of about 89,000, and about 56 per cent higher than the previous estimate of 103,882 pandemic deaths.Mexico has an extremely low testing rate, and officials had previously acknowledged that many people didn’t get tested or their tests were mishandled. Authorities had earlier presented the estimated Covid-19 death toll of 103,882 after taking into account mishandled tests and some other factors.But the Health Department said experts had now analyzed databases of death certificates up to late September — the latest date for which complete data was available — to come up with the latest figure of 139,153.The analysis picked up symptoms related to Covid-19 mentioned on death certificates even if they weren’t listed as the cause of death.Excess deaths are calculated by comparing the expected number of deaths from an average of previous years to those in 2020.The department did not explain the other 54,000 “excess” deaths, but experts in other countries have suggested that more people may have died from non-coronavirus causes simply because hospitals were crowded with Covid-19 patients, or people were wary of seeking medical attention for other illnesses because they feared getting infected.Mexico has a policy of testing only people who show serious symptoms of coronavirus infection, as well as a tiny sample of the wider population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-analysis-shows-mexico-s-covid-19-deaths-higher-than-earlier-estimates/story-hbTab4BCP17nAzA80lewyM.html
26-10-2020||World||Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: Armenia, Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating US-brokered truce||Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Monday of violating a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire in fighting over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, casting doubt over the prospects of the latest international push to end a month of clashes.The third truce in just over two weeks came into force at 8 a.m. local time (0400 GMT). Within minutes, Azerbaijan’s defence ministry said in a statement that Armenian forces had shelled villages in the Terter and Lachin regions.The Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry denied this and said Azeri forces had launched a missile attack on Armenian military positions on the northeastern side on the line of contact. Armenia’s defence ministry said in a statement that the Azeri side violated the ceasefire at around 9.10 a.m. local time.The latest fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, erupted on Sept. 27 and is the worst in the South Caucasus since the 1990s. Two Russian-brokered ceasefires have failed to hold.World powers want to prevent a wider war that might draw in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia. The conflict has also strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies.The latest ceasefire was agreed on Sunday after separate talks in Washington between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan.Representatives of the OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, also participated in the talks. The group said its co-chairs and the foreign ministers agreed to meet again in Geneva on Oct. 29.Commenting on the talks, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter: “Congratulations to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who just agreed to adhere to a cease fire effective at midnight. Many lives will be saved.”Nagorno-Karabakh has said that 974 of its military personnel have been killed since Sept. 27. Azerbaijan says 65 Azeri civilians have been killed but has not disclosed its military casualties.Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that 5,000 people might have been killed in the fighting.Pashinyan, the Armenian prime minister, wrote on his Facebook page that the Armenian side “continued to adhere to the ceasefire.”About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland; Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control.

We’ve applied lessons from previous elections, hired experts, and built new teams with experience across different areas to prepare for various scenarios,” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said, as quoted by the newspaper.(Read: Trump, Biden to step up campaigning in final week before polls)The tools, which Facebook is planning to deploy, were earlier designed for “at-risk” countries and have already been used in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. They allow holding back the spread of viral content and lower the threshold for the identification of potentially inflammatory posts.Facebook will implement such measures only in case of a critical situation that may cause election-related violence, the paper wrote, noting that if the company decides to use those tools, they will transform the information that millions of Americans receive.(Read: Nearly 59 million Americans have already voted, but wait for poll result could be long, says report)The Wall Street Journal added that this plan has been criticized by some members of the Facebook team and the representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties, who believe that the implementation of content regulation measures will hamper political discussion.The US presidential election, in which Trump is facing off Democratic nominee Joe Biden, is set for November 3.

26-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump, Biden to step up campaigning in final week before polls||President Donald Trump plans to intensify an already breakneck travel schedule in the final full week of the presidential campaign, overlooking a surge of coronavirus cases in the US and a fresh outbreak in his own White House.(Click here for full US election 2020 coverage)Trump is expected to hit nearly a dozen states in his last-ditch effort to recover ground from Democrat Joe Biden, including Sunday’s trip to Maine and Tuesday’s to Nebraska. Both states award electoral votes by congressional district and could be crucial in a tight election. He will hold 11 rallies in the final 48 hours alone.Biden, too, plans to pick up his travel schedule, aiming to hit the six battleground states the campaign sees as key to his chances, some with socially distanced in-person events and others with virtual events. On Tuesday the former vice president is travelling to Georgia, a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in more than a quarter-century but where polls show a tight race.The final week of the campaign is colliding with deepening concerns about a public health crisis in the US Trump is eager for voters to focus on almost anything else, worried that he will lose if the election becomes a referendum on his handling of the pandemic. Biden is working to ensure the race is just that, hitting Trump on the virus and presenting himself as a safer, more stable alternative.Also Read | Americans are learning to die with coronavirus: BidenThe stakes were clear this weekend as the White House became the locus for a second outbreak of the virus in a month. Several close aides to Vice President Mike Pence tested positive for the virus, including his chief of staff, Marc Short. Pence, though, was insistent on maintaining his aggressive political calendar, even though he was deemed a “close contact” of his adviser, claiming the privileges of being an “essential employee.”The latest outbreak has served as a potent metaphor for the divergent approaches the Trump and Biden campaigns have taken to the virus. On Sunday, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said that “we’re not going to control the pandemic” and the focus should be on containment and treatment. Trump aims to pack thousands of people, most without face coverings, across some of the upper Midwestern states bearing the brunt of the surge.“We want normal life to resume,” Trump said Sunday. “We just want normal life.”Meadows, pressed to explain why the pandemic cannot be reined in, said, “Because it is a contagious virus just like the flu.” He told CNN’s “State of the Union” that the government was focused on getting effective therapeutics and vaccines to market.Biden, in a statement, said Meadows’ comments continued with the Trump administration waving “the white flag of defeat” in the face of the virus.Biden’s team argues the coronavirus is likely to blot out any other issues that might come up in the final days of the campaign — including Biden’s recent debate-stage comment in which he affirmed he’d transition away from oil, later walked back as a transition away from federal subsidies. That strategy appeared to pay off as the outbreak in Pence’s staff refocused the national conversation once again on the pandemic.Trump and his team, meanwhile, have struggled to settle on a closing message, with the undisciplined candidate increasingly trusting his gut over his advisers. He’s grasped for dirt on his Democratic rival and used apocalyptic terms to describe a Biden presidency, but Biden has thus far proven more resilient to such attacks than Trump’s 2016 rival.“You can certainly expect that (Biden) will focus on Covid as it continues to, unfortunately, rise all across the country,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in an interview. “It’s disrupting people’s lives and people are looking for a leader to put in place plans to get it under control.”With more than a third of the expected ballots in the election already cast, it may become increasingly challenging for Trump and Biden to reshape the contours of the race. Biden is leading Trump in most national polls and has an advantage, though narrower, in many key battlegrounds.Biden is also sitting on more campaign cash than Trump and is putting it to use, blanketing airwaves with a nearly 2-to-1 advantage over the final two weeks. The incessant campaign ads from Biden feature a mix of his aspirational message with stinging critiques of Trump’s handling of the pandemic.Also Read | How Trump plowed through USD 1 billion, losing cash advantageIt’s part of what Josh Schwerin, the senior strategist for Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, says has helped Biden gain an advantage.“Those dual messages — continuing to draw a contrast with Trump, but also offering that positive aspirational message, giving people a reason to vote for Biden and not just against Trump — continues to be the best way forward. And we’re seeing it work,” he said.Indeed, Biden has seen his favorability ratings steadily rise over the course of the campaign, despite a barrage of attacks from Republicans, while Trump remains underwater in such polls. Democrats have been heartened, too, by their lead in the record numbers of early votes that have been cast across a number of battleground states — though they caution that Republicans are more likely to turn out on Election Day and certain to make up ground.Still, multiple Democrats described the “2016 PTSD” that’s keeping them up at night a week out from Election Day. In 2016, Hillary Clinton also enjoyed a lead in national and some state polls, and Democrats say their complacency then doomed their candidate. Now, with the pandemic and record numbers of mail and absentee ballots injecting a greater level of uncertainty into the election, Democrats are reluctant to let their guard down.Biden’s campaign will focus in the final week on turning out what they’ve dubbed the “Biden coalition” — Black and Latino voters, as well as suburban, college-educated whites, women and older voters disaffected by Trump.“What we see consistently is there aren’t a whole lot of undecided voters left, and at this stage of the race it’s really about turnout. It’s about educating voters to make sure they know how to vote, and it’s about making sure that that they turn out,” Bedingfield said.Biden’s campaign has emphasized the need for Democrats to stay engaged even as the polls seem to favor their candidate. In a recent memo, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said that “in a number of critical states we are functionally tied,” and warned supporters that “every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire.”Bedingfield says that’s a message the campaign will continue to push through Nov. 3.“One thing that we have been very vocal about is that we do believe the race is tighter than a lot of the public polling would suggest,” she said. “We are constantly working to ensure that people understand that there is an urgency here, and that we can’t get complacent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-trump-biden-to-step-up-campaigning-in-final-week-before-polls/story-mk116Z1SMmToGKcOATqAcP.html

26-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Nearly 59 million Americans have already voted, but wait for poll result could be long, says report||More than 58.7 million Americans have voted in the 2020 presidential election so far, surpassing all early ballots cast in the 2016 polls, but an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots has given rise to the possibility that the result could be delayed as counting of votes may stretch beyond November 3, according to a media report.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage) The report in the CNN said that according to a survey of election officials in all 50 states and Washington DC conducted by the US-based network, Edison Research and Catalist, more than 58.7 million Americans have voted so far in the election, with still 9 days left for November 3.(Read more: Early US voting surpasses 2016, nine days before election) The report said in 2016, around 58.3 million pre-election ballots were cast, including ballots in the three vote-by-mail states that year. That early vote accounted for about 42 per cent of all ballots cast in the 2016 presidential election. “Pre-election voting for the November election has surpassed all 2016 early ballots cast with 9 days left until Election Day,” the report said. “Pre-Election Day voting is skyrocketing nationwide amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and states are reporting record-breaking turnout as voters are energised to vote by mail or early in person before November,’ it said. Another CNN report, however, noted that despite the unprecedented mail-in voting, there is a possibility that full results of who between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will win the Presidential election may not be known on election night. “Election night can be synonymous with unpredictability - just look at 2016 - but this year might be even murkier than usual. The pandemic has changed the way millions of Americans vote for president,” the report said. While voters have already cast an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots, in many locations, including potential battleground states, the mail-in ballots will not be counted until after the election, “potentially leading to long delays in the news media’s ability to call the election on election night,” it said. CNN cited media experts to say that the counting could go longer than election night and could last until the next morning or until the next afternoon or even later.It said that 54 per cent of those 58.7 million votes already cast this cycle comes from 16 most competitively ranked states, which will play a crucial role in determining who wins the presidency this year. Among those states, Minnesota has currently seen the largest percentage increase in early voting turnout compared to last cycle, according to Catalist data from both years in 14 key states. The report added that younger voters (aged 18-29) are also casting significantly more ballots and make up a greater share of the pre-Election Day vote than they did around the same time four years ago in all of the key states with information available. Across all 14 of these key states, voters below the age of 30 have seen upticks in their share of the early vote compared to this point in 2016, it said. The report analyses the turnout in several key states that Trump had won by the narrowest of margins in 2016. Trump had won Florida by a little over one percentage point in 2016 and capturing the state again this year is critical to his re election prospects, it said. The report added that 35 per cent of likely voters in Florida say they have already cast a ballot. Of that group, 71 per cent said they support Biden and 27 per cent back Trump. In North Carolina, Democrats are also outpacing Republicans in their percentage of the pre-election votes, but that margin is narrowing amid a surge in early voting. The report said that about 40 per cent of the early votes that Catalist has analysed comes from Democrats compared to 30 per cent from Republicans so far. In Pennsylvania, a crucial state that Trump won by less than one percentage point in 2016, Democrats continue to hold a significant advantage over Republicans in their share of ballots already cast, according to Catalist party data. About 70 per cent of pre-election votes have come from Democrats so far, compared to about 20 per cent from Republicans, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-nearly-59-million-americans-have-already-voted-but-wait-for-poll-result-could-be-long-says-report/story-ERa6lKyB9tOT5f7BIC8uPP.html
26-10-2020||World||South Korea urges people to get vaccinated against influenza amid Covid pandemic||South Korea urged citizens to get vaccinated against influenza and reduce the chances of an outbreak that coincides with the battle on the coronavirus, as it kicked off free inoculations for the last eligible group.Public anxiety over the safety of flu vaccines has surged after at least 48 people died this month following vaccinations, while, last month, about 5 million doses had to be disposed of after not being stored at recommended temperatures.Authorities have said they found no direct link between the deaths and the flu shots and have sought to reassure South Koreans about the safety of the vaccines against flu, a disease that kills at least 3,000 each year.“Vaccination offers far greater benefits compared to side effects, and both the WHO and domestic and overseas experts agree,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told a briefing on Sunday, in a reference to the World Health Organization.Last year, more than 1,500 elderly people died within seven days of receiving flu vaccines, but those deaths were not linked to the vaccinations, the government said.As South Korea presses on with its inoculations, southeast Asia’s tiny city state of Singapore became one of the first nations this week to call a temporary halt to the use of two influenza vaccines, as a precaution.Singapore has reported no deaths linked to flu vaccinations.South Korea ordered 20% more flu vaccines this year to ward off the prospect of what it calls a “twindemic” of concurrent major flu and coronavirus outbreaks in winter.At least 1,154 instances of adverse reactions have been reported from among more than 9.4 million people inoculated since the effort began in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-urges-people-to-get-vaccinated-against-influenza-amid-covid-pandemic/story-KqJQxihHSFu40Dh67SqbmJ.html
26-10-2020||World||Thailand’s parliament meets to debate political protest tensions||Thailand’s parliament began a special session Monday that was called to address tensions as pro-democracy protests draw students and other demonstrators into the streets almost daily demanding the prime minister’s resignation.As Speaker of the House Chuan Leekpai began the session, only 450 of the total of 731 members of both houses had signed in for the meeting.The demonstrations by student-led groups in the Bangkok and other cities have three main demands: that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha step down, the constitution be amended to make it more democratic and reforms be made to the monarchy to make it more accountable.Public criticism of the monarchy is unprecedented in a country where the royal institution has been considered sacrosanct, and royalists have denounced the protesters for raising the issue.“The only way to a lasting solution for all sides that is fair for those on the streets as well as for the many millions who choose not to go on the streets is to discuss and resolve these differences through the parliamentary process,” Prayuth said last week.The non-voting session of Parliament is expected to last two days.The protesters have little confidence in the parliamentary path, declaring the government’s efforts insincere.They noted the points of discussion submitted by Prayuth’s government for debate dealt not with the protesters’ concerns but were thinly disguised criticisms of the protests themselves.They concern instead the risk of the coronavirus spreading at rallies, the alleged interference with a royal motorcade by a small crowd earlier this month, and illegal gatherings and the destruction of images of the royal family.The protesters allege Prayuth, who led a coup in 2014 as the army chief, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters also say the constitution, written and enacted under military rule, is undemocratic.Parliament in September was scheduled to vote on six proposed constitutional amendments but instead set up a committee to further consider such proposals, and then recessed.Constitutional changes require a joint vote of the House and the Senate, but the proposals lack support in the Senate, whose members are not elected and are generally very conservative and hostile to the protesters.Instead of confronting lawmakers and counter-protesters on Monday, the pro-democracy protest organizers have called for an afternoon march to the German Embassy, apparently to bring attention to the time King Maha Vajiralongkorn spends in Germany.Germany’s foreign minister, questioned in Parliament by a member of the Green Party, recently expressed concern over any political activities the king might be conducting on the country’s soil.Protesters’ criticism of the royal institution has roiled conservative Thais. Self-proclaimed “defenders of the monarchy” mobilized last week online and in rallies in several cities, in many cases led by local civil servants.A small group of royalist demonstrators were outside Parliament on Monday morning, saying they were there to let lawmakers know of their opposition to any changes in the status of the monarchy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-s-parliament-meets-to-debate-political-protest-tensions/story-wdHNAgojTJqo2zWho6m3dK.html
26-10-2020||World||China launches emergency testing to control new Kashgar outbreak||China has tested nearly three million people in Xinjiang province to tackle a cluster of coronavirus cases, in the latest example of the country’s aggressive approach to bring new outbreaks under control.A 17-year-old teenager in Kashgar prefecture was found through routine testing to have contracted the virus. Subsequent testing found 137 cases, all related to a factory where the teenager’s parents worked. Each of the cases were asymptomatic, according to Xinjiang’s health authorities.Free testing is being rolled out for nearly 4.75 million people in Kashgar, in the far west of China. As of 2 p.m. Sunday, 2.83 million people had undergone testing, while results for 334,800 people have already come out negative.Authorities have implemented controls on mobility within 10 kilometers of the county where the cluster was found, but transportation in the region remains open and residents can leave if they tested negative within the past seven days. No restrictions are placed on external visitors.While new infections in China had remained below 100 a day since mid-August, with most of them imported, the country continues to see small flare-ups, with the most recent in the eastern port city of Qingdao earlier this month. It has managed to stamp out these clusters -- including an outbreak in Beijing in June -- through mass testing campaigns that screen millions of citizens for the virus within days.The new outbreak in Kashgar reflects the difficulty of stamping out the coronavirus entirely in any one country. Other Asian nations like Thailand and New Zealand have maintained long stretches of virus-free periods, only to see the pathogen appear again. Still, China so far has been able to stamp out each new cluster, even as the U.S. and Europe struggle with fresh waves of record infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-emergency-testing-to-control-new-kashgar-outbreak/story-Unpkik3COmDkGPdcgaEZLO.html

26-10-2020||World||Chileans vote in favour of rewriting Constitution||Amid a year of contagion and turmoil, Chileans turned out Sunday to vote overwhelmingly in favor of having a constitutional convention draft a new charter to replace guiding principles imposed four decades ago under the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.The country’s conservative government had agreed with the center-left opposition to allow the plebiscite after the outbreak of vast street protests that erupted a year ago in frustration over inequality in pensions, education and health care in what has long been one of South America’s most developed nations.The Electoral Service said Sunday night that with nearly all polling stations reporting, about 78% ballots of the 7.3 million votes counted favored drawing up a new constitution, while just under 22% were opposed. About 79% supported having the charter be drafted by a convention of 155 elected citizens rather than a convention with half its members elected citizens and half members of congress.In a speech to the country, center-right President Sebastián Piñera said acknowledged the victory for those seeking a new charter but cautioned it is only the start of a long process.“It is the beginning of a path, which together we will have to go through to agree on a new constitution for Chile,” said the president, who had opposed having a new constitution though he had conceded earlier in the day that it likely would be supported by voters.The special convention would begin drafting a new constitution that would be submitted to voters in mid-2022.As Piñera spoke, thousands of people celebrated in a central square of the capital used for festivities and protests. Similar gatherings were held on the outskirts of Santiago.“What happened in the social outburst is now reflected in the outcome of the plebiscite,” said one celebrant, Paulina León. “I was part of the marches a year ago and I have to take care of my decision and help build a dignified constitution.”Felipe Caviedes also joined in, saying that “I am part of the social diversity that was marginalized 30 years in this country and now, at last, we can create it ourselves. Now there are real changes coming.”Chile’s current constitution was drafted by the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and was sent to voters at a time where political parties had been banned and the country was subject to heavy censorship.It was approved by a 66%-30% margin in a 1980 plebiscite, but critics say many voters were cowed into acceptance by a regime that had arrested, tortured and killed thousands of suspected leftist opponents following the overthrow of an elected socialist government.“I think that many people went to vote out of fear,” said political scientist Claudio Fuentes, who wrote a book about that plebiscite titled, “The Fraud.”“The current constitution has a flaw of origin, which is that it was created during the military dictatorship in an undemocratic process,” said Monica Salinero, a 40-year-old sociologist who supports drafting a new charter.The free-market principles embodied in that document led to a booming economy that continued after the return to democracy in 1990, but not all Chileans shared.A minority was able to take advantage of good, privatized education, health and social security services, while others were forced to rely on sometimes meager public alternatives. Public pensions for the poorest are just over $200 a month, roughly half the minimum wage.Luisa Fuentes Rivera, a 59-year-old food vendor, said hopes that “with a new constitution we will have better work, health, pensions and a better quality of life for older people, and a better education.”But historian Felipe Navarrete warned, “It’s important to say that the constitution won’t resolve the concrete problems. It will determine which state we want to solve the problems.”Claudia Heiss, head of the political science department at the University of Chile, said it would send a signal about people’s desires for change, and for a sort of politics that would “allow greater inclusion of sectors that have been marginalized from politics.”Conservative groups fear the revamp could go too far, and endanger parts of the constitution that have helped the country prosper.“The people have demonstrated saying they want better pensions, better health, better education. and the response of the political class” is a process that won’t solve the problems and will open a period of uncertainty,” said Felipe Lyon, 28-year-old lawyer and spokesman for the group “No, Thanks” that opposes the change.The decision to allow the vote came after hundreds of thousands of Chileans repeatedly took to the streets in protests that often turned violent.The vote was initially scheduled for April, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has killed some 13,800 Chileans, with more than 500,000 people infected by the new coronavirus.Officials trying to ensure voters felt safe barred infected persons or those close to them from the polls, and long lines formed at voting places. Voters had to wear masks — dipping them only briefly for identification purposes — and brought their own pencils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chileans-vote-in-favour-of-rewriting-constitution/story-HmlrE3ZQuz9XJchhoV1XKJ.html

Hospitalizations are also rising and have hit a two-month high and deaths are trending upwards, according to a Reuters tally. So far in October, 29 states have set records for increases in new cases, including five considered key in the Nov. 3 presidential election: Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Cases in the Midwest set a new record on Saturday and the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in that region hit an all-time high for the ninth day in a row.Hospitals are strained in several states including North Dakota, which is the hardest hit based on recent new cases per capita, according to a Reuters analysis. The city of El Paso in Texas is asking residents to stay home for the next two weeks and the wider El Paso County closed its parks and recreational facilities for 14 days.In addition, an El Paso County judge ordered late Sunday a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew due to the Covid crisis. The curfew order went into effect immediately, but it does not apply to essential workers or people traveling.Over the last three weeks, the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in the El Paso area has tripled to a record 786, according to state data. “If we continue on this trend, we risk detrimental effects to our entire healthcare system,” the city’s public health director, Angela Mora, said in a statement.“For the sake of those hospitalized and the frontline healthcare workers working tirelessly each day to care for them, we ask you to please stay home for two weeks and eliminate your interactions with those outside your household until we can flatten the curve.” On Saturday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the federal government to allow the use of an army medical center at Fort Bliss by non-coronavirus patients to ease the burden on hospitals. On Sunday, Abbott said state emergency management officials will open an alternate care site this week, initially with 50 beds, at the El Paso Convention and Performing Arts Center. New White House outbreakPence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, tested positive on Saturday as well as multiple other senior aides. Despite the outbreak, the White House said the vice president would press ahead with campaigning, visiting North Carolina on Sunday and Minnesota on Monday. The new infections offered a reminder of the way Trump - who was hospitalized for three nights this month after contracting Covid-19 - and those around him have downplayed the advice of public health experts to wear masks and observe social distancing guidelines to stem Covid-19 transmission.Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” why Pence was not following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to quarantine for 14 days after such exposure, Meadows on Sunday cited the vice president’s status as “essential personnel.”The latest outbreak follows what health experts described as a super-spreader event at the White House on Sept. 26 where President Donald Trump announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-highest-number-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-past-two-days/story-ygqKeKCykW6fmE7hDo4RRI.html
26-10-2020||World||Kamala Harris to campaign in Texas on last day of early voting||A massive number of people have already voted in Texas since early voting started on October 13, leading experts to predict that the state could reach overall turnout levels unseen so far this century.Over seven million people have already voted in the state of Texas ahead of next week’s general election, a figure that accounts for nearly 43 per cent of all registered voters in the state. A total of 25,658 people voted in person Sunday and 560 mail ballots were returned while 1,090,445 people in Harris County have cast a ballot so far as per Harris County Clerk. President Trump won Texas in 2016, as has every Republican presidential nominee for several decades, but Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign is hoping a surge in early and mail-in voting will turn the state blue for the first time since the late 1970s. Meanwhile, Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, will head to Texas Friday, the last day of early voting in the state, as polls show a close race at the top of the ballot here.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s campaign sent an email to Democratic lawmakers Sunday saying the travel plans “will be publicly released momentarily,” the Texas Tribune reported. It’s not clear yet where in the state Harris, a US senator from California, will campaign.According to US Rep Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, the trip comes amid massive voter turnout in Texas.“As the most recent statewide polls showing Vice President Biden ahead and the historic voter turnout in Central Texas and urban areas across the state indicate, we are changing Texas,” Doggett said in a statement. “Sen Harris would not be here near election eve were this not a winnable state. And, as Texas changes, we will change our country and our world for the better.” Biden’s wife, Dr Jill Biden, and Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, have made campaign stops in Texas in recent weeks. Joe Biden, however, has stuck to more traditional battleground states such as Pennsylvania.A Dallas Morning News/UT-Tyler poll among likely voters released Sunday shows Biden with a narrow lead over President Donald Trump, 48 per cent to 45 per cent, within the margin of error. The poll was conducted October 13-20.Texas has seen high voter participation during the early voting period, which began Oct. 13. As of Saturday, nearly 7 million Texans had voted, according to the Texas secretary of state’s office, or roughly 40 per cent of all registered voters.A Quinnipiac University poll conducted Oct 16-19 and released Wednesday found that Texans who are casting their ballots at early voting locations are more likely to back Biden, with 48 per cent of early voters for Biden and 46 per cent for Trump. Among those who said they will vote in person on Election Day, 62 per cent support Trump and 32 per cent back Biden. And among those who are voting by mail or absentee ballot, 63 per cent said they are voting for Biden and 31 per cent for Trump. The survey also showed Sen John Cornyn’s (R-Texas) lead over Democrat MJ Hegar slipping since September.Cornyn now has an 8-point lead over Hegar. He had an 11-point advantage in the September poll.Republicans have pounced on Biden’s remarks about the oil industry at the Thursday debate, which they believe could hurt the Democrat in Texas and other states.“And how do they propose to ‘transition’ 270 million cars with internal combustion engines? What will that cost?” Cornyn tweeted last week.The October poll shows that Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to be a major political problem.Forty-four per cent of Texans said they have no confidence in Trump’s ability to keep the public safe from the virus, up from 32 per cent who said so last month.The poll, however, shows that Texas voters continue to feel more confident about Trump’s ability to manage the economy compared with Biden, validating GOP lawmakers and strategists who have said for months that the economy is the president’s biggest advantage. The poll shows Biden leading Trump among voters aged 18 to 44 and Trump winning those 45 years old and older. Trump has support from 56 per cent of Texas voters older than 65, his best age group. A spokeswoman for the president’s reelection campaign said volunteers knocked on 131,000 doors and made 838,000 phone calls to Texans last week.“The Democrats talk a big game but are falling short in the face of Trump Victory’s superior ground game and spirit,” spokeswoman Samantha Cotten said Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-campaign-in-texas-on-last-day-of-early-voting/story-ldFDncASboATiMLZ4vI7bP.html
26-10-2020||World||Typhoon Molave displaces thousands of villagers, floods villages in Philippines||A fast-moving typhoon forced thousands of villagers to flee to safety in provinces south of the Philippine capital Monday, flooding rural villages and ripping off roofs, officials said.There were no immediate reports of casualties from Typhoon Molave, but authorities reported at least one person was missing and seven others were rescued after their yacht sank off Batangas province south of Manila.The typhoon has sustained winds of 125 kilometers (77 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 miles) per hour and was blowing westward at 25 kph (15 mph). Molave is expected to start blowing out of the country into the South China Sea on Monday, government forecasters said.At least 25,000 villagers were displaced with about 20,000 taking shelter in schools and government buildings which were turned into evacuation centers, according to the Office of Civil Defense.“Villagers are now asking to be rescued because of the sudden wind which blew away roofs,” Humerlito Dolor, governor of Oriental Mindoro province, told DZMM radio.Dolor said pounding rains overnight swamped farming villages in his province then fierce winds toppled trees and power posts early on Monday, knocking off power. Authorities were clearing roads of fallen trees and debris in some towns after the typhoon passed, he said.More than 1,800 cargo truck drivers, workers and passengers were stranded in ports after the coast guard barred ships and ferry boats from venturing into rough seas.About 20 typhoons and storms annually batter the Philippines, and the Southeast Asian archipelago is seismically active, with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-molave-displaces-thousands-of-villagers-floods-villages-in-philippines/story-oNbIncejZpWFySX2rdkiaI.html
26-10-2020||World||Early US voting surpasses 2016, nine days before election||Early voting in the 2020 US election has surpassed all the pre-election ballots from four years earlier, an independent vote monitor said Sunday, with nine days still to go before the November 3 poll.Millions of Americans wary of crowded polling booths during the coronavirus pandemic and energized by an election fight that both President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden have framed as existential are smashing records for casting ballots, whether by mail or in person.The tally by the independent US Election Project, run by the University of Florida, said that as of Sunday more than 59 million people had voted so far.That is higher than the 57 million who voted early or by mail in 2016, according to the US Election Assistance Commission website. So far, Democrats -- who have encouraged early voting -- have been leading the way, but whether that means Biden can breathe easy remains to be seen.Trump for months has been claiming, without evidence, that mail-in ballots lead to fraud, and many Republicans are expected to vote on Election Day.With coronavirus cases spiking across the country, however, Michael McDonald -- a political science professor at the University of Florida who administers the Election Project -- warned that the strategy “looks all the more risky.”“What if at least some of his voters decide not to vote? What if a polling place becomes unavailable or an election office shuts down?” he tweeted.The Election Project has predicted that turnout this year could top 150 million in total. Some 137 million ballots were cast in the 2016 election.Some states key to the 2020 outcome were also firmly on the path to breaking records, such as Texas, where the Election Project said Sunday that 80 percent of the early 2016 vote had already turned out.“Folks, Texas still has in-person early voting until Friday, plus Election Day. No doubt Texas turnout will be above 2016. Question is, how much?” McDonald tweeted.The election in Texas, traditionally a conservative bastion which has backed Republican candidates since 1980, is under close scrutiny, with some polls showing Biden in a position to edge out Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-us-voting-surpasses-2016-nine-days-before-election/story-0pOAhe3OlnRhTL4n0mI7GP.html
26-10-2020||World||Winds send California fire risk soaring, forcing blackouts||Violent winds are rattling Northern California, sending the risk of wildfires soaring and prompting the state’s largest utility to cut power to prevent live wires from toppling into dry brush and sparking blazes.PG&E Corp. has cut electricity to 225,000 homes and businesses in areas north of San Francisco earlier on Sunday and will turn off power to an additional 136,000 in areas including the East Bay and South Bay in the evening, impacting an estimated 1.1 million people as gusts exceeding 50 miles (80 kilometers) an hour swept through an area already bone-dry from heat and drought. Utilities in Southern California warned they may need to cut power, too.“This is the strongest event we have seen so far this year,” said Karleisa Rogacheski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento. It’s some of most dangerous weather the state has seen since the Camp Fire erupted in 2018, killing 85 people, she said.PG&E said it may restore power starting Monday afternoon, though some customers may be left in the dark through Tuesday.By mid-afternoon Sunday, at least three blazes had broken out north of Sacramento, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The brutal winds, fires and blackouts are the latest blow for a state that’s been battered by violent weather and has already seen a record 4.1 million acres (1.66 million hectares) scorched this year. PG&E has previously cut power four times in 2020 to prevent falling wires from igniting blazes in a region that’s tinder dry from heat and drought. This round is the biggest yet as an estimated 4.2 million people are at risk from extreme fire conditions, according to the National Weather Service.The winds, fueled by a low pressure system in the Pacific Northwest, were gusting as high as 52 mph in Northern California at 10:30 a.m. local time. Gusts in canyons and atop ridges could hit 70 mph, just shy of hurricane strength.Fire fighters were battling three new blazes in Shasta County, including the Point Fire which had burned 275 acres and was 70% contained by about 6 p.m. Local time, Cal Fire said. The nearby Dersch Fire had burned at least 50 acres.Come Monday, humidity will be as low as 6% in Redding and just 5% in Grass Valley, according to the National Weather Service. It comes as the state is already riddled with dry brush and grasses due to some of the warmest temperatures record over the last nine months, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information.PG&E is cutting power in stages. It began at 10 a.m. local time Sunday in the Northern Sierra region and will continue through Monday evening, the company said. The outages will hit 36 counties that include the San Francisco Bay area, the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Central Valley and the Central Coast.The blackouts may hit densely populated parts of the San Francisco metropolitan area, including portions of Oakland, Berkeley and Marin County -- cutting power to many residents as they are working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic. The city of Berkeley advised residents living in the hills to evacuate due to the fire risk, according to a statement.In Southern California, Edison International said about 75,000 customers could lose power beginning Monday. That’s about 225,000 people based on the size of the average California household. Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co. is considering about 21,000 outages.And Pacific Power, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said it could switch off power in Northern California and Southern Oregon on Sunday due to the gusts, according to a statement.Much of the U.S. West is at risk from wildfires as dry weather and stiff winds turn hillsides, forests and scrub land into tinderboxes. In Colorado, two of the largest fires in state history have forced the closure of Rocky Mountain National Park and triggered the evacuation of nearby towns.More than 8 million people across California will be in high-risk zones, including the cities of Sacramento, Stockton, and San Bernardino, the U.S. Storm Prediction Center said in its long-range forecast.The outages come on the heels of a blistering heat wave that gripped California earlier this month, driving temperatures to record daily highs. In August, a freak lightning storm sparked more than 150 wildfires in 24 hours. Days before that, the state’s grid operator ordered the first rotating outages since the Enron-era energy crisis of 2001 as scorching weather sent electricity demand surging.PG&E began resorting to preventative shutoffs after its equipment caused some of California’s worst blazes, forcing the company into bankruptcy last year. PG&E emerged from Chapter 11 in July after paying $25.5 billion to resolve fire claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/winds-send-california-fire-risk-soaring-forcing-blackouts/story-8Zu34dFCyXAeOWAxn2Px0I.html
26-10-2020||World||Pak soldiers did not even have weapons during Kargil war, claims Nawaz Sharif||While addressing the third anti-government rally of Pakistan opposition’s 11 -party alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif said that a few generals, were behind the 1999 Kargil war between India and Pakistan, and not the army.“The task of initiating the Kargil war, which witnessed the deaths of our brave soldiers, and disgraced Pakistan in front of the world, was not done by the Army, but by a few generals. They threw not only the Army but the country and community in the war in such a place, that nothing could be achieved from it. The moment was painful for me when I learnt that our brave soldiers lamented that when they were sent to the peaks, without food. They did not even have weapons. They sacrificed their lives. But what did the country or community achieve?” said Sharif, who spoke through a video link from London.He said these generals, who were behind the Kargil war, were also the ones who plotted a coup on October 12, 1999 and declared martial law to hide their actions and escape punishment.”Pervez Musharraf and his companions used the Army for personal gains, and disgraced them,” he added.Sharif said the PDM has risen against unconstitutional power “that has made Pakistan hollow from inside and out”, reported Dawn.”Looking at this enthusiasm, I am sure that no one will be able to violate the respect for the vote now. I saw this enthusiasm in Gujranwala and Karachi, and now I’m seeing it in Quetta,” said the former Prime Minister from London.Also Watch | Pakistan opposition parties unite to oust Imran Khan govt: Key details He criticised the PTI government’s performance and claimed that he was disqualified as premier over a “flimsy charge”, according to Dawn.In his speech, Sharif also addressed the arrest of PML-N leader retired Captain Mohammad Safdar, stating that it was “shameful” how police officials barged into the room and violated the privacy of his daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif and her husband.”On whose order is the privacy of people violated? On whose orders are doors broken down. If even the province’s chief minister doesn’t know, then who is behind it?” he said.The third anti-government rally of Pakistan opposition’s 11-party alliance, PDM, took place in Quetta, Balochistan on Sunday.PDM had earlier organised two mammoth rallies in Gujranwala and Karachi as part of countrywide agitations, calling for the resignation of Imran Khan. Earlier, the police had “arrested” Safdar Awan, from the hotel they were staying in Karachi, hours after the PML-N vice-president had lashed out at Prime Minister Imran Khan and the PTI government at the second power show of PDM.”Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt. Safdar,” Maryam tweeted early Monday.Several police officers on Tuesday applied for leave in order to “come out of the [...] shock” caused by the registration of an FIR and arrest of Safdar, according to Dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-soldiers-did-not-even-have-weapons-during-kargil-war-claims-nawaz-sharif/story-i2RCOjiw3pj9Xa6AHSlrIL.html
26-10-2020||World||US Senate advances nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to Supreme Court||The US Senate on Sunday voted to advance President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, paving the way for a full Senate confirmation vote probably to happen Monday.Sunday’s procedural vote meant to break a Democratic filibuster in the Republican-controlled upper chamber, where the GOP senators needed only a simple majority to advance the nomination, and the result was 51-48.If confirmed, which is all but assured given the Republican resolve to do so, Judge Barrett, a conservative, will be a Supreme Court justice who has gone through one of the quickest confirmation proceedings in modern U.S. history, replacing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon.Democrats opposed the installation of Barrett on the high court for the lifelong tenure, citing the proximity to the Nov. 3 presidential election.Having grilled Barrett over issues from Obamacare and abortion rights during the 48-year-old appellate court judge’s confirmation hearings earlier this month, Senate Democrats, however, conceded that they didn’t have the tools to prevent the Republicans from speeding up the process.Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was one of just two GOP senators who opposed a full Senate vote on the Barrett nomination, but she announced Saturday she will vote yes if the Senate does take up a vote.Susan Collins, Republican senator from Maine who also expressed concerns that the nomination was too close to the election, is still expected to vote not to confirm Barrett.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-advances-nomination-of-judge-amy-coney-barrett-to-supreme-court/story-WQF2ZWlUJtmkpYbEXxSjcP.html
26-10-2020||World||WHO chief warns against ‘vaccine nationalism’||The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday called for global solidarity in the rollout of any future coronavirus vaccine, as the number of cases soared across the world.In a video address at the opening of the three-day World Health Summit in Berlin, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the only way to recover from the pandemic was together and by making sure poorer countries had fair access to a vaccine.“It is natural that countries want to protect their own citizens first but if and when we have an effective vaccine, we must also use it effectively. And the best way to do that is to vaccinate some people in all countries rather than all people in some countries,” he said.“Let me be clear: vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic, not shorten it.”Scientists around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, which has killed over 1.1 million people.Several dozen vaccine candidates are currently being tested in clinical trials, ten of which are in the most advanced “phase 3” stage involving tens of thousands of volunteers.The European Union, the United States, Britain, Japan and a slew of other nations have already placed large orders with the companies involved in developing the most promising vaccines.But concerns are growing that countries with smaller wallets could be left at the back of the queue.The WHO has launched an international scheme known as Covax to help ensure equitable access to jabs, but it has struggled to raise the funds needed.‘Greatest crisis’The WHO on Sunday reported a third straight day of record new infections across the world, calling on countries to take further action to curb the spread of the disease.The agency’s figures showed that 465,319 cases were declared for Saturday alone, half of them in Europe.“This is a dangerous moment for many countries in the northern hemisphere as cases spike,” Tedros said.But he added that people weren’t powerless against the virus, stressing the importance of social distancing, hand washing, and meeting outdoors instead of inside.“Again and again we have seen that taking the right actions quickly means the outbreak can be managed.”Speaking at the same summit, which is being held online this year, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his video message called the pandemic “the greatest crisis of our times”.“We need global solidarity every step of the way,” he said, echoing the plea for developed countries to support those with fewer resources.“A vaccine must be global public good,” Guterres said.“Vaccines, tests and therapies are more than life savers. They are economy savers and society savers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-warns-against-vaccine-nationalism/story-ITyAavfrPGPfsnLfodA7JP.html
26-10-2020||World||Fire set in Boston ballot drop box; FBI asked to investigate||A fire was set Sunday in a Boston ballot drop box holding more than 120 ballots in what appears to have been a “deliberate attack,” Massachusetts election officials said.The state has asked the FBI to investigate the fire that was set around 4 a.m. in a ballot drop box outside the Boston Public Library downtown, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin’s office said.In a joint statement, Galvin and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh called it a “disgrace to democracy, a disrespect to the voters fulfilling their civic duty, and a crime.”“Our first and foremost priority is maintaining the integrity of our elections process and ensuring transparency and trust with our voters, and any effort to undermine or tamper with that process must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” they said in the emailed statement. “We ask voters not to be intimidated by this bad act, and remain committed to making their voices heard in this and every election.”Boston Police said an arson investigation is underway and released surveillance images of a person near the ballot box at that time, urging the public to help identify the individual.Officers called to the scene saw smoke coming out of the box before firefighters managed to extinguish the fire by filling the box with water, police said.There were 122 ballots inside the box when it was emptied Sunday morning, and 87 of them were still legible and able to be processed, Galvin’s office said. The box had last been emptied around 2:30 p.m. on Saturday.Voters can go online to see whether their ballot was processed. Those who used that dropbox between Saturday afternoon and 4 a.m. Sunday and can’t confirm the status of their ballot online should contact the Boston Elections Department immediately, officials said.Voters whose ballots were affected can either vote in person or by a replacement ballot that will be mailed to them, officials said. If those voters don’t submit a new ballot, “their original ballot will be hand-counted to the extent possible,” Galvin’s office said.An email seeking comment on whether the FBI is investigating was sent to an agency spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-set-in-boston-ballot-drop-box-fbi-asked-to-investigate/story-qyFg5KLuyHJDmtbSIp7FaM.html
26-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Malaysia’s king rejects PM’s proposal to declare state of emergency||Malaysia’s king on Sunday rejected a proposal by embattled Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to declare a state of emergency to fight a new outbreak of the coronavirus.The plan by Muhyiddin, which involves suspending Parliament, has sparked national outrage, with critics slamming the move as an undemocratic means for him to hang on to power amid challenges to his leadership.The palace said in a statement that Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah “is of the opinion that there is currently no need for His Majesty to declare a state of emergency in this country or any part of Malaysia.” Muhyiddin met with the monarch on Friday to seek royal assent but hasn’t made any public comment. The palace’s statement came after the king conferred with other royal households earlier Sunday to discuss the prime minister’s proposal. Sultan Abdullah said the government has handled the pandemic well and believes that Muhyiddin is capable of implementing measures to cope with the crisis. But the monarch called for a halt to “all politicking” that could disrupt the government’s stability. The king can declare a state of emergency that allows the country to be governed through ordinances that cannot be challenged in court. Muhyiddin took power in March after instigating the cause of the former reformist alliance, but his government is shaky, with only a two-seat majority in Parliament. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has alleged that he has the support of a majority of lawmakers to topple Muhyiddin, but hasn’t managed to secure the monarch’s support. Still, Muhyiddin faces a key test early next month when his government is due to seek approval for its 2021 budget in Parliament. If he is unable to pass the bill, pressure will build for him to resign or call new elections. A state of emergency could allow him to delay that vote and consolidate support. The king said there was “no need for MPs to continue with irresponsible actions that can affect the stability of the government.” He stressed that the budget is crucial in the fight against Covid-19 and to restore the economy, and urged Malaysians to unite to stem the virus’s spread. Malaysia’s coronavirus cases doubled to more than 26,000 in just three weeks following a new outbreak, mainly in Sabah state on Borneo island. Politicians from both sides of the divide as well as the Bar Council, the medical association and other groups have said there is no need for an emergency decree because there are sufficient laws to curb public movement and impose penalties to curb the virus. Some also have warned that declaring an emergency could plunge the country into a dictatorship and ruin the economy. Some media outlets have cited sources as saying that Muhyiddin wanted an “economic emergency” to merely suspend Parliament, without any curfew. The last time emergency laws were invoked nationally was in 1969 during deadly racial riots. Muhyiddin withdrew his party from Anwar’s reformist alliance that won 2018 elections and joined with the opposition to form a Malay-centric government in March. Then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned in protest, saying he wouldn’t work with the corruption-tainted opposition that he ousted in 2018 polls. Apart from Anwar, Muhyiddin also faces threats from the key ally in his ruling coalition, which is angry about being sidelined despite being the biggest party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-malaysia-s-king-rejects-pm-s-proposal-to-declare-state-of-emergency/story-W47FuZtCcsYQtKfySJcF8O.html
26-10-2020||World||Killing of Al-Qaeda leader points to its links with Taliban: Afghan govt||Afghan forces have killed a top al Qaeda militant wanted by the US, as the government on Sunday accused the Taliban of still keeping close ties with the Islamist militant group.Abu Muhsin al-Masri, an Egyptian national believed to be the group’s number two in the Indian subcontinent, was targeted in eastern Ghazni province, Afghanistan’s intelligence agency said in a statement.The National Directorate of Security did not provide further details about the operation or when it was carried out.Masri’s killing was an indication of the relationship between the Taliban and al Qaeda, Afghanistan’s interior minister Masoud Andarabi claimed on Sunday without providing details.“The killing of one of the key al Qaeda member, al-Masri by the National Directorate of Security demonstrates close ties of the Taliban with the terrorist groups that are operating against the Afghan government and its people,” he tweeted.“They still keep close relations with the terrorist groups and they are lying to different sides.”The Taliban’s sheltering of al Qaeda was the original reason for the US invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 attacks.In a landmark deal with the US in February, the Taliban agreed to not allow Afghan soil to be used by foreign extremists including al Qaeda, in return for Washington withdrawing its troops from the country.Masri, who also goes by the name Husam Abd-al-Ra’uf, is on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists list. A US warrant for his arrest was issued in December 2018 after he was charged with providing support and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation and plotting to kill US nationals, according to the FBI.A source at the Afghan intelligence agency, who did not want to be named, told AFP that an aide to Masri who was “in contact with the Taliban” was also detained during the operation in Ghazni province, a volatile region where Taliban fighters are very active.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/killing-of-al-qaeda-leader-points-to-its-links-with-taliban-afghan-govt/story-7PGywB3ElvisYmSKUi0wEO.html
26-10-2020||World||Treaty banning nukes ratified but US, major powers not on board||The United Nations has announced that 50 countries have ratified a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons triggering its entry into force in 90 days, a move hailed by anti-nuclear activists but strongly opposed by the US and the other major nuclear powers.As of Friday, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, known as the TPNW, had 49 signatories, and UN officials said the 50th ratification from Honduras had been received.  “This moment has been 75 years coming since the horrific attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the founding of the UN which made nuclear disarmament a cornerstone,” said Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize-winning coalition whose work helped spearhead the nuclear ban treaty. “The 50 countries that ratify this Treaty are showing true leadership in setting a new international norm that nuclear weapons are not just immoral but illegal.”“The United Nations was formed to promote peace with a goal of the abolition of nuclear weapons,” Fihn said. “This treaty is the UN at its best — working closely with civil society to bring democracy to disarmament.”The 50th ratification came on the 75th anniversary of the ratification of the UN Charter, which officially established the United Nations and is celebrated as UN Day. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commended the 50 states and saluted “the instrumental work” of civil society in facilitating negotiations. The US had written to treaty signatories saying the Trump administration believes they made “a strategic error” and urging them to rescind their ratification. The US letter, obtained by The Associated Press, said the five original nuclear powers - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - and America’s NATO allies “stand unified in our opposition to the potential repercussions” of the treaty.It says the treaty “turns back the clock on verification and disarmament and is dangerous” to the half-century-old Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, considered the cornerstone of global non-proliferation efforts.“The TPNW is and will remain divisive in the international community and risk further entrenching divisions in existing non-proliferation and disarmament fora that offer the only realistic prospect for consensus-based progress,” the letter said. “It would be unfortunate if the TPNW were allowed to derail our ability to work together to address pressing proliferation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/treaty-banning-nukes-ratified-but-us-major-powers-not-on-board/story-xOMMMJgOOti3wD0cSorfSP.html
26-10-2020||World||Donald Trump warns GOP may lose Senate||US President Donald Trump has privately told donors that it will be “very tough” for Republicans to keep control of the Senate in the election because he would not support some of its candidates, the Washington Post reported.“There are a couple senators I can’t really get involved in. I just can’t do it. You lose your soul if you do. I can’t help some of them. I don’t want to help some of them,” Trump told a fundraiser last week, the paper reported on Sunday citing an attendee. Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate. To control the upper chamber, Democrats need to win three seats if Joe Biden wins the presidency in the November 3 polls.Trump, meanwhile, appears to have gone back to the 2016 playbook for the final nine days of the race, hoping to pull off a similar win. Biden, on the other hand, has kept the focus on the present and is seeking to expand the battleground states. On Saturday, Biden and his former boss Barack Obama hammered Trump at separate rallies on his failure to contain Covid-19.“There’s something going on. It happened this time four years ago. This time more,” Trump told supporters in Ohio, a battleground state he had won in 2016 but now leads Biden by a razor-thin margin of 1.5 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.Trump has striven to paint Biden as a corrupt politician just as he did with his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, and indulgently watched his supporters chant “Lock him up,” a 2020 version of “Lock her up”.Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told Post, “There are striking similarities to the president’s campaign in 2016 — a tight race, an enthusiasm advantage and clear momentum down the stretch for Donald Trump.”Trump had trailed Clinton in polls at this stage in 2016 by similar margins — by 6.1 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight average on October 24, 2016. Four years since, Trump trails Biden by 9.1 percentage points.Biden is seeking to expand his advantage by taking the battle into Republican territory: Georgia, where he will address two rallies on Tuesday.Obama was scathing in his remarks on his successor. “Eight months into this pandemic, new cases are breaking records,” he said. “He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself.” That was a reference to Trump’s own bout with Covid-19. Vice-President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, has tested positive for coronavirus along with key adviser Marty Obst, raising the prospect of another outbreak within the White House. Pence himself has tested negative and will continue to campaign for Trump’s re-election, his office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-warns-gop-may-lose-senate/story-JyU2q5pBKi7afjf2iYGGtI.html
26-10-2020||World||Pak joint oppn holds massive rally in Quetta||Pakistan’s joint opposition on Sunday held a massive rally in Quetta, despite a blast in a different part of the city earlier that left three people dead.Addressing the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) third march against the Imran Khan government, Pakistan Muslim League-N chief Nawaz Sharif asked Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to answer for the country’s current situation. “Gen Bajwa, you will have to answer for record rigging in the 2018 elections, for horse-trading in the Parliament, for making Imran Niazi prime minister against people’s wishes and by tearing apart the Constitution and laws, for pushing people towards poverty and hunger,” he said via video link from London. He accused Inter-Services Intelligence Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed of “interfering in politics for several years with impunity” in violation of his oath. PDM had held two mammoth rallies in Gujranwala and Karachi in the past weeks seeking the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan.Earlier in the day, at least three people were killed and six others wounded when a bomb exploded in a suburban neighbourhood of Quetta, home to several separatist and Islamist insurgencies. The bomb was concealed in a motorcycle. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.Prime Minister Khan said on Sunday that French President Emmanuel Macron has “attacked Islam” by encouraging the display of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. He was responding to Macron paying tribute to a French teacher beheaded by an Islamist who wanted to avenge the use of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of expression.“Sadly, President Macron has chosen to deliberately provoke Muslims, incl his own citizens, through encouraging the display of blasphemous cartoons targeting Islam & our Prophet, ” Khan tweeted. Khan said Macron had “chosen to encourage Islamophobia by attacking Islam rather than the terrorists”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-joint-oppn-holds-massive-rally-in-quetta/story-fdK9yEUYcvMbDC4D58ZAFJ.html
26-10-2020||World||After 3 days of record Covid-19 cases, Spain declares virus emergency||Spain declared a national state of emergency on Sunday to tackle a second coronavirus wave as the World Health Organization reported a third straight day of record new infections across the world.The WHO has warned that some countries are on a “dangerous track”, with too many witnessing an exponential increase in cases, and called on governments to take further action to curb the spread of the disease.The UN agency’s figures showed 465,319 cases were declared on Saturday alone, half of them in Europe.The WHO has said that the northern hemisphere was at an especially critical juncture with winter looming.After Spain became the first EU member state to pass one million cases, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced the new state of emergency and overnight curfews across the entire country except for the Canary Islands.Italy, the epicentre of the first European outbreak, also ramped up restrictions on daily life, ordering the closure of theatres, cinemas and gyms and shutting bars and restaurants early.Dozens of far-right protesters in Rome clashed with riot police overnight during a demonstration against a curfew, setting off fireworks, burning bins and throwing projectiles.In Britain, Scotland Yard officers facing anti-lockdown demonstrations in central London made 18 arrests, with three officers receiving injuries following clashes with the protesters.Large groups of protesters were seen marching through the city on Saturday with banners and placards calling for “freedom” and an end to Covid-19 restrictions, which has currently placed the UK capital under Tier 2 – under which any gatherings over the “rule of six” are prohibited.The Metropolitan Police said that it made arrests for a variety of offences, including breaching coronavirus regulations, assaulting an emergency service worker, violent disorder and for being wanted.In Germany, several people attacked the Robert Koch Institute, the country’s national disease control centre, with incendiary devices in the national capital early on Sunday.  Criminal police has taken over the investigation on suspicion that the attack may have been politically motivated. In Poland, Warsaw police detained 278 people on Saturday after thousands protested against new curbs.US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Sunday it would be clear whether a vaccine was safe and effective by early December, but that more widespread vaccination would not be likely until later in 2021.“We will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, the beginning of December,” he told the BBC.“Vaccinating a substantial proportion of the population, so that you can have a significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak, that very likely will not be until the second or third quarter of the year.” New York and New Jersey reported the most new Covid-19 cases since May, while daily infections across the US reached a record of more than 83,000. New Jersey extended a public health emergency for another month. Illinois had the most new cases since the pandemic began.Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that 83,718 new cases in the US were reported on Saturday, nearly matching the 83,757 infections reported on Friday. Before that, the most single-day cases in the US had been 77,362, on July 16.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington currently forecasts that the country’s Covid-19 death toll could exceed 318,000 by January 1.In South America, Colombia became the eight country to reach 1 million confirmed Covid cases on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-declares-virus-emergency/story-1OxL8kNVEAfp5HvQxR9jTL.html

26-10-2020||World||Turkey tried to open a back door for Pakistan at FATF, China bailed out||Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, the only country to back Pakistan at the plenary meeting of the global anti-money laundering watchdog, had proposed a special visit to Islamabad to make an onsite assessment of the Imran Khan government’s implementation to plug holes in its legal framework to curb terror financing.The suggestion at the plenary last week before February 2021 was seen as an effort to let Pakistan off the hook for now and immediately place it on the white list but was not supported by any other country including ‘all-weather ally’ China and Malaysia. Turkey, Pakistan and Malaysia have been trying to emerge as a new radical Islamic axis to upstage the established order led by Saudi Arabia.The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) eventually decided to retain Pakistan on its grey list, comprising countries whose controls over terror financing are deemed inadequate and are placed “under increased monitoring”. It was also handed out a sharp warning by FATF president Marcus Pleyer, who told Islamabad that it couldn’t take forever to deliver.Indian counter-terror officials said Turkey’s unsuccessful attempt to pull Pakistan out of the grey list reflected a lack of diplomatic support across the member states for Pakistan that is often described by India as an epicentre of terrorism in South Asia.“It does appear that Pakistan’s efforts to exit the grey list have reached a dead end, not unless it takes substantive and not cosmetic steps to tighten control over terror financing over the next four months,” a top counter-terror official in New Delhi said. Prime Minister Imran Khan, who already faces a combined opposition offensive, hadn’t said a word on the FATF decision. Global dirty money watchdog FATF is scheduled to review Pakistan’s status again in 4 months.If the FATF’s plenary concludes that Pakistan has completed the 27 action points, the watchdog will move to the next stage to send a team to Islamabad to evaluate if the measures in place are working effectively. It is only if Pakistan clears this test that the FATF would consider letting Pakistan emerge out of the grey list.Indian officials said this is going to be a big ask that Islamabad is unlikely to be able to deliver on, particularly given the deep linkages between the terror groups and the establishment that uses them as tools to serve its interests in Jammu and Kashmir and Afghanistan.Enacting laws is the easier part. Enforcing them on the ground will be difficult, an Indian official said, pointing to allegations from the opposition that Imran Khan went on an overdrive not to get out of the FATF grey list but arm himself with laws to target opposition leaders.“It is going to be unlikely that Pakistan will crack down on terror groups that the establishment has conceived, birthed and nurtured,” a second official said. By way of example, he pointed to the long list of terrorists designated by the United Nations who have a free run in Pakistan.“The UNSC 1267 Sanctions List has 130 names from Pakistan, which claims that it can locate only 19,” the second official cited above added, wondering if the Pakistan Army - which the opposition alleges holds the remote control to the government - can throw Pakistan’s terror leadership behind bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-is-trying-to-eject-from-fatf-grey-list-could-run-into-a-dead-end/story-bdbLLJX1mL6B8Ol2K8BC8H.html
