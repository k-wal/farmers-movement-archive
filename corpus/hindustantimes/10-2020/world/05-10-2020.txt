05-10-2020||World||Paris shuts bars to brake Covid-19 spread||Bars and cafes in Paris and its nearest suburbs, placed on maximum coronavirus alert Monday, will be shuttered for two weeks under new measures to slow the rapid spread of Covid-19 cases, officials said.With the rate of new infections, hospitalisations and deaths accelerating months after the lifting of a nationwide lockdown, new rules to enforce social distancing will enter into force on Tuesday.“These are braking measures because the epidemic is moving too fast,” Paris police chief Didier Lallement told journalists.France reported nearly 17,000 new coronavirus cases on Saturday alone, the highest daily number since the country began widespread testing. For Paris, the number was about 3,500 new cases every day -- with a high of nearly 6,000 recorded last Monday, said Aurelien Rousseau, director of the ARS regional health agency.- ‘Sad, and unfair’ -Bars in Paris have continued to draw large crowds of people often flouting physical distancing and mask-wearing guidelines.But some in the industry said they felt unfairly singled out.“We’re really the guardians of good behaviour, we keep an eye on our clients,” said Remi, who runs the morning shift in a cafe and restaurant in central Paris.“Everything is clean, everybody wears masks. When people entertain at home that’s when they become irresponsible. Nobody wears a mask during an evening with friends, me included,” he told AFP, declining to give his last name.Liam Porisse, co-owner of Corcoran’s, a spacious Irish pub, said revenue had already dropped 70 percent compared with pre-virus business, and his venue was losing more than 2,000 euros ($2,350) each day.“Closing down is a bit of a relief, really,” he told AFP, as he poured “a last drink” before shuttering the pub. “It’s cheaper than staying open.”Laurent, who runs a bar in Paris, said he too had been losing money for months.“I’ve kept the place open so I don’t lose clients, not to make money,” he said, “and now I’m going to lose them anyway, to restaurants.”“It’s sad, and unfair,” added Jacques, owner of another Paris bar. “Nobody thinks it’s going to be just two weeks, it’s more likely going to be a month or six weeks,” he said. “Time enough for all of us to get depressed.”Rousseau said there were 203 active coronavirus “clusters” in larger Paris.He urged inhabitants of Paris and its suburbs, which jointly form the Ile-de-France region and are home to nearly seven million people, to go back to working from home as much as possible.- ‘It’s not going to work’ -Restaurants, however, can continue to operate provided they meet stricter new conditions, Lallement said.These will include making sanitising hand gel available at each dining table, limiting patrons to six at a table with at least a metre (3.3 feet) between seats, and allowing patrons to remove their masks only for eating.“We must continually find a balance between the health of our fellow citizens and the reality and necessity of economic and social life,” Lallement said.For smaller restaurants the new rules sound like a death knell, said Michel, who owns a tiny eatery that also operates as a cafe and a bar -- depending on the time of day -- and as a tobacconist.The enforced distancing “is not going to work for small restaurants. They won’t be able to fit enough people in,” he told AFP. “Everybody is going have to crunch numbers: Is it worth staying open or not?”“I think I’m going to shut it all, except for the tobacco sales, until further notice,” he said.Rousseau said 36 percent of intensive care hospital beds in Ile-de-France are taken up by coronavirus patients -- a ratio expected to rise to 50 percent in the coming weeks.“The pressure is strong,” he said. “The point is to brake this progression.”Lallement said pools and gyms in Paris will remain off-limits except for school activities, public gatherings would be limited to ten people, and there would be a ceiling of 1,000 people on open air stadiums for sporting or cultural events.Visits to people in old-age homes may continue but only by appointment and limited to two visitors at a time.Alcohol sales after 10:00 pm will remain prohibited, as will weddings and other parties in reception halls.burs-mlr-jh/js/pma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-shuts-bars-to-brake-covid-19-spread/story-4cqOxii2PM21hA7i5IDRvJ.html
05-10-2020||World||Armenia and Azerbaijan clash as Iran works on peace plan||Armenia accused Azerbaijan of firing missiles into the capital of the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh on Monday, while Azerbaijan said several of its towns and its second-largest city were attacked.Iran, which borders both countries, said it was working on a peace plan for the decades-old conflict, which reignited last month and has killed scores of people on both sides.The region of Nagorno-Karabakh lies inside Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994.Armenian military officials reported missile strikes in the territorial capital of Stepanakert, which came under intense attacks all weekend. Residents told the Russian state RIA Novosti news agency that parts of the city were suffering shortages of electricity and gas after the strikes.Firefights of varying intensity “continue to rage” elsewhere in the conflict zone, Armenian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said on Facebook.Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said that while Nagorno-Karabakh’s army “confidently controls the situation” in some areas where fighting is going on, it is “very difficult” in other areas.The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, in turn, accused Armenian forces of shelling the towns of Tartar, Barda and Beylagan. Ganja, the country’s second-largest city far outside the conflict zone, also was “under fire,” officials said.Hikmet Hajiyev, aide to Azeirbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, tweeted that Armenian forces attacked “densely populated civilian areas” in Ganja, Barda, Beylagan and other towns “with missiles and rockets.”Armenia’s Foreign Ministry dismissed allegations of attacks being launched from Armenia’s territory as a “disinformation campaign” by Azerbaijan.Vahram Poghosyan, spokesman for Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader, warned via a Facebook post that the territory’s forces would target military facilities in Azerbaijani cities in response to strikes on Stepanakert and Shushi, another town in Nagorno-Karabakh.The fighting erupted Sept. 27 and has killed dozens, marking the biggest escalation in the conflict. Both sides have accused each other of expanding the hostilities beyond Nagorno-Karabakh.According to Nagorno-Karabakh officials, about 220 servicemen on their side have died in the clashes since then. Eighteen civilians have been killed and 90 others wounded. Azerbaijani authorities haven’t given details about military casualties, but said 24 civilians were killed and 124 wounded.Nagorno-Karabakh was a designated autonomous region within Azerbaijan during the Soviet era. It claimed independence from Azerbaijan in 1991, about three months before the Soviet Union’s collapse. A full-scale war that broke out in 1992 killed an estimated 30,000 people.By the time the war ended in 1994, Armenian forces not only held Nagorno-Karabakh itself but also substantial areas outside the territory borders.Aliyev has repeatedly said Armenia’s withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh is the sole condition to end the fighting.Armenian officials allege Turkey is involved in the conflict on the side of Azerbaijan and is sending fighters from Syria to the region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said “a cease-fire can be established only if Turkey is removed from the South Caucasus.”Turkey’s government has denied sending arms or foreign fighters, while publicly siding with Azerbaijan.On a trip to Ankara, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-country military alliance is “deeply concerned by the escalation of hostilities,” and urged Turkey to help end the fighting.“I expect Turkey to use its considerable influence to calm tensions,” Stoltenberg told reporters after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who reiterated calls for Armenia to withdraw from the region.“Everyone, and especially NATO, must make a call for Armenia to withdraw from these territories, in line with international laws, U.N. Security Council resolutions and Azerbaijan’s territorial and border integrity,” Cavusoglu said.The Foreign Ministry of Iran, which has nearly 760 kilometers (470 miles) of border with Azerbaijan and a short border with Armenia, said it is working on a peace plan.Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not elaborate but said Iran is talking to all related parties.“Iran has prepared a plan with a specific framework containing details after consultations with both sides of the dispute, Azerbaijan and Armenia, as well as regional states and neighbors, and will pursue this plan,” he said.Khatibzadeh also warned both sides against expanding the hostilities into Iranian territory.“Any aggression against the borders of the Islamic Republic, even inadvertently, is a very serious red line for the Islamic Republic that should not be crossed,” he said.Since the beginning of the conflict, stray mortar shells have injured a child and damaged some buildings in rural areas in northern Iran, near the border with Azerbaijan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-and-azerbaijan-clash-as-iran-works-on-peace-plan/story-CFSTwjMorRCbemuPoCwf3I.html
05-10-2020||World||Malaysia PM quarantines as minister tests positive for coronavirus||Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Monday he will self-quarantine after a Cabinet minister he was in contact with tested positive for the coronavirus, as cases in the country hit a record high.Muhyiddin had chaired an October 3 meeting attended by Religious Affairs Minister Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri, who confirmed Monday he has been hospitalized for treatment.The health ministry has warned that Malaysia is facing a new wave of virus cases as the outbreak has widened in recent days. New clusters have sprung up in many states amid increased travel to eastern Sabah state, a hotspot zone, for a state election last month.New virus cases hit a record daily high of 432 on Monday, bringing Malaysia’s tally to 12,813 with 137 deaths. Nearly half were from a prison in a northern state, and 130 were in Sabah.Muhyiddin, who took power in March after a political coup, said in a statement that he underwent virus testing every two weeks since April. But since returning from campaigning in Sabah, he had tested three times since Sept. 22 and all were negative.However, he said he will observe the quarantine and work from home until October 16. Muhyiddin said all those in close contact with Zulkifli at the meeting will undergo compulsory quarantine, while others are advised to observe self-isolation.Local reports said the attendees included several ministers, the national police chief, the armed forces chief and the health director-general. Health ministry officials couldn’t be immediately reached for confirmation and further details.This was the second time that Muhyiddin has voluntarily observed a self-quarantine. He did the same in May when one of his Cabinet officers was diagnosed with the virus.Local reports said religious minister Zulkfili visited two states and attended a number of events including at mosques and universities since returning from Sabah on Sept 24. Zulkifli apologized in a Facebook post and urged all those at events he attended to undergo virus tests.The government also announced Monday that more areas in Sabah, including state capital Kota Kinabalu, will be locked down to curb the virus. Sabah is just a boat ride away from the south of the Philippines, which has recorded more than 324,000 cases.Malaysia resumed its economic activities in June after nearly three months of lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-pm-quarantines-as-minister-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-Bb4pSHii2PYTALsTsYtqlJ.html
05-10-2020||World||US, Australia, India, Japan to discuss China’s growing power||Foreign ministers from four Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group are gathering in Tokyo on Tuesday for talks that Japan hopes will increase their involvement in a regional initiative called “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” aimed at countering China’s growing assertiveness.The meeting — the first in-person talks among the foreign ministers since the coronavirus pandemic broke out — brings together US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.Japanese officials say they will discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) initiative for greater security and economic cooperation that Japan and the US have been pushing to bring together “like-minded” countries that share concerns about China’s growing assertiveness and influence.On his way to Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters that the four countries hope to have some “significant achievements” at the meeting, but did not elaborate.The talks come weeks ahead of the US presidential election and amid escalating tensions between the US and China over the virus, trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights. Pompeo is attending the Quad meeting, though he canceled subsequent planned visits to South Korea and Mongolia after President Donald Trump was hospitalized with the coronavirus.The talks follow a recent flareup in tensions between China and India over their disputed Himalayan border. Relations between Australia and China have also deteriorated in recent months.Japan, meanwhile, is concerned about China’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea. Japan also considers China’s growing military activity to be a security threat. Japan’s annual defense policy paper in July accused China of unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea, where it has built and militarized manmade islands and is assertively pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea’s key fisheries and waterways.New Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will make his in-person diplomatic debut when he attends part of the Quad meeting. He will also hold separate talks with Pompeo on deepening the Japan-US alliance and the FOIP.“The world is possibly becoming even more unpredictable and uncontrollable due to heightening selfish nationalism and growing tension between the US and China,” Suga said in an interview with Japanese media on Monday. He said he will pursue diplomacy that is based on the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone and “strategically promote the FOIP,” while establishing stable relations with neighbors including China and Russia.He said he also plans to promote the FOIP during a planned visit to Southeast Asia later this month.Suga replaced Shinzo Abe, who resigned due to poor health, on Sept. 16, pledging to carry on Abe’s hawkish diplomacy and security policies. Abe has been a driving force behind FOIP. Japan sees it as crucial to have access to sea lanes all the way to Middle East, a key source of oil for the resource-poor island nation.Suga, a former chief Cabinet secretary, has little experience in diplomacy. Balancing between the US, Japan’s main security ally, and China, its top trading partner, will be tough, analysts say.“The challenges of Japan-US relations are not in themselves, but in where Japan stands when US-China disputes intensify,” said Yasushi Watanabe, an expert on US diplomacy at Japan’s Keio University. ”It would be best for Japan to take a pragmatic approach to China while maintaining the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone,” he said. “And it is indispensable for Japan to strengthen cooperation with the EU, Britain, Australia and ASEAN.”Japan hopes to regularize the Quad foreign ministers’ talks and broaden their cooperation with other countries.That would be a major challenge for the Quad, said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. “A shared threat perception of China does not mean shared views on what to do and if it’s possible to build the Quad into something along the lines of NATO,” he said.The US and Australia would favor the idea, but Japan and India are ambivalent and so is ASEAN, he said. “Transforming the Quad into a collective security organization targeting China forces governments to choose sides. Beijing has generated an arc of anxiety in Asia but there is a preference for dialogue and negotiations, not saber rattling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-australia-india-japan-to-discuss-china-s-growing-power/story-NNmxsJYCp5NPutqKvjg4bM.html
05-10-2020||World||Covid-19: A royal thumbs up for journalism||The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of journalism and trusted sources of news at a time when people have access to a large number of sources, Queen Elizabeth said on Monday.The contribution of the news media has been ‘invaluable’ during the pandemic, she said in a message to the industry organisation News Media Association, which is holding a ‘Journalism Matters’ week from October 5 to 11.The queen wrote: “The Covid-19 pandemic has once again demonstrated what an important public service the established news media provides, both nationally and regionally”. “As our world has changed dramatically, having trusted, reliable sources of information, particularly at a time when there are so many sources competing for our attention, is vital”, the queen, whose family has at times had a tense relationship with the British news media, said.The ‘Journalism Matters’ week aims to highlight the vital role trusted news media journalism plays in democratic society, the association said.By campaigning on behalf of readers, independent news media can make a difference to people’s lives and bring about change for the better, it said.The queen added in her message: “The efforts of the news media to support communities throughout the United Kingdom during the pandemic have been invaluable – whether through fundraising, encouraging volunteering, or providing a lifeline for the elderly and vulnerable to the outside world”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-a-royal-thumbs-up-for-journalism/story-kQtWufmARU5y0lpPyHVCFK.html
05-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, moving to show strength, aims for Monday release||President Donald Trump was hoping for a Monday discharge from the military hospital where he is being treated for Covid-19, a day after he briefly ventured out while contagious to salute cheering supporters by motorcade in a move that disregarded precautions meant to contain the deadly virus that has killed more than 209,000 Americans.White House officials said Trump was anxious to be released after three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where doctors revealed on Sunday that his blood oxygen level dropped suddenly twice in recent days and that they gave him a steroid typically only recommended for the very sick. Still, the doctors said Trump’s health is improving and volunteered that he could be discharged as early as Monday to continue the remainder of his treatment at the White House.“This is an important day as the president continues to improve and is ready to get back to a normal work schedule,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told Fox News on Monday. He said the determination on whether Trump would leave the hospital won’t be made until later in the day after the president is evaluated by his medical team, but that Trump was “optimistic” he could be released Monday.Less than one month until Election Day, Trump was eager to project strength despite his illness. The still-infectious president surprised supporters who had gathered outside the hospital, driving by in a black SUV with the windows rolled up. Secret Service agents inside the vehicle could be seen in masks and other protective gear.The move capped a weekend of contradictions that fueled confusion about Trump’s health, which has imperiled the leadership of the US government and upended the final stages of the presidential campaign. While Trump’s physician offered a rosy prognosis on his condition, his briefings lacked basic information, including the findings of lung scans, or were quickly muddled by more serious assessments of the president’s health by other officials.In a short video released by the White House on Sunday, Trump insisted he understood the gravity of the moment. But his actions moments later, by leaving the hospital and sitting inside the SUV with others, suggested otherwise.“This is insanity,” Dr. James P. Phillips, an attending physician at Walter Reed who is a critic of Trump and his handling of the pandemic. “Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary presidential ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quarantined for 14 days. They might get sick. They may die.”White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump’s trip outside the hospital “was cleared by the medical team as safe to do.” He added that precautions were taken, including using personal protective equipment, to protect Trump as well as White House officials and Secret Service agents.Joe Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, said the Democratic presidential nominee again tested negative for coronavirus Sunday. The results come five days after Biden spent more than 90 minutes on the debate stage with Trump. Biden, who has taken a far more cautious approach to in-person events, had two negative tests on Friday.The White House has refused to say when Trump last tested negative and whether he was tested before the debate, but the Cleveland Clinic, which co-hosted the event, said that Trump’s team certified the day of the debate that he and everyone who accompanied him in the debate hall had received a negative COVID-19 test.For his part, Trump still faces questions about his health.His doctors sidestepped questions on Sunday about exactly when Trump’s blood oxygen dropped — an episode they neglected to mention in multiple statements the day before — or whether lung scans showed any damage.It was the second straight day of obfuscation from a White House already suffering from a credibility crisis. And it raised more doubts about whether the doctors treating the president were sharing accurate, timely information with the American public about the severity of his condition.Pressed about conflicting information he and the White House released on Saturday, Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley acknowledged that he had tried to present a sunnier description of the president’s condition.“I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness has had,” Conley said. He said he “didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction. And in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true. The fact of the matter is that he’s doing really well.”Medical experts said Conley’s revelations were hard to square with his positive assessment and talk of a discharge.“There’s a little bit of a disconnect,” said Dr. Steven Shapiro, chief medical and scientific officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.It was not clear for how long Trump’s recovery would continue at the White House once he is discharged.According to CDC guidelines, “In general, transport and movement of a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes.”Even before Trump’s motorcade outing on Sunday, some Secret Service agents have expressed concern about the lackadaisical attitude toward masks and social distancing inside the White House, but there isn’t much they can do, according to agents and officials who spoke to The Associated Press. This close to the election, thousands of agents are engaged on protective duty so they can be subbed out quickly should someone test positive.The disclosures about Trump’s oxygen levels and steroid treatment suggested the president is enduring more than a mild case of Covid-19.Blood oxygen saturation is a key health marker for Covid-19 patients. A normal reading is between 95 and 100. Conley said the president had a “high fever” and a blood oxygen level below 94% on Friday and during “another episode” on Saturday.He was evasive about the timing of the Trump oxygen drops. But he revealed that Trump was given a dose of the steroid dexamethasone in response. At the time of the briefing, Trump’s blood oxygen level was 98% — within normal rage, Trump’s medical team said.Signs of pneumonia or other lung damage could be detected in scans before a patient feels short of breath, but the president’s doctors declined to say what those scans have revealed.“There’s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern,” Conley said. He declined to outline those “expected findings.”Asked about Conley’s lack of transparency, White House aide Alyssa Farah suggested the doctors were speaking as much to the president as to the American public: “When you’re treating a patient, you want to project confidence, you want to lift their spirits, and that was the intent.”In all, nearly 7.4 million people have been infected in the United States, and few have access to the kind of around-the-clock attention and experimental treatments as Trump.Trump’s treatment with the steroid dexamethasone is in addition to the single dose he was given Friday of an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that supplies antibodies to help the immune system fight the virus. Trump on Friday also began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways — the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus, and remdesivir curbs the virus’ ability to multiply.Garibaldi, a specialist in pulmonary critical care, said the president was not showing any side effects of the drugs “that we can tell.”The National Institutes of Health Covid-19 treatment guidelines recommend against using dexamethasone in patients who do not require oxygen. It has only been proven to help in more serious cases. Among the concerns with earlier use is that steroids tamp down certain immune cells, hindering the body’s own ability to fight off infection.Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications. First lady Melania Trump has remained at the White House as she recovers from her own bout with the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-moving-to-show-strength-aims-for-monday-release/story-ljV2EdYc00TlV1W6wIKm8L.html
05-10-2020||World||James Bond fails to save closure of theatre chain Cineworld||Agent 007 battled many warlords, mafia dons and criminals to save people over the decades, but on Monday failed to prevent the closure of Cineworld, one of the largest cinema chains in the UK and the US after the release of the latest James Bond film No Time To Die was put off again.Producers announced last week that the film, which has been postponed twice this year, would now be released on April 2, 2021. It was widely expected to help bring people back into cinema houses grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic.Over 5,500 jobs in the UK and 20,000 in the US are set to go after Cineworld announced temporary closure of its hundreds of cinemas on Monday. “Cineworld confirms that it will be temporarily suspending operations at all of its 536 Regal theatres in the US and its 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK from Thursday 8 October 2020,” it said in a statement.Earlier, a statement on the James Bond film’s website said: “MGM, Universal and Bond producers, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, today announced the release of No Time To Die, the 25th film in the James Bond series, will be delayed until 2 April 2021 in order to be seen by a worldwide theatrical audience”. “We understand the delay will be disappointing to our fans but we now look forward to sharing No Time To Die next year”, it added.Reacting to Cineworld’s announcement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go to cinemas and enjoy themselves to support them. Cinema houses and other entertainment venues have reported major fall in business in recent months. Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: “We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets,” adding that the company “cannot underscore enough how difficult this decision was” to close the sites.“Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-bond-fails-to-save-closure-of-theatre-chain-cineworld/story-av1TzlDNOC9bIhs8xYMByL.html
05-10-2020||World||Prime Minister Rishi Sunak? ‘Definitely not,’ says UK’s chancellor of the exchequer||British finance minister Rishi Sunak on Monday denied he was eyeing the job of his beleaguered boss, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and vowed to uphold his “sacred responsibility” of rebalancing the books after a splurge of coronavirus spending.The 40-year-old Indian-origin chancellor of the exchequer is being portrayed as a leader-in-waiting by some Conservative lawmakers and right-wing commentators, after resisting stricter curbs on public life to counter the Covid-19 crisis.He told the Conservative party’s annual conference on Monday that the “overwhelming might of the British state” will be deployed to deal with the Covid-19 crisis and kickstart the ailing economy.Riding a crest of popularity among party members – the latest ConservativeHome survey places him at the top of the ‘cabinet league table’ – Sunak listed several multi-billion-pound schemes he had announced to help employees, companies and the self-employed.But when asked at a side event if he wanted the keys to Number 10 Downing Street, Sunak said: “Oh God. No. Definitely not, seeing what the prime minister has to deal with.”“It’s a job hard enough for me to do,” Sunak said, chuckling, asked whether he was looking to move next door from the chancellor’s residence at 11 Downing Street.“I think he and I are personally close,” Sunak said, and confirmed Johnson called him “Rish”.When asked what he called Johnson, Sunak said: “I call him prime minister. He keeps trying to tell me to call him other things... but I just stick with PM.” At the conference, Sunak downplayed any rift with Johnson, while acknowledging the “difficult trade-offs and decisions” forced upon the government as Britain endures the worst pandemic toll in Europe.On the coronavirus crisis, he told his audience: “(We) are only part way through this crisis. What began in March as a health emergency has grown and now reaches deep into our economy and society. Not only does it endanger lives, but jobs and education. It separates friends and family”.“I am committing myself to a single priority – to create, support and extend opportunity to as many people as I can. Because even if this moment is more difficult than any you have ever faced, even if it feels like there is no hope, I am telling you that there is, and that the overwhelming might of the British state will be placed at your service”.As of Sunday night, the UK had registered 502,978 cases and 42,350 deaths (including 813 patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in England). Technical issues about recording new cases have surfaced in recent days, but officials said these have now been resolved.Sunak admitted that borrowing to fund support schemes would challenge future budget exercises, and cautioned that hard choices would need to be made to balance the books, indicating that tax rises could be one of the ways of dealing with deficits.He said: “We have a sacred responsibility to future generations to leave the public finances strong, and through careful management of our economy, this Conservative government will always balance the books”.“If instead we argue there is no limit on what we can spend, that we can simply borrow our way out of any hole, what is the point in us? I have never pretended there is some easy cost-free answer. Hard choices are everywhere. I won’t stop trying to find ways to support people and businesses”, he added.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prime-minister-sunak-definitely-not-uk-s-rishi-sunak-says/story-IoCZD9Uy4OBncoRTDCqXhL.html
05-10-2020||World||WHO says 10 per cent of world’s people may have been infected with coronavirus||The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization said Monday its “best estimates” indicate that roughly 1 in 10 people worldwide may have been infected by the coronavirus — more than 20 times the number of confirmed cases — and warned of a difficult period ahead.Dr. Michael Ryan, speaking to a special session of the WHO’s 34-member executive board focusing on Covid-19, said the figures vary from urban to rural, and between different groups, but that ultimately it means “the vast majority of the world remains at risk.” He said the pandemic would continue to evolve, but that tools exist to suppress transmission and save lives.“Many deaths have been averted and many more lives can be protected,” Ryan said. He was flanked by his boss, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who minutes earlier led a moment of silence to honor victims as well as round of applause for the health workers who have strived to save them.Ryan said southeast Asia faced a surge in cases, Europe and the eastern Mediterranean were seeing an increase in deaths, while the situations in Africa and the Western Pacific were “rather more positive.”“Our current best estimates tell us that about 10 percent of the global population may have been infected by this virus,” Ryan told attendees from member governments who make up the executive board and provide much of its funding.The estimate — which would amount to more than 760 million people based on a current world population of about 7.6 billion — far outstrips the number of confirmed cases as tallied by both WHO and Johns Hopkins University, now more than 35 million worldwide.Experts have long said that the number of confirmed cases greatly underestimates the true figure.The comments came during a special session of the executive board to consider the follow-up to its previous meeting, in May, that passed a resolution to look into the world’s — and WHO’s — response to the pandemic. Ryan warned that the world was “now heading into a difficult period. The disease continues to spread. It is on the rise in many parts of the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-10-per-cent-of-world-s-people-may-have-been-infected-with-virus/story-6JUEpZaWTnJI4NpIBxKCzN.html

Separately, a court in Islamabad charged former president Asif Ali Zardari in two corruption cases.The Lahore police filed a first information report (FIR) against Sharif, Maryam and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi for conspiring against the state and its institutions a day after Sharif’s son-in-law Capt (retd) Muhammad Safdar was booked under sedition charges for “provoking the people against the state and its institutions.” The FIR also named three retired generals of the Pakistan Army. Journalist Hamid Mir tweeted on Monday that Prime Minister Imran Khan “always claimed to be an ambassador of Kashmiris but look at this FIR registered by Punjab police, they booked elected PM of AJK @farooq_pm under treason charges along with @NawazSharifMNS and three retired Lt Generals of Pak Army Face.”The FIR alleged that Sharif had conspired against Pakistan’s prestigious institutions by making provocative speeches from London, on a complaint registered by a citizen, Badar Rasheed.It alleged that in the speeches made on September 20 and October 1, the former premier supported the policies of India so that Pakistan would continue to remain on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) ‘grey list’ over lack of compliance on money laundering and terror financing.The complainant said that the main purpose of Sharif’s speeches was to isolate Pakistan in front of the international community and to declare it a rogue state. He added that Sharif is trying to turn the people against the democratically elected government of Imran Khan.The aim of the speeches was also to divert attention from “human rights violations” in Kashmir to benefit Sharif’s “friend” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the complainant alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-crackdown-on-oppn-continues-conspiracy-case-against-nawaz-sharif-graft-charges-on-zardari/story-IXsrvtvREs6OBZg2XsmYHM.html

05-10-2020||World||Ola to appeal after London refuses licence over public safety risk||Indian ride-hailing service Ola said on Monday that it would appeal the decision by London’s transport officials to refuse it another licence over a “number of failures that could have risked public safety”.Ola, which has been operating in London since February 2020, was granted a 15-month licence by Transport for London (TfL) on July 4, 2019, which expired on Saturday. After it lodged the appeal, officials said the company can continue to operate pending the outcome of any appeals process.Marc Rozendal, Ola’s UK managing director, said: “At Ola, our core principle is to work closely, collaboratively and transparently with regulators such as TfL. We have been working with TfL during the review period and have sought to provide assurances and address the issues raised in an open and transparent manner”. “Ola will take the opportunity to appeal this decision and in doing so, our riders and drivers can rest assured that we will continue to operate as normal, providing safe and reliable mobility for London.”TfL, the public body responsible for the capital’s network, said that before granting a licence, it must be satisfied that the operator is ‘fit and proper’ to hold a private operator’s licence. Ola also operates in south-west England.TfL added that the number of failures with potential public safety consequences includes historic breaches of the licensing regime that led to unlicensed drivers and vehicles undertaking more than 1,000 passenger trips on behalf of Ola.Besides, it said there has been a failure to draw these breaches to TfL’s attention immediately when they were first identified.Helen Chapman of TfL said: “Our duty as a regulator is to ensure passenger safety. Through our investigations, we discovered that flaws in Ola’s operating model have led to the use of unlicensed drivers and vehicles in more than 1,000 passenger trips, which may have put passenger safety at risk.”“If they do appeal, Ola can continue to operate and drivers can continue to undertake bookings on behalf of Ola. We will closely scrutinise the company to ensure passengers safety is not compromised.”TfL had raised similar issues with Ola’s rival, Uber. On September 28, the Westminster Magistrates Court ruled that Uber, whose licence was revoked last November, is now ‘fit and proper’ to run private car services after the issues were addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ola-to-appeal-after-london-refuses-licence-over-public-safety-risk/story-CBMDzgSZauMIZN0rvHCdwO.html
05-10-2020||World||FIR registered against Nawaz Sharif for ‘criminal conspiracy’||A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered against Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the case of criminal conspiracy for the “provocative speeches” he made in London to “defame Pakistan’s institutions”, Geo News reported on Monday.The FIR was lodged against Sharif on October 1 by a local in the Shahdra Police Station’s jurisdiction.According to Geo News report, the case was filed under the provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code for criminal conspiracy against the Pakistan Muslim League (N) chief and other leaders.Earlier this month, Pakistan failed to execute a non-bailable arrest warrant against Sharif, who was granted permission to fly abroad to get medical treatment in November last year.For nearly one month, the Pakistan government made several attempts to get Sharif’s arrest warrant signed.Last week, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had slammed Sharif over his failure to appear before the court after he was granted permission to fly abroad for medical treatment.“Accused [Sharif] knows that he went abroad after defeating the system. He must be laughing at the system while sitting abroad. It’s shameful conduct by the accused,” Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan had tasked relevant authorities to bring back Sharif at the earliest. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister also issued the directive to pursue the matter vigorously.A cabinet member had told Dawn the government had already sent a request to the British government for the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) leader’s repatriation but it would now send a fresh application.Last month, the IHC came down heavily on the Imran Khan-led government for allowing Sharif to go abroad without informing the court and it was up to the dispensation to take steps for ensuring the latter’s return to the country.Additional Attorney General Tariq Mehmood Khokhar had told a bench comprising Justices Aamer Farooq and Mohsin Akhtar Kayani that Pakistan’s Foreign Office implemented the court-issued non-bailable arrest warrants without delay through the Pakistan High Commission in the UK on September 17, Geo News reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fir-registered-against-nawaz-sharif-for-criminal-conspiracy/story-4qdKA8URMnFptniiCrDbOL.html
05-10-2020||World||Covid-19 disrupting mental health services in most countries: WHO survey||The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted critical mental health services in 93% of countries globally while the demand for these services is increasing, according to a World Health Organisation (WHO) survey released on Monday. The survey was conducted in 130 countries from June to August. Nearly a third (35%) reported disruptions to emergency interventions, including those for people experiencing prolonged seizures, severe substance use withdrawal syndromes, and delirium, often a sign of a serious underlying medical condition. And 30% reported disruptions to access to medications for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders.Also read: Europe tightens curbs as leaders gird for long Covid-19 fightApart from emergency treatment, countries also reported widespread disruption of many kinds of critical mental health services.At least 60% reported disruptions to mental health services for vulnerable people, including children and adolescents (72%), older adults (70%), and women requiring antenatal or postnatal services (61%).Counselling and psychotherapy services have also affected in about 67% cases. As many as 65% reported critical harm to reduction services and 45% to opioid agonist maintenance treatment for opioid dependence.Even school and workplace mental health services have been adversely affected, and according to the WHO survey about three-quarters reported at least partial disruptions of services at these places during the pandemic.“Initial few weeks of the pandemic were worse when regular Out Patient Departments (OPDs) had to be shut, and people were finding it difficult to gain access to doctors, and even not able to procure medicines as freely as earlier. The problem was worse for people not living in the metros as transportation was also restricted. The elderly and children were much more affected. Gradually we opened online consultation services but not many were aware of it. So, yes, this pandemic has been tough on patients, including those suffering from mental illnesses. But things are now getting back to normalcy,” said Rajesh Sagar, a professor of psychiatry at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The survey provides the first global data showing the devastating impact of the pandemic on access to mental health services and underscores the urgent need for increased funding in this area.Prior to the pandemic, the surveyed countries were spending less than 2% of their national health budgets on mental health, and struggling to meet their populations’ needs, highlighting the issue of chronic underfunding of mental health. And the pandemic has only increased the demand for mental health services.Bereavement, isolation, loss of income, and fear have triggered mental health conditions or exacerbated the existing ones. Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.The survey also found that Covid-19 can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke.“People with pre-existing mental, neurological, or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 [that causes Covid-19] infection - they may stand a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death,” it says.The survey evaluated how the provision of mental, neurological and substance use services has changed due to Covid-19, and the types of services that have been disrupted, and how countries are adapting to overcome these challenges.While many countries (70%) have adopted telemedicine or teletherapy to overcome disruptions to in-person services, there are significant disparities in the uptake of these interventions, shows the survey. At least 80% of high-income countries reported deploying telemedicine and teletherapy to bridge gaps in mental health, compared with less than 50% of low-income countries.WHO has issued guidelines to countries on how to maintain essential services, including mental health services, during this pandemic. It has asked countries to allocate resources for mental health as an integral component of their response and recovery plans. The Organization has also urged countries to monitor changes and disruptions in services so that they can address them as required.Although 89% of countries reported that mental health and psychosocial support is part of their national Covid-19 response plans, only 17% of these countries have full additional funding for covering these activities.This highlights the need for more money for mental health as pre-pandemic estimates suggest nearly US$1 trillion in economic productivity is lost annually from depression and anxiety alone. However, studies show that every US$1 spent on evidence-based care for depression and anxiety returns US$5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-disrupting-mental-health-services-in-most-countries-who-survey/story-1Z0GOtb2zXqg86FOZj8DtI.html

05-10-2020||World||Europe tightens curbs as leaders gird for Long Covid-19 fight||Europe is tightening restrictions to regain control of resurgent coronavirus infections, with Paris closing bars and new curbs likely on the way in Italy and Ireland.The continent is struggling to control the latest outbreak as opposition to limits on movement mounts and leaders resist the stringent lockdowns that hammered economies in the second quarter. Instead, the approach is on a shifting array of measures, which risks being similarly disruptive.“Authorities have an extremely difficult job at the moment,” Martin Hirsch, head of Paris hospitals, said on France Info. “If we go too far we are accused of killing freedom or the economy, and if we don’t go far enough, it’s homicide.”Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Monday will announce new restrictions to contain the spread after a surge in cases in the capital and its suburbs.Authorities are planning to entirely shut down bars and impose tighter distancing rules on restaurants as the region is declared on maximum alert, according to Agence France Presse. In Marseille, however, restaurants will be permitted to reopen after a week of closure.France’s virus cases increased the most in Europe over the past two months and monthly virus-related deaths tripled in September. The country reported a record number of laboratory-confirmed new cases on Saturday.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel will chair a special cabinet meeting on the pandemic response in Berlin. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said “it will take time” to return to pre-coronavirus levels of activity, even if more effective therapies and a vaccine are made available.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We will be dealing with this ‘new normality’ and with the virus into next year,” Scholz said in an interview with ARD public television late Sunday. “It’s not gone, and it’s a great danger for everyone around the world.”In Hungary, the government over the weekend announced what it called an unprecedented increase in doctors’ wages. Prime Minister Viktor Orban predicted that the “seven-eight months ahead will require extraordinary efforts” from medical professionals, according to a Facebook video.Amid a surge in cases in recent weeks, Ireland’s national health authorities recommended the country move to a level 5 lockdown. That’s the highest level of shutdown, with most stores closed, household visits banned and limits placed on how far people can leave their homes. Most of the country is currently at level 2, with Dublin at Level 3.While the government is set to consider the recommendation in coming days, the surprise proposal is already running into resistance, amid concern that such a drastic step would devastate the nascent economic recovery.“It is intolerable that after six months we are still receiving both vague and changing criteria to advance such serious restrictions,” said Danny McCoy, head of the nation’s biggest employers’ group, IBEC.In a sign of the economic risks, Cineworld Group Plc lost more than half its value after the companyu said it will temporarily suspend operations at all its American and British movie theaters now that crucial income from winter blockbusters has been pushed into 2021.Operations will resume when “key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,” the world’s second-biggest cinema chain said.Italian LibertiesItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that people may have to give up some liberties to combat the renewed spread of the coronavirus, as his government prepares to require masks in all outdoor areas and impose limits on gatherings, Corriere della Sera reported.Italy reported 2,578 new cases on Sunday, as figures continue to be higher than any time since late spring, though the flare-up has been more contained than in most neighboring countries.In a reminder of the risks, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is self-isolating after being exposed to someone who tested positive.

05-10-2020||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan heads into his biggest challenge. Military is also target||Prime Minister Imran Khan is facing the biggest challenge to his leadership from opposition parties that united over the weekend to appoint firebrand cleric Maulana Fazalur Rehman to lead the freshly-minted 11 party anti-government alliance trying to unseat him.Rehman had last year the first round of his campaign against Imran Khan when he launched the ‘Azadi March’ from Karachi to the capital city of Islamabad against the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, or PTI government. That effort had fizzled out. This time, Khan’s orange-turbaned rival has support from other parties to keep the street protests going.A 26-point resolution adopted by the coalition - they call it Pakistan Democratic Movement - a fortnight earlier seeks to force “the selected prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the establishment in politics.” It also wants to ensure the “end of establishment’s interference in politics”, a reference to the army.The opposition’s combined attack on the powerful military is unusual in Pakistan; the army has ruled Pakistan for roughly half of its 73-year history and often had the last word in the country’s governance for the other half. Like Imran Khan’s critics say, it does now.That it was Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa who summoned political parties to a secret meeting last month to build consensus on turning the Gilgit Baltistan in the occupied northern areas into Pakistan’s fifth province at China’s behest underlined the role that the military was playing in the country’s politics.“It is saddening that the situation has escalated to the level where we now have a state above the state,” Nawaz Sharif said at the first opposition conference late last month, echoing their sentiment that Imran Khan was their proxy.His daughter and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz - who has been fronting the party’s battles with the government in the absence of Pakistan’s three-time prime minister - has been among the loudest to demand action against retired Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor chairman and PM Khan’s aide on corruption charges.Also Read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his handsImran Khan, who came to power on the back of populist assurances to root out corruption, faces allegations that his anti-corruption drive only aims at opposition leaders. In July this year, Pakistan’s top court also remarked in one case that the anti-corruption watchdog appeared “reluctant in proceeding against people on one side of the political divide”.A Pakistan watcher in New Delhi said it is not a surprise that the National Accountability Bureau arrested Pakistan’s Leader of the Opposition and PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif soon after the first opposition conference.“Nawaz Sharif is no hero but he represents the very essence of democratic choice,” he said, stressing that investigations directed at Nawaz Sharif and his family were important since he was the only leader to stand up to the army. In the absence of her father who is in exile in London, Maryam Sharif has been taking a blunt aim at the military. She has called Gen Bajwa’s meeting last month on Gilgit-Baltistan as an attempt by the military to tighten its grip over the country’s politics. “These decisions should be made in parliament, not in GHQ (army headquarters),” she said.A second Pakistan watcher in Delhi said there was an assessment that Maryam Sharif’s shrill pitch against the military did appear to expose her to “serious risk of physical harm”. She hasn’t backed down from her sharp criticism of the military and Imran Khan despite her uncle’s arrest.Street protests and mega rallies had been Imran Khan’s favourite tool to build public opinion against the Nawaz Sharif government back. Analysts say that the opposition doesn’t expect to succeed in the short term but is building the momentum to overthrow the Khan regime, quite like the 2014 Azadi march that he had led against Nawaz Sharif.Khan faces other challenges as well, some of them much more immediate. Next month’s meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, is one. The meeting, scheduled for 21-23 October, is to decide on Imran Khan’s request to take Pakistan off the global watchdog’s ‘grey list’.An Indian counter-terror official said Islamabad was likely to be disappointed given its patchy record of implementing anti-terror laws. That would make it hard for Khan’s government to access international markets at a time when the country’s economy has been faltering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-imran-khan-heads-into-his-biggest-challenge-military-is-also-target/story-khmBRSwEci9qDEAJXrecJO.html
05-10-2020||World||FATF all set to decide on Pakistan’s grey list status: Report||The Financial Action Task Force is all set to decide on Pakistan’s grey list status in a virtual meeting scheduled later this month, according to a media report on Monday. The Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic. Seeking to wriggle out of the FATF’s grey list, debt-ridden Pakistan in August imposed financial sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders, including 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. The virtual FATF plenary scheduled for October 21-23 will decide if Pakistan should be excluded from its grey list, based on a review of Islamabad’s performance to meet global commitments and standards on fight against money laundering and terror financing (ML&TF), the Dawn News reported. The meeting was earlier scheduled in June but Islamabad got an unexpected breather after the global watchdog against financial crimes temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines in the wake of grave health risk following COVID-9 pandemic, it said. The agency also put a general pause in the review process, thus giving additional four months to Pakistan to meet the requirements. In February, the FATF gave Pakistan, which missed 13 targets, a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against ML&TF committed with the international community. In its third plenary held virtually in June, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan in the grey list as Islamabad failed to check flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). With Pakistan’s continuation in the ‘grey list’, it is increasingly becoming difficult for the country to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.In July, Pakistan’s Senate unanimously approved two bills related to the tough conditions set by FATF. In August, Parliament’s lower house passed four FATF-related bills as part of the efforts by Pakistan to move from the FATF’s grey list to the white list.In September, the joint session of the Parliament amended about 15 laws to upgrade its legal system matching international standards as required by the FATF. The government has already submitted its report to the FATF and its affiliated review groups and responded to their comments, detailing compliance with the 13 outstanding action points, the Dawn report stated. The FATF meeting this month will review Pakistan’s compliance with the 13 remaining action points. The FATF will examine if the country had demonstrated remedial actions and sanctions applied in cases of violations relating to terrorist financing risk management and terror financing sanctions obligations.The FATF will also judge if competent authorities were cooperating and taking action to identify and taking enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and had proven implementation of cross-border currency and bearer negotiable instruments controls at all ports of entry, including applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.Pakistan has also to determine if law enforcement agencies were identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity and that terrorist financing (TF) probes and prosecution target designated persons and entities, and those acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities besides showing TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, the report said.The country’s outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services, it said. If the FATF in its meeting finds that Pakistan has failed to meet its requirements, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country in the ‘Black List’ along with North Korea and Iran. In August, Prime Minister Imran Khan had warned that if blacklisted at the FATF, Pakistan’s entire economy will be destroyed due to inflation and a massive fall in Pakistani Rupee. The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF currently has 39 members including two regional organisations - the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council.

05-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: Mike Pence’s campaign role grows at key moment||Vice President Mike Pence is in a familiar spot: standing by President Donald Trump.With Trump hospitalized with a virus that he spent months downplaying, his ever-loyal No. 2 will play an increasingly prominent role in the weeks ahead.Pence will take a leading role in campaigning around the country in the final stretch before the Nov. 3 election, aiming to keep the president’s supporters energized and deflecting criticism of his handling of a virus that has killed over 205,000 Americans. The president’s positive diagnosis on Friday has intensified scrutiny of the administration’s cavalier approach to the pandemic.The spotlight on Pence will be especially bright on Wednesday when he will participate in the vice presidential debate with California Sen. Kamala Harris. Pence will almost certainly be pressed to explain shifting accounts of the president’s health over the weekend and justify Trump’s decision to hold large in-person campaign rallies during a pandemic — events that often flouted public health guidelines by congregating thousands of mostly mask-less supporters.“Normally, the vice presidential debate is inconsequential. That is not the case in 2020,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential bid. “The public has so many questions about how we got here and it’s an opportunity for Pence to answer some of those.”Pence has often been called upon to smooth over fallout from Trump’s messy decision making and divisive policies. Since the 2016 campaign, he has served as a bridge of sorts between a brash, thrice-married former reality television star who long bragged about womanizing and the more traditional branch of the Republican Party, particularly conservative evangelicals.The smooth diction and humble demeanor Pence brings to the role was honed in the 1990s when he was a conservative talk-radio host in Indiana, when he referred to himself as “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.”His approach hasn’t always been successful. As Indiana’s governor from 2013 to 2017, he was so relentlessly on-message that he sometimes struggled to contain fallout from fast-moving crises.That includes his handling of backlash over a 2015 law he signed that allowed business owners to deny service to gay people for religious reasons, which was later amended as a result of the uproar. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC when he was governor, Pence grew flustered after failing to answer direct questions about whether discrimination against gay people should be legal.“George!” Pence protested before letting out an audible sigh. “C’mon.”The debate with Harris will be a major test. The former California prosecutor’s political rise was fueled by searing exchanges with political rivals during major congressional hearings. And she is certain to press the issue of the virus and Trump’s diagnoses when the two meet in Salt Lake City.“That will be his challenge. But it is one he is well-suited for,” said Cam Savage, a veteran Republican strategist from Indiana who has closely observed Pence’s political career. “With Pence you get a very disciplined leader who is not likely to make mistakes.”One major uncertainty is what sort of condition Trump will be in during the weeks ahead.His administration has offered rosy assessments of his health and said he could be released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as early as Monday. But Trump’s blood oxygen level abruptly dropped twice in recent days and he was given supplemental oxygen before his hospitalization. His doctors continued to evade basic questions about his health on Sunday.There are also concerns that Pence could himself could catch the virus while campaigning, a troubling scenario that raises serious questions about national security and the transfer of power if either he or Trump took a turn for the worse.After the debate, Pence says, it’s back to “business as usual” and the campaign has appearances planned for him, as well as Trump’s children and other top surrogates in an effort billed as “Operation MAGA.” Pence is slated to visit Arizona and Florida and will return to Indiana on Friday to vote early.“We’ve got a campaign to run,” Pence said Saturday on a call with staff. “I promise you, this president, as soon as his doctors say so, he’s going to be back out there.”Pence often evokes faith when describing his approach to public office, citing the biblical concept of “servant leadership.”He has been a faithful servant to Trump since he was plucked from a difficult bid for reelection as governor to join the presidential ticket in 2016.Though Pence has long-held presidential ambitions, his own political career was on the ropes.The former congressman turned governor had a dismal approval rating. His enthusiastic support for religious conservative cultural issues alienated moderate Republicans and drew threats of boycott of the state. And he faced a difficult reelection battle against the same Democrat that he narrowly beat in 2012.His selection for the Trump ticket removed him from a lackluster campaign that leaned heavily on car racing metaphors that often fell flat even though the state has a deep affinity for the sport and is home to the Indianapolis 500.As Trump’s envoy to religious conservatives, Pence quickly revitalized his political prospects. Often referencing the Supreme Court, Pence reminded fellow religious conservatives that the future makeup of the judiciary would be determined by the 2016 winner — a prediction poised to become reality with Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg.At times, Pence’s defense of Trump involved few words.After the “Access Hollywood” video emerged in 2016 of Trump talking in lewd terms about grabbing women by their genitals without consent came to light just days before a debate, Pence’s mere return to the campaign trail was a signal of support.Whether Trump secures another term or not, Pence is a likely Republican presidential contender in 2024. His handling of the challenges before him could be a determining factor in what his future will bring.“We will find out in the next few days whether Pence will be a leading candidate in 2024,” said Conant, the Republican strategist.___Associate Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-mike-pence-s-campaign-role-grows-at-key-moment/story-oOdBFWaxZiKhdIYGYH7j6O.html

05-10-2020||World||Donald Trump criticized for leaving hospital to greet supporters||US President Donald Trump sparked an angry backlash from the medical community Sunday with a protocol-breaking visit to his supporters outside the hospital where he is being treated for the highly-infectious, potentially deadly new coronavirus.He was masked as he waved from inside his bulletproof vehicle during the short trip outside Walter Reed military medical center near Washington, which appeared designed to take back the narrative on his improving health after a weekend of muddled messaging from his doctors.The last-minute limousine outing came with Trump’s doctors satisfied enough about his progress to suggest the possibility of his being discharged on Monday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here But experts complained that the outing broke his own government’s public health guidelines requiring patients to isolate while they are in treatment and still shedding virus -- and endangered his Secret Service protection. Trump, who has been repeatedly rebuked for flouting public health guidelines and spreading misinformation on the pandemic, said in a video that dropped on Twitter just before the appearance that he had “learned a lot about Covid” by “really going to school” as he has battled the virus.But health experts took to the airwaves and social media to criticize the “stunt,” which they said demonstrated that he had learned nothing at all. “Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quarantined for 14 days,” said James Phillips, chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University.“They might get sick. They may die. For political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage White House spokesman Judd Deere said “appropriate” precautions had been taken to protect Trump and his support staff, including protective gear. “The movement was cleared by the medical team as safe to do,” he added.But Zeke Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania and regular TV pundit, described the appearance as “shameful.”“Making his Secret Service agents drive with a COVID-19 patient, with windows up no less, put them needlessly at risk for infection. And for what? A PR stunt,” he tweeted.Confused messaging The episode came hours after a briefing by Trump’s medical team, who said he had “continued to improve” and could be returned to the White House, which has the facilities to treat and isolate the president, as early as Monday.The president was flown to Walter Reed with a high fever on Friday after a “rapid progression” of his illness, with his oxygen levels dropping worryingly low, Trump’s physician Sean Conley said in a Sunday briefing.Health experts have complained that the messaging from the administration -- and particularly Trump’s medical team -- has caused widespread confusion.Conley admitted Sunday that he had kept from the public the fact that the president had been given extra oxygen, in a bid to reflect an “upbeat attitude.”And he gave a rosy account of Trump’s progress Saturday, only for White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to tell reporters immediately after that Trump’s condition had been “very concerning” and that he was “still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”‘White House Cluster’With his tough reelection campaign in its final month against Democratic rival Joe Biden, Trump’s diagnosis and hospitalization have left him sidelined from what he does best -- campaigning.Meanwhile, Biden -- who announced Sunday his latest negative test for the virus -- will start the week with a trip Monday to key swing state Florida.But Trump and his advisors have done their best to project a sense of continuity.His deputy campaign manager Jason Miller told ABC Sunday he had spoken to Trump for a half-hour Saturday and that the president was “cracking jokes.” But controversy has been mounting over the possibility that Trump might have exposed numerous others to Covid-19 even after a close aide tested positive. A timeline provided by his advisors and doctors suggested he met more than 30 donors on Thursday in Bedminster, New Jersey, even after learning that Hope Hicks had the virus -- and just hours before he announced his own positive test.There were more than 200 people at the fundraiser, and a contact-tracing operation underway in New Jersey was looking at potentially thousands of people who may have been exposed.All this came in a week when a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll -- taken in the two days after a bruising presidential debate with Biden but before news emerged of Trump’s illness -- gave Biden a significant 53-39 percent lead among registered voters.As well as Trump and Hicks, numerous White House insiders and at least three Republican senators have contracted Covid-19, along with First Lady Melania Trump, who has not experienced severe symptoms.Public health experts have expressed alarm at the “White House cluster” that has been linked to the September 26 Rose Garden celebration of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-criticized-for-leaving-hospital-to-greet-supporters/story-HkhwCoen74RxqkwIa3v3HI.html
05-10-2020||World||Covid: Australia’s Victoria state to boost testing on path to easing restrictions||Australia’s coronavirus hotspot of Victoria will look into ways to increase testing for the disease to control its spread in anticipation of easing of the state’s stringent lockdown restrictions, officials said on Monday.New daily coronavirus infections in Victoria, Australia’s second most-populous state, fell to nine cases on Monday, down from 12 in the previous days. No deaths were reported. Melbourne, which has remained in a strict lockdown for nearly three months, is expected to see the bulk of its restrictions eased when the average for new daily cases over two weeks falls below five. According to the state’s modelling, that could occur in late October. On Monday, the 14-day day rolling case average was 11.6, down from 11.9 the previous day. Also Read: New York City seeks to reinstate Covid-19 restrictions in some spots“We want everybody who has symptoms, regardless of their circumstances, to be able to get tested, we get their results and that’s how we can protect them and indeed, the entire community,” Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said in a televised briefing. “There is some work going on in the next few days to see if we can increase the number of people who are eligible and increase the number of people who can get those tests.”Victoria accounts for 90% of the country’s 894 Covid-19 deaths. Since the start of the year, the state has conducted some 2.7 million tests. It had a population of about 6 million at the last census, according to government data.Australia has one of the world’s highest ratios of tests per capita and, despite the outbreak in Victoria, one of the lowest numbers of coronavirus cases.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe country has had just over 27,000 infections, according to health ministry data - less than the average daily number of cases for the United States in the past several months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-australia-s-victoria-state-to-boost-testing-on-path-to-easing-restrictions/story-qKNPxnoKN6ghzUV97nJm5H.html
05-10-2020||World||New York City seeks to reinstate Covid-19 restrictions in some spots||New York City’s mayor said Sunday that he has asked the state for permission to close schools and reinstate restrictions on non-essential businesses in several neighbourhoods because of a resurgence of the coronavirus.The action, if approved, would mark a disheartening retreat for a city that enjoyed a summer with less spread of the virus than most other parts of the country, and had only recently celebrated the return of students citywide to in-person learning in classrooms.Shutdowns would happen starting Wednesday in nine ZIP codes in the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.About 100 public schools and 200 private schools would have to close. Indoor dining, which just resumed a few days ago, would be suspended. Outdoor restaurant dining would shut down in the affected neighbourhoods as well, and gyms would close.Houses of worship would be allowed to remain open with existing restrictions in place, de Blasio said.The mayor, a Democrat, said he was taking the action in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading deeper into the city and becoming a “second wave,” like the one that killed more than 24,000 New Yorkers in the spring.“We’ve learned over and over from this disease that it is important to act aggressively, and when the data tells us it’s time for even the toughest and most rigorous actions we follow the data, we follow the science,” de Blasio said.Over the past two weeks, the number of new cases of the virus has been rising in pockets of the city, predominantly in neighbourhoods in Brooklyn and Queens that are home to the city’s large Orthodox Jewish population.Nearly 1,100 people have tested positive in Brooklyn in just the last four days, according to state figures.De Blasio made the announcement shortly after Gov. Andrew Cuomo complained that local governments with coronavirus hot spots had “not done an effective job” of enforcing social distancing rules.“If a local jurisdiction cannot or will not perform effective enforcement of violating entities, notify the state and we will close all business activity in the hot spots where the local governments cannot do compliance,” Cuomo said.Cuomo did not immediately comment on de Blasio’s proposed shutdown in the areas where the virus is spiking.As many as 500,000 people live in the neighbourhoods affected by the proposed shutdown, de Blasio said. He said the lockdown could be lifted in 14 days or 28 days if the percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 declines.The coronavirus was estimated to have hit between 1 and 2 million people in New York City, mostly in the spring before testing was widely available. Thousands of people fell ill each day. By the summer’s end, the city appeared to have the virus partly in check, averaging fewer than 240 new cases per day citywide as recently as Sept. 7.Overall, the city’s infection rate remains relatively low, with around 420 new cases a day over the past few days, but those have been concentrated in a handful of neighbourhoods. The nine ZIP codes singled out by the mayor have been responsible for more than 20% of all new infections in the city over the past four weeks, though they represent only 7% of the population.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDe Blasio had said in the past that public schools were largely unaffected by the rise in virus infections in Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods, but he said Sunday that public schools in the hot spot neighbourhoods would be closed “out of an abundance of caution.”United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew praised the decision. “This is the right decision, one that helps protect our schools, our neighbourhoods, and ultimately our city,” Mulgrew said Sunday.The staff at Public School 164 in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, one of the affected neighbourhoods, sent a letter to de Blasio on Thursday demanding that the school be closed.Teacher Frances Hidalgo said it was unrealistic to think the school would be immune from infection when students and staff interact with people in the neighbourhood daily.Hidalgo, a fourth grade teacher, pointed to the high positivity rate in Borough Park. “We don’t live in a bubble. We’re part of the neighbourhood,” she said in a phone interview Saturday.Cuomo allowed New York City restaurants to resume indoor dining starting on Sept. 30, but at only 25% of their seating capacity. Several friends in the restaurant business said Sunday that shutting down for a while might be better.“It’s going to be a hard winter,” said Alejandra Benitez, who owns Beco Bar in a Brooklyn ZIP code affected by de Blasio’s shutdown proposal. “But it’s almost cheaper to close. It’s just that people don’t want to risk it.”Mike Sternfield, who was dining with Benitez and other friends outside L&B Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn, agreed with her. “As a bartender, I don’t think we should be going inside to eat and drink at all,” Sternfield said. “But operating at 25% capacity isn’t going to help anyone anyway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-seeks-to-reinstate-covid-19-restrictions-in-some-spots/story-GAba07cKsz4jv0VISCrNqK.html
05-10-2020||World||2020 Nobel season opens with medicine prize||Breakthroughs in the field of health will be honoured Monday when the 2020 Nobel season kicks off with the medicine prize, as the world battles the worst pandemic in a century.The medicine prize announcement, due at 11:30 am (0930 GMT), will be followed by the physics prize on Tuesday and chemistry on Wednesday.The most closely-watched awards -- for literature and peace -- will follow on Thursday and Friday, while the economics prize wraps things up on Monday, October 12.This year, the coronavirus pandemic has put the global spotlight on research.“The pandemic is a big crisis for mankind, but it illustrates how important science is,” Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten said.No prizes are expected to be awarded this year for work directly linked to the new coronavirus, as Nobel prizewinning research usually takes many years to be verified.The prize-awarding committees are “not in any way influenced by what is happening in the world at the time,” Erling Norrby, the former permanent secretary of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences which awards the science prizes, told AFP.“It takes time before a prize can mature, I would say at least 10 years before you can fully understand the impact” of a discovery, Norrby, himself a virologist, said.The work of the various prize committees is shrouded in secrecy and the names of the nominees are not disclosed for 50 years, leading to rampant speculation.- T-cells, breast cancer, scissors? -Swedish public radio SR and the country’s biggest daily Dagens Nyheter both suggested Monday’s medicine prize could go to French-born Australian Jacques Miller and Max Cooper of the US for their discoveries of T-cells and B-cells in the 1960s, which led to breakthroughs in cancer and virus research.The pair won the prestigious Lasker Prize in the US last year.Or the nod could go to Lebanese-born American geneticist Huda Zoghbi for her discovery of a genetic mutation that leads to the brain disorder Rett Syndrome, both SR and Dagens Nyheter said.Dagens Nyheter also tipped American Mary-Claire King, who discovered the BRCA1 gene responsible for a hereditary form of breast cancer, and researchers who worked on a cure for Hepatitis C, Ralf Bartenschlager of Germany and Americans Charles Rice and Michael Sofia -- a trio also awarded the Lasker Prize in 2016.Two names mentioned frequently are Emmanuelle Charpentier of France and Jennifer Doudna of the US, for their gene-editing technique known as the CRISPR-Cas9 DNA snipping tool, a type of genetic “scissors” used to cut out a mutated gene in a human embryo and replace it with a corrected version.Chinese-born American Feng Zhang also claims to have discovered the technique, which could be eligible for both the medicine and chemistry prize.Others also mentioned include immunologists Marc Feldmann of Australia and Indian-born British researcher Ravinder Maini, for work on rheumatoid arthritis, and American oncologist Dennis Slamon for research on breast cancer and the drug treatment Herceptin.For Tuesday’s physics prize, astrophysicists Shep Doeleman of the US and Germany’s Heino Falcke could win for work that led to the first directly observed image of a black hole in April 2019, according to Dagens Nyheter.SR meanwhile saw it going to American mathematician Peter Shor who paved the way for today’s research on quantum computers, or France’s Alain Aspect for his work on quantum entanglement.For chemistry, SR predicted the honour could go to Christopher Murray for his work on semiconductor nanocrystals or to US gene sequencing pioneer Leroy Hood, while Dagens Nyheter tipped Americans Harry Gray, Richard Holm and Stephen Lippard for work in the field of bioinorganic chemistry.- Greta for peace prize? -Nobel watchers say the peace prize could go to press freedom champions such as Reporters Without Borders or the Committee to Protect Journalists, climate activists such as Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement, or an organisation like the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization or Transparency International.Stockholm’s literary circles saw Canadian poet Anne Carson and American-Caribbean writer Jamaica Kincaid as strong candidates for the literature prize, while Canada’s Margaret Atwood and US authors Marilynn Robinson and Joyce Carol Oates have made Nobel buzz for years.Kenya’s Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Hungary’s Peter Nadas, Albania’s Ismael Kadare, Korea’s Ko Un and France’s Michel Houellebecq are also frequently mentioned, while British novelist Hilary Mantel is a recent addition.map-po/cdw/gle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-nobel-season-opens-with-medicine-prize/story-ttcOxchStIm1aIUpAZwNCL.html

Mexico’s civil defense agency said in a statement that four of the deaths, including two children, were in Chiapas, where a landslide on a mountainous slope buried their home. The other death was in Tabasco state, where a person was dragged away by the water. Gamma, along with cold fronts, combined over the weekend to cause extreme rains in parts of the Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas, affecting more than half a million people. The hardest-hit state was Tabasco, where more than 3,400 were evacuated to shelters. The storm came ashore Saturday near Tulum with maximum sustained winds of nearly 70 mph (110 kph) — 4 mph (9 kph short of hurricane force), according to the US National Hurricane Center in Miami. Mexican authorities continued to warn people in the Yucatan on Sunday afternoon as Gamma remained stalled offshore. The hurricane center said Gamma was about 130 miles (205 kms) northeast of Progreso, Mexico, and had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). The state’s tourism department reported Friday on Twitter that more than 41,000 tourists were present in Quintana Roo, with hotels in Cancun and Cozumel already at more than 30% occupancy. The area only recently reopened to tourism after a pandemic shutdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-gamma-leaves-5-dead-in-southern-mexico/story-iO3QUHtan2U7qDEKCW8yWK.html

If it had been anther 15-20 minutes it would have been a very different story.”Kircher described how residents awoke to find an inferno bearing down on them.“I talked to a gentleman who got up to his dog (barking) in the early hours, opened his door and there was this wall of orange,” he said.“He was the one that set off the town fire alarm and helped to wake people... there’s certainly some scary tales about how close it came to being an absolute disaster with fatalities.”Wildfires are relatively common on the South Island at this time of the year but the scale and intensity of the Ohau fire have been unusual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfires-raze-dozens-of-homes-in-new-zealand/story-I5bIsCOhSypkYiUMaKadcO.html

The economic impact of the pandemic on the impoverished continent has remains a cause for concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-1-5-million-says-who/story-q6RRVoz5ANmb5RHMSJl6UJ.html

Trump’s motorcade drove past his supporters who were seen waving at him.Shortly before he left the hospital, Trump posted a video on Twitter, saying “I also think we will pay a little surprise to the patriots that are waiting outside in the streets.”In the video, Trump said that he had “a very interesting journey” where he learned a lot about Covid-19 by going to the “real school” and not the “read the book school”.“It has been a very interesting journey.

How the world’s ‘most powerful man’ got Covid-19||After US President Donald Trump officially announced on Twitter that he and First Lady Melania Trump have been tested positive, the question that has intrigued the world is how Covid-19 could enter the White House and incapacitate the world’s ‘most powerful man’. The questions have inevitable led the focus to the crowded Rose Garden event held on September 26, and something more.Donald Trump has been on the campaign trail for quite some time now. Going over his precaution pattern, the nature of meetings that he had, the Rose Garden event has been zeroed in on as a possible ‘superspreader’, but might not be the origin of the Trumps’ infections. Here are the points highlighted by several experts who traced back the journey of Covid-19 in the White House1. It was a crowded event. Social distancing was not maintained. Even not everybody had a mask on, going by the photographs.Also Read: Donald Trump ‘learned a lot’ about Covid-19 by going to ‘real school’2.
