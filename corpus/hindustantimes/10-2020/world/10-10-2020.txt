Born two weeks ago, Azalea Belle Gray is the sixth child for Aaron Gray and Erin Fernald Gray on Islesford, which is also known as Little Cranberry Island. The Grays had contingency plans to go to Mount Desert Island — the largest island off the coast of Maine — for the birth if they needed to. But everything went smoothly September 26, the Bangor Daily News reported. Ellen Fernald Gray said she didn’t set out to be the first woman to have a home birth in Islesford since Calvin Coolidge was president. She said she didn’t realise how long it’d been since the last island birth: her own grandfather, Warren Fernald, in 1927. It was only after Azalea’s birth that she learned that the lifelong lobsterman who died in 2005 had previously been the most recent birth on Islesford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-born-on-maine-island-for-1st-time-in-more-than-90-years/story-yasShinYxHWn77M3DNDYcO.html
10-10-2020||World||Man in prison for murder admits to killing Minnesota guard||A man already imprisoned in Minnesota for murder has been sentenced to life behind bars after admitting to killing a guard in 2018.Edward Muhammad Johnson, 44, pleaded guilty Friday to first-degree murder for killing Joseph Gomm. A judge immediately sentenced him under a state law that makes a life sentence mandatory for first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer.Johnson entered his plea via video conference from the maximum-security prison at Oak Park Heights. He said he had checked out a hammer on July 18, 2018, from the metal shop at the Stillwater prison, where he was incarcerated, and hit Gomm in the head, “twice, I believe.”Johnson said he meant to kill Gomm, who was supervising inmates in the metal shop. Gomm, 45, had been a corrections officer for 16 years.Gomm’s death led to a monthlong lockdown of the Stillwater prison and the resignation of three officers. At least 10 others took leaves. His death also prompted guards to demand more security cameras and staffing in vocational workshops.Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell called the plea and sentencing “bittersweet.”“Though it brings a fitting end to the judicial process, it does not relieve the very real pain and loss experienced by Joe’s immediate family, friends, and co-workers,” Schnell said in a statement. “Officer Gomm was an honorable public servant not because of how he died, but because of the way he lived – his memory and sacrifice should be forever honored.”Johnson was serving a 29-year sentence for the 2002 stabbing of his then-roommate, and his life sentence will run consecutive to that, Washington County District Judge Ellen Maas said.Gomm’s sister, Audrey Cone, and her husband, Chris Cone, told the Star Tribune they were relieved that Johnson decided to plead guilty.“At least we can close this part of the book and try to move forward,” Audrey Cone said. “We’re never going to get Joe back. That’s really the only thing that would ever fix this.”The Cones said they plan to sue the Department of Corrections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-in-prison-for-murder-admits-to-killing-minnesota-guard/story-Y9WZAWcZWj5BcLBZ8AIaeI.html
10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, still facing health questions, holds first public event since Covid-19 diagnosis||U.S. President Donald Trump will on Saturday hold his first public event since being diagnosed with Covid-19 more than a week ago, aiming to show he has beaten the virus and is ready to resume campaigning, although questions remain about his health.Trump is expected to make remarks from a White House balcony to a crowd of hundreds on the lawn below. The White House called the event “a peaceful protest for law & order.”The president revealed his positive coronavirus test on Oct. 2 and spent three nights in hospital before returning to the White House on Monday. He has not said whether he is still contagious, only that he is no longer showing symptoms of the virus that has killed more than 210,000 Americans.A White House spokeswoman said on Friday that Trump will be tested for COVID-19 and will not go out in public if it is determined he can still spread the virus.The White House did not preview the remarks that Trump will deliver on Saturday, but he campaigned on a law-and-order theme throughout a summer of protests for racial justice.Trump’s efforts to portray himself as tough on crime have had little impact on his standing in national opinion polls, which show him trailing his Democratic challenger Joe Biden by double digits. But the gap between the two candidates is narrower in the battleground states that may determine who wins the White House.Trump has said a Biden presidency would lead to lawlessness, while seeking to tie the former vice president to unrest sparked by the deaths of Black Americans while in police custody.Biden has accused Trump of stoking violence with his rhetoric. The Democratic candidate has embraced calls from protesters for policing reforms but has denounced the rioting and looting that have disturbed some of the mostly peaceful protests across the country in recent months.On Monday, Trump plans a campaign rally in central Florida, a must-win state for his hopes of a second term. His campaign also announced events in Pennsylvania and Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday.In an appearance on Fox News on Friday evening, Trump said he had been tested again for the virus but did not disclose the result. He also said he had stopped taking medications to combat COVID-19. “I feel really strong,” Trump said.The White House has not released the results of Trump’s latest test, and has declined to say when he last tested negative.Trump and his administration have faced criticism for their handling of the pandemic, as well as for a lax approach to mask-wearing and social distancing in the White House and - in recent days - confusing messages about how ill the president has been.BIDEN IN PENNSYLVANIABiden sharply criticized Trump’s decision to resume campaigning. “Good luck. I wouldn’t show up unless you have a mask and can distance,” he told reporters in Paradise, Nevada.A source familiar with the planning for Saturday’s White House event said attendees will all be expected to wear masks. People at the Florida rally will be given a temperature check, masks that they will be encouraged to wear, and access to hand sanitizer, the campaign said.Biden will travel on Saturday to the city of Erie in northwestern Pennsylvania, a state that Trump narrowly took over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.Former Democratic President Barack Obama won Erie county in the two elections beforehand and Biden, who was Obama’s vice president, has made the region a top priority.A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released earlier this week showed Biden with a five-point edge over Trump in Pennsylvania. The poll also had Biden with a 10-point lead nationwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-still-facing-health-questions-holds-first-public-event-since-covid-19-diagnosis/story-coowGar6FhosQT6GvFko4J.html
10-10-2020||World||Nancy Pelosi calls Donald Trump plan ‘one step forward, two steps back’||President Donald Trump scrapped fiscal stimulus talks this week after failing to swing Senate Republicans behind a package Democrats could support. With negotiations back on, the obstacles are just as daunting, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi termed Trump’s latest offer “insufficient.”Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin head into weekend negotiations with the top-line number for relief fast approaching the $2 trillion level that many Senate Republicans say they cannot accept.Before those talks, though, Pelosi on Saturday called the Trump administration’s latest offer “one step forward, two steps back.”“We still have disagreement on many priorities,” Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues. “His proposal appears to mean that he wants more money at his discretion to grant or withhold.”Funding for state and local government “remains sadly inadequate,” she added.Senate Republicans, meanwhile, expressed concerns about both the proposed size and certain elements of Trump’s proposal on a call Saturday with Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the Washington Post reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.Mnuchin has already alienated some in his party by moving toward policies in the House Democrats’ $2.2 trillion proposal that they oppose. His counteroffer contains language allowing taxpayer-funded abortions through Obamacare and stimulus checks to undocumented immigrants, according to a person familiar with the matter -- measures anathema to many GOP lawmakers.After a months-long deadlock, the stimulus talks took on a desperate appearance this week. Trump on Tuesday tried to blame Pelosi for refusing to compromise, and pulled out his negotiators. Hours later, he demanded separate bills for aid including stimulus checks for individuals and aid to airlines. By Thursday, comprehensive talks were back on.Then came Friday. With his poll deficit to Joe Biden widening and the need to divert attention from his handling of the coronavirus escalating, Trump endorsed an even bigger stimulus proposal. Just how big a number he wants hasn’t been entirely clear.Negotiators UndercutMnuchin made a $1.8 trillion offer to Pelosi Friday -- an increase from the $1.6 trillion the White House had previously endorsed. Yet Trump undercut that by saying he wants an even bigger stimulus than what the Democrats advocate.“I would like to see a bigger stimulus package, frankly, than either the Democrats or the Republicans are offering,” Trump said on Rush Limbaugh’s radio program, adding that he’s going in the “exact opposite” direction from his earlier stances.Shortly after, the White House communications director, Alyssa Farah, told reporters the administration wants a package below $2 trillion, sowing further confusion.Democrats’ $2.2 trillion plan, passed by the House earlier this month, is down from the $3.4 trillion package they approved in the chamber in May.Senate VoteSenate Republicans backed a bill offering about $650 billion last month, showcasing the gulf with the House. But if Mnuchin and Trump can get Pelosi to sign off on an agreement for less than $2 trillion, it would be hard for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not to put it up for a vote, according to a Senate GOP aide.Trouble is, the president’s suggestion he wants something bigger than the Democratic proposal could also harden Pelosi’s demands for larger-scale spending.Then there’s the timeline. For Trump -- and vulnerable moderates from both parties -- unveiling a deal after Election Day would garner no campaign benefit. It took 19 days after enacting the last stimulus, in March, to send out stimulus payments to individuals, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts pointed out. There are now 24 days left until the election.Crafting a pre-election bill may prove a hurdle too high. McConnell said on Friday that there’s probably not enough time.Barrett Is the Priority“I believe that we do need another rescue package, but the proximity to the elections and the differences of opinion about what is needed are pretty vast,” McConnell said at an event in his home state of Kentucky.The majority leader later told reporters that “even if an agreement” on stimulus is reached, his first priority is securing Senate confirmation of Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. Hearings for her nomination are scheduled to begin Monday with a final Senate vote as soon as the week of Oct. 26.If Pelosi and Mnuchin did reach an agreement, Congress would likely need two weeks or more to draft legislative text and approve it in the House and Senate. The Senate is on recess until Oct. 19 and the House until mid-November, but lawmakers have been told they can be called back with 24 hours notice to vote on any stimulus deal.If it came to a vote, Republican lawmakers may be the key obstacle.Further DisputesMcConnell has said there are members of his majority who think the government has already provided enough stimulus. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California has also said his caucus members are skeptical of a large package. “We’d have to see what’s in it, but I think it’s difficult,” he said last month.The two sides are are divided on issues including how much money to provide state and local governments, language restricting Trump’s ability to divert anti-virus health care spending and the level and length of supplemental unemployment benefits. Dozens of smaller arguments, such as on funding for election security and the U.S. Postal Service, also remain.Many of the policy issues are “at least as controversial as the top-line number,” Goldman analysts including Alec Phillips wrote in a note Friday.“An appearance of additional progress seems likely over the next several days,” with Trump pushing for a deal, they wrote. But “we haven’t changed our view that substantial fiscal stimulus is unlikely to pass before the election,” the Goldman team concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-calls-donald-trump-plan-one-step-forward-two-steps-back/story-kzMqdWBhhzMpNESGjgPfuK.html

10-10-2020||World||Taiwan urges China to ‘never seek hegemony’ and ease tensions||Taiwan’s leader on Saturday appealed to her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to deescalate military tensions and live up to his promise to “never seek hegemony” after months of Beijing ramping up fighter jet incursions.In a speech on Taiwan’s national day, President Tsai Ing-wen said the international community was becoming concerned about the “expanding hegemony” of China. Beijing views democratic, self-ruling Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it back into fold.But Tsai referenced a recent speech by Xi to the United Nations that she said gave the Taiwanese some hope.“I am also aware that the leader across the Strait (Xi) has publicly stated in a video message to the United Nations General Assembly that China will never seek hegemony, expansion, or a sphere of influence ... we hope this is the beginning of genuine change.” “We are committed to upholding cross-strait stability, but this is not something Taiwan can shoulder alone -- it is the joint responsibility of both sides,” she added,Beijing’s bellicose stance towards Taiwan has increased dramatically under Xi, who has described the island’s unification with the mainland as “inevitable”.It is also a response to the election of Tsai in 2016 and again earlier this year. Tsai, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), views Taiwan as a sovereign country and rejects the idea that the island is part of “one China”. Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) accused Tsai of “extending confrontational thinking and antagonism to promote independence” in her speech, according to the official Xinhua news agency.“We urge the DPP authority to stop any provocative word and action promoting independence and not to go further down the wrong road,” Xinhua quoted TAO spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian as saying.The DPP would “only swallow its own evil fruits to collude with Western countries,” Zhu warned.Washington’s increased outreach to Taipei under President Donald Trump has become yet another flashpoint with Beijing as US-China relations plunge to historic lows.China’s military has piled on pressure even more than usual this year, sending its warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence zone at unprecedented frequency and sometimes also crossing the so-called “median line” of the Taiwan Strait.It conducted exercises near the Taiwan Strait when a senior American diplomat was visiting the island last month, shortly after health chief Alex Azar made the highest-level US visit to Taipei since 1979 when Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.A Chinese foreign ministry official has even said there was no such thing as the median line as “Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory”, sparking condemnations from Taipei. On Saturday, Chinese jets entered Taiwan’s air defence zone for the eighth time this month and the fifth straight day this week, according to Taipei’s defence ministry.Tsai pledged that Taiwan “will not act rashly” and will work to lower the risk of military conflict.“As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations... we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-urges-china-to-never-seek-hegemony-and-ease-tensions/story-iEpiSXzRvYpAqmQxZ5EnmO.html

Following his meetings this week with India’s top leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Abdullah said in an interview that he hadn’t discussed any “military role” for India in Afghanistan during his talks in New Delhi. Watch: Abdullah Abdullah on Afghan peace talks, India engaging with Taliban | Worldview “Whether India would like to engage with the Taliban or not, we have no view one way or another. I have not asked for that engagement, but should India opt to engage them, we will not have concerns about it. So that’s very clear,” he said. Abdullah said he had not raised or discussed a military role for India in Afghanistan during his meetings with the Indian leadership. “Analytically, it might have been in the public domain here, but personally, during my visit, we have not discussed it,” he said. Also read: India test-fires 10 missiles in 35 days. It is not a coincidenceZalmay Khalilzad, US special envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation, had suggested earlier this year that India should directly engage the Taliban to discuss its concerns related to terror, reinvigorating the debate on whether New Delhi should talk to the group. However, diplomatic circles remain sceptical about the Taliban’s intentions in view of the group’s deep ties with the Pakistani security establishment. India’s decision to send an official delegation to the inauguration of talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha and the external affairs minister’s address to the event via video conference signalled towards a possible shift in New Delhi’s position. Abdullah said he had come to New Delhi to brief the leadership here on the Doha negotiations since India has contributed to the well-being of the Afghan people and is a “country which has a lot at stake in a peaceful settlement of the situation”. He added, “We were happy that external affairs minister S Jaishankar also addressed the conference [in Doha].” Acknowledging that the pace of the talks in Doha “is perhaps a bit slow” and that there needs to be a “significant reduction in violence” by the Taliban, Abdullah said the Afghan government delegation has been advised to be “patient, flexible, innovative and try to find a solution”. “Are both sides equally determined to achieve peace and utilise this opportunity for the best interest of our own people? That would be put to test. I have no doubt in my mind about the determination of the delegation from... Afghanistan,” he added. In the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s stated intention of pulling out all US troops from Afghanistan by late December, Abdullah reiterated such a move would have consequences. “If it is a premature withdrawal, it will... have consequences but eventually we need to stand on our own feet. But it will not be the end of US commitment in support of Afghanistan and we believe their commitment is long-term,” he said. “What brought them to Afghanistan was terrorist threats emanating from Afghanistan, which hurt them back in the US and I do not think that they want that situation to prevail in Afghanistan because we still have those challenges, including Al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups.” Responding to a question on the possible impact of India’s current tensions with both Pakistan and China, Abdullah acknowledged that such issues “certainly will have some repercussions for us”, but insisted that a “peaceful [and] stable Afghanistan is in the interest of everybody”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-leadership-won-t-have-concerns-if-india-engages-with-taliban-abdullah-abdullah/story-8h7tJ7rLvh1XjCFycq5FAN.html

But, I mean…you know…damn! Just get organized and get everyone to vote #Biden,” she wrote.Thunberg, who sparked a global climate protest movement after striking outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, could encourage participation among younger voters who are typically less likely to vote than older Americans.After Thunberg was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year in 2019, U.S President Donald Trump mocked the teen activist, tweeting she needed to “work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend”.Trump also sarcastically commented on Thunberg’s speech to a United Nations climate summit last year, in which she angrily denounced world leaders for failing to tackle climate change by demanding: “How dare you?”.Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement was nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, which on Friday was awarded to The United Nations’ World Food Programme.Trump, a Republican, has focused on dismantling former President Barack Obama’s climate agenda to free the energy and auto industries from the costs of regulations meant to protect health and the environment, while Biden has a focus on a new massive green infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-shows-support-for-joe-biden-in-rare-political-tweet/story-qlXUPWDO9uKTdeOHGGxVKM.html

10-10-2020||World||North Korea unveils new intercontinental ballistic missile at military parade||North Korea showcased previously unseen intercontinental ballistic missiles at an unprecedented predawn military parade on Saturday that showcased the country’s long-range missiles for the first time in two years.Analysts said the missile, which was shown on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, would be one of the largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the world if it becomes operational.Also displayed were the Hwasong-15, which is the longest-range missile ever tested by North Korea, and what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).Ahead of the parade, which was held to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party, officials in South Korea and the United States said Kim Jong Un could use the event to unveil a new “strategic weapon” as promised earlier this year.The parade featured North Korea’s ballistic missiles for the first time since Kim began meeting with international leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, in 2018.“We will continue to build our national defence power and self-defensive war deterrence,” Kim said, but vowed that the country’s military power would not be used preemptively. He made no direct mention of the United States or the now-stalled denuclearisation talks.State news agency KCNA said the authority and security of North Korea hinged on “the huge nuclear strategic forces” shown in the parade.Kim blamed international sanctions, typhoons, and the coronavirus for preventing him from delivering on promises of economic progress.“I am ashamed that I have never been able to repay you properly for your enormous trust,” he said. “My efforts and devotion were not sufficient to bring our people out of difficult livelihoods.”The video showed Kim make an appearance as a clock struck midnight. Dressed in a grey suit and tie, he waved to the crowd and accepted flowers from children while surrounded by military officials in Pyongyang’s recently renovated Kim Il Sung Square.The parade was highly choreographed, with thousands of troops marching in formation, displays of new conventional military equipment including tanks, and fighter jets launching flares and fireworks.Chad O’Carroll, CEO of the Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea, said more new military hardware had been displayed at this event than at nearly any other previous parade.CORONAVIRUS MEASURESSometimes appearing emotional, Kim thanked the military for working hard to respond to a series of damaging summer typhoons, and for preventing a coronavirus outbreak in the isolated country.Kim said he hoped that North and South Korea would join hands again when the global coronavirus crisis is over.He said he was grateful that not a single North Korean had tested positive for the disease, an assertion that South Korea and the United States have previously questioned.While attendees at other celebratory events were shown wearing masks, no one at the parade appeared to be wearing them.“It is an impressively large gathering during a global pandemic, suggesting North Korean authorities are concerned more with political history and national morale than with preventing a COVID-19 superspreader event,” said Leif-Eric Easley, who teaches at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.Earlier in the day, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said South Korea and U.S. intelligence authorities were closely monitoring developments.South Korean officials said this week that Kim could use the event as a “low intensity” show of power ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, as denuclearisation talks with Washington have stalled.Foreign diplomats in Pyongyang have often been invited to observe past celebrations. But the Russian Embassy said on social media that all diplomatic missions have been advised this year to “refrain as much as possible” from travelling in the city, approaching the event venue and taking photos and videos.In a congratulatory message to Kim for the anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he intended to “defend, consolidate and develop” ties with North Korea, its state media said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-displays-ballistic-missiles-kim-apologises-for-economic-woes/story-ijS5bwqjY9NN1gfzy73IrM.html
10-10-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim attends military parade, thanks troops for stopping coronavirus||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addressed an unusual predawn military parade early on Saturday, praising the troops for working hard to respond to natural disasters and to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, state television reported.The country marked the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party with a raft of concerts and festivals, and the ceremony was seen around the region as an event where Kim could deliver messages to domestic and foreign audiences. State television began broadcasting edited video of the event later on Saturday after a day of silence about the parade, which was held in Pyongyang’s recently renovated Kim Il Sung Square. Officials in Seoul and Washington had said the North might unveil new strategic weapons. Initial footage of the parade showed conventional troops marching in formation and what appeared to be ballistic missiles on vehicles.The video showed Kim make an appearance as a clock struck midnight. Dressed in a grey suit and tie, he waved to the crowd and accepted flowers from children while surrounded by military officials wearing rows of medals.Sometimes appearing emotional, Kim thanked the military for working hard to respond to natural disasters and to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. North Korea has not reported any domestic infections, an assertion that South Korea and the United States have questioned. Kim said he hopes that North and South Korea will join hands again after the coronavirus crisis is over.While attendees at other holiday events were shown wearing masks, no one at the parade appeared to be wearing any masks.CORONAVIRUS MEASURES The event comes as the isolated country carries out strict measures against the coronavirus. State media said the curbs have caused delays in some of Kim’s key economic and construction projects, already dogged by international sanctions. “It is an impressively large gathering during a global pandemic, suggesting North Korean authorities are concerned more with political history and national morale than with preventing a COVID-19 superspreader event,” said Leif-Eric Easley, who teaches at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. Earlier in the day, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it spotted signs that a parade involving large-scale military equipment and personnel took place in Pyongyang but gave no further details. “South Korea and U.S. intelligence authorities are closely monitoring developments,” it said.It was the first time that the parade has been held before dawn.South Korean officials said this week that Kim could use the event as a “low intensity” show of power ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, as denuclearisation talks with Washington have stalled.For weeks commercial satellite imagery has shown thousands of North Korean soldiers practicing marching, and South Korean officials have said the North could use the parade to unveil a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), or a new submarine-launched ballistic missile.Foreign diplomats in Pyongyang have often been invited to observe past celebrations. But the Russian Embassy said on social media that all diplomatic missions have been advised this year to “refrain as much as possible” from travelling in the city, approaching the event venue and taking photos and videos. The last time North Korea broadcast a military parade live on television was in 2017, when it showed off many large ICBMs amid heightened tension with the United States.ICBMs were once again paraded in February 2018, but no international media were allowed to observe. Shortly after, Kim began meeting international leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump, and no large missiles have been displayed since.In a congratulatory message to Kim for the anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he intended to “defend, consolidate and develop” ties with North Korea, its state media said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-attends-military-parade-thanks-troops-for-stopping-coronavirus/story-S1ps6EWUpw8LL0J8Yz1YrK.html
10-10-2020||World||UK plans new 3-tier system of Covid-19 lockdown measures||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to unveil a new three-tier system of measures alongside local regions across the country being handed greater decision-making powers as part of efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus.The new so-called “traffic light” system, to be laid out in the House of Commons on Monday, will see the most severe measures imposed for areas of England fall within the third tier and people being ordered not to have any social contact with anyone outside their household together with the expected closures of pubs, bars and restaurants where some of the highest numbers of cases are occurring.Tier one is likely to see people expected to follow the “rule of six” on gatherings and maintain social distancing. Tier two could ban households from mixing in homes, gardens, pubs, bars or restaurants.According to a letter seen by the BBC, the details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend.Johnson’s Chief Strategic Adviser Edward Lister has written to the members of Parliament to highlight engagement with local authority leaders as part of the process. It comes amid mounting criticism of the government using a top-down approach by shutting down parts of northern England without a full engagement process with the local authorities.“The government is operating under the misguided, arrogant and counterproductive view that ‘Whitehall knows best’, that decisions can be made behind closed doors, without any real consultation or even picking up the phone to those on the frontline,” Opposition Labour Party Leader Kier Starmer wrote in ‘The Daily Telegraph’ earlier in the week.Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) also criticised the government’s approach to reduce the spread of the virus and called for compulsory face coverings across all settings.“COVID-19 is just as infectious in offices as in supermarkets. We need clear consistent policy now requiring masks in all settings where people mix outside their household and not 2 metres apart,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA Council Chair.A number of areas in the northern and Midlands of England are already subject to stricter restrictions, with the new tiered system being designed to try and better organise the differing set of rules for different parts of the UK.Public Health England’s national infection service warned that the number of cases was rising all over the country, but more quickly in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber than the South.Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected Liverpool – where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people – to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions.Other cities, such as Leeds and Sheffield, could fall in the top tier. There is also a debate about whether the tiers should be tightly drawn around larger cities, or include the suburbs where infections are less.Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan repeated his warnings that tougher restrictions in the UK capital are “inevitable”.“You’ve got three buckets: level one the least restrictions, level three the most – similar to lockdown-type measures. What’s clear to me is that it’s inevitable there will be additional restrictions in London,” he told ‘LBC Radio’.“And one of the things we are discussing as ‘one London’ – that’s me and the 32/33 boroughs – is what we think the right level should be and then work with government to make sure we have the right level there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-new-3-tier-system-of-covid-19-lockdown-measures/story-GPRm1KQMJzmZmmyuc4CV2L.html

10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump to resume public events starting Saturday at White House||President Donald Trump will make his first public appearance since returning from a three-day hospitalization for Covid-19, setting the stage for a return to the campaign trail even as questions remain about whether he’s still contagious.In a Saturday address from a White House balcony before hundreds of invited guests, Trump will seek to show that he has made a strong recovery from coronavirus and is ready to resume work and re-enter the re-election race against Democratic nominee and front-runner Joe Biden.The event kicks off what could be a full week of campaign travel for the president, starting Monday with a stop in central Florida for a rally at the Orlando Sanford International Airport to make up for one canceled when Trump fell ill.Trump has been itching to return to public events following his battle with the coronavirus, aides say -- an impatience only heightened by the president falling further behind Biden in polls.The White House event comes at the earliest moment doctors said the president would be able to return to public life. The gathering risks deepening concern among voters about Trump’s handling of a pandemic that has left more than two dozen of his close associates infected and more than 210,000 Americans dead.After the president’s last outdoor event -- a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony to announce his pick of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court -- at least 11 attendees tested positive for coronavirus. While the White House had a testing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and attendees mingled and sat in close proximity to one another both indoors and outdoors.Trump’s physician said Wednesday that the president had been free of symptoms for the previous 24 hours. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump “will be clear to go” on Saturday, when “he wants to talk to the American people.” There are medical tests underway to ensure he doesn’t transmit the virus when he returns to the campaign trail, she said on Fox News, adding that she’d conferred with White House doctor Sean Conley. McEnany, who herself has tested positive for Covid-19, is working remotely.Virus ScreeningOn Saturday, White House guests must bring masks with them and wear them on the grounds, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that they also have to undergo a Covid-19 screening on Saturday morning that will include a temperature check and a brief questionnaire. But those rules were put in place not by the White House but by the organizer of the event, the Blexit group, led by Candace Owens, a Trump ally, the person said.On Tuesday, Trump is planning an event in western Pennsylvania, according to WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh. His campaign is negotiating a town hall on network television on Thursday, according to CNN.Trump’s challenge to win over voters has only intensified in recent days. His vacillations on a stimulus bill and second presidential debate have fed a developing narrative that he’s flailing as a second term slips from his grasp.Earlier in the week, Trump -– to the dismay of fellow Republicans -- said he was cutting off talks on an additional coronavirus stimulus bill, only to rapidly reverse course after the announcement rocked markets.But subsequent days saw a flurry of different and often contradictory statements from the White House. First, officials said they would resume talks -- but only on standalone bills to bolster the airline industry and small businesses.Reversing CourseThen Trump said not only did he want a sweeping bill, but was open to levels beyond even what Democrats had proposed. By Friday afternoon, the administration was preparing a proposal for a $1.8 trillion deal that fell below what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has described as her floor, but exceeded levels Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said would be acceptable.Trump and his campaign team -- which, like the White House staff, has suffered coronavirus infections at the highest levels -- are searching for ways to reverse the president’s slide in polls.Trump pulled out of the second debate because the bipartisan commission organizing the event said it would be held virtually following his diagnosis. Trump’s efforts to force the debate commission to reverse course or reschedule the remaining debates fell flat. As a result, Trump will either be deprived of one of the final marquee opportunities to reach voters before Election Day or forced to publicly reverse himself.That’s left the president eager to return to the campaign trail, with hopes that his signature rallies can offer him a chance to reconnect with voters and rekindle enthusiasm for his candidacy.The president told Fox News host Sean Hannity that his team was looking to organize a rally Saturday night in Florida -- the earliest possible date his medical team said he might be able to resume public appearances -- and a second event Sunday in Pennsylvania.Virus SymptomsWhite House aides said logistical challenges prevented organizing such events on short notice. But the president also acknowledged Friday he’s still experiencing some symptoms from his brush with coronavirus. Trump was seen struggling to catch his breath after walking a flight of stairs during his return from the hospital on Monday, and occasionally lost his voice during his interview with Hannity on Thursday.Trump sought to underscore his health Friday through a marathon of interviews with conservative media figures.That included a two-hour uninterrupted conversation on Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio show. On that program, Trump ranked Fox News hosts by how favorable they were to him personally, expressed alarm that Attorney General Bill Barr might not release the findings of a politically charged investigation into the origins of its Russia probe and delivered an expletive-charged warning to Iran.Trump followed that up with several more interviews, including an appearance on Mark Levin’s talk show. The president is expected to be interviewed again Sunday morning by Fox Business Network.“I feel really good, I feel very strong, I know a lot of people who have had the Covid—or the China virus as I call it because it came from China,” the president said in an interview on Fox News Friday. “But I feel really, really strong and a lot of people don’t feel that way sometimes for a while afterwards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-resume-public-events-starting-saturday-at-white-house/story-CtZcucc2e8yFih9L6SZo9M.html
10-10-2020||World||New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern casts her vote a week before polls close||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has voted in the nation’s general election, a week before polls officially close.Ardern cast her vote in her Auckland district Saturday after visiting a market in the heavily Polynesian south Auckland suburb of Otara, where she was thronged by supporters.Ardern’s Labour Party has governed since the 2017 general election, when it was able to forge a narrow majority in New Zealand’s 120-seat Parliament in a coalition with the left-wing Greens and right-wing New Zealand First parties.Recent polls show a more comfortable result this year, with the Labour Party leading the National Party, led by 61-year-old conservative Judith Collins, by as many as 13 points.More than 700,000 people had voted by Saturday, a week before the official election day of Oct. 17, according to the New Zealand Electoral Commission. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to vote during the coming week.Ardern’s visit to Otara was an effort to get out the vote in an electorate in which Labour out-polls National by around four votes to one.“We’re seeing really high turnout at the moment for advance voting,” Ardern said. “We want to make sure everyone uses their voice until election day.”Voters have four choices to make this year. They are picking a candidate to represent their electorate and choosing which party to give their “party vote.” Seats in Parliament are allocated on the basis of seats won and the percentage of the vote won by each party.Voters also face two referendums. They will vote on the decriminalization of cannabis and on the legalization of “assisted dying” in limited cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-casts-her-vote-a-week-before-polls-close/story-ESlFWl12nBMkKPe5kCxlyK.html

There were reports from both sides of continued fighting in the run-up, and the two countries also alleged serious breaches after it got underway. The Moscow ceasefire talks were the first diplomatic contact between the two sides since fighting over the mountainous enclave erupted on Sept. 27, killing hundreds of people. The enclave is internationally-recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who helped mediate between the two sides, said in a statement in the early hours of Saturday after more than 10 hours of negotiations that the ceasefire had been agreed on humanitarian grounds.The International Committee of the Red Cross would help make the truce work, he said.“The specific terms of the ceasefire still need to be agreed,” said Lavrov, who said Armenia and Azerbaijan had also agreed to enter into what he called substantive peace talks. Those talks would be held under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Minsk Group, he said. Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azeri counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov did not speak to reporters in Moscow after striking the ceasefire deal.But Mnatsakanyan later paid tribute on Armenian state TV to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he said had played a key role in making sure the talks happened and had personally intervened to help get an agreement.Turkey, which has strongly backed Baku, welcomed the deal but said much more was needed.“The humanitarian ceasefire is a significant first step but will not stand for a lasting solution,” the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. “Turkey emphasized that it will support any solution approved by Azerbaijan. Turkey will continue to stand by Azerbaijan in the field and at the table”. Rival allegationsThe Azeri defence ministry in a statement accused ethnic Armenian forces of shelling populated areas on Saturday morning ahead of the ceasefire, an allegation Yerevan denied. Armenia’s defence ministry, which said forces in the enclave had been ordered to halt fighting from midday, in turn accused the Azeris of using attack drones on a populated settlement inside Armenia and said it looked like Baku was trying to change the facts on the ground before the truce took hold. Ethnic Armenian officials in Nagorno-Karabakh also accused the Azeris of firing missiles at Stepanakert, the biggest town in the region, but said there was no data on casualties yet. Baku denied shelling or using drones against civilian areas.Nagorno-Karabakh officials said that 28 members of their defence forces had been killed in fighting since Friday. Renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.The clashes have also increased concern about the security of pipelines that carry Azeri oil and gas to Europe.The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000 people and ended with a ceasefire that has been violated repeatedly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nagorno-karabakh-row-kremlin-backed-ceasefire-enters-into-force-despite-shelling-from-both-sides/story-SH2cn7Uy4iaKLKWKTVLRMM.html

While earlier studies had shown that the cocktail of two antibodies targeting the coronavirus spike protein could be used to neutralise the pathogen, scientists from the American biotechnology company Regeneron noted that further research in multiple animal models is needed to test the effectiveness of the formulation. In the current study, published in the journal Science, the researchers tested REGN-COV2 in rhesus macaques, which manifest mild Covid-19 symptoms, and in golden hamsters, which show symptoms that are much more severe, including rapid weight loss.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  They found that when the cocktail was administered three days before challenging the macaques with the virus, the treatment almost completely blocked establishment of infection. According to the scientists, this ability of REGN-COV2 “matches or exceeds the effects recently shown in vaccine efficacy studies using the same animal models.” “These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of (this approach) to both protect from and treat SARS-CoV-2 disease,” the researchers noted in the study. When the macaques were treated with the drug one day after infection, they said there was faster viral clearance than in controls who had not been treated with the cocktail. In the hamster model, the study noted that the animals treated with the drug two days before infection exhibited a “dramatic protection from weight loss,” and decreased viral load in the lungs. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The scientists also reported benefits for hamsters treated one day after infection, as compared to controls. “In conclusion, our data provide evidence that REGN-COV2 based therapy may offer clinical benefit in both prevention and treatment settings of Covid-19 disease, where it is currently being evaluated,” they wrote in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/regeneron-s-antibody-cocktail-may-offer-protection-against-covid-19-study/story-UJHSkB5ssuCJw2uajUeQmK.html
10-10-2020||World||With whipping winds, Delta drenches Louisiana, Mississippi||Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. By early Saturday, it dwindled to a tropical storm with 60 mph (95 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas. Mississippi also got its fair share of rain overnight.Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.” In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack’s bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.” In the town of Lake Arthur, Delta’s winds peeled shingles off the roof of L’Banca Albergo Hotel, an eight-room boutique hotel in what used to be a bank.“I probably don’t have a shingle left on the top of this hotel,” owner Roberta Palermo said as the winds gusted outside.Palermo said the electricity was out and she could see pieces of metal coming off the roof of a 100-year-old building across the street. Unsecured trash cans were flying around the streets.“There is a lot of power lines down all over the place, there’s ... really deep water in certain spots,” said hotel guest Johnny Weaver. He had been out in the weather with his friends earlier and the friend’s car was stranded in the water.Delta’s reach stretched as far west as Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from where the storm struck Louisiana. Two homes under construction were toppled by winds, as were some trees and signs in the area. Beach dunes flattened by earlier storms allowed storm surge to reach beneath some of Galveston’s raised beach houses.Delta also downed trees across Mississippi, including one that landed on top of a Jackson-based WLBT-TV vehicle with a news crew inside. No one was injured.Power outages in Louisiana and neighboring Texas neared 600,000 homes and businesses early Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us. Almost 40,000 outages were reported in Mississippi.Tropical storm force winds extended 160 miles (260 kilometers) outward from the storm’s center, forecasters said Saturday. A 68 mph (110 kph) gust was reported at LSU’s Tiger Stadium overnight, and a 55 mph (68 kph) gust was reported Adams County airport in Natchez, Mississippi.Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast. It was the first Greek-alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And it became the 10th named storm to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.The storm was projected to move then into the Tennessee Valley later Saturday and into Sunday as a tropical depression.Delta was the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck. And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.Some who rode out Laura chose to hunker down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting the front door of her apartment Friday night and her patio gate banging open and shut.“The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought,” Gove said in a message on Twitter.The roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and being tossed down the sidewalk.“The wind gusts are making the glass from our windows bow inward,” Gove added. “It’s pretty scary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-whipping-winds-delta-drenches-louisiana-mississippi/story-sedLm9Cw6JfUhesCeVQNHN.html
10-10-2020||World||Chinese app provides legal way to get over the Great Firewall||A developer backed by Chinese cybersecurity giant 360 Security Technology Inc. has introduced a browser that allows mainland Chinese users to access previously blocked sites like Google and Facebook, partially bypassing Beijing’s Great Firewall.The browser, named Tuber, requires mobile number registration before use. That makes users’ browsing activities traceable and can identify people because smartphone numbers are linked to unique Chinese identification numbers. Blocked websites that can be accessed via Tuber include YouTube, Instagram and The New York Times.The app appears to be providing a government-approved platform for the nation’s 904 million netizens to legally visit overseas websites. Mainland Chinese use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to bypass the Great Firewall -- the name given to the entity which has blocked an array of foreign Internet services, from Gmail to Twitter, for over a decade. China regularly cracks down on illegal VPN services, eliminating VPN apps from the stores of both Alphabet Inc.’s Android and Apple Inc.’s iOS.The app has attracted five million downloads on Huawei Technologies Co.’s app store as of Saturday morning. It has been available for download since at least late September, according to online posts. There are numerous WeChat posts about it, and a reporter from state media outlet Global Times promoted the app in a Twitter post. Tuber is currently only available for Android phones, according to its website.Tuber appears to be providing censored search results for YouTube. A search of President Xi Jinping’s name in Chinese yielded only seven video clips uploaded by three accounts claiming to be television stations in Shanghai, Tianjin and Macau. Searching for Xi’s name in English yielded no results at all.The parent company of Tuber’s developer is controlled by Chinese billionaire and tech mogul Zhou Hongyi, who delisted his security company Qihoo 360 from New York in mid-2016 and aligned himself with China’s national interest. The U.S. Department of Commerce in May sanctioned two of Zhou’s companies among 24 entities it said posed national-security concerns.A public relations employee at 360 Security declined to provide immediate comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet industry, didn’t respond to calls and emails from Bloomberg News on Saturday, which is a work day in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-app-provides-legal-way-to-get-over-the-great-firewall/story-w8PDpjfwwWgbft0KbbvS4O.html
10-10-2020||World||Time to accept that talks won’t make China change aggressive stance: US NSA||China has attempted to “seize” control of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India by force as part of its territorial aggression, US’ national security advisor has said, underlining that time has come to accept that dialogue and agreements will not persuade Beijing to change.India and China are locked in a five-month-long tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their relations. Both sides have held a series of high-level diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.Also Read: ‘China deployed 60K soldiers on India’s northern border’: Pompeo hits out at Beijing’s ‘bad behaviour’“CCP’s (Chinese Communist Party) territorial aggression is also apparent on its Indian border where China has attempted to seize control of the Line of Actual Control by force,” US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said in a remark on China early this week in Utah.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it. The Chinese territorial aggression is also true in the Taiwan Strait where the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) Navy and Air Force continue to conduct threatening military drills, O’Brien said.“Beijing’s signature international development programme, One Belt One Road (OBOR), involves impoverished companies taking on opaque and unsustainable Chinese loans to pay Chinese firms employing Chinese labourers to build their infrastructure,” he said.Many of these projects are unnecessary, shoddily built and are “white elephants”, the national security advisor said. “And now these countries’ dependence on the Chinese debt leaves their sovereignty eroded and with no choice but to hue to the party’s line on UN votes or any other issue that the Chinese Communist Party considers a red line,” he said. O’Brien also noted that China’s other international aid efforts include selling surveillance systems and similar tools of repression to “pariah regimes” around the world, including Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro. “The time has come to accept that dialogue and agreements will not persuade or compel the People’s Republic of China to change. There’s nothing to be gained from looking the other way or turning the other cheek. We’ve been doing that for too long,” he said.Also Read: ‘Tide’s begun to turn’: Pompeo says US, India partners in fight against ChinaO’Brien said the US must stand up to the Chinese and protect the American people.“We must promote American prosperity, practice peace through strength and advance American influence in the world,” he said, adding that under President Donald Trump’s leadership that is exactly what the US has done.O’Brien said the Trump administration has adopted a competitive approach to China. That approach, he said, has two primary objectives. First, improve the resiliency of US institutions, alliances and partnerships to prevail against the challenges that China presents; and the second is to impose tangible cost in order to compel Beijing to cease or reduce actions harmful to America’s vital national interest and those of its allied and partner nations.“President Trump has taken decisive action to meet these objectives. He is working to prevent companies that answer to the CCP’s intelligence and security apparatus,” O’Brien said.Citing examples, he said Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE have been prevented from accessing Americans’ personal and private data and national secrets. The Trump administration, he said, has also imposed import and export restrictions on US semiconductor technology and other exports going to Huawei and similar Chinese telecommunications corporations.“Our democratic partners are starting to follow. Just last month, the UK joined democracies such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Sweden in committing to using trusted suppliers to build their future 5G networks,” O’Brien said.“Carriers like Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan, and others have prohibited the use of Huawei equipment in their networks. The Trump administration is investigating and prosecuting the economic espionage aggressively,” he said.O’Brien said the Trump administration has strengthened its military relationships in the Indo Pacific.“One important partnership which will be one of the most key partnerships for the United States in the 21st century, India, is thriving,” he said. He also noted that the US has signed extended US military access to Singapore’s air and naval bases. The country is also working closely with Japan, Australia and New Zealand to strengthen relationships with the Pacific Islands, especially Timor. It is also working closely with Mongolia.However, O’Brien said even as the US competes with China, it does welcome cooperation where America’s interests align. “The US has a deep and abiding respect for the Chinese people and enjoys longstanding ties to that country, including our alliance in World War II,” O’Brien said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-has-come-to-accept-that-talks-won-t-make-china-change-its-aggressive-stance-us-nsa/story-CpJpIuZ0HbpZgOfIaFI0yL.html
10-10-2020||World||Pak’s law ministry seeks discontinuation of two-finger test on rape victims||The Pakistan government has disapproved of the two-finger test (TFT) performed on rape victims and recommended that it should not be part of any medico-legal examination report in sexual assault cases. The Ministry of Law and Justice has intimated the Additional Attorney General at Lahore, Chaudhry Ishtiaq Ahmed Khan, about the recommendation. He will now inform the Lahore High Court about the federal government’s stance, the Dawn News reported. The court sought the law ministry’s response after going through a statement by the World Health Organisation, which has declared virginity testing as “unscientific, medically unnecessary and unreliable”. The court is seized with two public interest litigation petitions which have challenged the TFT, the report said. One petition was filed by a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) member of the National Assembly and the other by a group of women’s rights activists, academics, journalists and advocates. The petitioners contended that the TFT was “disrespectful, inhumane and violated women’s fundamental rights”. At a previous hearing last month, the Punjab Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department and the Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department had observed in their submissions to the court that the TFT had limited evidentiary value vis-à-vis determination of virginity and, therefore, should be struck off the protocol of medico-legal certificate (MLC). The Lahore High Court is expected to resume the hearing in the first week of next month, but in the meantime, the law ministry has come out with its response on the issue. It will be placed before the court during the next hearing. In a statement, the law ministry observed that the TFT was an “inconclusive test”. In addition, the manner in which the test was conducted violated Article 14 of the Constitution which lays down that human dignity and the privacy of home must be respected under all circumstances and that the right to privacy would take precedence over any other inconsistent provisions of the law, the daily said. The petitioners had sought a declaration that these practices constituted a violation of women’s fundamental rights, including the rights to life, privacy, dignity, bodily integrity, access to justice, protection from cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, and freedom from discrimination. The petitioners further contended that this test nurtures myths and inaccuracies about female anatomy by ignoring the prevalence of different forms of sexual violence against women and children. They regretted that the test was still rife in the country despite calls for its revocation by healthcare professionals and human rights organisations the world over. “The continued use of TFT and hymen tests does not lead to any evidence that should be considered relevant to a trial and is aimed solely at drawing conclusions about the character, morality, chastity, social standing, past sexual activity and credibility of women who have been victims of these crimes,” the petition said. The petition pointed out that the Human Rights Watch, UN Human Rights Organisation and the WHO have called for the elimination of the TFT. The petitioners called upon governments to take measures to ensure physical and mental health of all women undergoing medico-legal examination and to adopt scientific methods of investigating claims of rape and sexual assault.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-s-law-ministry-seeks-discontinuation-of-two-finger-test-on-rape-victims/story-0mbNuQkvrczYBzDLkAJECI.html
10-10-2020||World||Specter of election chaos raises questions on military role||It’s a question Americans are unaccustomed to considering in a presidential election campaign: Could voting, vote-counting or the post-vote reaction become so chaotic that the U.S. military would intervene?The answer is yes, but only in an extreme case. There is normally no need for the military to play any role in an election. The Constitution keeps the military in a narrow lane — defending the United States from external enemies. Civil order is left largely to civilian police. But there is an obscure law, the Insurrection Act, that theoretically could thrust the active-duty military into a police-like role. And governors have the ability to use the National Guard in state emergencies if needed.The potential use of troops, either active duty or National Guard, at the polls or in post-election unrest has been discussed by governors and military leaders. The possibilities arise as President Donald Trump asserts without evidence that mail-in balloting will create election fraud and suggests that he might not accept an election loss. Stationing troops at polling places on Election Day — even if just to protect citizens as they vote — raises worries about voter intimidation.Here are some questions and answers about possible military involvement in the election:WHY WOULDN’T THE MILITARY GET INVOLVED?Civilian control of the military is a bedrock principle of American democracy. It means that men and women in uniform answer to civilian leaders like the secretary of defense, and they stay apart from politics. They pledge their loyalty to the Constitution and the nation’s laws, not to a political party or a president.Gen. Mark Milley, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the nation’s top military officer, has told Congress the military is committed to staying apolitical and steering clear of any election role.“In the event of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law U.S. courts and the U.S. Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the U.S. military,” he said in written answers to questions from two Democratic members of the House Armed Service Committee. “I foresee no role for the U.S. armed forces in this process.”Milley said service members must not get involved in the transfer of power after an election. In other words, don’t expect to see troops intervening if there is a dispute over who won.WHAT COULD THE NATIONAL GUARD DO?The military is made up of active duty, National Guard and Reserves. In all but extreme cases, active-duty troops are used for war to protect the nation, not against American citizens on domestic soil. National Guard units are in every state and are controlled by the governor, not the federal government.Governors routinely mobilize their Guard members for emergencies, such as natural disasters, and they can use them to help enforce the law during events such as riots. But usually law enforcement takes the lead, and Guard forces support it. During civil unrest this year, governors used Guard troops to tamp down violence and provide security. They could do so again.To bolster that effort, the National Guard Bureau has designated military police units in two states to serve as rapid reaction forces to respond quickly if a governor seeks help from other states to control civil unrest.In a national emergency, such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a president can deploy the Guard in a federal status to support the active-duty military. The president has the authority to federalize the Guard for use in a domestic emergency, but there are questions about whether a state’s governor can try to block such a move.WHAT ABOUT THE INSURRECTION ACT?The president has the authority under the Insurrection Act of 1807 to dispatch active-duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law. Under the law, the president can activate troops without a governor’s approval as long as specific conditions are met, such as if the violence is interfering with the execution of laws there.Would potential post-election violence amount to an insurrection? That might be open to debate. It’s not clear if states could legally block any presidential use of the Insurrection Act.In the last half-century, presidents have sent the military to Southern states to enforce school desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s, at times without gubernatorial consent. And troops were sent to Los Angeles when the California governor sought federal help during the 1992 riots. But it has not happened in connection with a presidential election in modern times.In June, Trump considered invoking the Insurrection Act to use active-duty forces to quell unrest following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposed using military troops for law enforcement. He argued publicly that the Insurrection Act should be invoked “only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” and added, “We are not in one of those situations now.”Still, it would be unprecedented for military leaders to refuse to follow a presidential order invoking the act.WHAT ABOUT SECURITY AT THE POLLS?Democrats fear that Trump supporters will try to intimidate Democratic voters at polling places to scare them from voting. Trump added to those worries in the Sept. 29 debate, urging his supporters “to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that’s what has to happen.”Several state leaders, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, have raised the possibility of using Guard troops for security at the polls. Others used the Guard during primary elections. At times they wore civilian clothes and filled in for poll workers who were absent because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also helped by cleaning polling places or directing traffic. But they must stay out of the polling process.A uniformed military presence at the polls, however, raises worries.Michele Flournoy, a Democrat who is considered a leading candidate to become the first female defense secretary if Joe Biden wins, said the Guard should be used only if police are overwhelmed. But she warned that using Guard troops at the polls could “be very intimidating to voters. ... I hope we don’t get there as a nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/specter-of-election-chaos-raises-questions-on-military-role/story-4eciD0NoPNssycimLb7bXM.html
10-10-2020||World||Whitmer kidnapping bid: 6 men belonging to militia group Wolverine Watchmen face domestic terrorism charges||Six men arrested on suspicion of taking part in a plot by armed extremists to kidnap Michigan’s governor have been arraigned on domestic terrorism and weapons charges, while a seventh awaits extradition from South Carolina, authorities said on Friday.All seven, described by prosecutors as members or associates of an anti-government militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen, were taken into custody late on Wednesday as part of a joint state-federal investigation.They are accused of conspiring to abduct Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has clashed sharply with Republican US President Donald Trump over her COVID-19 public health orders.Prosecutors say the men also sought to single out law enforcement officers for intimidation, made threats of violence to incite civil unrest, and trained for an operation to storm the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing and take government officials hostage.“Clearly this was not just talk,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a CBS News interview on Friday. “These were many overt actions. And so we thought it was time to move in before anybody lost their lives.”Nessel said the governor was informed of the investigation and briefed on developments over the past couple of months.“At times, she and her family had been moved around as a result of activities that law enforcement was aware of,” Nessel added.$10 million bondEach of the seven men named in criminal complaints filed by Nessel’s office is charged with providing material support for terrorist acts and possessing a firearm in the commission of a felony - both punishable by up to 20 years in prison.Two of them - Pete Musico, 46, and Joseph Morrison, 26 - were additionally charged with belonging to a criminal gang and with committing a threat of terrorism. At their arraignment on Thursday, Musico and Morrison were each ordered to remain jailed on a $10 million cash bond, the attorney general’s office said in a statement.Bond for each of the four others was set at $250,000. Michigan prosecutors are working to extradite the seventh defendant from South Carolina, where he was arrested, the statement said. He, too, is charged with gang membership.Various additional pretrial court proceedings were set for later this month, but no mention was made of any pleas being entered.In addition to the seven suspects held on state charges, six men were arrested on federal charges of conspiring to kidnap the governor, for which they could face life in prison if convicted.Michigan, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential race, became a focus of agitation earlier this year by Trump and his supporters, including various militia groups, who opposed strict stay-at-home orders imposed by Whitmer to curb the spread of the coronavirus.At least three of the defendants charged by the state were among hundreds of protesters, many carrying weapons, who entered the Michigan capitol on April 30 as state lawmakers debated Whitmer’s request to extend her emergency public health authority. Photos show all three men were armed.Both Whitmer and Nessel accused Trump of inflammatory rhetoric that they said has fostered a climate of racism and political extremism. Trump lashed back by calling Whitmer the “lockdown queen” while denying he was encouraging violence or racism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whitmer-kidnapping-bid-6-men-belonging-to-militia-group-wolverine-watchmen-arraigned-on-domestic-terrorism-charges/story-KL0FJJAOIMReyekXxXcbCI.html

It is also home to a large Canadian-owned mining operation.Military checkpoints were put up overnight around capital Bishkek and armoured personnel carriers were spotted in the city after President Sooronbai Jeenbekov ordered troops to deploy and re-establish order amid flare-ups of violence.The parliament planned to gather in the presidential residence on the outskirts of Bishkek, after its own offices were ransacked by protesters who seized key government buildings on Tuesday.Russia, which exerts significant influence on Kyrgyzstan, this week described the situation as “chaos”. More than 1,200 people have been injured and one person has been killed in street clashes since protests erupted on Monday.It was unclear which candidates the legislature would consider for premiership, although deputy speaker Aida Kasymaliyeva urged MPs to reconsider the nomination of opposition politician Sadyr Zhaparov, saying that voting him in would only divide the country further.Zhaparov’s supporters clashed with followers of a few other parties on Friday which nominated their own candidate, Omurbek Babanov. Several people were wounded including a politician nominated to serve as Babanov’s deputy.The opposition is divided between 11 parties which represent clan interests in a country that has already seen two presidents toppled by popular revolts since 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kyrgyz-parliament-set-to-meet-discuss-new-government-amid-unrest/story-osJxUhxaN9kUg2OWLriMpI.html
10-10-2020||World||‘China deployed 60K soldiers on India’s northern border’: Pompeo hits out at Beijing’s ‘bad behaviour’||China has amassed 60,000 troops on India’s northern border, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said as he hit out at Beijing for its “bad behaviour” and the threats it poses to the Quad countries. The foreign ministers from the Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group - the US, Japan, India and Australia - met in Tokyo on Tuesday in what was their first in-person talks since the coronavirus pandemic began. The meeting took place in the backdrop of China’s aggressive military behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, South China Sea and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Also Read: ‘Tide’s begun to turn’: Pompeo says US, India partners in fight against China “The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border,” Pompeo told The Guy Benson Show in an interview on Friday after his return from Tokyo wherein he attended the second Quad ministerial with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia. “I was with my foreign minister counterparts from India, Australia, and Japan – a format that we call the Quad, four big democracies, four powerful economies, four nations, each of whom has real risk associated with the threats imposed – attempting to be imposed by the Chinese Communist Party. And they see it in their home countries too,” he said. Pompeo met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Tokyo on Tuesday and they underscored the need to work together to advance, peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe. He described his meeting with Jaishankar as “productive.” “They see, the people of their (Quad) nations understanding that we all slept on this for too long. For decades, the West allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us.  The previous administration bent a knee, too often allowed China to steal our intellectual properties and the millions of jobs that came along with it. They see that in their country too,” he said in the interview.Also Read: PLA at its doors, India looks at new security rule to punch Chinese firms In another interview with Larry O’Connor, Pompeo said in his meetings with his counterparts from Japan, India and Australia, they began to develop a set of understandings and policies that can jointly take these countries to work to present a true resistance to the threats that the Chinese Communist Party poses to each of these nations. “They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight,” he said. “But they’ve all seen it, whether it’s the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the northeastern part of India, the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north,” he said. India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May that has significantly strained the bilateral ties. Both sides have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff. China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake in the last week of August. “Whether it’s the Australians who did the simple thing of saying the Chinese screwed this deal up with the virus, and we’d like to understand what happened and said we ought to have a full investigation, and in exchange for that, the Chinese Communist Party began to extort, coerce, bully the Australians,” Pompeo said. Every one of these countries has seen this, he said, adding that people in each of these countries now understand the Chinese Communist Party presents a threat to them. “The world has awakened. The tide’s begun to turn. And the United States under President Trump’s leadership has now built out a coalition that will push back against the threat and maintain good order, the rule of law, and the basic civic decency that comes from democracies controlling the world and not authoritarian regimes,” Pompeo said. In his third-interview to Fox News, Pompeo said that the US under Trump administration has begun to build out all the edifice of the structure and the allies and the coalition to push back against China. “We aim to protect the American people from the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses,” he said. Referring to his Quad ministerial meeting, Pompeo said that the three other countries Japan, India, and Australia were building out a coalition, build partners and allies around the world who understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party in the same way that “we do so that they can protect jobs here at home”. “Look, they’ve stacked 60,000 soldiers against the Indians in the north. When the Australians had the temerity to ask for an investigation of the Wuhan virus and where it began, something that we know a lot about, the Chinese Communist Party threatened them. They bullied them,” Pompeo told Fox News. “We need partners and friends. They’ll certainly try to react. But what the Chinese Communist Party had become accustomed to, frankly, for an awfully long time was watching America bend a knee, watching us turn the other cheek and appease them,” he said. “That only encouraged their bad behaviour, their malign activity. Our push back – they understand we’re serious about it. They’ve watched that we’re going to confront them and impose costs upon them. I am confident that this activity, over time, will change the nature of what the Chinese Communist Party tries to do to harm America,” Pompeo said. India is expanding bilateral cooperation with Japan, the US and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deployed-60k-soldiers-on-india-s-border-says-pompeo-hitting-out-at-beijing-s-bad-behaviour/story-2Hv5DsBusvmLcdxNsnhosI.html

Pierluigi Maccalli and Nicola Chiacchio, and prominent Malian politician Soumaila Cisse this week, days after the Malian government freed nearly 200 Islamic militants in an apparent prisoner exchange.Stoeckli, a Christian missionary, and at least four further foreign hostages were also held by JNIM and its associates. The fate of the others wasn’t immediately known.The Swiss Foreign Ministry said it was trying to find out more about the circumstances of the killing and the whereabouts of her remains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-says-swiss-hostage-in-mali-has-been-killed/story-0wUz2JGb71tr4HudqDwaSM.html

The Republic of China, which was in large font in the current passport, has been replaced with an emblem in the new one.According to Focus Taiwan, the country’s foreign minister Joseph Wu said that the change in design has been intended to reflect the difference between China and Taiwan. The Chinese passport has ‘The People’s Republic of China’ engraved in it. Wu said, people often mistake Taiwanese citizens for Chinese citizens due to the passport.The opposition party Kuomintang has accused the Tsai Ing-wen led government of trying to remove the official name of Taiwan - the Republic of China - from its records. Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) believe the efforts have been made to rule out misidentification.These changes come amid rising military tensions with China. Speaking on the occasion of Taiwan National Day, president Tsai Ing-wen said her country wants meaningful dialogue with China.“As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations, while parity and dignity are maintained, we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,” Tsai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-national-day-new-passport-design-asserts-independent-identity/story-0GhwWmWaWMtfzanoAF27lN.html

Xi said he was “greatly pleased” with the achievements that North Korea had made in recent years by engaging with foreign countries in the face of hardships and challenges, KCNA reported.After years of cool relations during which China joined the United States and other nations in imposing sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, Xi and Kim met five times in 2018 and 2019. The North Korean diplomatic offensive included Kim meeting with US President Donald Trump.While North Korea says it has had no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, strict border closures and other measures it imposed to prevent an outbreak have further strained its economy, which is heavily reliant on trade with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intend-to-successfully-develop-china-korea-relations-xi-jinping-to-kim-jong-un/story-mpeEyiigr2qHVl6FB6LFPO.html
10-10-2020||World||Nine arrested on suspicion of helping 12 flee Hong Kong for Taiwan||Hong Kong police said on Saturday they had arrested nine people suspected of helping 12 Hong Kong activists who fled the city in August, heading for Taiwan, only to be intercepted by Chinese authorities and held on the mainland. The detainees’ plight has grabbed international attention, with human rights groups raising concern as their families said they were denied access to independent lawyers, and aired suspicion that Hong Kong authorities helped in China’s arrests. Accused of crimes tied to anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, the group is being detained in China’s southern city of Shenzhen after authorities intercepted their boat and accused them of illegal border crossing. Police arrested four men and five women suspected of arranging transport for the fugitives, said Hong Kong police official Ho Chun-tung.“One direction of the investigation is whether they helped others to flee,” said Ho, a superintendent with the force’s organised crime and triad bureau, adding that he did not rule out the possibility of more arrests.He dismissed the relatives’ accusations that police in the Asian financial hub played a role in the arrests in China. “The arrests on the mainland had nothing to do with the Hong Kong police,” Ho added. Police also seized HK$500,000 ($64,500) in cash, computers, mobile phones, and documents related to the purchase of a boat. People began fleeing Hong Kong for self-ruled Taiwan from the early months of the protests, most of them legally, by air, but some by fishing boat, activists in Taipei who helped Hong Kong citizens get visas have told Reuters. Hong Kong authorities have said those detained are to be represented by mainland lawyers of their choice, albeit from a list provided by Chinese authorities.Their families have been offered “needed and feasible” assistance, which will continue, the authorities have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nine-arrested-on-suspicion-of-helping-12-flee-hong-kong-for-taiwan/story-OrzFFbF96ZnDH3tFCYkLsI.html

10-10-2020||World||North Korea flaunts advanced weapons during military parade||Nuclear-armed North Korea appears to have held a giant military parade early Saturday, Seoul said, with Pyongyang’s latest and most advanced weapons expected to have been on show in the coronavirus-barricaded country’s capital.The widely anticipated display is part of commemorations of the 75th anniversary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party.Such events typically feature thousands of troops goose-stepping through Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square, named for North Korea’s founder, under the gaze of his grandson Kim Jong Un, the third member of the family to rule the country.A cavalcade of progressively larger armoured vehicles and tanks usually follows, culminating with whatever missiles Pyongyang wants to highlight.They are keenly watched by observers for clues to its weapons development.“Signs of a military parade -- involving equipment and people on a large scale -- were detected at Kim Il Sung Square early this morning,” Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.South Korean and US intelligence agencies were “closely tracking the event”, they added.The parade is part of commemorations marking 75 years since the founding of Kim’s ruling party, an anniversary that comes during a difficult year for North Korea as the coronavirus pandemic and recent storms add pressure to the heavily sanctioned country. Pyongyang closed its borders eight months ago to try to protect itself from the virus, which first emerged in neighbouring China, and has yet to confirm a single case.Last month, troops from the North shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who had drifted into its waters, apparently as a precaution against the disease, prompting fury in Seoul and a rare apology from Kim.‘Big step forward’The North is widely believed to have continued to develop its arsenal -- which it says it needs to protect itself from a US invasion -- throughout nuclear negotiations with Washington, deadlocked since the collapse of a summit in Hanoi early last year.Analysts expected a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) or an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland to appear -- maybe even one with multiple re-entry vehicle capabilities that could allow it to evade US defence systems.The anniversary of the Workers’ Party means North Korea “has a political and strategic need to do something bigger”, said Sung-yoon Lee, a Korean studies professor at Tufts University in the United States.Showcasing its most advanced weapons “will signal a big step forward in Pyongyang’s credible threat capabilities”, he said.But unlike on many previous occasions, no international media were allowed in to watch the parade, and with many foreign embassies in Pyongyang closing their doors in the face of coronavirus restrictions, few outside observers were left in the city.Foreigners were not welcome at the anniversary commemorations, according to the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, which posted a message from the authorities on its Facebook page urging diplomats and other international representatives not to “approach or take photos” of the venues.State broadcaster KCTV did not show any early-morning parade live, and had not carried footage of it by mid-afternoon.But specialist service NK News cited multiple sources saying they had heard sounds of aircraft flying by, drones and heavy machinery during the early hours of Saturday morning.The North has usually held its parades in the morning and generally streams them in real time or near-live, although the last two, both in 2018, were shown either later that day or the next morning.Former US government North Korea analyst Rachel Lee cautioned against interpreting the decision not broadcast it live “without knowing what was said and shown during the parade”.Masks and missiles?At the end of December, Kim threatened to demonstrate a “new strategic weapon”, but analysts say Pyongyang will still tread carefully to avoid jeopardising its chances with Washington ahead of next month’s presidential election.Showing off its strategic weapons in a military parade “would be consistent with what Kim Jong Un promised”, said analyst Lee, while “not provoking the United States as much as a test-launch of a strategic weapon”.But Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest warned that if thousands of people were involved, it could turn into a “deadly superspreader-like event” unless “extreme precautions” were used.The impoverished nation’s crumbling health system would struggle to cope with a major virus outbreak, and he added that such protective measures seemed “pretty unlikely”.“Clearly, masks and missiles don’t mix.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-north-korea-military-parade-reports-say-pyonyang-held-giant-military-parade-flaunted-advanced-weapons/story-qfAqHSp082T12pjAwmZ5bM.html

But when it does, workers can chose to work from home permanently with their manager’s approval, although they will have to give up their office space.“The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged all of us to think, live and work in new ways,” human resources head Kathleen Hogan said in a note to employees obtained by The Verge.“We will offer as much flexibility as possible to support individual work styles, while balancing business needs and ensuring we live our culture.”In a public blog post later in the day, Hogan said the company views employees spending less than 50 percent of their time working from home as “standard,” but wasn’t abandoning office work entirely.“We are not committing to having every employee work from anywhere, as we believe there is value in employees being together in the workplace,” Hogan wrote.The Verge reported some employees won’t be eligible for remote-work arrangements, such as those who work in Microsoft’s labs or train other employees. In its memo, the company co-founded by Bill Gates said it is possible for its workers to relocate across the United States or perhaps overseas, The Verge said.Those that relocate may see their salaries change depending on where they go, and while the company will cover expenses for employees’ home offices, it won’t cover relocation expenses.As of the end of June, Microsoft employed 163,000 people, 96,000 of them in the US, according to a securities filing.Some major tech firms have already allowed permanent work-from-home arrangements including Facebook, whose boss Mark Zuckerberg said half of the social network’s staff could be permanently working remotely within five to 10 years.cs/ft||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-to-let-employees-work-from-home-permanently-report/story-qmQO4oRvj8Fz6JY1Xvd4cL.html

The purpose of the exercise was “to boost their tactical capability”, the ministry said in a statement, without giving more details on the geographical location of the drills. The three vessels will stop at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam over the weekend to replenish supplies, the statement said.The ministry could not be immediately reached for further comment.Nearly all of the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea are claimed by China, which has established military outposts on artificial islands in the area. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the sea.The United States has accused China of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to exploit the area’s extensive oil and gas reserves.China’s state-backed Global Times newspaper, noting the latest Japanese drills, said on Saturday that the frequent conducting of military activities in the South China Sea is not conducive to the security and stability of the area, and is firmly opposed by China.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army has always kept a high level of alert, defending China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests, said the newspaper, which is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party.The Global Times said Japanese warships had recently carried out activities in the South China Sea, with a helicopter aircraft carrier spotted on satellite on Sept. 5.On Friday, a Chinese military spokesperson said the U.S. destroyer John McCain had entered waters around the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea without China’s permission, and urged the United States to stop “such provocative actions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-begins-anti-submarine-exercise-in-south-china-sea-with-three-vessels/story-SnmuOecg8ddJb3edfro5LI.html
10-10-2020||World||Hit by Covid-19, thousands of mink dead in the United States||The United States is worst-hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak with over seven million cases. And now, there are reports that the disease has killed thousands of mink.According to CNN, ranchers in Utah and Wisconsin have lost almost 10,000 mink, the naimals known for their silky fur.A recent study done by researches at University of California (UCLA), numerous animals may be vulnerable to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.The study, published in Scientific Reports, reports evidence that 26 animals regularly in contact with people may be susceptible to infection. The researchers investigated how the spike protein from Sars-CoV-2 could interact with the ACE2 protein it attaches to when it infects people.Binding to the protein enables the virus to gain entry into host cells; while it is possible the virus might be able to infect animals via another pathway, it is unlikely based on current evidence that the virus could infect an animal if it cannot form a stable binding complex with ACE2.“The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to re-infect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms,” said lead author of the study, Professor Christine Orengo.CNN reported that reports of virus spreading in mink first appeared in August, after some farm workers fell ill. It quoted health experts in Utah as saying that the transmission happened from humans to animals.Similar cases have been reported from farms in other countries too. Denmark is culling around 1 million mink after finding further coronavirus infections among the animals at farms that breed them for their fur, authorities said.The Nordic country is the world’s largest producer of mink and had previously culled animals on farms hit by infections, but outbreaks have persisted.In May, Spain ordered the culling of all 93,000 mink at a farm to prevent human contagion after finding that most of the mink there were infected with the coronavirus.The Netherlands reported a similar outbreak and undertook a cull after two people were reported to have been infected by mink, though such cases of animal-to-human transmission are believed to be extremely rare.The UCLA study found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hit-by-covid-19-thousands-of-mink-dead-in-the-united-states/story-kh7yNb3XFaeSLuDKx2YxhP.html
10-10-2020||World||More restrictions, warnings to be imposed on misleading tweets: Twitter||Twitter Inc said on Friday it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the US election process or implementation of election results, including through violence, as the company also announced more restrictions to slow the spread of misinformation.Twitter said in a blog post that, from next week, users will get a prompt pointing them to credible information before they can retweet content that has been labeled as misleading. It said it would add more warnings and restrictions on tweets with misleading information labels from US political figures like candidates and campaigns, as well as US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers or that get “significant engagement.”Twitter, which recently told Reuters it was testing how to make its labeling more obvious and direct, said people will have to tap through warnings to see these tweets. Users can also only ‘quote tweet’ this content, as likes, retweets and replies will be turned off.Twitter says it has labeled thousands of misleading posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by US President Donald Trump. Twitter also said it would label tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate.The company announced several temporary steps to slow amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the US election week, global users pressing “retweet” will be directed first to the “quote tweet” button to encourage people to add their own commentary. It will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context, and will stop people seeing “liked by” recommendations from people they do not know in their timeline.Twitter’s decision to hit the brakes on automated recommendations contrasts with the approach at Facebook Inc , which is amping up promotion of its groups product despite concerns about extremism in those spaces.Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the Nov. 3 vote.Reuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud. On Wednesday, Facebook said it would ban calls for poll watching using “militarized language.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-restrictions-warnings-to-be-imposed-on-misleading-tweets-twitter/story-eBgQpRoK7z8OJQvH9s26BL.html
10-10-2020||World||US, AstraZeneca strike deal for Covid-19 antibody treatment touted by Trump||The US government has awarded $486 million to AstraZeneca Plc to develop and secure supplies of up to 100,000 doses of Covid-19 antibody treatment, a similar class of drug that was used in treating President Donald Trump.The agreement, under the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, is for developing a monoclonal antibody cocktail that can prevent Covid-19, especially in high-risk population like those over 80 years old, the US Department of Health and Human Services said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe treatment has come under the spotlight after Trump was treated with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ antibody drug last week. The president has also released a video on Twitter touting its benefits.In a call earlier on Friday, a top US health official said the government was expecting to provide more than 1 million free doses of antibody treatments to Covid-19 patients, similar to the one that was administered to Trump.Regeneron and Eli Lilly have both applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorizations of their antibody treatments. AstraZeneca said it was planning to supply up to 100,000 doses starting toward the end of 2020 and that the US government could acquire up to an additional one million doses in 2021 under a separate agreement.Regeneron signed a $450 million deal in July to sell Operation Warp Speed enough doses of its antibody treatment, REGN-COV2, to treat around 300,000 people.Eli Lilly said on Friday it had not signed an agreement with Operation Warp Speed. AstraZeneca plans to evaluate the treatment, AZD7442, which is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, in two studies. One trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the experimental treatment to prevent infection for up to 12 months in about 5,000 participants, while the second will evaluate post-exposure preventative and pre-emptive treatment in roughly 1,100 participants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-astrazeneca-strike-deal-for-covid-19-antibody-treatment-touted-by-trump/story-sfsEzmLy3TPlBcicL3JycO.html
10-10-2020||World||‘Willing to work together as long as Beijing is ready to resolve antagonisms’: Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen||Taiwan wants to have “meaningful dialogue” with China on an equal basis, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Saturday, extending an olive branch at a time of heightened military tension with Beijing, which claims the island as sovereign Chinese territory.Democratic Taiwan has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up air force activity near the island in the past few weeks, including crossing the Taiwan Strait’s sensitive mid line that normally serves as an unofficial buffer zone.China says it is responding to “collusion” between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the self-governed island. Beijing views this a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China. Speaking at National Day celebrations, Tsai described the situation in the Taiwan Strait as “quite tense.” This, along with disputes in the South China Sea, a China-India border conflict and China’s crackdown in Hong Kong, showed democracy and peace in the region were facing big challenges, she said.If Beijing can heed Taiwan’s voice and jointly facilitate reconciliation and peaceful dialogue, regional tension can surely be resolved, she added.“As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations, while parity and dignity are maintained, we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,” Tsai said.There was no immediate reaction from China, which cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016 after she first won office.Tsai said she was committed to maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait, but that this was the responsibility of both sides.Still, she has made strengthening Taiwan’s armed forces a priority, and said she would keep pushing this, upholding the principle of neither seeking war nor fearing it.“Our commitment to our sovereignty and democratic values will not change, but we will also maintain strategic flexibility and be responsive to changes,” she said, without elaborating.The United States has been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so they can become a “porcupine”, hard for China to attack. Washington, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/willing-to-work-together-as-long-as-beijing-is-ready-to-resolve-antagonisms-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen/story-y9ZQD8RUUBjNWMz60EGGbJ.html

It was a worldwide record reported by the world’s top health body. The confirmed daily high of 350,766 cases surpasses by nearly 12,000 a record set earlier this week. The total number Covid-19 infection has now reached to 36,785,758, as per the figures published by the John Hopkins University. While more than a million others have succumbed to the disease.In a recently held conference by the WHO’s emergencies chief, Dr Michael Ryan said that according to the world body’s “best estimates”, one in 10 people worldwide may have been infected from Covid-19.While the United States still remains the worst-hit country, Europe added more than 109,000 cases alone to the daily high of Friday.Here is the list of top five countries worst-affected by the Covid-19:US-7,660,123More than 7.6 million people in the United States have been infected with the deadly Covid-19, including the country’s President Donald Trump. Among the worst affected regions of the US is the Midwestern side where weather is the coldest. As the country is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 several states have been registering a record number of daily cases, prompting authorities to impose various restrictions to curb the spread.India- 6,906,151 India is the second country to be badly hit by the spread of the coronavirus disease. It is recording more than 70,00 new cases daily for the past few days. Before this, the number of daily cases used to hover around 90,000. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat are some of the states which are reporting the major chunk of the total tally.Brazil- 5,055,888 While the number of daily infections and fatalities have gone down, Brazil is still among the top five worst affected nations. The country surpassed the 5 million mark on Wednesday night and is verging on 150,000 deaths, according to the tally from Johns Hopkins University.At its height, Brazil was registering more than 45,000 cases and 1,000 deaths per day. Now, the numbers have dropped to about 27,000 cases and 700 deaths daily.Russia- 1,265,572 Among the list of countries witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 infection, Russia posted a record number of new Covid-19 cases on Friday. There were 12,126 new cases in the past day, breaking the previous record of 11,656 on May 11, according to data from the government’s National Virus Response Center.The resurgence in infections has come after schools reopened September 1.Colombia-894,300 Fifth country to be on the list of nations with the highest number of cases, Colombia has more than 8.9 million cases while over 27,400 others have succumbed to the disease.The country removed curbing measures and resumed economic activities with safety protocols earlier in September. However, restrictions on events and large crowds still continue.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-five-countries-with-highest-number-of-covid-19-infections/story-ULo2YkhXUolXbwxlEY9s9L.html

The tide’s begun to turn. And the United States under President Trump’s leadership has now built out a coalition that will push back against the threat,” he said.Following the Tokyo meeting, Pompeo will travel shortly to New Delhi with Defense Secretary Mark Esper for annual talks with their Indian counterparts.Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun will also travel to India next week to prepare the meeting, the State Department said.Tensions have soared between India and China since violent hand-to-hand fighting in the Himalayan region of Ladakh in June that left 20 Indian troops dead.China has acknowledged suffering casualties but has not revealed any figures.Citing national security grounds, New Delhi has since banned dozens of Chinese apps including TikTok, the blockbuster video-sharing platform which had counted on India as its largest overseas market.Despite wide concerns about China, India has historically shied away from formal alliances with outside powers under its doctrine of “strategic autonomy.”Asked at the conservative Heritage Foundation about tensions with China, India’s ambassador to the United States, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, stressed that the Asian powers had historic linkages and welcomed each other’s scholars.US-India ties have been rapidly growing and “this relationship has a much wider perspective than simply China,” Sandhu said.But he said he expected India and the United States to discuss boosting defense ties during the visit by Pompeo and Esper.“I would underline that there is a great further potential for our defense cooperation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tide-s-begun-to-turn-pompeo-says-us-india-partners-in-fight-against-china/story-qjKoSrOYSk283MqrC2RzcJ.html

The ceasefire begins at 12 p.m. Lavrov, who mediated the negotiations in Moscow, announced the ceasefire at 3 a.m.(midnight GMT) after 10 hours of talks with his Armenian and Azeri counterparts. He also said Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to start talks on the settlement of the conflict.Russia’s top diplomat added that International Red Cross Committee would act as an intermediary in the humanitarian operation.He did not provide details on the talks but said the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Minsk Group would mediate.Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azeri counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov did not speak to reporters.The mountain enclave belongs to Azerbaijan under international law but broke away in a war as the Soviet Union collapsed and is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.The renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.The clashes have also increased concern about the security of pipelines that carry Azeri oil and gas to Europe.The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000 people and ended with a ceasefire that has been violated repeatedly.Azerbaijan said on Friday that 31 Azeri civilians had been killed and 168 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed information about military casualties. Nagorno-Karabakh said 376 of its military personnel and 22 civilians had been killed since the beginning of the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-and-azerbaijan-agree-to-ceasefire-says-russia-s-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov/story-uQoYahAgiPf6FXCc2D1MKO.html
10-10-2020||World||Pakistan has no extradition treaty with US, says Supreme Court||Pakistan has no actual extradition treaty with the US, the country’s Supreme Court said on Friday while hearing a case of an American national of Pakistani origin accused of planning a bomb attack in New York in 2016. A three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Mushir Alam, challenged the extradition of Talha Haroon to the US till a final decision in the case. The Additional Attorney General told the court that there was an extradition treaty between Pakistan and the US, asserting that America had extradited two suspects, Farid Tawakal and Farooq Tawakal, to Pakistan in 2008, The Express Tribune reported. An official from the foreign affairs ministry said Pakistan had adopted a bilateral agreement signed between the US and the UK in 1932. Justice Qazi Amin inquired if Pakistan had unilaterally adopted the agreement. “It is not correct to say that all states are equal,” he added. The judge noted that the court had to see if there was any legal justification for the extradition of the accused to the US. “There is virtually no extradition treaty with the US,” he said. In response, the Additional Attorney General said that there was an agreement through which the accused were exchanged. He said that Haroon was accused of plotting an attack while living in the US. “Talha Haroon is also a US citizen,” he said, adding that the suspect was arrested in 2016. Justice Munib noted that the agreement that was being pointed out was a pre-partition one. Justice Amin asked how could a pre-partition agreement be a binding on Pakistan, and told the Additional Attorney General if the agreement he was showing included the crime of terrorism. The counsel for the accused said that Pakistan enacted a law in 1972 to extradite the accused. Justice Munib said that according to the documents it was unclear that the accused was in America at the time of the attack. He said Haroon was accused of funding, not terrorism. He asked the Foreign Office officials to be fully prepared at the next hearing. The counsel for the Haroon said his client had been in jail for four and a half years and should be granted bail. The apex court rejected the plea bail of the accused. It also extended the stay order on Haroon’s extradition to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-no-extradition-treaty-with-us-says-supreme-court/story-gYxtKtW4tr7SzyS8P6uNXK.html
10-10-2020||World||Hambantota port: Sri Lankan prez rejects concerns of getting caught in Chinese ‘debt trap’||President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday rejected concerns that China has lured Sri Lanka into a “debt trap” by financing the strategic southern port of and said the project has a vast potential for generating income and employment opportunities.Rajapaksa said this after holding talks with a high-powered Chinese delegation led by ruling Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi.Yang, China’s former foreign minister, is the first top ranking Chinese official to travel to the South Asian region since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.The visit comes amid the island nation struggling to boost its foreign reserves after its economy was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.During the high-level talks, the two sides agreed to resume talks on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and expedite work on the proposed Hambantota industrial zone.Yang also assured that China will firmly stand with Sri Lanka to protect its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity at international fora, including the UN Human Rights Council and continue to assist the country in its development activities.Rajapaksa expressed satisfaction over the current state of Sino-Sri Lanka relations and said China has been a long-standing friend who supported Sri Lanka irrespective of the government in power.“China extensively supported us to defeat terrorism. Bilateral relations reached a higher level following the end of the armed conflict,” he said, referring to the nearly 30-year bloody conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which was fighting for a separate homeland in Northeastern Sri Lanka.“China contributed to a number of large-scale infrastructure development projects. Hambantota Port, the Port City project, Southern Expressway are some of them,” he said.Rajapaksa said that constructing a port in Hambantota was an idea of Sri Lanka and not China’s.“We were convinced that it would be a project with a vast potential for generating income and employment opportunities. China offered to fund it. Many geo-political analysis interprets this project as a ‘debt trap’ set up by China to gain control over Sri Lankan affairs. I want to prove that it is not the case and that this large-scale project will help improve the living standards of the people,” the president said.China is one of the biggest investors in various infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. But there has been criticism, both locally and internationally, and growing concerns that China has lured Sri Lanka into a debt trap.The previous Maithripala Sirisena government handed over Hambantota port to a state-run Chinese firm in 2017 for a 99 years’ lease as a debt swap amounting to USD 1.2 billion.The Chinese delegation’s visit assumes significance as Sri Lanka is expecting to receive the second tranche of a USD 1.2 billion syndicated Chinese loan. The island nation received the first trance of USD 500 million in March.The Sri Lankan government had said that the anticipated Panda (Chinese) bonds and the syndicated Chinese loan will strengthen the country’s balance of payments in the backdrop of the country’s credit rating downgrade by Moody’s last week.Credit ratings agency Moody’s downgraded Lanka’s sovereign credit rating by two notches, saying the South Asian nation would be hard-pressed to secure funding to service its huge foreign debt.Sri Lanka was pushed down from “B2” (high credit risk) to “Caa1” (very high credit risk), as the coronavirus pandemic compounded the economic woes of the country.Sri Lanka’s economy, especially the tourism sector, has been hit hard since last year - initially by the Easter Sunday attacks, which killed over 250 people and later by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hambantota-port-sri-lankan-prez-rejects-concerns-of-getting-caught-in-chinese-debt-trap/story-ODvP2H3zj5HpGH2j9RLS9M.html
10-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un set to show off nuclear advances in message to Trump||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is expected to hold his biggest military parade in at least two years and show off a nuclear arsenal that poses one of the most daunting security challenges for the winner of the U.S. presidential election.The event -- part of festivities Saturday to mark the 75th anniversary the Workers’ Party of Korea -- could showcase the “new strategic weapon” Kim pledged to unveil at the start of the year. Any missiles designed to hit American targets would underscore how North Korea remains a nuclear threat to the U.S. as President Donald Trump prepares to defend his record against Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the presidential election.South Korean Defense Minister Suh Wook told parliament Wednesday in Seoul that Pyongyang was preparing for a “military show of force involving its strategic weapons.” While satellite imagery has showed North Korea mustering troops and equipment for months for a big parade, when the event will happen and how much of the secretive state will choose to share with the outside world remains unclear.Here are five things to watch:1. Newer, Better ICBMOne of the most alarming items North Korea might roll out is an intercontinental ballistic missile that features solid-fuel technology. Such a weapon would be quicker to launch than Kim’s current liquid-fuel models -- giving the U.S. less time to destroy it on the pad or prepare to intercept it in the air.Although North Korea hasn’t fired off an ICBM since November 2017, it last year conducted a long-burn test of a new engine and debuted an assortment of shorter-range, solid-fueled rockets. The tips of the missile may also show whether Kim has developed the capability to put multiple warheads on a single rocket. Such achievements would deal the biggest blow yet to Trump’s assertion that his unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 had made sure North Korea was “no longer a nuclear threat.”Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said North Korea has often unveiled strategic weapons systems on big ruling party milestones. “The 75th anniversary this weekend may be an opportune time for North Korea to reveal a new ICBM,” he said.2. Missile TrucksOne of the least flashy but most crucial parts of North Korea’s nuclear program are transporter erector launchers, or TELs. These are mobile launchpads that can be hidden in places like caves and under bridges and deployed quickly in an attack.With enough TELs, North Korea can demonstrate its ability to launch a first strike and still have enough in reserve for a second volley. Kim has tried to build more TELs at home and break his long reliance on truck imports from places like China. The more axles North Korea can put on a TEL, the bigger missiles it can launch. The more trucks it has with tank tracks, the more places it can send them.3. Submarine MissilesNorth Korea has also been developing a new missile designed to be launched from a submarine, a necessary step to making Kim’s fleet a credible nuclear threat. A year ago, it launched a solid-fuel Pukguksong-3 missile from an underwater platform, demonstrating an estimated maximum range of about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles).This is the most-advanced solid-fuel missile that Kim’s regime has launched and if the Pukguksong-3 rolls by an a TEL, it would represent a new strategic weapon that could deliver a nuclear warhead to all of South Korea and most of Japan.4. Diplomatic MessagingWhile such parades are chiefly intended to stoke national pride and reaffirm support for the Kim regime, they can also provide a platform to send diplomatic messages his adversaries. Kim may give a speech, or leave the bombastic rhetoric to his generals or state-run media.Such statements will be watched for direct threats to Japan, South Korea and, of course, the U.S. North Korea has in recent months indicated that Kim expects more from Washington than a good relationship with Trump, and right before the U.S. election would be a good time to drive that home. Kim has been pushing for a nuclear deal that would get him relief from international sanctions without giving up too much of his weapons program.5. Expanding ArsenalThe parade may also show of Kim’s growing arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles. The regime has test-launched more than 30 of them since 2019. These include the nuclear-capable, hypersonic KN-23 that can strike all of South Korea -- including U.S. forces stationed south of Seoul -- within two minutes. He has also launched KN-25 short-range missiles designed to be fired in rapid succession from a single launcher and overwhelm interceptors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-set-to-show-off-nuclear-advances-in-message-to-trump/story-KwBIMuUquNT4YPHnbFOByM.html
10-10-2020||World||White House ups coronavirus aid offer, resumes talks with Nancy Pelosi||The White House is boosting its offer in up-and-down Covid-19 aid talks Friday in hopes of an agreement before Election Day, even as President Donald Trump’s most powerful GOP ally in the Senate said Congress is unlikely to deliver relief by then.Trump on Friday took to Twitter to declare: “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!” A top economic adviser said the Trump team was upping its offer in advance of a Friday conversation between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two spoke for more than 30 minutes Friday afternoon, said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill.Also Read: White House increases fiscal-stimulus offer to $1.8 trillionA GOP aide familiar with the new offer said it is about $1.8 trillion, with a key state and local fiscal relief component moving from $250 billion to at least $300 billion. The White House says its most recent prior offer was about $1.6 trillion. The aide requested anonymity because the negotiations are private.“I would like to see a bigger stimulus package than either the Democrats or Republicans are offering,” Trump said on Rush Limbaugh’s radio show Friday. Earlier this week, Trump lambasted Democrats for their demands on an aid bill.Pelosi’s most recent public offer was about $2.2 trillion, though that included a business tax increase that Republicans won’t go for.But GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told an audience in Kentucky that he doesn’t see a deal coming together soon out of a “murky” situation in which the participants in the negotiations are elbowing for political advantage.“I’d like to see us rise above that like we did in March and April but I think it’s unlikely in the next three weeks,” McConnell said. McConnell said later that “the first item of priority of the Senate is the Supreme Court,” suggesting there isn’t time to both process a Covid relief bill and the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett before the election.He spoke after Trump apparently performed an about-face, empowering Mnuchin to resume negotiations with Pelosi, D-Calif., on a larger, comprehensive coronavirus relief package despite calling off the talks just days before.Also Read: Dems move bill seeking removal of Trump’s powers on medical groundsWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday that “developments are positive” and that “the bid and the offer have narrowed” in advance of a the telephone conversation later Friday between Pelosi and Mnuchin.McConnell remains a skeptic that a deal can come together — and he has issued private warnings that many Senate Republicans will oppose a deal in the range that Pelosi is seeking.“We do need another rescue package,” McConnell said. “But the proximity to the election and the differences about what is need at this particular juncture are pretty vast.”Later Friday, during an appearance in Tompkinsville, Kentucky, McConnell said, “I don’t know whether we’ll get another (virus relief) package or not.”McConnell’s remarks capped a tumultuous week in which Trump sent conflicting signals and made unworkable demands. On Tuesday, he ordered an end to the weekslong talks after being told that few Republicans in Congress would end up voting for a possible Pelosi-Mnuchin deal.After taking blowback for that decision, Trump sought to revive the negotiations Thursday. Yet even as Mnuchin was reengaging with Pelosi, staffers in the White House — working under chief of staff Mark Meadows, a key negotiator — were issuing demands for a smaller package stuffed with Trump’s priorities.All this comes as Trump is sliding in the polls and is sidelined by his Covid-19 infection. The White House is short-staffed and dealing with infections among its employees. And the president and Pelosi are attacking each other’s mental health.That the talks were headed nowhere was an open secret among close observers in Washington, but both sides had been reluctant to declare them dead until Trump did so Tuesday, making himself a magnet for blame. The talks are still unlikely to produce results in the near term because even if there was a breakthrough, it could take weeks to process.McConnell says he is open to resuming the negotiations in a post-election lame-duck session, but that prospect is murky as well, depending on the results.On Friday, Pelosi issued a downbeat assessment in a letter to her colleagues but expressed some optimism in an appearance on MSNBC.“I do hope that we’ll have an agreement soon,” Pelosi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-ups-coronavirus-aid-offer-resumes-talks-with-nancy-pelosi/story-kIU3qGDT6RvKNysKTwHduO.html
10-10-2020||World||‘No new answers’, says WHO as Covid-19 continues to surge across world||The World Health Organization has announced a new daily record high in coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide, with more than 350,000 infections reported to the UN health agency on Friday.The new daily high of 350,766 cases surpasses a record set earlier this week by nearly 12,000. That tally includes more than 109,000 cases from Europe alone.In a press briefing on Friday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan acknowledged that even as Covid-19 continues to surge across the world, “there are no new answers.”He said that although the agency wants countries to avoid the punishing lockdowns that have devastated economies, governments must ensure the most vulnerable people are protected and numerous measures must be taken.“The majority of people in the world are still susceptible to this disease,” Ryan warned. He said countries should focus not just on restrictive measures, but also on bolstering their surveillance systems, testing, contact tracing and ensuring populations are engaged.As the virus continues to surge across Europe and elsewhere, Ryan acknowledged that restrictive measures might be warranted at some point. British scientists reported this week that the Covid-19 outbreak is doubling every few weeks, French hospitals are running out of ICU beds, Germany may enlist the army to help contain its outbreak and Spain declared a state of emergency in Madrid as coronavirus cases soar.Ryan said lockdowns “may be unavoidable where the disease has got out of control again, but we shouldn’t accept that in every country, the return of cases should be seen with an immediate return of the need for lockdown restrictions.”Globally, more than 36 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported, including more than 1 million deaths.Experts say the tally far underestimates the real number of cases and Ryan said on Monday that the WHO’s “best estimates” were that one in 10 people worldwide — or roughly 760 million people — may have been infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-global-cases-hit-daily-record-trump-backs-big-aid/story-2Egalwt6eL3wFjrL0DOFML.html
10-10-2020||World||Police defend arrests of slain Black teen’s family||Police on Friday defended the arrests of family members of a Black teen killed by a suburban Milwaukee officer, saying they were driving recklessly during a protest and refused officers’ demands to leave their vehicles.Alvin Cole’s mother, Tracy Cole, and his sisters, Taleavia and Tristiana Cole, were arrested Thursday night during the demonstration in downtown Wauwatosa, their attorney, Kimberley Motley, said.Demonstrators have gathered in Wauwatosa for two straight nights to protest prosecutors’ decision not to charge Officer Joseph Mensah in the 17-year-old’s death. Mensah, who is Black, shot Cole after a foot chase outside a Wauwatosa mall in February.Motley said Friday that Tracy Cole, 48, was treated at a hospital for injuries on her arm and forehead. She initially complained that her arm might be broken, but Motley clarified during a news conference Friday that it was not. Tristiana Cole was also hospitalized but authorities have not said why. Motley tweeted that both were later released.Motley said the family was protesting peacefully and police dragged them from their vehicles and arrested them for no reason. No family members have been cited or charged, she said.“We all deserve better,” she said. “And we’re entitled to better under the law of the United States.”Wauwatosa police said officers encountered a group of vehicles after the 7 p.m. curfew. The vehicles were traveling across all lanes of traffic and officers used spike strips to stop them and protect other drivers, the police said in a Friday statement. Most of the people in the cars were arrested without incident but some refused to get out and were forcibly removed from their vehicles, police said.Police later said the Cole family was among those arrested and that Tracy and Tristiana Cole reported “minor injuries” and were taken to a hospital. The police did not offer any details on their injuries.Motley said in a text to The Associated Press that the police account is untrue and is a “pathetic attempt to justify the abuse and unlawful arrest of members of the Cole family.” If the police version of events was true, she said, the family would have been cited or charged.“Since when do people get dragged and beaten up for a traffic violation,” she said in the text. “This is America. Shame on them.”The police statement said investigators were reviewing the incident and that citations and charges would follow.Cole was the third person Mensah has killed on the job since he became a Wauwatosa officer in 2015. He shot Antonio Gonzales in 2015 after police said Gonzales refused to drop a sword. A year later, Mensah shot Jay Anderson Jr. in a car parked in a park after hours. Mensah said he saw a gun on the passenger seat and thought Anderson was reaching for it. He was cleared of wrongdoing in each case.The city’s police commission suspended Mensah in July and asked former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic to review the Cole case with an eye toward possible discipline. Biskupic’s report Wednesday recommended Mensah be fired, saying the risk of a fourth shooting is too great.Hours later Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, who is white, cleared Mensah of any criminal wrongdoing in Cole’s death. Chisholm’s report noted that officers said Cole pointed a gun at officers and refused to drop it. Chisholm said Mensah could successfully argue he fired in self-defense.Motley has vowed to file a civil rights lawsuit against Mensah.The protests in Wauwatosa are just the latest in a series of demonstrations against police racism and brutality that have erupted across the country since George Floyd’s death. Floyd, who was Black, died in May after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd gasped that he couldn’t breathe.The mostly peaceful protests in Wauwatosa have turned violent at times, with demonstrators breaking windows and looting at least one store, and National Guard troops patrolling the city. Public pressure has mounted on the Wauwatosa police commission to fire Mensah quickly.“Helicopters are circling above us, the National Guard is deployed on our streets, a curfew is preventing us from walking outside in our own yards, businesses are boarded up, there’s broken glass on our streets, families are marching and mourning the loss of their loved ones, police officers are at risk and none of us know what tomorrow will bring,” Milwaukee County Supervisor Shawn Rolland, who represents parts of Wauwatosa, said in a statement. “If this commission can accelerate its deliberative work, our people, businesses and neighborhoods can begin to heal faster.”A decision on discipline isn’t expected until at least November.A Facebook livestream that captured only audio of Tracy Cole was made by a third daughter. She could be heard screaming in pain as she was being arrested, saying police injured her arm, hit her in the head and used a stun gun on her.“I’m Mrs. Cole, Alvin’s mother,” she screamed repeatedly as officers pulled her out of her car.“I can’t believe y’all did this to me. Y’all killed my son,” she yelled at the officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-defend-arrests-of-slain-black-teen-s-family/story-Qsjp3TPoEQLSx2mcHg0K9N.html
10-10-2020||World||Hurricane Delta makes landfall in southwestern Louisiana||Hurricane Delta crashed onshore Friday in southwestern Louisiana as a Category 2 storm, compounding misery along a path of destruction left by Hurricane Laura only six weeks earlier.The center of the hurricane made landfall about 6 p.m. near the town of Creole with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph), pushing a storm surge that could reach up to 11 feet (3.4 meters), the National Hurricane Center said.As the 10th named storm to strike the continental US this year, Delta’s arrival snapped a century-old record.People in south Louisiana steeled themselves as Delta delivered driving rain, powerful winds and rising water to a part of the state still recovering from a deadly catastrophic hurricane six weeks ago. Power outages in Louisiana and neighbouring Texas soared past 203,000 homes and businesses Friday shortly after the storm came ashore, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.The Hurricane Center said wind gusts in Lake Arthur, Louisiana, reached 96 mph (154 kph) as Delta made landfall. Storm surge reached 8 feet (2.4 meters) east of Cameron, a sparely populated coastal community devastated by 2005′s Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike in 2008.Also read | ‘It’s a madhouse!’: Tourists pile into Cancun airport after hurricane hitsIn the city of Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta made landfall, rain pelted the tarp-covered roofs of buildings that Hurricane Laura battered when it barreled through in late August and killed at least 27 people in the state.“It’s devastating and it’s emotional for the citizenry,” Mayor Nic Hunter said as he prepared to ride out the storm in downtown Lake Charles.Winds picked up Friday evening in inland areas such as Lafayette, where occasionally strong gusts buffeted trees and sheets of rain were falling. Many parishes and towns implemented curfews Friday until Saturday morning to encourage people to stay off the roads during the worst of the storm.Dawn Trosclair checked into a hotel Friday, worried about trees falling on her home in Lafayette.“No other storm really threatened us,” Trosclair said as she watched the gusting winds. “Laura was far enough away and the winds were going to be mild enough here where we didn’t leave.”Laura damaged about 95% of the homes and buildings in Lake Charles, while up to 8,000 residents — 10% of the population — remain displaced, the mayor said. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other leftover debris lined the city’s largely vacant streets Friday, arousing concern they could cause more damage and deaths when the new storm strikes.“We just got lights back on like two weeks ago and then evacuating again? It’s extremely hard,” said Roslyn Kennedy. She was among a handful of evacuees at the Burton Coliseum in Lake Charles, waiting to be transported, again, to safer destinations.Delta was the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season and became the first Greek-alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental US As the 10th named storm to hit the continental US this year, it surpassed a record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.As the fourth hurricane or tropical storm to hit Louisiana in a year, Delta also tied a 2002 record, Klotzbach said.The storm triggered hurricane warnings stretching from High Island, Texas, to Morgan City, Louisiana.Earlier Friday, it had sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph), putting it at Category 3 strength. Though the storm weakened as it approached land, officials cautioned that it remained dangerous.“The fact that it’s weakening should not cause anyone to lose focus or lose vigilance, because this is still a very strong storm,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said during a news conference.Some residents were staying put, despite the danger. Ernest Jack remained in his Lake Charles house, one of those with a blue-tarped roof. He had gathered food, plenty of water and had covered his windows to protect against flying debris during Delta.“I just didn’t want to leave. I stayed during Hurricane Laura, too. I just put it in the Lord’s hands,” Jack said, pointing skyward.Delta, the latest in a recent flurry of rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricanes that scientists largely blame on global warming, appeared destined to set records at landfall.Concern wasn’t limited to the Lake Charles and Cameron Parish areas, where Laura came ashore in late August. Further east, in Acadiana region towns like New Iberia and Abbeville, people took the storm seriously.“You can always get another house, another car, but not another life,” said Hilton Stroder as he and his wife, Terry, boarded up their Abbeville home Thursday night with plans to head to their son’s house further east.This week marked the sixth time of the current season that Louisiana has been threatened by tropical storms or hurricanes. One, Tropical Storm Marco, fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip, and others veered elsewhere, but Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.New Orleans, to the east, was expected to escape Delta’s worst. But tropical storm-force winds were still likely in the city Friday, and local officials said they were preparing for the possibility of tornadoes.In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency, as did his counterpart Edwards in Louisiana. Forecasters said southern Mississippi could see heavy rain and flash flooding.The hurricane was expected to weaken rapidly over land. Forecasters predicted Delta would be downgraded to a tropical storm late Friday. The storm’s projected path showed it moving into northern Mississippi on Saturday and then into the Tennessee Valley as a tropical depression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-delta-makes-landfall-in-southwestern-louisiana/story-6aWGmTdxkOifgmkQE3UB0L.html

10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump to hold first rally since Covid-19 illness in Florida on Monday||US President Donald Trump will give a public speech at the White House on Saturday for the first time since testing positive for Covid-19, and will also hold a Florida rally next week in an attempt to relaunch his stumbling reelection campaign with only 25 days to go.Knocked off the campaign trail by his hospitalization for three nights last week, the president is in the midst of a frenetic bid to catch up with surging Democratic challenger Joe Biden.On Friday, during an extended media blitz, he falsely claimed that Covid-19 now has a cure.He also revealed that he’d been told he was near death at the worst of his bout with the virus, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans and severely dented his chances of winning a second term on November 3.Saturday’s speech, which a senior administration official said would be on Trump’s favored theme of “law and order,” will give him a chance to dispel lingering doubts about his health. The crowd will be on the South Lawn of the White House, while the president will stand up on the balcony, the official said, confirming US media reports.And on Monday, Trump will take another big step by holding a rally in Sanford, in the crucial electoral state of Florida, his campaign said.The events come despite continued questions over how sick Trump was last week and how complete his recovery is now, with White House officials refusing to answer basic queries including the date on which the president first contracted the virus and whether he has tested negative since.- ‘Better than a vaccine’ -On Friday, Trump gave a marathon interview to right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh in which he said the experimental Regeneron antibody cocktail that he took as part of therapeutic treatment was “a cure.”It’s “a total game changer” and “better than a vaccine,” he said.In fact, there is no cure and still no approved vaccine for the coronavirus.Trump repeatedly asserted that he feels fine and he has been backed up by statements from the presidential physician, Sean Conley.But in his Limbaugh interview, Trump suggested for the first time that he had been close to death, had it not been for the therapeutic drugs.“I’m talking to you today because of it. I could have been a bad victim,” he said, referring to friends of his who had died from Covid-19.Trump said that doctors told him afterward, “you were going into a very bad phase.” “You know what that means,” said the president.According to Conley, Trump is now fit for a “safe return to public engagement” from Saturday.- Battle for attention -Trump has tried to fill the gap left by his enforced absence from the campaign trail by making back-to-back appearances on friendly media outlets.He twice spoke at length on Fox on Thursday and was due back on Fox’s Tucker Carlson Tonight show late Friday, appearing from the White House where he was to undergo what the network described as an on-air “medical evaluation,” conducted remotely by Fox contributor Doctor Marc Siegel.Biden, however, is already picking up the pace of travel, with a stop in Nevada on Friday after going to Arizona on Thursday.Polls show Biden leads heavily in key demographics including women and the elderly, prompting analysts to talk increasingly of a possible landslide victory.Trump’s biggest liability -- overwhelming public dissatisfaction over his handling of the coronavirus crisis -- has returned as the headline issue of the campaign thanks to the president’s own infection.Adding to the pressure, congressional Democrats who control the House of Representatives unveiled plans for a commission to investigate a president’s physical and mental fitness for the job -- a move clearly meant to jab at Trump.The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said it was time to examine Trump’s “disassociation from reality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-hold-first-rally-since-covid-illness-in-florida-on-monday/story-WvhWkyGS4ZM5aPqo4l1u2L.html
10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump says experimental drugs may have saved him from coronavirus attack||President Donald Trump said Friday he could have become very ill and might not have recovered from Covid-19 without experimental drugs, a far worse outlook than what his doctors were telling the American people.“I was asking the doctors today ... and I said, ‘How bad was I?’ They said: ‘You could have been very bad. You were going into a very bad phase,’“ Trump told Rush Limbaugh during his radio show.“It looked like it was going to be a big deal and you know what that means, right? That means bad because I’ve lost five people,” Trump added, referring to acquaintances who have died.Trump said that after contracting the virus, he was “not in the greatest of shape.” He added that “I might not have recovered at all” without treatment with experimental drugs.Trump’s comments on the seriousness of his case of coronavirus contrast with generally upbeat public statements about his condition that his doctors released after his diagnosis and while he was hospitalized.The White House said Trump’s hospitalization at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which began October 2, was precautionary and his symptoms were mild.On October 3, Trump’s physician gave a televised briefing and painted a sunny picture of the president’s situation, emphasizing that he was still working, walking on his own and not laboring to breathe. But Dr. Sean Conley notably refused to provide some specific details, including repeatedly sidestepping questions about whether the president had at any point received supplemental oxygen. It was later learned that Trump had received oxygen before he was taken to Walter Reed.Trump’s comments tracked most closely with an update provided by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after his hospitalization. Meadows offered few details, but said the president’s initial situation had been “very concerning” and, though his health was improving, the following 48 hours would be critical.Trump credited his recovery to an experimental antibody drug made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. “It was primarily this one drug,” Trump said. “It just wiped out the virus. It wiped it out.”The drug is not a cure, but experimental antibody treatments like the one Trump was given are among the most promising therapies being tested for treating and preventing coronavirus infections. The antibody drugs, which aim to help the immune system clear the virus, are still in testing. Their safety and effectiveness are not yet known and there is no way for the president or his doctors to know whether the drug had any effect in his case.Trump is among fewer than 10 people who have been able to access the drug under “compassionate use” rules without enrolling in a study. He said he is “bugging” the Food and Drug Administration to quickly authorize emergency use of the drugs more broadly.Trump said that if the antibody drugs made by Regeneron as well as Eli Lilly succeed in clinical trials, they would constitute a “cure.”“It’s a cure and I’m talking to you today because of it,” Trump said. “And, you know, because I think I could have been a ... bad victim. I fit certain categories that aren’t so great. ... I’m telling you this is a total game-changer.”The White House did not respond to questions regarding the discrepancies between Trump’s account of his condition and the weekend updates given by his doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-experimental-drugs-may-have-saved-him-from-coronavirus-attack/story-KFVjLTeRHlVaX4MJd2kbEK.html
10-10-2020||World||Anthony Fauci calls Donald Trump’s White House ceremony a ‘super-spreader event’||Anthony Fauci, the US’s top infectious-disease expert, said that a gathering in the White House Rose Garden last month was a “super-spreader event” for the novel coronavirus.President Donald Trump held a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden on Sept. 26 to honor Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. While the White House had a testing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and attendees mingled and sat in close proximity to one another both indoors and outdoors.Subsequently, the president and several top staffers, as well as senators and military officials, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.“The data speak for themselves,” Fauci said in an interview Friday with CBS News Radio. “We had a super-spreader event in the White House. And it was in a situation where people were crowded together, were not wearing masks. So the data speaks for themselves.”Fauci said in the interview that people who are infected with the coronavirus but aren’t yet showing symptoms can transmit the pathogen to others, which makes the case for wearing face coverings.Asymptomatic individuals “are a substantial part of the people that actually transmit infections to other people,” Fauci said in the CBS interview. “So the better part of the recommendation would be everybody wear a mask, literally universally.”Trump was hospitalized last week after testing positive, and was given several experimental therapies, including Gilead Sciences Inc. antiviral remdesivir, the steroid dexamethasone and an antibody cocktail made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Trump said he intends to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Regeneron drug, which hasn’t yet been cleared in any form by US regulators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-calls-donald-trump-s-white-house-ceremony-a-super-spreader-event/story-A0fBMiZEvdO8WdBOqCpDyM.html
10-10-2020||World||Why won’t White House say when Trump last tested negative||It is a basic, crucial question and one the White House refuses to answer: When was President Donald Trump’s last negative test for the coronavirus before he tested positive last week?“Yeah, I’m not going to give you a detailed readout with timestamps every time the president’s tested,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters last weekend.“I can’t reveal that at this time,” echoed Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications. “Doctors would like to keep it private.”“I don’t want to go backwards,” said Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician.The answer could help fill in vital details about the course of the president’s illness as well as when he may have been contagious and whom else he may have exposed. And the White House refusal to answer makes it hard not to wonder what they’re hiding, given other details they’ve shared.“At this point it’s just so strange that they’re unwilling to give us the information,” said Michael Joseph Mina, a physician and professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s school of public health. “It makes people start thinking things like, ‘Was the president the super-spreader?’... If there was no nefarious activity going on, then they should have no problem answering this question.”The information is also key to tracking who else may have been exposed to the virus so their contacts can be traced to prevent new clusters of infection.“Then you can get an idea, potentially, of when he was infected, how long his incubation period was, and also then evaluate who may have been exposed to him over that time frame,” said Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the clinical virology laboratory at Stanford Health Care. While there is considerable variability between cases, he said, Trump was most likely infectious several days before he tested positive — a period during which he traveled and had close contact with dozens of people.Senior White House staff and those who are in direct contact with the president are tested for the virus daily. The White House originally gave the impression that Trump, too, was tested every day, with McEnany claiming in July that Trump was “the most tested man in America” and tested “multiple times a day.” But Trump contradicted her, saying, “I do probably on average a test every two days, three days.”The current White House line is that Trump is tested “regularly.”Here’s what is known: On Wednesday, Sept. 30, during a trip to Minnesota for a fundraiser and rally, one of the president’s closest aides, Hope Hicks, began feeling ill. She isolated herself aboard Air Force Once during the trip home, but the White House appears to have taken no further action.The next morning, Hicks was again tested for the virus. This time, the results came back positive, just as the president was about to leave for a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. A frantic effort was made to swap out staff who had been in close contact with Hicks, including McEnany. But Trump, who had also been with Hicks, nonetheless boarded Marine One, along with other White House staff still in the dark about Hicks’ diagnosis.After returning home from Bedminster, Trump was administered a rapid test, followed by a more accurate confirming test, which takes several hours to process. Both came back positive.“Safe to say, his first positive test was upon return or at least after Bedminster,” McEnany said.But had Trump been tested before he made that trip to court donors in New Jersey after Hicks fell in?Had he been tested before he traveled to Minnesota?What about the previous day, before his first debate against Democrat Joe Biden in Cleveland? The Cleveland Clinic, which co-hosted the event, required that all attendees be tested in advance. Campaigns had to “certify” that their candidates and traveling staff had tested negative within 72 hours. “Each campaign complied with this requirement,” the clinic said in a statement.White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern, however, refused Friday to confirm that was the case in an appearance on MSNBC.“The president’s doesn’t check all of his HIPAA rights at the door just when he becomes president,” Morgenstern said, referring to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which was written to prevent doctors and others who bill for insurance coverage from disclosing a person’s medical information without their consent.Was Trump tested Monday, Sept. 28, before he held a photo op with a truck on the South Lawn and a Rose Garden press conference to trumpet coronavirus test efforts? What about before a debate prep session with his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who have both since tested positive?What about Sept. 27, when he visited his golf course in Sterling, Virginia, held a late afternoon news conference in the White House briefing room, and held an evening reception for Gold Star families on the White House state floor? Adm. Charles W. Ray, the vice commandant of the Coast Guard, who was in attendance, has since tested positive, forcing the nation’s top military leaders, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, into self-quarantine.What about Sept. 26, before he held a Rose Garden ceremony announcing his next pick for the Supreme Court, complete with closed-door receptions where few wore masks? Numerous attendees have since tested positive following the suspected “super-spreader” event.Could Trump have been contagious that day? Could he have been the spreader?Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist and department chairman at the Yale School of Public Health, noted that a small proportion of people infected contribute to the majority of infection, with about 20% of people responsible for 80% of transmission, studies show.While it’s unclear if Trump did indeed spread it, Ko said, “trying to identify people and when they could be infectious is important, especially when they are in contact with a lot of other people.”Added Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, “There is concern that he continued to engage in public activities after his initial positive test, which is deeply worrisome and frankly unethical.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-won-t-white-house-say-when-trump-last-tested-negative/story-MIG1EHOFDlcTsUz35Cg7ZO.html
10-10-2020||World||Twitter seeks to limit spread of misinformation before vote||Twitter Inc. announced a handful of product changes intended to make it harder for users to spread misinformation on the service in the final weeks of the US presidential campaign.Some of the alterations are related to Twitter’s retweet feature, which lets users share another person’s post to their own followers, and is the fastest way for a tweet to go viral. If someone tries to retweet a post that has been labeled as false, Twitter will show “a prompt pointing them to credible information about the topic,” the company said Friday. It will also put more misleading tweets behind a warning screen, forcing users to click in order to see the original post.Twitter will also prompt users to “quote tweet” a post before retweeting it -- asking them to “add their own commentary” to the message instead of just passing it along.“Though this adds some extra friction and an extra step for those who simply want to retweet, we hope it will encourage everyone to not only consider why they are amplifying a Tweet, but also increase the likelihood that people add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation,” the San Francisco-based company wrote in a blog post.Twitter, like rival Facebook Inc., is preparing for a contentious US presidential election on Nov. 3 in which results are likely to be delayed, and experts fear misinformation will run rampant online. Unlike Facebook, Twitter doesn’t have a large fact-checking operation, and only verifies tweets in particular categories, including election- and Covid-related misinformation. The company has drawn praise and criticism from different sides of the political spectrum for its decision to fact-check posts from President Donald Trump about mail-in voting and the coronavirus.Twitter doesn’t remove inaccurate tweets unless they pose an immediate risk or harm to users or violate another one of the company’s rules, like promoting hate speech or harassment. This approach to leaving misinformation up, but with a label, is why the company is trying more creative methods to keep people from sharing misinformation more widely.It’s also trying to prevent the spread of misinformation caused by its own software. The company says it will stop inserting popular posts into users’ feeds from people they don’t follow.“This will likely slow down how quickly tweets from accounts and topics you don’t follow can reach you, which we believe is a worthwhile sacrifice to encourage more thoughtful and explicit amplification,” the company said in the blog. Twitter will also only surface trends for people if the trend includes additional context.Twitter already announced a handful of other policies intended to curb confusion around election night. Twitter and Facebook, for example, will forbid candidates from claiming victory before official results are available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-seeks-to-limit-spread-of-misinformation-before-vote/story-SlfFPqr4z6DruvhtEK7FAO.html
10-10-2020||World||Donald Trump got ‘unusual’ payments from Vegas hotel in 2016: NYT Report||Donald Trump received $21 million in “highly unusual” payments from a Nevada hotel in 2016 as his presidential campaign was struggling for cash, the New York Times reported.Tax records recently obtained by the newspaper show a series of transactions that flowed to the president from a hotel he owns in Las Vegas with casino mogul Phil Ruffin, at a time his campaign had as little as $1.3 million in the bank, according to the report published on Friday. The Times said experts characterized the payments as unusual.The documents don’t show if the money ultimately went to the campaign, but the payments could violate tax or campaign finance laws, the newspaper said.The finding is the latest published by the New York Times based on more than two decades of Trump’s tax data. The Times reported Sept. 27 that Trump has aggressively used tax deductions to offset income and paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017.“This is yet another politically-motivated hit piece inaccurately smearing a standard business deal,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement responding to the Times article. “During his years as a successful businessman, Donald Trump was long-time partners with Phil Ruffin and earned whatever payments he received.”The Trump Organization and the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment.The New York Times said the the bulk of the $21 million went through a company called Trump Las Vegas Sales and Marketing that had no employees or clear business purpose. Trump contributed $10 million to his campaign in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, which has raised questions about where the candidate, who’d been tight on cash, got the money, the newspaper said.Trump‘s re-election effort ended August with $325 million, about $141 million less than Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee had. Neither campaign has released figures on their September financial position, but Biden topped the record $364.5 million his campaign raised in August.Biden started September with a $466 million mountain of cash to take on Trump, completely reversing the Republican’s financial advantage in just four months. In April, Biden had about $98 million in the bank compared to $255 million for the incumbent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-got-unusual-payments-from-vegas-hotel-in-2016-nyt-report/story-0kW5Jqw6s8vWsUA2DtXydJ.html
10-10-2020||World||New daily record as Covid-19 cases hit more than 350,000: WHO||The World Health Organization has announced a new daily record high in coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide, with more than 350, 000 infections reported to the UN health agency on Friday.The new daily high of 350,766 cases surpasses a record set earlier this week by nearly 12,000. That tally includes more than 109,000 cases from Europe alone.In a press briefing on Friday, the WHO emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, acknowledged that even as COVID-19 continues to surge across the world, “there are no new answers.”He said that although the agency wants countries to avoid the punishing lockdowns that have devastated economies, governments must ensure the most vulnerable people are protected and that numerous measures must be taken.“The majority of people in the world are still susceptible to this disease,” Ryan warned. He said countries should focus not just on restrictive measures, but on bolstering their surveillance systems, testing, contact tracing and ensuring populations are engaged.As the virus continues to surge across Europe and elsewhere, he acknowledged that restrictive measures might be warranted at some point. British scientists reported this week that the COVID-19 outbreak is doubling every few weeks, French hospitals are running out of ICU beds and Spain declared a state of emergency in Madrid as coronavirus cases soar.Ryan said lockdowns “may be unavoidable where the disease has got out of control again, but we shouldn’t accept that in every country, the return of cases should be seen with an immediate return of the need for lockdown restrictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-reports-new-daily-high-in-covid-19-cases-as-global-tally-hits-more-than-350-000/story-i3ERJ83SlmBVIZzKwtuxxM.html
10-10-2020||World||Airbus delivers most jets since pandemic aided by E-delivery||Airbus SE delivered more aircraft in September than any month this year, a victory in the European planemaker’s battle to keep factories running and revenue flowing amid a prolonged downturn in air travel.The tally of 57 jets, mostly single-aisle with a handful of long-range aircraft, compared with 39 handovers recorded in August, according to a statement Friday. Still, Airbus saw no new orders and three cancellations -- a reminder of the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that’s shown little sign of letting up.The month’s figures marked progress on a number of fronts for the planemaker, which has struggled to maintain jetliner deliveries as its airline customers seek to defer orders to protect their own cash reserves. September saw the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer whittle down its backlog of finished aircraft, delivering nine of the larger, wide-body planes for which demand has all but dried up.The previous high for the year was 49 in July. Airbus’s e-delivery option has accounted for around 100 handovers so far, according to a person familiar with the matter. The system allows customers to delegate some essential checks to the manufacturer’s own engineers, avoiding unnecessary travel and delays related to restrictions.Chinese carriers, including Air China Ltd., China Southern Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp., took possession of 18 jets during September. Delta Air Lines Inc. accepted two A350-900 and one A330-900 wide-bodies, along with an A321ceo.Airbus and its US rival Boeing Co. have been working with cash-strapped customers to address commitments for aircraft made long before the pandemic arrived. Some airlines have decided to accept planes they don’t need, gaining concessions elsewhere and avoiding forfeiture of earlier progress payments.Wide-Bodies, JobsIn an illustration of how challenging the current environment is, Airbus announced its first wide-body mandate in almost six months in late September -- for a single tanker-jet. The order wasn’t included in the September figures because it isn’t finalized.In normal times, Airbus and Boeing would have racked up dozens of orders for hundreds of planes over the summer. Boeing, which hasn’t yet announced September figures, released forecasts earlier this week predicting a sharp contraction in jetliner sales over the next decade.Airbus slashed its production-rate targets in April and Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said this week they would stay 40% lower through 2020 and 2021. The company still has a significant backlog of undelivered jets, raising questions over whether it may need to cut production further.The company, which is due to release its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29, has also been stepping up warnings about jobs. Chief Operating Officer Michael Schoellhorn said last week that plans to slash 15,000 staff would be the minimum requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airbus-delivers-most-jets-since-pandemic-aided-by-e-delivery/story-M2Dex2fDNUf46jeaIQluML.html
10-10-2020||World||VP debate: Kamala Harris, Mike Pence clash over handling of Covid-19 pandemic||Democratic Senator Kamala Harris cemented her place in US history on Wednesday as the first woman of colour and the first Indian-American person to participate in a vice-presidential debate.Republican vice-president Mike Pence, the incumbent Harris is seeking to unseat, sought to live up to the expectations of defending President Donald Trump and his administration’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 211,000 Americans.Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last month’s acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump that had devolved into name-calling.As a stark reminder of the times we are living in, Harris and Pence were separated by plexiglass barriers in an auditorium where guests had to wear face coverings, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Social distancing norms were enforced far more rigorously than in the opening presidential debate, at which Trump’s guests, including his family members, hadn’t worn face coverings.“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris said, landing the first punch of the night, referring to the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic.“I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first,” said Pence, defending the American president and himself as head of the White House task force, appointed by Trump, to lead the fight against the worst public health crisis in over a century.With at least 211,000 dead and over 7.5 million infected with the coronavirus in the US, and Trump, the first lady and a growing number of people in their circle testing positive for Covid-19, the pandemic was the top issue at the vice-presidential debate. Harris and Pence also clashed over climate change, trade war with China, economy, racism, healthcare, Supreme Court, women’s right to abortion, and religion.As the running mate of Biden who was leading in national polls, Harris was expected to play it safe and not hand the Trump campaign a lifeline. And she did just that, overlooking several opportunities to attack Pence, much to the disappointment of many supporters who had expected to see flashes of her prosecutorial skills.“The debate was civil and constructive as compared to the presidential debate,” said M R Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, a leading Indian-American advocacy group. “Kamala and Pence delivered their positions passionately and we now have 27 days to decide.”Puneet Ahluwalia, a Republican running for Lt Governor in Virginia, a state that used to be Republican but has widely come to be considered Democratic lately, said, “VP Pence clearly distinguished himself by highlighting the exemplary job done for the American people by President Trump and his administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vp-debate-kamala-harris-mike-pence-clash-over-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-EfoNVdLmlxfmALI8mBApTL.html
