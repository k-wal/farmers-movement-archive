In March, a passenger bus tumbled off a winding mountainous road and into a ravine in northern Pakistan, killing at least 19 people and injuring several others.Landslides after heavy monsoon rain are also common in the country and cause widespread damage mountainous areas.Skardu is located in a complex of mountain ranges that includes the Himalayas, and the town is the gateway to K2, the world’s highest peak after Mt. Everest. Large numbers of local and foreign tourists visit the peak annually. Skardu is around 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/landslide-in-northern-pakistan-buries-bus-16-killed/story-2m6HzAjpfRJCZxy00JznZN.html
18-10-2020||World||Young US poll workers brace for Election Day as virus fears keep elders home||After scrambling to replace an aging force of most at risk poll workers from the coronavirus, US election officials face the challenge of running the Nov 3 voting with untested volunteers tasked with following strict health protocols in an intensely partisan environment.A nationwide drive that recruited hundreds of thousands of younger poll workers - the people who set up equipment, check in voters and process ballots, means most battleground states will not be understaffed, a Reuters review of Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin found.In nearly all of those states, more poll workers than the 2016 presidential election have already been recruited, according to data from the US Election Assistance Commission, state election officials and private poll worker recruitment campaigns. Wisconsin did not have complete data.The new poll workers must be trained not only in the usual election tasks but also issues uniquely relevant in 2020, such as how to handle voters who violate Covid-19 safety rules and ways to de-escalate political confrontations.In a year that has seen armed militia members confront protesters, some voting rights advocates worry gun toting groups will show up outside polling places.They are also concerned by a highly unusual drive by Republicans to deploy thousands of poll watchers as part of efforts to find evidence to support President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud.Though more than 20 million Americans have already cast ballots and many others still expect to vote early in person or by mail, roughly a third to almost half of voters in critical battleground states plan to vote on Nov. 3, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.“The multitude and magnitude of issues poll workers are going to have to deal with in this election are unprecedented,” said Aaron Ockerman, executive director of the Ohio Association of Election Officials.Their success in handling those situations could mean the difference between a confidence inspiring election between Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden or the turbulence seen during primaries earlier this year when thousands of older poll workers quit amid Covid-19 concerns.In Wisconsin, a dramatic reduction in polling places caused by a lack of poll workers in April forced voters to risk their health by standing in lines for hours to cast a ballot.As those problems became apparent, election officials and activist groups including the student run Poll Hero Project and Power the Polls - a coalition of voting rights, civic and corporate organizations - began seeking volunteers to step into the breach.The new recruits are far younger than usual. Of the more than 920,000 poll workers nationwide in the 2016 election, more than 56% of them were above the age of 60, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.By contrast, nearly 90% of the more than 650,000 poll workers that have been referred to local officials this year by Power the Polls are under the age of 65, said co-founder Robert Brandon. The Poll Hero Project has recruited more than 31,000 students, more than half of them high school students, said co-founder Ella Gantman, 19, a student at Princeton University.Election officials said the widespread interest in working the polls has been encouraging and challenging.In Michigan’s rural Isabella County, Clerk Minde Lux said she hired and trained her poll workforce months ago, but her office is still being inundated with calls from prospective poll workers through a recruitment program run by the secretary of state’s office. She said she has no more time or money to train additional volunteers.“We’re just trying to keep our heads above the water, but then people get mad at us, like, ‘Oh, you don’t want us to work the polls,’“ she said.Jacob Major, 17, is one of the new faces who will work the polls in his Milwaukee neighbourhood. Major, who now leads the Poll Hero Project’s Wisconsin campaign, said many of the recent recruits are vulnerable to last-minute cancellations because young people have less control over their lives. He also is anxious that the city has not yet told him when his training will take place.Too young to cast a ballot himself, Major said nothing will keep him from showing up on Election Day.“Being a poll worker and helping so many young people to sign up as poll workers is my way of voting,” he said.In Milwaukee, where the decision to cut the number of polling places from 180 to five in the primary because of lack of poll workers led to disarray, the number of polling places on Nov. 3 will be back up to at least 173, said Jonatan Zuniga, deputy director of the Milwaukee City Election Commission.Zuniga said nearly 2,600 new poll workers had signed up for training and another 1,000 veteran workers would return, resulting in a big increase over the 2,653 poll workers the city had in 2016, according to data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.Yet with Covid-19 cases rising in Wisconsin, Zuniga said he planned to create a pool of 200 standby workers who would be dispatched on Nov 3 if others do not show up.“We’ll be monitoring that and see how many back out,” he said. “But right now we’re in good shape.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/young-us-poll-workers-brace-for-election-day-as-virus-fears-keep-elders-home/story-fusKVq3VEG8dLAnq07LiWJ.html
18-10-2020||World||Damage from August wind storm in Midwest at $7.5B||Damage estimates from a rare wind storm that slammed Iowa and some other parts of the Midwest in August are growing, with the total now at $7.5 billion, according to a new report.The August 10 storm hit Iowa hard but also caused damage in Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota and Indiana. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it’s currently the second-costliest US disaster so far in 2020, although cost estimates for widespread wildfires along the West Coast aren’t yet available.The storm, known as a derecho, generated winds of up to 140 mph (225 kph) that flattened millions of acres of crops. The derecho also knocked out power to half a million Iowa residents and damaged homes, trees and power lines. Four people died as the storm moved across the Midwest.The most expensive disaster so far this year was Hurricane Laura, which caused $14 billion in damage when it hit the Gulf Coast in August, according to the NOAA research.National Weather Service meteorologist Allan Curtis told the Des Moines Register that the derecho caused such extensive damage because it lasted for roughly 14 hours and hit crops when they were especially vulnerable. He said the damage would have been significantly less if the derecho had occurred in the spring, before crops were tall enough to be caught by the wind.“If you were looking to exert the most damage on corn crops when it comes to thunderstorms and heavy winds, when the derecho rolled through in August, it was the perfect time to do it,” Curtis said.The US Agriculture Department has estimated that Iowa farmers will be unable to harvest at least 850,000 acres (343,983 hectares) of crops this fall because of the damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/damage-from-august-wind-storm-in-midwest-at-7-5b/story-QVHJHxJcUV4hG8vyJYYaMK.html

In Phase 3, it would be administered to people over 65. All remaining essential workers would receive the vaccine in a fourth phase, and healthy adults and children would receive it in a fifth phase.Prioritization would also vary by geographic location based on the prevalence of the virus, Cuomo said.“This is a larger operational undertaking, I would argue, than anything we have done during Covid to date,” he told reporters.The program will likely seek to deliver some 40 million doses of a vaccine to state residents, as New York’s population is around 20 million and the vaccines in development may require two doses to be effective, Cuomo said.He said the state had sent the drafted plan to the federal government, along with questions on what funding the federal government would provide for the effort.“States cannot do this on their own,” he said.A New York state task force will carry out its own review of coronavirus vaccines authorized or approved by the federal government due to concerns of politicization of the approval process, according to Cuomo, a Democrat who has blasted President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“I think that will give people added surety in the vaccine,” Cuomo said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/healthcare-workers-high-risk-people-will-get-priority-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-new-york-governor/story-o7SKYveYkCGcNOvbHgnT3J.html

18-10-2020||World||Chinese forces prepare for possible military invasion of Taiwan||The presence of the People’s Liberation Army is increasing in China’s southeast coast as it prepares for a possible military invasion of Taiwan, according to the defense observers cited by the South China Morning Post.According to the sources, Beijing is replacing its old DF-11s and DF-15s and deploying its most advanced hypersonic missile DF-17 in the region.“The DF-17 hypersonic missile will gradually replace the old DF-11s and DF-15s that were deployed in the southeast region for decades,” the source was quoted by SCMP. “The new missile has a longer range and is able to hit targets more accurately.”Even though Taiwan has never been controlled by China’s ruling party, Chinese authorities insist that the self-governing island is an integral part of their territory, with president Xi Jinping refusing to rule out a military force to capture it if necessary.According to the Canada-based Kanwa Defence Review, satellite images show that both the Marine Corps and Rocket Force bases in Fujian and Guangdong have expanded.“Every rocket force brigade in Fujian and Guangdong is now fully equipped,” the report said.“The size of some of the missile bases in the Eastern and Southern theatre commands have even doubled in recent years, showing the PLA is stepping up preparations for a war targeting Taiwan,” the further stated.The information regarding the possible deployment of hypersonic missile comes amid heightened tensions between China and the US, with issues pertaining to disagreements over Taiwan and the COVID-19 pandemic.On Tuesday, the Chinese President during a visit to a military base in the southern province of Guangdong had instructed troops to “put their minds and energy on preparing for war”, according to news agency Xinhua.During an inspection of the PLA’s Marine Corps in Chaozhou City, Xinhua said Xi told the soldiers to “maintain a state of high alert” and called on them to be “absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable”.China in recent years has also increased military drills around Taiwan, with almost 40 Chinese warplanes crossing the median line between the mainland and Taiwan on September 18-19 -- one of several sorties the island’s President Tsai Ing-wen called a “threat of force.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-forces-prepare-for-possible-military-invasion-of-taiwan/story-Fvxh3fP3WNcHv6gPzFGnfO.html
18-10-2020||World||Economy, pandemic overshadow climate for young US voters||The two dozen students who signed up for air pollution expert James Goldstene’s advanced environmental studies class all say they are deeply passionate about fighting climate change.But when it comes to voting in the US presidential election, many said climate change was not their top issue.Their priorities ahead of the Nov. 3 election reflect those of the wider electorate: the battered US economy, the Covid-19 pandemic and racial justice.“I know everybody’s biggest issue right now within this class is environment. And it’s super important to me but another thing that I feel is more important personally because I’m an African-American woman is race,” said Kelia Surrency, 23.“The environment is 100% important to me, but I need someone in that office that doesn’t look at the Black community as lesser than.”Many in the class at California State University, Sacramento, were having trouble finding entry-level jobs or internships in the Covid wrecked economy, said Goldstene, a former top California air pollution regulator.“With Covid going on and a lot of people losing their jobs and struggling, worrying about how they are going to pay for stuff. I think that does overshadow climate,” said another student, Enrique Dominguez, 23.The students’ views illustrate how climate change, even when an issue of great voter concern, is eclipsed by other problems.“Our attention span is limited,” said Joe Arvai, director of the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Southern California. “Unless your house is on fire, you’re not going to be experiencing climate change firsthand.”Only 7% of likely voters aged 34 and under named environment and climate as their top concern in choosing a president, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 13. Among likely voters of all ages, only 4% prioritized climate and environment.By comparison, Covid-19 was the top concern for 25% of young voters, while jobs and the economy were named by 20%. Nevertheless, Democratic candidate Joe Biden has made climate change a campaign priority, his campaign said.The campaign sees young voters as important to Biden’s chances of winning the election -- a major challenge given the typically low turnout by the demographic. In 2016, turnout among voters under the age of 30 was about 46%, according to the US Census Bureau. By comparison, 71% of those 65 and older voted.Aware of voters’ worries about the economy, public health and systemic racism, Biden’s campaign has wrapped environmental issues into a broader discussion of green jobs and a healthier environment.“When you look at a really deep issue like climate, there’s no way to separate it in your solution from the interconnected and overlapping issues like job creation, economic growth, prosperity, and also health,” said climate activist and billionaire Tom Steyer, who is advising Biden on environmental issues.Biden has endorsed a $2 trillion plan to promote clean energy and repair infrastructure.His campaign has released several digital ads aimed at young people that mention climate, mostly in the context of other issues, and an online youth engagement meeting focused heavily on jobs and the economy.Biden’s campaign released a television ad focusing exclusively on climate, but it was aimed at farmers rather than young people.“Joe Biden recognizes that our country is grappling with four intersecting crises — the raging pandemic, economic collapse, persistent racial injustice, and existential threat of climate change — and is exactly why he has outlined an integrated, ambitious, and bold agenda to ensure we tackle these crises together,” said spokesman Matt Hill.President Donald Trump has sought to frame Biden’s climate plans as a radical leftist agenda that would cost too much and hurt economic growth. By contrast, his campaign has said it would continue to ease business restrictions to boost the economy.His campaign has also invoked the environment, arguing that Trump’s pro-industry policies have led to lower carbon emissions.“President Trump’s record on the environment proves you can have energy independence and a clean, healthy environment without destroying the economy, overregulating, or burdening American taxpayers,” Trump spokeswoman Samantha Zager said. “The president will continue to rely on policies of innovation and competition.”The emissions reductions noted by Trump’s campaign were driven largely by the retirement of coal plants. Air quality also continued to improve under Trump following the same trajectory as in previous Republican and Democratic administrations.It would be a mistake to ignore young voters’ concerns about the environment, said Ben Wessel, head of the youth outreach group NextGen America founded by Steyer. Stronger campaign messages on climate could draw more young voters to the polls, he said.That could be the case for Goldstene’s student Michaela Gallagher, 24. Alarmed by climate change, she says she is leaning toward casting a ballot for the Democrat because she feels he will do more than Trump for the environment. But she also might vote for a third-party candidate or skip voting.“I’m all over the place about it,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/economy-pandemic-overshadow-climate-for-young-us-voters/story-LsMGEkAZDbGvkX9kNoCb4M.html
18-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden are campaigning across country from each other||President Donald Trump made a rare visit to church Sunday as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden campaigned across the country from one another in key states with the November 3 election close at hand.Trump was attending services at the nondenominational International Church of Las Vegas before raising money in Newport Beach, California, and holding an evening rally in Carson City, Nevada. Biden’s schedule put him in North Carolina for a voter mobilization event in Durham and a virtual meeting with African American faith leaders. In the morning, he worshipped at a church in Wilmington, Delaware.For Trump, it was a return to a church he had visited as a candidate in October, 2016. At that time, he received a prayer on stage and toured an affiliated Christian school, seeing students and delivering remarks on alternatives to traditional public schools.Biden went to St. Joseph’s on the Brandywine, as he does nearly every week. He and his wife, Jill, entered wearing dark-colored face masks. She carried a bunch of flowers that including pink roses.The church is a few minutes’ drive from Biden’s home. Biden’s son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, is buried in the cemetery on its grounds. Joe and Jill Biden visited the grave after the service.If elected, Biden would be only the second Roman Catholic president in U.S. history and first since John F. Kennedy. Biden speaks frequently about his faith and its importance in his life.Trump attends church far less often, but has drawn strong support from white Evangelical leaders and frequently hosts groups of pastors at the White House.Trailing in national and pivotal battleground state polls with just over two weeks until Election Day, Trump has kept a more robust schedule since returning campaigning after contracting the coronavirus.Trump enters the final stretch of the campaign at a steep financial advantage — a highly unusual predicament for an incumbent. After building a massive cash edge early in the race his campaign spent lavishly. Biden kept expenses low and benefited from an outpouring of donations that saw him raise nearly $1 billion over the past three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-are-campaigning-across-country-from-each-other/story-N5cjEcUG8sAGZC0ki1WWJJ.html
18-10-2020||World||Pak fails to fulfil 6 key mandates of FATF; no action against Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed||Pakistan’s failure to fulfil six key obligations of the FATF, including action against two of India’s most wanted terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, and the sudden disappearance of more than 4,000 terrorists from its official list will most likely lead to its continuation in the ‘grey list’ of the Global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, officials said on Sunday. The virtual plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to be held on October 21-23, will take the final call on Pakistan’s continuation on its grey list after a thorough review of Islamabad’s performance in fulfilling the global commitments and standards in the fight against money laundering and terror financing. The FATF had given Pakistan a total of 27 action plan obligations for completely checking terror financing of which so far it has cleared 21 but has failed in some of the key tasks, an official privy to the developments said. The mandates which Pakistan has failed include action against all UN-designated terrorists like Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Azhar, Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Saeed and the outfit’s operational commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi. Besides, FATF has strongly noted the fact that there was sudden disappearance of the names of more than 4,000 terrorists from its original list of 7,600 under Schedule IV of its Anti Terrorism Act. “Under these circumstances, it is almost certain that Pakistan will continue in the FATF grey list,” the official said. Also, the four nominating countries — the United States, Britain, France and Germany — are also not satisfied with Islamabad’s commitment to taking strong action against the terror groups operating from its soil. Azhar, Saeed and Lakhvi are most wanted terrorists in India for their involvement in numerous terrorist acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror strikes and the bombing of a CRPF bus at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir last year. With Pakistan’s continuation in the grey list, it is increasingly becoming difficult for Islamabad to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the neighbouring country which is in a precarious financial situation. The FATF will also judge if competent authorities in Pakistan were cooperating and taking action to identify and taking enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and had proven implementation of cross-border currency and bearer negotiable instruments controls at all ports of entry, including applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. The country’s outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services, another official said. The FATF plenary was earlier scheduled in June, but Pakistan got an unexpected breather after the global watchdog against financial crimes temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines in the wake of grave health risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The watchdog also put a general pause in the review process, thus giving additional four months to Pakistan to meet the requirements. Pakistan needed 12 votes out of 39 to exit the grey list and move to the white list. To avoid the blacklist, it needs the support of three countries. China, Turkey and Malaysia are its consistent supporters. Currently, North Korea and Iran are on the FATF blacklist. Pakistan was placed on the grey list by the FATF in June 2018 and was given a plan of action to complete it by October 2019. Since then, the country continues to be on that list due to its failure to comply with the FATF mandates. The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terror financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF currently has 39 members, including two regional organisations -- the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. India is a member of the FATF consultations and its Asia Pacific Group.

18-10-2020||World||China likely to show Covid-19 recovery economically with fresh GDP numbers||China is about to show the world that its economy is pulling further out of the chasm created by the coronavirus, setting it apart from other nations struggling to avoid renewed lockdowns.Gross domestic product for the third quarter -- due Monday -- is forecast to come in at a 5.5% expansion from a year earlier, recovering all of the lost ground from the historic contraction in the first three months of the year.Global trade has been an unexpectedly strong driver for the world’s second-largest economy, and even still-cautious domestic consumers are becoming more confident. That returning optimism is based on the nation’s success in keeping the virus practically at bay despite an occasional cluster emerging.“Right now, China has basically put Covid-19 under control,” People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said on Sunday in a webinar organized by the Group of 30. “In general, the Chinese economy remains resilient with great potential. Continued recovery is anticipated which will benefit the global economy.”Yet even amid the strengthening domestic recovery, the prospect of renewed closures amid spiking infection rates in Europe and elsewhere comes with uncertain prospects for China, which has relied on exports and manufacturing to help spur its rebound. September data for industrial production, retail sales, investment and unemployment will give a clearer reading of underlying momentum.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..“Improving consumer sentiment and consumption likely also boosted private demand. Leading indicators indicate demand is coming back at a faster pace than production at this stage of the recovery.”--Chang Shu, chief Asia economist. For the full note click hereElsewhere, at least nine central banks from Russia to Mozambique deliver interest-rate decisions, while European activity indicators could signal growth is petering out.US and CanadaIn the US, figures on residential construction starts, previously owned home sales and weekly unemployment benefit applications are the highlights of a relatively quiet week for economic data. In addition, the Federal Reserve will issue its Beige Book -- a collection of economic and business activity assessments within each of the central bank’s 12 regions.In Canada, investors will be watching for Monday’s release of the central bank’s business outlook survey as well as inflation data on Wednesday. Those reports will set up the October 28 rate decision.Europe, Middle East, AfricaThis week will offer more evidence of the euro area’s fading recovery, with flash PMIs forecast to weaken again in October. Those numbers will follow another flurry of European Central Bank speakers, giving investors final hints into their thinking before a quiet period sets in ahead of the ECB rate decision on October 29.In the UK, inflation is set to rebound after the expiry of the government’s Eat Out to Help Out restaurant support program. Markets will also be closely watching Bank of England speeches for clues on a potential stimulus top-up early in November.Hungary’s central bank holds its monthly and weekly rate decisions within the space of two days, with investors hoping for clarity about whether the two will move in tandem or diverge. Ukraine, meanwhile, will announce its key policy rate amid rising uncertainty over its independence, cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and a virus spike.The Bank of Israel may cut its key rate below the current level of 0.1%, or opt to expand government bond purchases, as the country starts to emerge from a second national lockdown.In Turkey, the central bank could hike for the second time in less than a month as inflation remains near double digits and real interest rates are still negative. The Bank of Russia is expected to stay on hold, but investors are watching closely for signs of whether its easing cycle is coming to an end amid the plunge in the ruble.Namibia’s central bank will probably keep its key rate unchanged, after its South African counterpart did the same last month. Namibia’s benchmark is already lower than its neighbor’s, which could threaten the country’s reserves and currency peg.Mozambique may also stay on hold because inflation has been ticking up. Uganda’s central bank may have some scope for easing as inflation started slowing and the economy is now projected by the IMF to contract this year.AsiaAside from Chinese GDP, other key releases in the region include Japan export figures and early Korean data for October, which will give the latest indication of how global trade is picking up.Likewise, Japan’s PMI reading will offer a picture of how the manufacturing and service sectors are recovering. Inflation data is likely to show prices still falling there.Latin AmericaMexico’s September unemployment report out Wednesday may show a third month of marginal improvement after joblessness rose to a near decade-high in June. A sluggish recovery that’s losing momentum suggests the trend level will remain elevated for some time.Mid-month readings of inflation should find prices just within the target range in Mexico, while Brazil has a bit more room to spare even as its headline number may have nearly doubled since May.As to output and demand, Argentina’s activity index looks set to post a sixth straight double-digit decline and Mexico’s retail sales report will underscore the scope of the demand-shock there.Lastly, Brazil’s current account balance report out Friday may draw more than passing interest. The billions spent to prop up cash-strapped households all but ensures a record budget gap this year, and investors and credit rating companies have taken note of government in-fighting over austerity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-likely-to-show-covid-19-recovery-economically-with-fresh-gdp-numbers/story-oJzniFlgmtUvdPmdHZxTTO.html
18-10-2020||World||Ardern’s stunning election victory holds lessons for the US||Jacinda Ardern’s emphatic election victory is seen as an endorsement of an inclusive brand of leadership that may ripple beyond New Zealand’s borders.In an age of populism and confrontation, Ardern’s message of empathy and kindness married with skillful crisis management won her Labour Party its biggest share of the vote in more than 70 years. That contrasts starkly with the divisive politics in the US as Donald Trump and Joe Biden face off for the presidency on Nov. 3.“Ardern’s approach could be a lesson for other leaders seeking to maximize their support base,” said Zareh Ghazarian, senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Monash University in Melbourne. “Not only has she been able to lead the nation through very challenging circumstances, but also successfully communicate an overall vision. In New Zealand it’s about the politics of inclusion.”Ardern, 40, won international plaudits for her response to the deadly shootings at two mosques in 2019, donning a headscarf as a mark of respect as she mourned with the Muslim community. This year, she’s demonstrated her steel in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, enacting one of the world’s strictest lockdowns to crush community transmission.She rode the resulting wave of adulation to secure the first outright majority in parliament since New Zealand introduced proportional representation in 1996. Labour won 49% of the vote and 64 of the 120 seats in parliament. The scale of the victory may fuel her global appeal among those who already view her as a standard-bearer for liberal values.Ardern is now in a position to lead New Zealand’s most left-leaning government in decades but has yet to decide whether to include her ally the Green Party, which wants more action on issues such as poverty and climate change.Ironically, her increased mandate may prompt her to rein in her left-leaning instincts as she looks to hang on to the Center-Right voters who have flocked to her banner.“It’s going to be a huge dilemma for her, whether to go to the left or stay in that Center ground,” said Lara Greaves, a lecturer in New Zealand politics at the University of Auckland. “Does she want to try to be a four term Prime Minister or does she want to make transformational policy that changes people’s lives?”Her re-election spells continuity in a nuanced foreign-policy stance toward China. Ardern has tried not to antagonize New Zealand’s largest trading partner while maintaining close ties with the U.S. and other western allies in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance.Her focus will be on the enormous economic and social challenges ahead as New Zealand charts a recovery from recession.The border is expected to remain closed well into 2021, decimating international tourism and education, while the jobless rate is projected to climb. Economists at Infometrics last week flagged the risk of another recession in 2021.The nation faces persistent budget deficits and net debt that will surge to 56% of gross domestic product by 2026 from 28% in mid 2020, according to Treasury forecasts.Labour said it will impose a 39% tax on income over NZ$180,000 ($119,000) to help pay for the Covid response and keep debt under control. It aims to stimulate investment and create jobs through major infrastructure projects and incentives for small business.Voters rewarded Ardern for her successful response to Covid-19, which stands in stark contrast to countries like the U.K., U.S. and even neighbouring Australia where authorities are still battling to contain the virus.Ardern stood out among her western peers in pursuing an explicit elimination strategy, and imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world. This shuttered the economy but wiped out community spread of the virus, allowing restrictions to be removed sooner than in many other countries. A second outbreak in largest city Auckland was also quickly stamped out with a regional lockdown, though one new community case was reported Sunday.“The way the Prime Minister has put health before the economy will be of interest, especially for other social democratic leaders around the world,” said Bryce Edwards, a political analyst at Victoria University in Wellington. “They will now see Ardern as the leader of those left parties internationally and they will want to learn from her.”Asked Sunday if she had a message for Americans as they head into their own election, Ardern said it wasn’t her place to comment.“But my hope as someone who has, of course, a strong interest in politics is that we have elections globally where we try and move beyond the divisive nature that elections can sometimes bring, because that can be damaging for democracy,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ardern-s-stunning-election-victory-holds-lessons-for-the-us/story-HAVvL5cXBGIimeNeO0efLL.html
18-10-2020||World||Protesters in Thailand carry on despite police warning||Thousands of mainly young Thais were back on the streets of Bangkok on Sunday for a fifth straight day of protests demanding sweeping political change, with demonstrations also taking place at several other locations around the country.The demonstrators, who are protesting despite a state of emergency banning them from doing so, received a new warning from police that they are violating the law. On Saturday, however, few people had been arrested as peaceful rallies were held at several points around Bangkok, the capital, with several thousand taking part.The protest movement — which is calling for the prime minister’s resignation, a more democratic constitution and a reformed monarchy — began in March at universities around the country. After a lull due to the coronavirus crisis, it was revived in late July, building up strength, particularly in Bangkok.On Sunday, rallies were called in at least a dozen provinces, including Chiang Mai, a popular tourist destination in northern Thailand. Social media spread the word, though the government said it would seek legal action against accounts posting details of planned protests.The rallies in Bangkok again drew large crowds, perhaps as many as 10,000 in all, despite the official warnings and intermittent rain.“If we are together we have a better chance to win, but if we let people fight alone there will be less chance to win,” a 24-year-old protester who called herself Pear said at a rally at the busy Asoke intersection, located in the commercial heart of the capital. “So we are here to express ourselves, what we are wanting and what we are expecting for the future as well.”The larger rally in Bangkok was held at Victory Monument, a popular meeting point that anchors a traffic circle on a main thoroughfare. The atmosphere there was jumpy due to occasional rumors that police had been spotted nearby.The authorities tried in vain to keep people from gathering by selectively shutting down stations on Bangkok’s elevated and underground mass transit lines. On Saturday, after protest organizers urged followers to meet at the city’s Skytrain stations, they had ordered all stations to be closed, to little avail.The current cycle of confrontations began before dawn Thursday, when police broke up an overnight rally outside Government House, which hosts the offices of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. It led Prayuth to declare a state of emergency, banning gatherings of more than five people and allowing the government extra powers to keep the peace.Protesters ignored the emergency decree and gathered Thursday night in large numbers at a major intersection in Bangkok’s central shopping district, overcoming half-hearted resistance by thin lines of police.A Friday night rally at a nearby intersection was crushed by a large force of riot police backed by truck-mounted water cannons. The use of force was condemned by rights organizations.Police made no efforts to break up Saturday’s gatherings, which ended peacefully at 8 p.m., as scheduled by organizers.A statement issued late Saturday night by Prayuth’s office said the government had acted within the law in seeking to stop the rallies and did not intend to deny people their rights.“The situation is very dynamic at the moment,” police deputy spokesperson Kissana Phatanacharoen said at a Sunday morning news conference. “There is no formula as to what we do or what we don’t do.”He said that if people failed to obey the law, police would be compelled to enforce it.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The protest movement became particularly controversial when it adopted reform of the monarchy as a demand. The protesters want it to act within the checks and balances of democracy.The monarchy has long been considered sacrosanct in Thailand, and is protected by a law that makes defaming the royal institution punishable by a prison term of three to 15 years. The issue has angered Thailand’s conservative establishment, especially the army, which considers protecting the monarchy to be one of its main duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-in-thailand-carry-on-despite-police-warning/story-gHQ1Wz1q4YQ4mOOUUnoV3N.html

The organization unites the biggest companies in the country and their owners.The business leaders expect that they will have an opportunity to talk about recent tax changes as well as about Russia’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, two people from companies whose leaders are due to attend the video conference said. The meeting is tentatively planned for October 21, they said.Putin usually meets with top executives and tycoons every spring during the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs business week. That event was cancelled this year due to pandemic.Russia plans to more than triple mineral extraction taxes next year to help to cover the budget gap opened by the pandemic. The tax increase covers most metals and fertilizers. Coal, gold and silver will be excluded from the measure, while the government plans a separate diamond-mining tax linked to the sales price of gems. Taxes and regulations for oil companies are also changing.Virus infections in Russia have surged in recent weeks, with daily tallies surpassing peak levels reached in the spring. Fallout from the pandemic contributed to a deep slump in the second quarter, though the Russian economy bounced back over the summer after many virus lockdown restrictions were lifted. Industrial production will probably only shrink 4.5% for the full year, while manufacturing will contract 2%, according to Industry Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-to-hold-video-chat-with-business-leaders-this-week/story-msltly0z8F204vO028MLsK.html

At least four of those detained are family members of the attacker, who had been granted 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March, was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun, which fires plastic pellets.His half-sister joined the Islamic State group in Syria in 2014, Ricard said. He didn’t give her name, and it wasn’t clear where she is now.The prosecutor said a text claiming responsibility and a photograph of the victim were found on the suspect’s phone. He also confirmed that a Twitter account under the name Abdoulakh A belonged to the suspect. It posted a photo of the decapitated head minutes after the attack along with the message “I have executed one of the dogs from hell who dared to put Muhammad down.”The beheading has upset moderate French Muslims. A group of imams in the Lyon region are holding a special meeting Sunday to discuss together what the group called “the appalling assassination of our compatriot by a terrorist who in the name of an uncertain faith committed the irreparable.”The attack has provoked global condemnation. US President Donald Trump addressed the killing Saturday night from a political rally in Janesville, Wisconsin.“On behalf of the United States, I’d like to extend my really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President (Emmanuel) Macron of France, where they just yesterday had a vicious, vicious Islamic terrorist attack — beheading an innocent teacher near Paris,” he said. “France is having a hard time and Macron’s a great guy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-demonstrations-to-pay-tribute-to-beheaded-teacher/story-APeywfS1fytj9PmhYpCfhL.html

18-10-2020||World||Can Lindsey Graham lose South Carolina? A Senate upset is possible||An epic political battle is cresting in South Carolina, where Senator Lindsey Graham, a presidential ally, is neck-and-neck with an African-American challenger two decades his junior, raising Democratic hopes of snatching a Senate seat in Trump country.Out-fundraised by Democrat Jaime Harrison, and glued to Donald Trump’s hip on issues like immigration and Supreme Court nominations, Graham is under threat like never before in a state where his Republican Party has controlled the local legislature, governor’s mansion, and both US Senate seats for at least the last 15 years.With Trump’s fortunes sinking along with his poll numbers, Democrats are eyeing potential flips in several other states as they seek to reclaim control of the Senate. But suddenly South Carolina, a traditionally conservative bastion that Harrison describes as a legacy of the slave holding “old South”, is in play, despite Graham’s repeated claims that both he and Trump will win re-election in 17 days.“Lindsey Graham’s scared,” Harrison told a crowd Saturday in North Charleston, where supporters honked their approval at a drive-in campaign event to allow social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.“He is nervous, and he should be,” the 44-year-old Harrison added. “Because the people of South Carolina are about to give him a one-way ticket back home!”A Harrison victory would send shock waves through American politics, notably because South Carolina -- where the opening shots of the Civil War were fired in 1861 -- would become the first US state ever represented by two Black senators at the same time. The state’s other senator, Tim Scott, is Republican.Harrison, whose aunt died of Covid-19 this year, recalled growing up in poverty, doing his homework in the dark when his family could not pay the electricity bill.“I know what hard times is,” the Yale graduate and former head of the South Carolina Democratic Party said, invoking the lilt of his grandparents who helped raise him.“On November 3, the people of South Carolina are going to close the book on the Old South, and write a brand new book called the ‘New South,’“ one of boldness, diversity and inclusion, Harrison said as the car horns reached a crescendo.“And out of the ashes, we will rise like a phoenix.”With his position at risk, the 65-year-old Graham campaigned Friday in the Palmetto State, stepping off a campaign bus bearing a larger-than-life image of the senator, only to highlight how he is being outspent by Harrison, who raised a staggering record $57 million in the third quarter.“Help me pay for the bus!” he pleaded, only half-jokingly, to a few dozen supporters in an otherwise deserted parking lot near Charleston.Most of them appeared to be connected to Graham’s campaign or the party apparatus, offering a striking contrast to the rowdier Harrison campaign event.Why is a conservative star who has the president’s ear and is helping guide Trump’s nominee onto the Supreme Court in jeopardy in ruby red South Carolina?Democrats and some Republicans point to Graham’s reversals on two key issues.He loathed Trump in 2016, then embraced him after he won the presidency. He also vowed to oppose confirming a new justice in an election year, only to become a fierce advocate for Amy Coney Barrett’s Senate confirmation before the election.“What has happened is Lindsey Graham has shot himself in the foot. That’s why it’s close,” Johnnie Cordero, who chairs the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Black caucus, said in a telephone interview.Graham’s supporters say South Carolinians will look past his flip-flops.“I think the Republicans are going to forgive him for those things. Things change over time,” said 68-year-old Debra Bays, a party volunteer who is door knocking for Trump and Graham.South Carolina is changing, too. Immigrants are moving to the state, and the low country along the coast is now decidedly purple.Lawyer Bennett Crites, who cast his ballot Friday at an early voting location in North Charleston, said there are many South Carolinians “disappointed in the job that Graham has done.”“So it would be a shocker if (Harrison) pulled it off, but it wouldn’t surprise me either,” he added.Despite polls showing Trump trailing Biden and RealClearPolitics labeling South Carolina’s Senate contest a toss-up, Graham insisted the prospects of re-election for him and Trump, whose toxic tone has irritated the senator, are improving.“He can be a handful who can get in the way of his own success,” Graham told AFP, but the presidency is no “personality contest” either.“As we get closer to voting day there’s a comparison going on, of where the country will go under his leadership versus that of the Democratic Party, and I think it’s getting better for us by the day.”Graham elbow bumped his supporters but wore a mask as they snapped selfies while he attacked Democrats as promoting “the most radical movement in (US) history.”But Democratic voters see Harrison as fighting for fairness, particularly in access to health care, for everyday Americans.“He’s like a breath of fresh air,” historian Don Doyle, 74, said at Harrison’s rally, and “he’s giving Lindsey a run for his money.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-lindsey-graham-lose-south-carolina-a-senate-upset-is-possible/story-DE8tZ18jXB66VDoFduz0GL.html
18-10-2020||World||Singapore’s world’s first face scan plan sparks privacy fears||Singapore will become the world’s first country to use facial verification in its national ID scheme, but privacy advocates are alarmed by what they say is an intrusive system vulnerable to abuse.From next year, millions of people living in the city-state will be able to access government agencies, banking services and other amenities with a quick face scan.This biometric check will do away with the need to remember a password or security dongle when performing many everyday tasks, its creators say.It is part of the financial hub’s drive to harness technology, from ramping up the use of electronic payments to research on driverless transport.“We want to be innovative in applying technology for the benefit of our citizens and businesses,” Kwok Quek Sin, who works on digital identification at Singapore’s technology agency GovTech, told AFP.Facial verification has already been adopted in various forms around the world, with Apple and Google implementing the technology for tasks like unlocking phones and making payments.Governments have also deployed it at airports for security checks on travellers.But Singapore’s rollout is one of the most ambitious yet, and the first to attach facial verification to a national identification database.The technology captures a series of photos of a person’s face in various lights.These images are matched with other data already available to the government such as national identity cards, passports, and employment passes.Safeguards ensure the process is secure, said Lee Sea Lin of digital consultancy Toppan Ecquaria, which is working with GovTech to implement the technology.“We want to have assurance that the person behind the device is a real person, and that it is not an image or a video,” Lee said.The technology is being integrated into the country’s digital identity scheme and is being trialled now at some government offices, including the tax authority and the city’s pension fund.Private firms can sign up for the initiative, and Singapore’s biggest bank DBS is part of the trial.Face scanning technology remains controversial despite its growing use and critics have raised ethical concerns about it in some countries, for instance, law enforcement agencies scanning crowds at large events to look for troublemakers.Singapore authorities are frequently accused of targeting government critics and taking a hard line on dissent, and activists are concerned about how the face scanning tech will be used.“There are no clear and explicit restraints on government power when it comes to things like surveillance and data gathering,” said Kirsten Han, a freelance journalist from the city.“Will we one day discover that this data is in the hands of the police or in the hands of some other agency that we didn’t specifically give consent for?”Those behind the Singapore scheme stress facial verification is different to recognition as it requires user consent, but privacy advocates remain sceptical.“The technology is still far from benign,” Privacy International research officer Tom Fisher told AFP.He said systems like the one planned for Singapore left “opportunities for exploitation”, such as use of data to track and profile people. Kwok of GovTech insisted that no data would be shared with third parties and users would be left with other options, such as personal passwords, to access services.“It is not surveillance,” he said. “The use is very specific.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-s-world-s-first-face-scan-plan-sparks-privacy-fears/story-30BoApOIy5fyqeCoJHuBqM.html
18-10-2020||World||China’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate proves safe in initial tests||Researchers in China have confirmed that BBIBP-CorV, a vaccine currently under human trial observation, has safely triggered the expected antibody immune responses.The combined early and mid-stage trials for the vaccine happened between April 29 and July 30 this year. Beijing Institute of Biological Products, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG), is currently developing the vaccine. It is one of ten potential vaccine candidates that have entered the Phase III trials around the world. Chinese scientists are currently leading the research in four such vaccine development programs, as confirmed by the World Health Organization. Based on a report by news agency Reuters, a paper published in the Lancet, a medical journal, has proved that the vaccine is initially safe. However, anticipated adverse effects such as mild fever, pain localized to the regions of injection were commonly observed in candidates. The vaccine is currently under Phase 3 trials in places outside China. Meanwhile the government has recently approved the vaccine on a conditional basis for emergency inoculation for essential workers and high infection risk groups in the country. Nearly 600 healthy individuals of varying age groups participated in the study. When two injections of three different dosages were administered, the expected antibody reactions were triggered in all individuals, as published in the paper.Two key findings from the trial were mentioned in the study. Researchers from CNBG and the Chinese Disease Control Authorities have said that there is no sufficient data to support the fact that the vaccine can evidently cure the Coronavirus. Also, while the vaccine did trigger antibody responses, observations about cell-based immune response were not mentioned. Thus the scientists could not assure on the potency of the vaccine in fighting the coronavirus. Participants aged 60 and above were also found to be slower in developing antibody responses and multiplying them, than people of younger age groups. Another subsidiary of the CNBG, is in the process of developing a similar vaccine, which is also under Phase 3 trials. An official from the CNBG has mentioned that both the vaccines could be approved for emergency usage among the general public in China, before the end of the year.

The National People’s Congress Standing Committee voted to adopt the law on Saturday, according to Xinhua, and it would come into effect on April 15, 2021. The law would establish systems for biosecurity risk prevention and control, including risk monitoring and early warning, risk investigation and assessment, and information sharing. It would also have provisions to prevent and respond to specific biosecurity risks, including major emerging infectious diseases, epidemic and sudden outbreaks, and biotechnology research, development and application, reported Xinhua.China had announced in May that it aimed to fast-track the passing of the biosecurity law by year-end, following the global coronavirus outbreak which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China has managed to nearly stamp out domestic transmissions of the coronavirus following aggressive measures to curb its spread. New infections detected last week in the eastern coastal city of Qingdao however ended China’s run of about two months without reporting a local case.China’s health commission last reported 13 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for Oct. 17, bringing the mainland’s total number of confirmed cases to 85,672.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-passes-biosecurity-law-to-prevent-infectious-diseases/story-1lGsVi40ms01s1HYG3SZPN.html

The annual award ranks cities in the country based on the number of new rodent treatments carried out in a year. Chicago has retained the top spot for the sixth consecutive time.Orkin, in a press release, said that rats have taken over the streets of Chicago once again.It said that 2020 is an unprecedented year due to the coronavirus pandemic which has forced pests like rats to seek new grounds in search for food. “The pandemic-driven closure of restaurants forced rodents to find new food sources. Without food waste to consume, these pests were seen scavenging new areas and exhibiting unusual or aggressive behaviour,” the company said.Orkin further said that the presence of rats will increase in the approaching colder months “as these pests seek shelter in war areas with available food and water”.It also warned people to “pay extra attention to attractants that entice rats and mice”.The other US cities facing the acute problem of rat infestation are Los Angeles, New York, Washington DC and San Francisco, said Orkin.The rankings are based on survey carried out by the company from September 1 to August 31 every year. These rankings include both residential and commercial treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chicaco-is-rattiest-city-in-the-us-says-survey-by-pest-control-service/story-GS85CjHVilxLpG7MAPVDoM.html

He expected the death toll to rise.Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Aran said the car bombing struck near the entrance of the provincial police chief’s office and other nearby government buildings in the area.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Ghor, which comes amid an uptick in attacks by the Taliban as representatives of the group and Afghan government officials hold their first-ever face-to-face talks in Qatar, where the Taliban have had a political office for many years. The negotiations are meant to end the country’s decades-long war.On Friday, the Taliban agreed to suspend attacks in southern Afghanistan that had displaced thousands of residents in recent days. It came after the US vowed to halt all strikes and night raids in keeping with the peace agreement the US signed with the Taliban in February.The US had been conducting air strikes in support of Afghan forces trying to repel Taliban assaults in Helmand province, which threatened to derail efforts to end Afghanistan’s war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-bombing-in-afghanistan-kills-12-wounds-more-than-100/story-qCButLyhLrgXphWh1ODlZP.html
18-10-2020||World||Japan’s new Prime Minister pushes Abe’s vision ahead of Asia trip||Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, left on Sunday for his first overseas foray since taking over from his predecessor Shinzo Abe last month, heading to Vietnam and Indonesia.The choice to visit southeast Asia underscores Japan’s efforts to counter Chinese influence and build stronger economic and defense ties in the region, much in line with Abe’s vision of “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” that he had pushed with Washington.“ASEAN countries are our important partners for achieving the ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific’ that Japan has been promoting,” Suga told reporters before boarding his flight to Hanoi. “As part of Indo-Pacific nations, Japan is committed to contribute to the region and I will clearly convey this to the people in and outside of our country.” His trip also reflects pandemic realities. With the US tied up with the November 3 election, Suga was unable to head to Washington straight away for talks with Japan’s most important ally after he replaced Abe, who resigned for health reasons.As he emerges from Abe’s shadow with promises to “work for the people”, Suga is proving in some ways to be even more hard line. It has raised hackles within Japan and could rile neighbours, already disgruntled by Abe’s nationalist agenda.Abe had vowed to restore Japan’s waning diplomatic stature and national pride by promoting ultra-nationalistic policies such as traditional family values and amending the post-World War II pacifist constitution to allow a greater overseas military role for his country.Suga is expected to sign a defense equipment and technology transfer agreement with Vietnam as part of efforts to promote exports of Japanese-made military equipment. It’s a signal that Suga is certain to follow in Abe’s footsteps in diplomacy.At home, Suga was best known for his behind-the-scenes work pushing Abe’s agenda as chief Cabinet secretary. He has deftly used his modest background as the son of a strawberry farmer and a teacher and his low-profile and hardworking style to craft a more populist image than his predecessor.With much of the world, including Japan, occupied with battling the pandemic, Suga is focusing more on delivering results. So far, he appears to be trying to distinguish himself from Abe by pumping out consumer-friendly policies meant to showcase his pragmatism and efficiency.With national elections expected within months, there is little time to waste.“What is always on my mind is to tackle what needs to be accomplished without hesitation and quickly, and start from whatever is possible ... and let the people recognize the change,” Suga told reporters on Friday as he marked his first month in office.He has ordered his Cabinet to rush through approvals of several projects such as eliminating the requirement for Japanese-style “hanko” stamps, widely used in place of signatures on business and government documents. He is forging ahead with his earlier efforts to lower cellphone rates and promote use of computers and online government and business.Tackling Japan’s low birthrate and shrinking population head-on, he favours granting insurance coverage for infertility treatments.“So far, Prime Minister Suga is working on policies that are easy to understand and popular to many people, as his administration apparently aims to maintain high support ratings,” said Ryosuke Nishida, a sociologist at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. At the same time, Suga’s refusal to approve the appointments of six professors out of a slate of 105 to the state-funded Science Council of Japan has drawn accusations that he is trying to muzzle dissent and impinge on academic freedoms.The flap looks unlikely to balloon into a serious crisis for Suga, who has not given any explanation apart from saying that his decision was legal and that the group of academics that advises and checks government policies should be acceptable to the public.But it added to concerns that Suga might be more forthright than Abe in quashing opposition: The council, set up in 1949, has repeatedly opposed military technology research at universities, most recently in 2017. Its objections to government funding for such research is contrary to Abe’s efforts to build up Japan’s military capability.Many Japanese, especially academics, are wary of abuse of power given the country’s history of militarism and anti-communist campaigns after the World War II.Historian Masayasu Hosaka, writing in the Mainichi newspaper, described it as a “purge.” The surprise decision sent support ratings for Suga’s Cabinet to just above 50% last week from well above 60% shortly after he took office.Adding to unease over possible interference in academic freedom, the Education Ministry urged public schools to display a black cloth symbolising mourning along with the national flag, and to hold a moment of silence to show respect for late Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, whose state-funded funeral was held on Saturday.Such moves would come as no surprise under Abe, who as grandson of wartime leader Nobusuke Kishi and heir to a political dynasty stuck to his ultra-conservative agenda.But while Suga’s own personal ideology is unknown, he followed Abe’s example in making ritual donations of religious ornaments Saturday to the Yasukuni Shrine to pay respect to the war dead. China and South Korea consider the shrine, which also commemorates executed Japanese war criminals, a symbol of Japan’s militaristic past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-new-prime-minister-pushes-abe-s-vision-ahead-of-asia-trip/story-KMCEfZqDWWbG0sOH8UOJtL.html

His ex-wife Sofia confirmed the news of Stuzhuk’s death on her Instagram profile.After Stuzhuk was rushed back to the hospital, Sofia said he was in a “grave condition” and unconscious. She told her followers that he had “problems with his cardiovascular system... his heart is not coping. His state is extremely grave. No-one can do anything with this,” Sky News reported.“I did everything I could so the father of my three children lives. But nothing depends on me now,” she added. She later announced his death, saying, “Dima is no longer with us. His heart could not stand”.Stuzhuk had shared his experience with his 1.1 million followers on his Instagram handle on October 15. He wrote, “I also thought that there was no Covid… Until I got sick”. “COVID-19 DISEASE IS NOT EPHEME (short-lived)! And heavy,” he had said.Stuzhuk developed breathing problems and stomach-ache while he was in Turkey. After returning from Turkey, he tested positive for Covid-19 and was subsequently admitted to a hospital.

18-10-2020||World||Covid-19 rate among dentists less than 1%: Report||A US-based report suggested that less than 1% of dentists were found to be Covid-19 positive across the globe.It was a first-of-its-kind report based on data collected in June 2020.The result is far below that of other health professionals in the US. In addition, 99% of dentists are using enhanced infection control procedures such as screening protocols and enhanced disinfection practices when treating patients. The report, published online ahead of print by The Journal of the American Dental Association, is the first large-scale collection and publication of U.S. dentists’ infection rates and infection control practices related to Covid-19.“This is very good news for dentists and patients,” said American Dental Association (ADA) Science and Research Institute Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Araujo, D.D.S., M.S., Ph.D., the senior author of the report. “This means that what dentists are doing - heightened infection control and increased attention to patient and dental team safety - is working.”Dr Araujo added that the authors of the report, researchers from the ADA Science and Research Institute and Health Policy Institute based in Chicago, are continuing to collect and will report infection rate data on dentists and have added hygienists to their ongoing survey, in collaboration with the American Dental Hygienists Association. This report focused on nearly 2,200 dentists in June, finding that 82% of dentists were asymptomatic for one month prior to the survey and 16.6% reported getting a Covid-19 test. Those who tested positive were not clustered in any particular geographic region. Among those not tested, less than 1% (0.32) were given a probable Covid-19 diagnosis by a physician. The authors weighted the results to align with U.S. dentists demographically and geographically and found an estimated prevalence of less than 1% (0.9) with a margin of error of 0.5%.“Understanding the risks associated with Covid-19 transmission in the dental setting is critical to improving patient and dental team safety,” said Dr Araujo. “This study brings us another step forward in understanding what works. Dentists are following ADA and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and it’s helping to keep the dental team and their patients as safe as possible.”In March, The New York Times listed dentistry as one of the professions at the highest risk of Covid-19 based on data from O*NET, a database maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor. It was presumed that virus transmission could occur because of the close proximity between dental professionals and patients and because many dental procedures generate aerosols that may contain viral particles from infected individuals.This newly-published report, with the extremely low rate of Covid-19 infection among dentists, supports the effectiveness of the recommendations from the CDC and ADA in preventing virus transmission.The ADA’s guidance calls for the highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) available--masks, goggles and face shields. The ADA’s interim guidance also calls for the use of rubber dams and high-velocity suction whenever possible and hand scaling when cleaning teeth rather than using ultrasonic scaling to minimise aerosols.“The fact that dentistry was named one of the most at-risk professions for infection, but has a far lower prevalence of infection compared to other health professions, is not a coincidence,” said Chief Economist and Vice President of the ADA Health Policy Institute Marko Vujicic, PhD. “The profession has taken this issue extremely seriously, and it shows. We will continue to track the rate of Covid-19 among dentists and other facets of the pandemic affecting dentistry so it can help inform the dental profession and other industries as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-rate-among-dentists-less-than-1-report/story-C0aZ7c3hYyoM6qjQH49BnL.html

It comes just days after 13 members of a rescue team were found dead after a failed attempt to save workers from a hydropower plant engulfed by a landslide.The bodies of two employees at the plant have been found but 15 are still missing.River levels in Quang Tri had reached their highest in two decades, state media said. The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides.Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, often bringing flooding and landslides.More than 130 people were reported dead or missing in natural disasters around the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-soldiers-dead-17-missing-in-vietnam-after-second-big-landslide-in-days/story-3sNSzyeSGoKCdIcWB8TTBP.html

It is, for the first time, that living novel coronavirus has been isolated from the outer packaging of cold-chain food, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Saturday.The authorities in Qingdao, where a new cluster of Covid-19 cases were reported recently, conducted tests on all of its about 11 million population. No new clusters of cases were found after the tests, the local authorities said.In July, China suspended imports of frozen shrimp after the deadly virus was found on packages and the inner wall of a container.The CDC said it detected and isolated the living virus on the outer packaging of imported frozen cod in Qingdao. The finding was made during an investigation to trace the source of recent infections reported in the city. It has proved that contact with packaging contaminated by living novel coronavirus could lead to infection, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the CDC statement.The statement, however, did not mention the country from where the package was imported.The agency said the risk of cold-chain food circulating in China’s market being contaminated by the novel coronavirus is very low, citing recent nucleic acid test results for samples taken from the business.A total of 2.98 million samples had been tested across the country’s 24 provincial-level regions by September 15, including 670,000 taken from cold-chain food or food packaging, 1.24 million from working staff and 1.07 million from the environment.Only 22 samples from cold-chain food or food packaging tested positive for the virus, the CDC said.Meanwhile, the National Health Commission on Sunday said 13 confirmed Covid-19 cases, all arriving from outside the mainland, were reported on Saturday. There was no new locally transmitted Covid-19 case, it said. Of the imported cases, five were reported in Shanghai, four in Guangdong, two in Shaanxi and one each in Tianjin and Sichuan.As of Saturday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland reached 85,672. Altogether 80,786 patients have been discharged after recovery, while the death toll stood at 4,634, the Commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/living-coronavirus-found-on-frozen-food-packaging-in-china/story-QvOCVqGhsJlJkttgDoPhYI.html

There is foreign ministry Iran which says positive things and expresses ideas or makes statements that could be construed as supportive of a peace process, but there is another Iran that would like to keep the US entangled in a war that they would like to be unwinnable,” said Khalilzad, as quoted by Tolo News.Even though the US Special Representative called Pakistan’s efforts in the Afghan Peace Process as “positive”, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar warned that terrorism in Pakistan is publicly acknowledged by their own government. “Terrorism from Pakistan continues and terrorism from Pakistan remains publicly acknowledged by their government as a policy that they are justifying. (It) makes it very hard to conduct normal relations with them,” said Jaishankar at an online event hosted by the Asia Society.He added, “They’ve blocked connectivity between India and Afghanistan...I think until we address that problem, this challenge of how do you have a normal relationship with this very unique neighbour, is a very troubling issue for our foreign policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-official-says-al-qaeda-remains-close-to-taliban-in-afghanistan/story-2UvU0qY5pmoXaVTPkFxgYM.html

The antibodies, I think the antibodies are the best thing, we’re gonna make it free,” Trump said at his campaign rally in Janesville, Wisconsin on Saturday. “This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression,” Trump added.Earlier in the day, speaking at another rally in Muskegon, Michigan, Trump warned that a Democratic victory in the November elections could make the coronavirus situation worse in Michigan, as well as the US as a whole.“Democrats would terminate our recovery with a draconian unscientific lockdown like your governor is doing right now,” Trump said, stressing that “Biden will shut down the country, delay the vaccine and prolong the pandemic.”Trump resumed his campaign trail earlier this month, holding his first rally (since his positive COVID19 diagnosis) in Sanford, Florida.Trump told his supporters in Florida that “whatever the hell they gave me” was going to be distributed around US hospitals.Trump was hospitalised with COVID-19 at the Walter Reed Military Medical Center on October 2, not long after announcing on Twitter that he and his wife Melania had tested positive for the coronavirus. While at Walter Reed, Trump was treated with an experimental antibody cocktail that targets the coronavirus spike protein.White House Physician, Dr Sean Conley, announced on October 12 that Trump had tested negative for COVID-19 on consecutive days.First Lady Melania Trump announced on Wednesday that the First Family’s son Barron, 14, had also contracted COVID-19 but exhibited no symptoms and has recently tested negative.Trump told his supporters in Wisconsin on Saturday that since Barron was young his immune system was very strong and he was able to easily overcome the virus, like many other young people.

If Biden wins, China will own America--they pay him (Biden) a fortune. He works for China,” Trump said at his reelection rally in Michigan.Trump later during the course of the rally went on to label Biden as a corrupt politician adding that the Biden family is “a criminal enterprise”.“I did more in 47 months than what sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. The Democrats are pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy social security,” he added. The US President further hit out at Beijing for “flowing in” the ‘ChinaVirus’ (Covid-19) saying that the US was coming together before the outbreak.“The country was coming together and then we had the ChinaVirus flowed in. This country was coming together because there is nothing like success. Success was bringing people together,” he added.Trump said that the US has “saved millions of lives” and said that the projected deaths due to Covid-19 were supposed to be 2.2 million “but the fake news never says that”.“We had this horrible plague that came in from China and we are not going to forget that it came from China. It went from all over the world. We had signed an incredible deal with China and ink hadn’t even dried, then this happened,” Trump said further.Trump during the conclusion of his rally made the statement that if elected President, he would make the US into a manufacturing superpower and “end our reliance on China once and for all.” The US Presidential Elections took place on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-was-coming-together-before-china-virus-trump/story-aoOxTsA9WVmqoHkC2wsNwJ.html

This weakens the integrity of our institutions, which we do not want,” he said as quoted by Dawn.“But what can we do when the army is deployed at polling stations in general elections [and] Imran Khan says in every speech ‘this or that institution is with me, we are all on the same page’?” Bilawal asked, accusing the prime minister of using institutions as “political props”.“When we take the establishment’s name, we realise that only today’s generals or retired generals [are not to be blamed] but it is a part of our history that we either received dictatorship or a controlled democracy,” he said.According to Dawn, he made these remarks while speaking to reporters in Karachi after reviewing arrangements for the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) second power show, which is scheduled to be held in the city today.Earlier PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, while addressing the PDM rally via video link from London, accused the security establishment of being behind his ouster as Prime Minister and of “bringing Imran Khan into power”.The former Prime Minister named Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed alleging that they were responsible for making a “state above the state” and for the presence of “two governments” in Pakistan.A day after former Pakistan premier Nawaz Sharif tore into ‘puppet government’ of the country during Gurjanwala anti-government rally, a disgruntled Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday lashed out at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo for allegedly maligning the top army leadership, and deemed as “a circus”, the opposition’s power show.Remarking on the speech given by Sharif during the opposition rally, Prime Minister Khan said the PML-N leader was using inappropriate “language” against the army and ISI chiefs at a time when Pakistani soldiers were constantly sacrificing their lives for the nation, Dawn reported.Pakistan opposition leaders along with an “ocean” of people made their way to Gujranwala for the first show of strength of their anti-government campaign.The recently-formed Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) held its first anti-government protest in Gujranwala on Friday. The opposition comprising 11 parties including PML-N (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz), PPP (Pakistan People’s Party), and JUI-F (Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl) will be holding the Gujranwala Rally.The anti-government rally has been organised to protest against army atrocities and demand for PM Imran Khan’s resignation in the backdrop of corruption, economic slowdown, and poor governance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bilawal-bhutto-blames-pm-imran-khan-for-opposition-taking-names-of-army-generals/story-SUYO3bjY1TWf1fzBKMJtvJ.html

The newspaper, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, said Chinese officials had issued repeated warnings through multiple channels to US government officials.The paper said China’s message was the United States should end prosecutions of Chinese scholars in US courts, or Americans in China could find themselves in violation of Chinese law.A State Department advisory on Sept. 14 warning against travel to China said the Chinese government uses arbitrary detention and exit bans for US citizens and others “to gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.”The White House referred questions to the State Department, which said in an emailed statement that it stresses “to the Chinese government – including at the highest levels – our concern about China’s coercive use of exit bans on US citizens and citizens of other countries, and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process.”The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.The Trump administration has increasingly accused China of suing cyber operations and espionage to steal US technological, military and other know-how in a strategy to supplant the United States as the world’s leading financial and military power. Beijing denies the allegations.In July, the Justice Department said the FBI had arrested three Chinese nationals for allegedly concealing memberships in the Peoples Liberation Army when applying for visas to conduct research at US academic institutions.Last month, the United States said it had revoked visas for more than 1,000 Chinese nationals under a presidential measure denying entry to students and researchers deemed security risks, a move China called a violation of human rights. At the time, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States continued to welcome “legitimate students and scholars from China who do not further the Chinese Communist Party’s goals of military dominance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-detain-us-citizens-in-response-to-prosecution-of-chinese-military-affiliated-scholars-report/story-spUmToHzPcD6ovcS1wCzGO.html

Whitmer, a Democrat, blamed Trump for creating an environment that encourages radical criminal behavior.The president earlier this year issued a tweet urging citizens to “liberate” their states amid lockdowns to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that the kidnapping plot took root prior to Trump’s tweet.“You got to get your governor to open up your state,” Trump said at the Muskegon rally. The crowd responded with a “lock her up” chant, to which Trump replied “lock ‘em all up.”Trump is set to deliver a second rally later in the evening in Janesville, Wisconsin.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radical-left-will-destroy-american-way-of-life-trump-attacks-democrats-over-toppling-statues-of-slave-owners/story-iaXSlJPfyzdQV38hG9i9DK.html

The book was originally published in the 1970s and has been republished in New York.The book was released decades after Pakistan’s Operation Gulmarg in Jammu and Kashmir admits to the role of Pakistan in the conflicts in the valley.Giving out minute details of Pakistan’s aggression in Kashmir, he said that the crisis was hatched and formulated in Lahore and Pindi.The author wrote that at the beginning of September 1947, he was asked by Mian Iftikharuddin, then a leader in the Muslim League (the ruling political party) to prepare a plan to take over Kashmir.“Ultimately, I wrote a plan under the title of “Armed Revolt inside Kashmir”. As open interference or aggression by Pakistan was obviously undesirable, it was proposed that our efforts should be concentrated upon strengthening the Kashmiris themselves internally -- and at the same time taking steps to prevent the arrival of armed civilians or military assistance from India into Kashmir,” Khan said.Giving proof of top leaderships’ role in the crisis, he said, “I was called to Lahore for a conference with the prime minister of Pakistan Mr Liaqat Ali Khan. On arrival there, I first had to attend a preliminary conference at the Provincial Government Secretariat in the office of Sardar Shaukat Hayat Khan who was then a minister in the Punjab government. I saw copies of my proposed plan in the hands of some...”“On October 22, the operation began with Pakistani forces crossing the border and attacking Muzaffarabad and Domel on October 24 from where the Dogra troops had to withdraw. The next day these troops moved forward on the Srinagar road and again took on the Dogras at Uri... On October 27, India intervened and sent troops to Kashmir,” he wrote.Meanwhile, on the evening of October 27, Pakistan Prime Minister held a conference at Lahore to consider the situation arising out of Kashmir’s accession and India’s military intervention. “The Prime Minister held an unofficial conference at Lahore to consider the situation arising out of Kashmir’s accession and India’s military intervention. At this conference, among others, were also present Colonel Iskander Mirza (then defence secretary, later to be a governor-general), Chaudhri Mohd All (then secretary-general, later to be a prime minister), Abdul Qayum Khan, then chief minister of the Frontier Province and Nawab Mamdot, then CM of Punjab. Brigadier Slier Khan and I were also invited,” the author wrote.He further said, “At this conference, I proposed that an attempt should be made to liquidate Jammu in order to block the only road, along which India could send reinforcements into the valley and the rest of Kashmir. I did not suggest that troops be used for this purpose or that the government should get involved in this. I suggested only that tribesmen may be allowed to make the attempt. I thought that three lashkars of a thousand each should be used.”In the book, he also testified that the Pakistani Army had worked with the tribal forces in various incursions in Kashmir.After being appointed as the military adviser to the prime minister, on October 28, 1947, he had “rushed back to Pindi to ensure that the tribesmen received their ammunition in time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-book-by-pakistan-s-ex-major-general-accepts-country-s-role-in-kashmir-conflict/story-dDtfiye4V8EcgdD0Vf38LN.html
