Dr Shaw Dooley, a lead specialist on the team said, the president “is in exceptionally good spirits” and conveyed to them “I feel like I could walk out of here today”.Trump was shifted to Walter Reed on Friday “out of an abundance of caution”, the White House had said. And in a video message he tweeted after reaching the military medical facility, the president said, “I think I’m doing very well, but we’re going to make sure that things work out. The first lady is doing very well. So thank you very much I appreciate it I will never forget.”President Trump had waved to reporters as he walked to the helicopter waiting on White House grounds to fly him to Walter Reed, a short distance from DC. But he did not answer questions shouted out by reporters. He wore a mask, as did others with him, including his chief of staff Mark Meadows.Earlier in the afternoon Kayleigh McEnany, press secretary to the president, had said in a statement that “out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.”The presidential suite at the medical facility in Bethesda in the adjoining state of Maryland, are large and roomy and include a conference room, a living room and a bedroom.Dr. Conley, the president’s physician, had said earlier in a statement Trump was “fatigued but in good spirits” and had been administered a single 8-gram dose of a cocktail of antibodies against the coronavirus, which is an experimental drug that has not been approved for use yet.The doctor that the president was also given zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin, and a daily aspirin.The first lady “remains well with only a mild cough and headache”, the physician said, adding, the rest of the first family had tested negative.But aides and staff who had been around president in the last some days either at an event at the White House or on the campaign trail continue to test positive. The included Kellyanne Conway, the former adviser to Trump, and Bill Stepien, head of the Trump re-election campaign.The Trump campaign, which has either cancelled all of the president’s rallies for now and taken all of these to be addressed by family members online only, kept up attacks on Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, signaling the urgency of the situations with election day just a month from now.“Do you regret repeatedly attacking President Trump in a Michigan speech on the same day he was diagnosed with COVID-19?” the Trump campaign posted as the “question of the day” for Biden on Saturday, pointing to the former vice-president’s remarks on the economy and jobs.But the campaign left out Biden’s concluding remarks: “I want to say God bless you, may God protect the first family and every family that is dealing with this virus, and may God protect our troops.” The Biden campaign has also pulled down its negative ads on Trump, but the former vice-president continues to campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-doing-very-well-says-medical-team-at-military-hospital/story-xf8UDDNWG7TanYvz7DWe3K.html
03-10-2020||World||Covid-19 positive Donald Trump in exceptionally good spirits, fever-free, breathing fine: Doctors||Doctors have said that President Donald Trump is in “exceptionally good spirits,” fever-free and not having difficulty breathing, news agency Associated Press reported.President Trump, First lady Melania Trump tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday just a month before the United States is set to witness the grand Presidential election. Additionally, several members of Trump’s staff in the White House have also tested positive for the viral contagion.As a precautionary treatment protocol, Trump was moved to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for the weekend, from where he is expected to carry out his duties from the hospital’s presidential suite.The White House physician said he was being treated with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after taking another experimental drug at the White House, AP reported.“President Trump remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,” said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany earlier. “Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.”Several new cases have emerged among some of Trump’s advisers and allies who attended the White House event where Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, was introduced. Among them are former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Senator Mike Lee and North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis. Though the ceremony was held outdoors, attendees sat closely together and few wore masks. Some also mingled at a smaller event inside the White House.Due to the viral infection, Trump has been forced to cancel all campaigning activities and rallies just a month before the US citizens will elect their next President. The next presidential debate with Joe Biden on October 15 also stands undecided in the light of Covid-19 safety protocol.As of Saturday, the United States remains the worst affected nation because of the viral contagion with more than 7.3 million cases of the infection and 2,08,782 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-positive-donald-trump-in-exceptionally-good-spirits-fever-free-breathing-fine-doctors/story-FLPzuNAX7c2i9ihGZUYIKM.html

Joint operations by the London police, Microsoft and Indian police forces have so far led to action against 37 call centres and 88 arrests.Alex Rothwell of the City of London Police said, “Our ongoing close working relationship with Microsoft and the Indian authorities has led to sustained action against this type of fraud, demonstrating that we can and will seek out criminals wherever they are.“At the time of the lockdown in India, we saw a sharp decline in reports of Computer Software Service Fraud in the UK, but we know that criminals adapt quickly to continue to try to defraud people.”Rothwell added, “As more people work from home, the need to prevent fraud of this nature has become more urgent. We welcome this enforcement action on the part of the Central Bureau of Investigation and will support their efforts to bring offenders to justice through the Indian courts.”The modus operandi of the companies included displaying pop-up messages on the victims’ computers, warning them about serious technical problems with their devices, including the presence of malware infection.Victims were then advised to call a helpline to gain assistance and were charged a premium fee for the “fix” and “on-going support”. Victims were made to pay this fee online or over the phone, meaning their financial details were shared with criminals.Some home addresses of people associated with the various companies were also visited, the police said, adding that the CBI is continuing with investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-pat-for-india-s-cbi-from-city-of-london-police-for-drive-against-cyber-fraud/story-JlJIf05B5FAnvFMgMtVy3L.html
03-10-2020||World||Malaysia’s coronavirus cases rise by record for second straight day||Malaysia’s coronavirus cases climbed by a record for a second day as the government sought ways to curb infections without resorting to a strict lockdown.There were 317 confirmed cases on Oct. 3, the highest single-day increase for the country since the pandemic began, according to the health ministry. About half of the new cases were found in the state of Sabah, which has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the country, followed by 102 in Kedah state. One more person died from the disease, bringing total fatalities to 137.Malaysia won’t return to a nationwide lockdown, defense minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said in a Saturday briefing. It was only in June that Malaysia allowed most activities to resume after imposing restrictions on people’s movement that pushed the economy to shrink 17.1% in the second quarter.Instead, the government will step up enforcement of its maritime borders in Sabah, located on the island of Borneo, and limit foreign delegates visiting the country, Ismail said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-s-coronavirus-cases-rise-by-record-for-second-straight-day/story-nwzuxdwVX13HQUvkRD1GLL.html
03-10-2020||World||Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham admits sending sexually suggestive texts||The Democratic challenger in North Carolina’s closely contested US Senate contest has admitted to exchanging sexually suggestive text messages with a woman who’s not his wife, but he said he will not drop out of the race.Cal Cunningham apologized late Friday for the text message exchanges in which he tells the woman he wants to kiss her and she says she wants to spend the night with him. The messages were first reported by the website NationalFile.com.“I have hurt my family, disappointed my friends, and am deeply sorry. The first step in repairing those relationships is taking complete responsibility, which I do,” Cunningham said in a statement.Cunningham’s admission regarding the text messages, along with his opponent US Senate Thom Tillis testing positive for Covid-19, could reshape a closely contested campaign that’s considered key to determining the power balance in the Senate.But Cunningham, who is married with two children, added that he’s not dropping out of the Senate race: “I will continue to work to earn the opportunity to fight for the people of our state.”Screengrabs of the messages show Cunningham told public relations strategist Arlene Guzman Todd, “Would make my day to roll over and kiss you about now,” to which she replies, “You’re so sweet. I would enjoy that.”Another shows Guzman Todd tell Cunningham, “the only thing I want on my to do list is you,” to which Cunningham replies, “Sounds so hot and so fun!”A spokeswoman for Cunningham’s campaign, Rachel Petri, confirmed the authenticity of the text messages.It’s unclear when the messages were sent, but at one point Cunningham says he’s “Nervous about the next 100 days,” which could be a reference to the Senate election. One hundred days before the election would be July 26.An email trying to reach Guzman Todd at the communications firm that lists her as an employee wasn’t immediately returned Saturday morning.Earlier Friday, Cunningham’s opponent, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, announced that he tested positive for Covid-19 but said he has no symptoms. Cunningham tweeted that he wished Tillis a “quick recovery” and said he would get tested himself after the two men shared a debate stage Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-candidate-cal-cunningham-admits-sending-sexually-suggestive-texts/story-FpCTb6967C1x2ntXmi02xN.html
03-10-2020||World||Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine could be rolled out within 6 months: Report||There is growing hope that a vaccine against coronavirus may be given the green light by health regulators by the end of this year to be rolled out for a vaccination programme in six months’ time or even less, according to a UK media report. The vaccine candidate under trial by University of Oxford scientists in collaboration with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is the furthest in the process of trials and, according to a report in ‘The Times’, it could be given the required clearances by Christmas in December. The newspaper quoted UK government sources involved in the making and distribution of vaccines as saying that a full vaccine roll-out programme for adults could take six months or less after approval.Also read: 1 vaccine may have reached initial efficacy test “We are looking at closer to six months and it is likely to be far shorter than that,” a government source said. Under a protocol developed by the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, any approved vaccine will then be given to all over 65s, followed by younger adults at higher risk, which could include those from ethnic minorities as well as those with serious health issues based on their higher risk from the deadly virus. People over 50 will be next in line, with younger adults at the back of the queue. The UK government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine once it is ready for roll-out and the doses are being manufactured before it has been shown to be successful in order to save time once it clears all the regulatory stages. According to the newspaper report, scientists on the trial are hopeful that they will get results before the end of this year, and that they will at the very least show that it prevents 50 per cent of infections, the threshold for success. If it is approved by the regulators, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is said to be in a position to begin mass vaccination almost immediately.Also read: ‘A bridge to the Covid-19 vaccine’: Trump given Regeneron’s experimental drug There are others within the UK government, however, who are more cautious on the timelines as vaccinating every adult is a big challenge. A Royal Society report this week, co-authored by an Indian-origin scientist, warned of the massive uphill task ahead in producing and distributing a vaccine. “Even when the vaccine is available, it does not mean within a month everybody will be vaccinated. We’re talking about six to nine months to a year after a vaccine is approved,” said Professor Nilay Shah, head of chemical engineering at Imperial College London. The report called for the criteria for vaccine prioritisation to be “defined and made explicit” and then “public dialogue and engagement to manage expectations and understanding of vaccine effectiveness, safety, side effects, availability, and access”. The government’s Department of Health sought to downplay the findings and stressed that its planning process will ensure a speedy roll-out. “This study fails to reflect the enormous amount of planning and preparation that has taken place across government to quickly roll out a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine,” said a department spokesperson “We are confident we have adequate provision or transport, PPE [personal protective equipment] and logistical expertise to deploy a Covid-19 vaccine across the country as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-rolled-out-within-six-months-report/story-K25l6S7snlj7XtXaTFrWXL.html
03-10-2020||World||Covid-19 positive Donald Trump at military hospital; new cases among allies emerge||A feverish and fatigued President Donald Trump was spending the weekend at a military hospital for treatment of Covid-19, as new cases emerged among some of his top advisers and allies. Attention focused in particular on last Saturday’s White House event introducing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, with several attendees announcing they had tested positive for the virus.Among them: former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Though the ceremony announcing Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination was held outdoors, attendees sat closely together and few wore masks. Some also mingled at a smaller event inside the White House.The White House said Trump’s expected stay of “a few days” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was precautionary and he would continue to work from the hospital’s presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties. The White House physician said he was being treated with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after taking another experimental drug at the White House.The decision for the president to leave the White House for the hospital capped a day of whipsaw events in Washington Friday. The president, who has spent months playing down the threat of the virus, was forced to cancel all campaign events a month before the election as he fought a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans and is hitting others in his orbit as well.Trump walked out of the White House on Friday evening wearing a mask and gave a thumbs-up to reporters but did not speak before boarding Marine One. Members of the aircrew, Secret Service agents and White House staff wore face coverings to protect themselves from the president onboard the helicopter.In a video taped before leaving for Walter Reed, Trump said, “I think I’m doing very well, but we’re going to make sure that things work out.” He remained fully president, all authority intact.“Going welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!” he wrote in his first tweet from the hospital Friday night.Trump first revealed that he had tested positive in a tweet about 1 a.m. Friday — hours after he returned from a Thursday afternoon political fundraiser. He had gone ahead to the event, saying nothing to the crowd though knowing he had been exposed to an aide with the disease that has infected millions in America and killed more than 1 million people worldwide.First lady Melania Trump also tested positive and has said she has mild symptoms. She is believed to be isolating at the White House.Also testing positive: Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien. Campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Stepien received a diagnosis Friday and is experiencing “mild flu-like symptoms.” Stepien, who joined Trump at Tuesday’s first presidential debate, plans to quarantine until he recovers.Trump’s diagnosis came during an already turbulent period in Washington and around the world, with the US gripped in a heated presidential election and the pandemic taking a heavy human and economic toll. Trump’s immediate campaign events were all canceled, and his next debate with Democrat Joe Biden, scheduled for Oct. 15, is now in question.Trump has been trying all year — and as recently as Wednesday — to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is past, and he has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable. He has mostly refused to abide by basic public health guidelines — including those issued by his own administration — such as wearing face coverings in public and practicing social distancing. Until he tested positive, he continued to hold campaign rallies that drew thousands of often maskless supporters.“I felt no vulnerability whatsoever,” he told reporters back in May. With the election coming up in a month, he is urging states and cities to “reopen” and reduce or eliminate shutdown rules despite continuing virus outbreaks.The White House tried to maintain an atmosphere of business-as-usual on Friday.“President Trump remains in good spirts, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day,” said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. “Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.”The president’s physician said in a memo that Trump received a dose of an experimental antibody combination by Regeneron that is in clinical trials. Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley said Trump “remains fatigued but in good spirits” and that a team of experts was evaluating both the president and first lady in regard to next steps.Late Friday, Conley issued an update that said Trump is “doing very well” and is “not requiring any supplemental oxygen.” But he said that, “in consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate remdesivir therapy,” an antiviral medication.“He has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably,” the doctor wrote.The first lady, who is 50, has a “mild cough and headache,” Conley reported, and the remainder of the first family, including the Trumps’ son Barron, who lives at the White House, tested negative.Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide.Both Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris have tested negative, their campaign said. Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus Friday morning and “remains in good health,” his spokesman said. Pence was to resume his campaign schedule after his test.Barrett, who was with Trump and many others on Saturday and has been on a Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers, also tested negative, the White House said. It was confirmed that she had a mild case of COVID earlier this year and has now recovered.Many White House and senior administration officials were undergoing tests,, but the full scale of the outbreak around the president may not be known for some time as it can take days for an infection to be detectable by a test. Officials with the White House Medical Unit were tracing the president’s contacts.Trump’s handling of the pandemic has already been a flashpoint in his race against Biden, who spent much of the summer off the campaign trail and at his home in Delaware, citing concern about the virus. Biden has since resumed a more active campaign schedule, but with small, socially distanced crowds. He also regularly wears a mask in public, something Trump mocked him for at Tuesday night’s debate.“I don’t wear masks like him,” Trump said. “Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-positive-donald-trump-at-military-hospital-new-cases-among-allies-emerge/story-KQQshhrLMUZxT58JxcNfSK.html
03-10-2020||World||The day Covid-19 came to Donald Trump’s White House||Donald Trump’s calendar for October 1 showed a typical day for the president: time for tweeting in the morning, and a trip to his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course in the afternoon to raise money for his cash-strapped re-election campaign.But well out of public view, a crisis was building. A small number of officials at the White House, including Trump, learned that morning that one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Few people inside or outside the White House were told, and there was never serious thought given to canceling the Bedminster fundraiser, expected to raise $5 million -- where the more money donors gave, the closer they got to Trump, according to a person who attended.The White House says the fundraiser was deemed safe. But there were signs that not all was right.For one thing, some aides who had been in proximity to Hicks on Wednesday -- including White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany -- were hastily pulled off the manifest for the president’s helicopter and replaced.Then Trump steered clear of reporters assembled for the helicopter takeoff, eschewing his normal back-and-forth and cutting an unusually wide path as he strode from the Oval Office. He also avoided journalists waiting under the wing of Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews and on the flight to New Jersey and back.Photo LineAt the event, Trump did the usual photo line customary for VIP donors -- those who had given between $50,000 and $250,000. Inside an expansive room, the president stood in front of a presidential flag and an American flag, with tape on the ground representing a “do not cross” line six feet from guests.One attendee recalled a couple of things: Trump made small talk, and he didn’t wear a mask. He also cut his visit short, the second time in as many days the president seemed to be hurrying through his events.After returning to the White House, the day took an even darker turn for Trump as he announced he had tested positive for the virus.Just 26 hours after departing the fundraiser, he landed in Marine One to be admitted to Walter Reed hospital. White House aides, familiar with Trump’s fear of germs and aversion to hospitals, say it’s a signal doctors are genuinely concerned about his condition.The impact on the president and the White House has been profound. His re-election campaign, already struggling to gain ground against Joe Biden, has scrapped plans for fundraisers and rallies -- Trump’s political lifeblood -- with little more than four weeks before Election Day.Inside the White House and his campaign, some despondent aides fear the election is lost and the president is sicker than is known. Several officials said they had been provided no more information about his condition than ordinary Americans, who have been left practically in the dark a day after his diagnosis.Trump was administered an experimental “antibody cocktail” by White House doctors, but not much more information has been released, including whether his blood-oxygen levels are falling or even if he has a fever.Little of it was imaginable Thursday morning. This account of the day Trump learned Hicks was infected is based on interviews with multiple administration and campaign officials, some of whom requested anonymity to describe behind-the-scenes details of one of the most significant days of the Trump presidency.In the DarkHicks’s illness came as a surprise to some of the small group of aides informed Thursday morning of her diagnosis, even after traveling with her the night prior. Hicks began feeling ill during Trump’s trip to Minnesota, and when Air Force One landed in Duluth, she holed up in the plane’s private office while other staffers attended a campaign rally.Some White House aides on the trip were more focused on the president, concerned about his lethargic behavior. His rally speech that evening was less than an hour; Trump has regularly spoken more than twice as long during other recent campaign stops.Upon returning to Washington, Hicks waited until all other staff members had exited Air Force One before making her way off the plane -- limiting possible exposure and protecting her privacy. On Thursday morning, only a few aides -- and the president -- were told that Hicks had, in fact, tested positive.The secrecy came in part from a desire on the part of White House aides to shield Hicks, who has attained a level of celebrity while working for Trump -- intended or not. She is regarded by many in Trump’s inner circle as both a close personal friend and victim of unfair media scrutiny. During her first stint in the White House, in 2017, she became tabloid fodder after her then-boyfriend -- former staff secretary Rob Porter -- was alleged to have physically abused his ex-wives.As one of the president’s most trusted and loyal aides, she is frequently at his side.Among the White House officials in the dark about Hicks’s condition was the press secretary, according to McEnany herself. She held a Thursday morning briefing with White House reporters even as a contact-tracing effort was quietly underway in the West Wing.‘Two Standards of Health’During the briefing, McEnany defended the Trump campaign for staging rallies where social distancing measures have been routinely ignored, arguing the media should set the similar expectations for large protests against racial injustice.“There really seems to be two standards of health in this country, one for Trump supporters and one for everyone else,” McEnany said.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said he learned of Hicks’s positive test just as Trump left aboard Marine One, bound for his fundraiser.“We actually pulled some of the people that had been traveling and in close contact,” Meadows said.But there was little discussion of scrapping the president’s Bedminster trip, where he was expected to raise $5 million for a campaign facing an unexpected shortfall of cash.‘Deemed Safe’“It was deemed safe for the president to go,” McEnany said Friday. “He socially distanced, it was an outdoor event.”CDC guidelines say that people who have been in close contact with infected people, as Trump was with Hicks, should stay home for 14 days and maintain social distance from others at all times. It’s unknown if Trump was tested before leaving for his fundraiser.At Bedminster, guests began arriving at about 12:30 p.m. About 60 people were at the VIP cocktail party-style event, none of them wearing masks, according to a person who attended. The crowd for Trump’s remarks later numbered about 150.Those who donated between $35,000 and $250,000 had to undergo a nasal swab test for coronavirus that returns a result within 15 minutes. Top donors would have access to a roundtable discussion and a photo with the president, according to a Republican official.VIP PerkAs soon as the president arrived, VIP ticket holders who had given between $50,000 and $250,000 were invited to take a photo.Donors entered the room and were instructed to stand 6 feet away from Trump at all times. The president made small talk, the person who attended said.All of the Republican Party staff and Trump Bedminster staff wore masks, the person said. At no point during the event did the president wear a mask.Comedian Joe Piscopo was among the donors who attended. He described the event as “very social-distanced” while disputing a New York Times report that the president appeared worn down.“He was at the top of his game,” Piscopo said. “He looked strong and sounded great.”End of NormalcyThe rally would be one of the last moments of normalcy for Trump before he confronted the virus that has stalked the final year of his presidency.Within minutes of the president’s return to the White House Thursday evening, aides began receiving inquiries from a Bloomberg News reporter about Hicks’s health -- the first time some had heard about her condition.Bloomberg first reported Hicks’s infection later that evening.Even late Thursday afternoon, few in the White House appeared aware of the potential exposure. Staffers -- including a White House press aide who subsequently tested positive for the virus -- were working at their desks, not wearing masks.The Hicks revelation renewed concern among aides worried that Trump had seemed off his game in recent days. The decision was made for the president to undergo a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, coronavirus test, regarded by White House doctors as more reliable than the rapid tests the president, top officials and reporters receive regularly at the White House.The PCR test is more invasive, however, and the president has previously complained about how deep the nasal swab goes -- remarking that there was “nothing pleasant about it.”Interview With HannityAs Trump awaited his results, he decided to continue with a previously scheduled phone interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Live on air, he announced that he and first lady Melania Trump were awaiting the results of coronavirus tests because of Hicks’s positive result.“I just went out with a test,” Trump said. “I’ll see what -- because we spend a lot of time. And the first lady just went out with a test also. So, whether we quarantine, or whether we have it, I don’t know.”Around midnight, the results came in: The president and first lady had contracted the virus. Trump and his communications staff scrambled to figure out how to reveal the news to the American people, settling on a presidential tweet and then the release of a memo from the White House physician confirming the diagnosis.“We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,” Trump wrote at 12:54 a.m. on Friday. “We will get through this TOGETHER!”It was last the American public would hear from their president for nearly 18 hours, when after arriving at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he posted a video on Twitter.“I think I’m doing well,” he said. “But we’re going to make sure that things work out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-day-covid-19-came-to-donald-trump-s-white-house/story-pPMBy639s3NqdYJpM8CgWK.html

03-10-2020||World||Nobel Prizes and Covid-19: Slow, basic science may pay off||While the world wants flashy quick fixes for everything, especially massive threats like the coronavirus and global warming, next week’s Nobel Prizes remind us that in science, slow and steady pays off.It may soon do so again.Science builds upon previous work, with thinkers “standing on the shoulders of giants,” as Isaac Newton put it, and it starts with basic research aimed at understanding a problem before fixing it. It’s that type of basic science that the Nobels usually reward, often years or decades after a discovery, because it can take that long to realize the implications.Slow and steady success in science has made researchers hopeful in the fight against the pandemic. It even offers a glimmer of climate optimism.Many years of advances in basic molecular science, some of them already Nobel Prize-winning, have given the world tools for fast virus identification and speeded up the development of testing. And now they tantalize us with the prospect of Covid-19 treatments and ultimately a vaccine, perhaps within a few months.“This could be science’s finest hour. This could be the time when we deliver, not just for the nation but the world, the miracle that will save us,” said geophysicist Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences.The coronavirus was sequenced in a matter of weeks, testing became available quickly, and vaccines that would normally take years may be developed in a year or less, and “it’s all been built on the back of basic science advances that have been developed in the past three decades,” McNutt said.She pointed to gene sequencing and polymerase chain reaction, which allows for multiple copying of precise DNA segments. That latter discovery won the 1993 Nobel in chemistry.And even further back, in 1984, the Nobel in medicine went to a team for theories on how to manipulate the immune system using something called monoclonal antibodies. Now those antibodies are one of the best hopes for a treatment for the coronavirus.“Despite the politics, despite whatever other things are slowing us down, Nobel Prize-winning discoveries from 20 years ago are going to be key to treating and preventing COVID next year,” said Sudip Parikh, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “That was made possible by basic research.’‘Basic research comes first. The benefits are typically reaped only later, in what is called applied science.“Without basic science, you won’t have cutting-edge applied science,” said Frances Arnold, a Caltech chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel in chemistry.Nobel-winning basic research has allowed us to see the world in a whole new light.Do you like white, efficient LED light to replace the nasty fluorescent hum of industrial lighting or energy-gobbling incandescent bulbs? A key part of those lights are blue light-emitting diodes, and their discovery won the 2014 Nobel in physics, said astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, head of the Hayden Planetarium.How about seeing better, without glasses, thanks to LASIK surgery? That stemmed from research into precise lasers that led to the 2018 Nobel for physics, but was also the product of an accident in which a researcher got lasered in the eye, said microbiologist Rita Colwell, former head of the U.S. National Science Foundation.And those lasers used concepts that date back to Albert Einstein, said British Royal Astronomer Martin Rees.John Mather, who won the 2006 physics Nobel for cosmology, which is the study of the origin of the universe and is thus the ultimate basic science, said nearly everything we use around us is there because of basic science.“Engineers and entrepreneurs use this knowledge to build commercial empires,” he said. “Doctors use what we find to develop new cures. Architects build houses with modern materials. Airplanes are designed at the very edge of what is possible. Even cars are completely dependent on basic science.’’But some people don’t make that connection. Adam Riess, who won the 2011 Nobel in physics, and Tyson said this is especially noticeable when people who deny climate science or vaccine effectiveness do so while reaching fellow nonbelievers on smartphones and Google searches made possible because of basic science research.“Maybe, maybe science needs a PR agent, OK?” Tyson said in an interview. “Maybe with a new discovery in science in a way that affects your life outcomes, the TV commercials say, ‘Did you know this? This thing that you’re using was invented here in this lab by this person. And it was brought to market by this company. And now you’re using it and enjoying it.’ Stop in silence. ‘You’re welcome.’”As for fixing climate change, Mexican chemist Mario Molina has hope that the world will be able to solve the problem because of the work that led to his 1995 Nobel Prize.He and others discovered that industrial chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons were reaching high into the atmosphere and eating away at Earth’s protective ozone layer. He discovered this many years before an ozone hole developed over Antarctica.His work and the opening of the hole led to a 1987 international agreement to ban those ozone-depleting chemicals, and the hole has started shrinking. Now Molina hopes that kind of action can be applied to what he calls “the climate emergency.”“That’s why I’m optimistic. Because we do have one example of a global problem where practically all the countries of the planet agreed to work together. The ozone layer is healing. It takes quite awhile,” Molina said. “But it’s working, slowly. So it can be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prizes-and-covid-19-slow-basic-science-may-pay-off/story-38yrupY0SsJNs9RaQnzgiK.html

Trump’s campaign manager Bill Stepien tested positive for the coronavirus, as did former White House Senior Adviser Kellyanne Conway. Republican Senator Thom Tillis said he also has Covid-19.Trump said early Friday that he had tested positive along with his wife and one of his closest aides, throwing his campaign into deeper disarray just one month before the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-being-treated-with-antiviral-drug/story-yKxDx9ts2GFSwp1RWrxLXJ.html
03-10-2020||World||US opens trade case to probe Vietnam currency undervaluation||The US announced it’s opening a trade investigation into Vietnam’s currency policy to determine whether an undervalued dong hurts American businesses.Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced the so-called 301 case late Friday in Washington, which will also target the Asian country’s import of illegal timber. The probe follows determinations in August by the US Treasury and Commerce departments that Vietnam had manipulated its currency in a specific trade case involving tires.“Unfair currency practices can harm U.S. workers and businesses that compete with Vietnamese products that may be artificially lower-priced because of currency undervaluation,” Lighthizer said in a statement. “We will carefully review the results of the investigation and determine what, if any, actions it may be appropriate to take.”Vietnam’s ministry of foreign affairs didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment.Vietnam’s central bank this week cut interest rates for the third time this year, seeking to bolster a gradual economic recovery.Trade War WinnerThe country’s export-reliant economy, a beneficiary of a shift by factories trying to steer clear of the US-China trade war, is one of the few in Asia that’s expected to expand this year as trade and manufacturing recover from lockdown disruptions.The dong traded at 23,181 per US dollar at the close yesterday, little changed from Thursday, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.Vietnam’s central bank has moved to a more market-based framework of setting the currency since 2016, adjusting the dong’s reference rate on a daily basis. It allows the dong to trade within a band of 3% on either side of the reference rate, which is based on eight currencies.Vietnam has never used monetary policy to give it an unfair competitive advantage, the nation’s State Bank Governor Le Minh Hung said during a Hanoi briefing this week. Hung spoke a day after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration plans to announce the investigation into Vietnam’s currency.Hung said Vietnam will continue pursuing monetary policies to create macro stability, sustainable growth and support measures to help with the nation’s economic recovery.Under the Trump administration, Vietnam has become one of the US’s 10 biggest trading partners and one with the biggest imbalances. The US’s goods-trade deficit with the Asian nation this year reached $34.8 billion by July, the biggest after the shortfalls with China, Mexico and Switzerland.Vietnam is already on the US Treasury’s list of nations with currencies being monitored for manipulation. The department, in its latest report from January, urged Vietnam to “reduce its intervention and allow for movements in the exchange rate that reflect economic fundamentals, including gradual appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.”In its statement, USTR said it will issue two Federal Register notices next week with details of the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-opens-trade-case-to-probe-vietnam-currency-undervaluation/story-dFZLJIOjcLWCaEKrxnD4eO.html
03-10-2020||World||French President Macron says Islam ‘in crisis’, unveils anti-radicalism plan||President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a plan Friday to defend France’s secular values against Islamist radicalism, describing Islam as a religion “in crisis” all over the world. In a long-awaited address, Macron insisted “no concessions” would be made in a new drive to push religion out of education and the public sector in France.“Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world today, we are not just seeing this in our country,” he said.He announced that the government would present a bill in December to strengthen a 1905 law that officially separated church and state in France.The measures, Macron said, were aimed at addressing a problem of growing Islamic radicalisation in France and improving “our ability to live together”.“Secularism is the cement of a united France,” he insisted, but added that there was no sense in stigmatising all Muslim believers.The law permits people to belong to any faith of their choosing, Macron said, but outward displays of religious affiliation can under no circumstances be allowed in schools or the public service.He announced that France would seek to “liberate” Islam in France from foreign influences by improving oversight of the financing of mosques.There would also be closer scrutiny of schools and associations exclusively serving religious communities.France has in recent years been forced to take a hard look at its core republican values, perceived by many to be threatened by Islam in the wake of a string of terror attacks since 2015 targeting secular liberties such as freedom of expression.Macron was speaking one week after a man wounded two people in a meat cleaver attack outside the former Paris offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly which was condemned by the government as an act of “Islamist terrorism”.Staff at Charlie Hebdo were massacred in January 2015 by Islamist gunmen seeking to avenge its publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.In January, a renewed debate about freedom of expression erupted when a teenager received death threats for attacking Islam in an expletive-laden Instagram rant.And earlier this month, divisions were highlighted when MPs walked out when a university student entered parliament in a headscarf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-says-islam-in-crisis-unveils-anti-radicalism-plan/story-VNuuRQwF77xJA741iHHbiP.html

He was given the drug at the White House after its maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc received a compassionate-use request from officials.He is currently in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and is being monitored. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has described the experimental drug as a bridge to the Covid-19 vaccine.Here is everything you need to know about the experimental drug:* The experimental drug has been manufactured by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which has developed a successful Ebola treatment from an antibody combo in the past.* It is a combination of two artificially made antibodies, the immune system naturally makes to fight off infection.* It is a single-dose therapy and being tested in several clinical trials in both hospitalised Covid-19 patients and patients outside hospitals.* Monoclonal antibodies are considered one of the most promising potential treatments for Covid-19, and Regeneron is one of the front-runners in testing them.* Before this, Regeneron said the preliminary result showed that the drug may help treat coronavirus patients outside of the hospital by reducing virus levels and symptoms. * The trial was conducted of 275 Covid-19 patients and the partial results showed a reduction in virus levels present in the patient.* As the study is still underway, the preliminary findings have not been published officially or reviewed by the other scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-bridge-to-the-covid-19-vaccine-trump-given-regeneron-s-experimental-drug/story-7u3dASk8UurGl8YxB0EulN.html

03-10-2020||World||Trump gets experimental drug aimed at curbing severe illness||The experimental antibody drug given to President Donald Trump has been called one of the most promising approaches to preventing serious illness from a Covid-19 infection.Its maker, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., said the company agreed to supply a single dose, given through an IV, for Trump at the request of his physician under “compassionate use” provisions, when an experimental medicine is provided on a case-by-case emergency basis, while studies of it continue.The new drug is in late-stage testing and its safety and effectiveness are not yet known. No treatment has yet proved able to prevent serious illness after a coronavirus infection.Trump was given the experimental drug at the White House on Friday before he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he’ll be monitored, officials said. So far, Trump has had only mild symptoms, including fatigue.Several physicians who treat Covid19, including Dr. David Boulware at the University of Minnesota, had speculated that doctors might use the antibody drug, given that this approach has worked against other diseases in the past.“They’re not going to just sit around and watch to see if he gets sick,” Boulware said.Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help the immune system eliminate it.Vaccines trick the body into thinking there’s an infection so it makes these antibodies.But it can take weeks for them to form after natural infection or a vaccine. The drugs aim to give that protection immediately, by supplying concentrated versions of one or two antibodies that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.Regeneron’s drug contains two antibodies to enhance chances that it will work. The company previously developed a successful Ebola treatment from an antibody combo.The drug is given as a one-time treatment through an IV. In multiple studies, Regeneron is testing it both for preventing infection and in people already infected, like Trump, to try to prevent serious illness or death.Earlier this week, Regeneron said partial results from about 275 Covid-19 patients who were not sick enough to need hospitalization suggested it might be cutting how long symptoms last and helping reduce the amount of virus patients harbour.However, the study has not been completed, the results were only announced in a company news release and have not been published or reviewed by other scientists.Trump’s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said Trump also was taking zinc, vitamin D, an antacid called famotidine, melatonin and aspirin. None of those have been proven to be effective against Covid-19.Trump apparently is not receiving hydroxychloroquine, a drug he widely promoted that has been shown in many studies to be ineffective for preventing or treating Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-gets-experimental-drug-aimed-at-curbing-severe-illness/story-dR43VJcdVhgvNnZcfeqCJL.html

We’ve talked a number of times this morning. I got the five or six things that he had tasked me to do like I do every single morning. And he is certainly wanting to make sure that we stay engaged,” Meadows said.He said it is critically important the doctors continue to monitor the health of the president and first lady.“The great thing about this president is not only is he staying committed to working very hard on behalf of the American people, his first question to me this morning was is how’s the economy doing, how are the stimulus talks going on Capitol Hill,” Meadows said.Vice President Mike Pence was tested negative for COVID-19.“Earlier this morning under my care, Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for COVID-19,” said Dr Jesse Schonau, his doctor.“Under the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Vice President is not considered a close contact with any individuals who have tested positive for COVID, including President Donald J Trump. Vice President Mike Pence does not need to quarantine,” he said.“Vice President Mike Pence remains in good health and is free to go about his normal activities,” Schonau said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, in her interaction with reporters, said the president had mild symptoms, but he is hard at work.“We’re having to slow him down a little bit. He’s been on the phone with the Senator McConnell, Senator Lindsey Graham, been on the phone with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows talking about an emergency declarations four states as well as stimulus. So, he is hard at work despite the mild symptoms,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-think-i-m-doing-very-well-trump-says-before-boarding-chopper-for-walter-reed/story-cLl6h7boQph5rhFeYcj6aO.html

03-10-2020||World||Recreating history.....||The German reunification, in 1990, was one of the most significant conclusion to the end of a forty-year-long cold war between US and Soviet Union (USSR). The breaking down of the wall, dividing the city (now Capital of Germany) of Berlin, ushered in a new era, giving hope to many about the onset of a new world order which would based on the principles of equality, freedom and peace.  “And if ever, there was a song that symbolised this change, it was Winds of Change by the German rock band, Scorpions,” says the German Ambassador to India, Walter J Lindner, who has recreated the iconic “rock song with Indian elements”, to celebrate 30 years of this historic day, which is celebrated as the German Unity Day, every year.. “This songs was created for the unification. The whole situation at that time, for example, there was [Nelson] Mandela who was talking about liberation, and ending the apartheid. Here in Germany as well and the whole Cold War ending, symbolised freedom and gave everyone a hope that things will change for the better, and for the ‘children of tomorrow’ and for young people like me, there’s going to be freedom and more importantly peace in the world,” says Lindner adding that he was posted in Berlin, as he started out his career as a diplomat, and recalls what the song meant to him, and possibly to the rest of the world at that time. “I was at the beginning of my diplomatic career. I was still in Berlin, which was still divided, when it [the song] released. Winds of Change inspired a whole generation. If you see the original video, the tearing down of the wall, the movement of the Soviet soldiers, it was like a blast that went through the whole world. It gave every one a hope, and idea of freedom, at least for a decade, at least before the terrorist attack in US in 2001. Around the globe there were these winds of change blowing and the song symbolised it,” adds Lindner, who insists he still is a musician “first” and a “politician” later. “I always believe that, you can give hundreds of speeches, but the real connection you have with people is through sports and music. I started as an artiste, a musician. I became a diplomat and lawyer, later to earn money. At any time in my life, first I am a musician,” he says, adding, “Maybe it’s a good combination. It [Being a diplomat] takes away the necessity to live for music. I can dedicate my free time to music, and be my authentic self.” It, therefore, makes complete sense that a song with such iconic message was recreated, and being an Ambassador to India, the German national felt it was imperative, to borrow from the “vast musical heritage” of India. The iconic opening of the song, which opens with the band’s vocalist, Klaus Meine, whistling has been replaced by a flute, played by Rakesh ChaurasiaAlso, the iconic guitar solo, has been divided into four parts, with solos from instruments such as sarod (played by Pandit Vikash Maharaj), tabla (played by Prabhash Maharaj), sitar (played by Abhishek Maharaj) and a flute. “I didn’t want to make a replica. I had to play with Indian musicians. I already had that in my head that i wanted to create a German-Indian rock song. This song, this since its a rock song, was primarily on the electric guitar. We had to rule that out because it would have overshadowed the Indian instruments. So we got more musicians, and other Indian instruments, on the song,” says Lindner, who adds Klaus Meine, only decided to appear at the start of the video, after he heard the song. “He told me he had goosebumps. I met him in Berlin and that’s when he told me he would love to introduce the song. I think even in Germany, this song will generate good interest because it is a very different and a different sounding version,” he says. The song, as Lindner says, “is still relevant”, and hopes that it will promote the message that the original version has done so over the last 30 years. “Life without art is nothing, there’s no colour. This song contains dreams, and they can be anything. As long as you live, you hope that the world is a better place, for everyone who is born here and lives. That’s the real message and the entire concept, and I hope that this German-Indian rock song promotes that feeling,” he signs off.

03-10-2020||World||US Prez Trump, Melania test positive for Covid-19; could hit his presidential campaign||US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19 and will go into quarantine immediately, the president tweeted late Thursday.“Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19,” Trump said in the tweet, less than two hours after posting that his close aide Hope Hicks had tested positive.“We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”The tweet raised immediate concerns about the health of the president, who is more than 70 years of age and obese.Trump had earlier in the evening tweeted he and the first lady began “our quarantine process” after one of his closest advisers, Hope Hicks, who had travelled with him several times in the last few days, tested positive .“Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19,” President Trump tweeted. “Terrible! The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!”Watch l ‘We will get through this together’: Trump & Melania test positive for Covid-19 Hicks had travelled with Trump and his team on Air Force One to Cleveland, Ohio for the first presidential debate. She also travelled with Trump to his rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Wednesday and was seen in close contact with senior members of the president’s campaign.According to rules made by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who were in close contact with Hicks should quarantine themselves. That would include the president, the first lady and senior members of the president’s re-election campaign.Bloomberg, which first reported Hicks testing positive, said she had felt ill in Minnesota and quarantined herself on the way back on the presidential aircraft.“The president takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously,” White House spokesman Judd Deere has said in a statement. “White House Operations collaborates with the physician to the president and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible, both on complex and when the president is travelling.”Hicks is the fourth White House personnel to test positive for Coronavirus, after a personal military valet of the president, a member of the vice-president’s staff and the National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien. But Hicks has been the closest of them all to the president, who had gone on a 10-day course of Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug.More than 207,000 Americans have been killed by Covid-19 and millions have been infected. President Trump has refused a responsibility for them, and has been blamed for his botched response to the pandemic, despite his fervent claims to the contrary, citing travel shut-downs.More egregious has been his open scepticism of the use of face masks and social distancing norms. He rarely wears one himself despite professing his complete endorsement of masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-first-lady-melania-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-zsU5dh0MBdiyuMoKwTu3vI.html
