Two others showed up independently at a local precinct and reported being in contact with the suspect.The other detainees include the family -- father and his wife -- of a student who complained about the teacher, Ricard said. According to the prosecutor, the father was known to authorities because his half-sister joined the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia) in 2014.Reports emerged on Friday night of a French teacher getting beheaded in the outskirts of Paris. Police chased down and shot to death the main suspect, a Moscow-born Chechen teenager. The victim reportedly taught freedom of speech and showed caricatures depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad to his students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-authorities-confirm-9-people-detained-in-probe-into-killing-of-teacher/story-ItlNXB1CeNLIsQllLCS1nM.html

Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.theatres in New York City aren’t included, and counties must have a positivity rate below 2% on a 14-day average and have no “cluster zones.”Audiences will be restricted to 25% of capacity with a maximum of 50 people per screen, Cuomo said at his briefing. Masks will be required and there will be assigned seating to ensure social distancing.This week, the Global Cinema Federation sent an open letter to Cuomo urging him to let theatres reopen, saying Hollywood studios may continue delaying their remaining 2020 releases if theatres remain closed. The group asked Cuomo to adopt a county-by-county plan for theater openings based on virus data, similar what it said California Gov. Gavin Newsom has done.School suedState and county health officials filed a lawsuit Friday against an Orange County school that they said has remained open despite an order to close because of a spike in coronavirus cases.The Times Herald-Record reports the suit filed in state Supreme Court in Goshen names the Bnei Yoel school in Kiryas Joel, an Orthodox Jewish community. Earlier this month, Orange County health officials ordered schools in the area to close for two weeks.In the lawsuit, a deputy county health commissioner said he visited the school on two days recently and saw children not wearing masks and not observing social distancing.A phone message was left Saturday with the village’s administrator.Cuomo reinstated restrictions this month on businesses, houses of worship and schools in and near areas where coronavirus cases are spiking.The new rules, which include school and business shutdowns and limitations on gatherings, affect parts of Brooklyn and Queens in New York City, sections of Orange and Rockland counties outside the city, and an area within Binghamton in the Southern Tier.Some Jewish leaders have called the measures “blatantly anti-Semitic” for targeting Orthodox communities. On Friday, in a case brought by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, a federal judge upheld Cuomo’s order limiting worship to as few as 10 congregants in communities seeing spikes in coronavirus infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/movie-theatres-in-new-york-can-open-from-next-friday-with-limits-guv-cuomo/story-yMEEi6lrV8cHEn9z9RBmNJ.html

The US president was speaking at an election rally in the state of Georgia.“Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary,” Trump told his supporters at the rally in Macon, Georgia, seeking to tie Biden to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic challenger he beat in 2016.Biden leads Trump narrowly in the state that has firmly been Republican and has not voted for a Democrat since 1992.Biden, meanwhile, kept the focus of his attacks on the US president’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a rally in Michigan, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2016, Biden said the Republican incumbent had “gone around the bend” for repeatedly claiming the US had “turned the corner” on the outbreak.With less than three weeks left for the close of polling on November 3 - more than 25 million people have already voted through mail or in person - Trump was trailing Biden by 9 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls and 10.6 points in the FiveThirtyEight weightage of polls.The US president has been desperately trying to shift the focus of the election from his handling of the pandemic to his Democratic rival, questioning his age, his mental health status, and using a dubious news story - which is being investigated by the FBI as a possible Russian misinformation ploy - to allege corruption by Biden.Earlier on Friday, in Fort Myers, Florida, Trump sought to reach out to the elderly people - a key support base that felt alienated by his handling of the pandemic. “We are rounding the turn. I say that all the time. Some of the media doesn’t like hearing it. But I say it all the time, we’re rounding that turn.”Biden, who has questioned Trump’s claims in the past, slammed him at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. “He’s still living in a dream world. He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like a miracle,” Biden said. “As my grandfather Finnegan might say if he were here... he’s gone around the bend. Turned the corner - my lord! It’s not disappearing. In fact, it’s on the rise again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lock-up-the-bidens-lock-up-hillary-donald-trump-tells-supporters-at-georgia-rally/story-zsmwKxoFdThjUogRNmjEMK.html
17-10-2020||World||Italy governor eyeing Covid-19 surge blasts ‘idiotic’ Halloween||Americans may love Naples for its most famous export, pizza. But the governor of Italy’s southern region had choice words for the exported American holiday of Halloween as Naples buckles under surging coronavirus infections.Campania Gov. Vincenzo De Luca blasted the holiday as a “stupid American extravagance” and a “monument to imbecility” in announcing a 10 p.m. curfew in Naples and the surrounding region over Halloween weekend.De Luca has blamed “irresponsible” young people for Campania’s surge in infections, and this week closed schools for in-person learning for two weeks.His bah-humbug to Halloween was in keeping with that tough line. While Italy has long celebrated the religious holidays of All Saints and All Souls, Halloween has only taken off in the last generation, most strongly in the Italian south.Campania was largely spared the first wave of Covid-19, but the region is now one of the worst-hit in Italy and is reaching a critical stage given it has far fewer hospital beds, intensive care units and medical personnel than other regions of a similar size.De Luca won praise — and another term in office — for taking a tough line to keep infections down during Italy’s initial outbreak. But his decision to shift all learning online prompted criticism from the education minister and protests from parents.His Halloween rant sparked some ridicule on social media Saturday with the hashtag #allouin, which is how “Halloween” is sometimes written in Italian.The rant was included in one of De Luca’s Facebook videos on Covid-19, which feature his colorful language and obvious frustration that Neapolitans are flouting social-distancing rules and mask mandates.“How can you be so irresponsible?” he demanded Friday of students who wear their masks around their chins rather than over their noses.Corriere della Sera, in parsing De Luca’s latest video, noted that the veteran of Italy’s center-left is in a tough spot given Campania’s hospital capacity cannot handle any more serious infections. But commentator Fabrizio Roncone criticized the governor’s seemingly dictatorial bent, saying he’s treating residents like “subjects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-governor-eyeing-covid-19-surge-blasts-idiotic-halloween/story-aImtjKigDwM36R3ogdQG6I.html

Recently, he tweeted and thanked for 96% approval rating in the Republican Party. Over the course of his presidency, an average of 87% Republicans have approved of Trump’s handling of the White House. But there are some dissenting voices in the Republican Party. Lincoln ProjectThe Lincoln Project with 2.5 million followers on Twitter is an anti-Trump group formed by former Republican strategists George Conway, Steve Schmidt, John Weaver and Rick Wilson who started this group on December 17, 2019. George Conway, the conservative lawyer is the most talked about founder of the Lincoln Project as he is the husband of former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway. George Conway recently announced that he was withdrawing from the group to spend some more time with his family. Steve Schmidt managed John McCain’s 2008 Presidential campaign and John Weaver oversaw John McCain’s Presidential campaign in 2000. Rick Wilson is a media consultant. Through their social media campaign which includes videos and tweets, the Lincoln Project attempts to target President Donald Trump and openly endorses Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the Presidential Election 2020. The group has raised $39.4 million from July through September and at least 15 billionaires have donated to the group as reported by Forbes.

17-10-2020||World||New coronavirus restrictions in Europe; Merkel warns of hard days||Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to come together like they did in the spring to slow the spread of the coronavirus as the country posted another daily record of new cases Saturday.“Difficult months are ahead of us,” she said in her weekly video podcast. “How winter will be, how our Christmas will be, that will all be decided in these coming days and weeks, and it will be decided by our behavior.”Meanwhile, new restrictions went into effect in several other European nations in an effort to staunch the resurgence of the pandemic.In Paris and eight other French cities, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and other establishments were being forced to close no later than 9 p.m. to try to reduce contact among people. The country was deploying 12,000 extra police officers to enforce the new rules.Many restaurant owners have bristled at the order. An earlier months-long lockdown devastated the sector.“I have the right to question the government’s approach, I think it’s a catastrophic measure for the industry,” said Xavier Denamur, who owns Les Philosophes and several other bistros in Paris’s chic Le Marais district, saying that if nothing else, the curfew should be 11 p.m.“At least that would not destroy us,” he said. “There’s no evidence that this difference of a couple of hours will have any effect on the virus circulating.”In Britain, a three-tier regional approach to battle the pandemic introduced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson went into effect, with each level bringing progressively tighter restrictions.On Saturday, tier-2 cities like London and York were subject to a ban on socializing with people from other households indoors, while the county of Lancashire joined Liverpool in tier 3 with the tightest restrictions.Among other things, that means pubs have been forced to close and socializing with others is banned even in many outdoor settings.In Northern Ireland a lockdown lasting four weeks came into force Friday. All pubs and restaurants must close except for takeaway services, and schools will close for two weeks for an extended half-term holiday.Data from Friday showed that a further 136 people died in the U.K. within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total official toll to 43,429.The World Health Organization has warned that intensive care units in a number of European cities could reach maximum capacity in the coming weeks if the number of infections doesn’t slow.Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg joined the list of top politicians who have tested positive for the virus, and was quarantined though he showed no symptoms, his office told Austria’s APA news agency.The Vatican, meanwhile, said someone who lives in the same hotel as Pope Francis tested positive for the virus, adding to the 11 cases of Covid-19 among the Swiss Guards who protect him.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the country’s head of state, was quarantined after a bodyguard was infected, his office said. A first test came out negative.Germany, which was widely lauded for rapidly slowing the spread of the virus when the pandemic first broke out, has seen rapidly climbing numbers in recent days.On Saturday, the country’s disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 7,830 cases overnight, a new record.Like most countries, Germany has been grappling with how to keep schools and businesses open while trying to prevent people from coming into close contact with one another.Germany has registered a total of 356,387 coronavirus cases and a relatively low 9,767 deaths.Merkel urged Germans to avoid unnecessary travel, cancel parties and remain at home whenever possible.“What brought us so well through the first half year of the pandemic?” she asked. “It was that we stood together and obeyed the rules out of consideration and common sense. This is the most effective remedy we currently have against the pandemic and it is more necessary now than ever.”In the neighboring Czech Republic, the number of new infections surpassed 10,000 for the first time, surging to 11,105 on Friday, the Health Ministry said. The country has now registered a total of 160,112 cases, including 1,283 deaths.Despite new restrictive measures to slow the surge, Health Minister Roman Prymula said he still expects a rise in those testing positive for about two weeks.Next door, Slovakia said it was acquiring 13 million rapid antigen tests — enough to test each member of the population twice — and would establish 6,000 testing sites.Prime Minister Igor Matovic said testing will take place over the next two weekends, starting with the three or four hardest hit counties. It was not immediately clear whether tests would be mandatory.Italy’s northern Lombardy region, where the European outbreak began in late February, has taken new measures to contain rebounding infections, limiting bar service and alcohol sales, banning contact sports and closing bingo parlors.The regional government late Friday called for high schools to adopt hybrid schedules, with students alternating in-person with online learning.The measures were taken after Lombardy, Italy’s most populous region, once again became the most affected, adding more than 2,000 infections a day. Hospitals are coming under strain and intensive care units are filling up.The new measures allow only table service for bars from 6 p.m., ban takeout alcohol sales from that time and prohibit all consumption of booze in public spaces.Italy’s other hardest hit region, southern Campania, has taken similarly strict measures, including a shutdown of schools for two weeks. After parents protested, the regional governor backed off Friday and allowed daycare centers to remain open.In the capital, Rome, residents grumbled as cases climbed, fearing a return to the strict country-wide measures that were imposed when the virus was spreading out of control.“The situation is critical thanks to the morons, because I call them morons, who have not respected the rules,” said resident Mario Massenzi. “And if we fall back into the same situation as in March, we are finished.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-restrictions-in-europe-merkel-warns-of-hard-days/story-BR1WtHRVS5FlGEmA5n7wdO.html
17-10-2020||World||Transit shutdowns in Thailand fail to crush pro-democracy spirit||Pro-democracy activists in Thailand staged a fourth straight day of high-profile protests in the capital on Saturday, thwarting efforts by the authorities to stop them, including a shutdown of the city’s mass transit systems.Unlike protests a day earlier, which saw police using water cannons to keep the protesters at bay, Saturday’s demonstrations were peaceful, with no reports of any clashes by the time participants started heading home in the evening.The protesters are calling for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to leave office, the constitution to be amended to make it more democratic and the nation’s monarchy to undergo reform.All stations of Bangkok’s elevated Skytrain transit system were closed Saturday afternoon to try to keep protesters from gathering. The underground MRT system was also shut, and police blocked off several roads.Protesters met anyway as planned at the Skytrain stations, where they held small impromptu rallies, in effect establishing a temporary but active presence across the city.The organizers then issued a fresh advisory for followers to gather at three stations outside the city’s central area, where access was easier. Once that was announced, money was pooled by participants so they could take taxis to get around the transit shutdown.“Right now we can do nothing much,” said a 26-year-old hotel worker who asked to be called only Veronica. “What we can do right now is only show our power to let the outside see.”Several thousand people gathered in multiple locations, with some taking turns airing their views over a megaphone. By the evening, police had not disturbed them, even when some groups took to marching in the street. Protesters began dispersing at 8 p.m., the time organizers had said the protests would end.The protesters acted despite a state of emergency imposed by Prayuth on Thursday that makes them all subject to arrest.They also appeared not to be cowed by a crackdown on their rally in central Bangkok on Friday night, in which riot police backed up by water cannons cleared the streets in about an hour.No major injuries were reported from that confrontation. It was the first time in three months of sporadic protests that the authorities have employed such forceful tactics against the student-led movement.A 20-year-old student who used the name Ryo said Friday night’s events had hardened his resistance.“I respect people’s political opinions, but after yesterday’s incident, I feel it was so harsh, perpetrating violence against unarmed people who had no weapons to fight back,” he said.Protective gear such as goggles was distributed Saturday at some venues.ALSO READ| ‘I’m not afraid’: Thai protesters defy ban on protest gatheringsFriday night’s violent dispersal led the People’s Party, the protesters’ umbrella organization, to declare in a statement that “the government and military have established themselves as the enemy of the people,” Most of the group’s top leaders have been arrested.The protesters have been doing their best to elude the authorities, using social media to assemble followers before police have time to block them. The government has announced plans to take legal action against Twitter and Facebook accounts that announce the protests, but fresh calls to action were posted Saturday.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The call by the protesters for reform of the monarchy has significantly raised the political temperature in Thailand, angering many older conservative Thais for whom any critical discussion of the royal family is tantamount to treason.King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key members of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.Prayuth’s declaration of a state of emergency said the measure was necessary because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.”He was referring to an incident Wednesday that showed some members of a small crowd heckling a motorcade carrying Queen Suthida and Prince Dipangkorn as it slowly passed.On Friday, two activists were arrested under a law covering violence against the queen for their alleged part in the incident. They could face up to life in prison if convicted. They denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/transit-shutdowns-in-thailand-fail-to-crush-pro-democracy-spirit/story-vMzYX9qhzrgTnniKDYInAP.html

They are planning to scale up the trials and set up a nationwide network of secure air corridors to enable the drone delivery service to work safely across National Health Service sites.The hybrid drones — which have the rotors of a typical drone and the wings of a plane — can carry a maximum of 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) and fly about 60 miles (96 kilometers.)The drone project is among others set to share 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) of funding from the U.K. Space Agency and the European Space Agency to businesses developing space-based solutions for challenges created by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-drone-delivery-project-that-can-aid-healthcare-workers-against-covid-19-wins-uk-space-agency-s-support/story-ZhJX76ibCQuvQMgr8GHaQN.html
17-10-2020||World||Pope Francis removes Polish bishop accused of sex abuse cover-up||Pope Francis on Saturday permanently removed a Polish bishop who was kicked out of his diocese a few months ago pending a Vatican investigation into allegations he covered up cases of sexual abuse by his priests.The resignation of Edward Janiak as bishop of Kalisz suggests the Vatican was able to substantiate at least some elements of the accusations made in a documentary about sex abuse in Poland that has undermined the country’s influential Catholic hierarchy.Francis on Saturday accepted Janiak’s resignation and confirmed the archbishop of Lodz, Grzegorz Rys, as the diocese’s temporary administrator. At 68, Janiak is well below the normal retirement age of 75 for bishops.Francis in June had ordered Janiak to leave Kalisz and forbade him from having any influence on how the diocese is run pending the investigation.In May, the online documentary “Playing Hide and Seek” exposed two cases of pedophile priests that Janiak handled, first as an auxiliary bishop of Wroclaw and then as bishop of Kalisz, which he had headed since 2012.It featured court testimony about Janiak’s role in helping transfer one priest, subsequently convicted and defrocked, from Wroclaw to another diocese even after a criminal investigation had begun. The film also documented an alleged cover-up relating to another priest during Janiak’s time as Kalisz bishop.The film was the second on Polish clergy abuse to be made by brothers Tomasz and Marek Sekielski. Their first film last year, “Tell No One,” triggered a national reckoning in a country where there is no higher moral authority than the Catholic Church and its clergy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-removes-polish-bishop-accused-of-sex-abuse-cover-up/story-5rc6rkUN1G9eKDiiXR4hCN.html

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Saturday and warned concerted action was needed to prevent millions of people being pushed into poverty and hunger.The former Portuguese prime minister said far more could have been done if countries had worked together to combat the disease, which has killed more than one million people.“The Covid-19 pandemic is a major global challenge for the entire international community, for multilateralism and for me, as secretary-general of the United Nations,” Guterres told Portuguese news agency Lusa. “Unfortunately it is a test that, so far, the international community is failing.”He said that if coordinated measures were not taken, “a microscopic virus could push millions of people into poverty and hunger, with devastating economic effects in the years to come”.Guterres also criticised countries for a lack of unity in trying to solve other global challenges including the conflicts in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria.“It is a source of enormous frustration,” he said.More than 39 million people have been infected by Covid-19, according to a Reuters tally based on official disclosures.Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/divided-world-is-failing-covid-19-test-says-frustrated-un-chief/story-KKTr40hC9VGTzqVXNmkV9M.html
17-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Joe Biden or Donald Trump? These states could decide||With 17 days left for November 3, when the American voters will choose their next President between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, some states are emerging as more crucial than others because of the unpredictable pattern of their voting preferences. Here’s a look at seven swing states that will shape the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election: 1. Michigan: Traditionally, Michigan has been a Democrat stronghold because of the working class voters, a group that tends to vote for the Democrat Party but this changed in the 2016 Presidential election when Trump won Michigan by a small margin of 0.23%, with 47.50% of the total votes as opposed to Hilary Clinton who won 47.27%of the votes. A win in Michigan means 16 Electoral College votes for the candidates and in 2016 Donald Trump won Michigan with the narrowest margin of victory in Michigan’s presidential election history which was also the narrowest victory margin of any state in the 2016 election. 2. Wisconsin: Demographically, the rural and blue-collar white voters of Wisconsin play a major role in deciding who wins the state. The state accounts for 10 Electoral College votes and Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 by a narrow margin of 0.77%, with 47.22% of the total votes as opposed to 46.45% of Hillary Clinton. This made Trump the first Republican candidate to win the state since Ronald Reagan won in 1984. 3. Arizona: Arizona has traditionally been a Republican stronghold with 11 Electoral College votes. Donald Trump won Arizona in 2016 with a margin of 3.5 percent but this once Republican stronghold is now being considered a key swing state in this election as the absence of Republican stalwarts like Sen. John McCain has affected the dynamics of the state. The state also has an increasing Hispanic population, a group that leans towards the Democrat Party.    4. Georgia: Georgia contributes 16 Electoral College votes and has not picked a Democrat to be a President since 1992. In 2016,Trump won Georgia by 5.1% as Hillary Clinton received 45.35% of the votes. With its rapidly growing diverse population and Democrats like Stacey Abrams gaining nationwide popularity, Georgia is being regarded as a swing state for 2020.5. North Carolina: In 2016, Trump gained North Carolina’s 15 Electoral College votes with a 3.66% margin and 49.83 % of the total vote whereas Hillary Clinton got 46.17% of the votes. With a mix of rural, city and suburban voters,the importance of the state is reflected through Donald Trump’s frequent visits to the state.     6. Florida: With 29 Electoral College votes,Florida is the largest swing state in America and has always been so. The margin of victory in the state has been very low and Trump won in this state in 2016 with 49% of the total votes as opposed to Clinton’s 47.8%; only by 1.2 percentage points.  7. Pennsylvania: In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes which is less than 1 percentage point, the narrowest margin in a presidential election for the state in 176 years. With 20 electoral votes, the state is called the ‘Blue Wall state’ but Trump’s victory in 2016 has made Pennsylvania a battleground state for 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-joe-biden-or-donald-trump-these-states-could-decide/story-4Rf1C1KvZtzeB16sDqdqnN.html
17-10-2020||World||Paris beheading: Suspect in teacher’s attack in France was Chechen teen||A suspect shot dead by police after the gruesome beheading of a history teacher in an attack near Paris was an 18-year-old Chechen, officials said Saturday.France’s anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said that authorities investigating the horrific killing of Samuel Paty in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday have also arrested nine suspects, including the grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother of the attacker.Paty had discussed caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad with his class, leading to threats and a complaint from a parent, police officials said. Islam prohibits images of the prophet, considering that they lead to idolatry. The officials could not be named because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations.The French anti-terrorism prosecutor opened an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive, the prosecutor’s office said.French leaders offered messages of sadness but also of hope in the hours after the drama.“We’ll pick ourselves up together, thanks to our spirit of solidarity,” said Laurent Brosse, mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, at a news conference Saturday.“We are all affected, all touched by this vile assassination,” said Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer in a video message.A police official said the suspect in Friday’s attack armed was shot dead about 600 meters (yards) from where Paty died. He was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun — which fires plastic pellets — and police opened fire after he failed to respond to orders to put down his arms, and acted in a threatening manner. The official also could not be named because of the ongoing investigations.French President Emmanuel Macron arrived quickly at the school on Friday night to denounce what he called an “Islamist terrorist attack.” He urged the nation to stand united against extremism.“One of our compatriots was murdered today because he taught ... the freedom of expression, the freedom to believe or not believe,” Macron said.The presidential Elysee Palace announced Saturday that there will be a national ceremony on a future date in homage to Paty, about whom few details have so far emerged.In a video posted recently on Twitter, a man describing himself as the father of a student claimed that Paty had shown an image of a naked man and told students it was “the prophet of the Muslims.”Before showing the images, the teacher asked Muslim children to raise their hand and leave the room because he planned to show something shocking, the man said. The AP has not been able to independently confirm these claims.“What was the message he wanted to send these children? What is this hate?” the man asked.Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim Russian republic in the North Caucasus. Two wars in the 1990s triggered a wave of emigration, with many Chechens heading for western Europe. France has offered asylum to many Chechens since the Russian military waged war against Islamist separatists in Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s.France has seen occasional violence involving its Chechen community in recent months, believed linked to local criminal activity and score-settling.It is the second time in three weeks that terror has struck France linked to caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. Last month, a young man from Pakistan was arrested after attacking two people with a meat cleaver outside the former offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.The weekly was the target of a deadly newsroom attack in 2015, and it republished caricatures of the prophet this month to underscore the right to freedom of information as a trial opened linked to that attack.Friday’s terror attack came as Macron’s government works on a bill to address Islamic radicals, who authorities claim are creating a parallel society outside the values of the French Republic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-beheading-suspect-in-teacher-s-attack-in-france-was-chechen-teen/story-dJWUD4l3ojVQgveYzgdHrI.html

At least three protesters in Hong Kong were sentenced for desecrating the Chinese flag last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-amended-law-threatens-criminal-action-against-those-who-insult-national-flag/story-1lcZKAqAQZR3xao0fH2SSO.html
17-10-2020||World||For Donald Trump, city where ‘bad things happen’ looms large||When President Donald Trump told the world that “bad things happen in Philadelphia,” it was, in part, a blunt assessment of his party’s struggles in the nation’s sixth-most populous city.For decades, Philadelphia has been the cornerstone of Democratic victories in the battleground state — producing Democratic margins so massive that winning statewide has been a longshot for most Republican presidential candidates.But it’s a longshot Trump pulled off in 2016 and is trying to repeat again. His debate stage disdain for the City of Brotherly Love — which quickly inspired memes and T-shirts — underscored his campaign’s months-long effort to fight the blue tide that starts in the city.That fight has involved court challenges and statehouse wrangling over mail-in voting and poll watching, efforts Democrats characterize as voter suppression.And it came as Trump openly declared, citing no evidence, that the only way he can lose Pennsylvania to former Vice President Joe Biden is through a massive fraud engineered by Democrats in the city of 1.6 million.But Trump can’t change the basic political math in the state: one in eight registered voters live in Philadelphia, a city that keeps delivering increasingly large Democratic margins, routinely provides one in five votes for Democratic presidential candidates and is spurring a leftward drift in the heavily populated suburbs around it.“Trump is right, ‘bad things happen in Philadelphia,’ especially for him,” Philadelphia’s Democratic Party chair, Bob Brady, said. “And bad things are going to happen for him in Philadelphia on Election Day.”Recent polls show Trump and Biden in a competitive race in Pennsylvania, or Biden ahead by single-digits in a state Trump won by just over 44,000 votes — less than a percentage point — in 2016.Trump’s victory was the first by a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, and it shocked Pennsylvania Democrats to the core.In Philadelphia, Biden’s campaign is putting a heavy emphasis on turning out Black and Latino voters and is bringing in former President Barack Obama to campaign there. Trump’s campaign is making its own appeal to Black and Latino voters and hoping for even better results with his white, working-class base.Brady predicted Philadelphia will carry the rest of Pennsylvania and produce a bigger margin of victory for Biden than the 475,000 it produced for Hillary Clinton in 2016. That gap was slightly smaller than the historic margins Obama had in 2008 and 2012.The Biden campaign has several “voter activation” centers around the city, not to mention Biden’s campaign headquarters.Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, opened offices in heavily Black west Philadelphia and in heavily white northeast Philadelphia.Thanks to a year-old state law that greatly expanded mail-in voting, people now have weeks to vote and turnout is brisk at newly opened election offices around the city where voters can fill out and cast ballots.That is giving hope to Philadelphia Democrats, after the city’s predominantly Black wards did not turn out as strongly in 2016 for Clinton as they did for Obama, including some that delivered 10% fewer votes.“The line went around the block,” state Rep. Chris Rabb, whose district is 70% Black, said of a newly opened election office there. “It was nothing that I’ve seen since 2008 and I’ve worked the polls for 16 years now.”In a city that is 42% Black, the belief that Trump has fueled a racist surge is widely held.Breaking up concrete on a contracting job at a west Philadelphia rowhouse this week, Dexter Ayres, a lifelong Democrat, said he already voted for Biden in hopes of improving how Black people are treated in America.Some of his friends are skeptical that voting will change anything. Ayres, who is Black, admitted that makes him wonder, “Wow, why did I vote?”“But then I look at it like: ‘Well, maybe my vote will make a difference,’” Ayres said. “I’m just praying and leaving it in God’s hands.”Sitting on her front porch in west Philadelphia this week, Latoya Ratcliff, a Democrat, said she will vote for Biden, and sees more enthusiasm in her neighborhood to vote out Trump than in 2016 to vote for Hillary Clinton.The defining issue for Ratcliff, who is Black, is racism.“They understand a little more about getting out and getting that vote out,” said Ratcliff, 39.In northeast Philadelphia, Trump saw unexpectedly strong support from an area with a reputation for being home to unionized building trades members, police officers and firefighters. Republicans say they now expect even stronger support for Trump there.“Back the Blue” yard signs and thin-blue-line flags are everywhere in some neighborhoods, the city’s police union endorsed Trump again and the city’s firefighters and paramedics union also endorsed him, breaking with its international association’s endorsement of Biden.Leaving his northeast Philadelphia home to go shopping recently, lifelong Democrat Joe Dowling said he will vote for Trump after backing Clinton four years ago. The issue that changed his mind, he said, has been the violence in the wake of George Floyd’s death and a backlash against police.“It’s out of control,” said Dowling, 60, who is white. “There’s no reason for anybody to disrespect the police.”Democrats acknowledge that they slipped in northeast Philadelphia in 2016 — the swing was about 11,000 voters from 2012.Still, the area snapped back for Democrats in 2018 and U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, who represents it in Congress, said he expects Biden to do better there than Clinton.He recalled a paper-shredding event his office last fall, attended by hundreds in the parking lot of the plumbers’ union office in northeast Philadelphia.“I was surprised by the animus toward Trump, people unsolicited saying, ‘Gotta get him out of there, he’s a disaster,’” said Boyle, a Democrat. “And it was different. I wasn’t hearing that a few years earlier.”Stephen Lomas, a long-time registered Republican who lives between two Trump supporters in northeast Philadelphia, said he will vote for Biden.Lomas, 84, who is white, said Trump and members of his administration “are tearing down our belief in the system. ... They’re out-and-out crooks. They’re almost traitors to our Constitution.”Besides mail-in voting, another thing that is different in this presidential election is a network of allied liberal issues and community groups in Philadelphia, organizers say, with a long-term focus on reaching people unlikely to vote in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods.Briheem Douglas, vice president of Unite Here Local 274, a union of casino, food service and hotel workers that supports Biden, said he is canvassing harder than ever before.Douglas, 36, tells a personal story to everyone he meets who isn’t planning to vote: He is caring for the infant child of his 21-year-old niece, Brianna, who died in September from the coronvavirus.“So I’m laser-focused on canvassing more than in 2016,” Douglas said.___Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

The Office for National Statistics’ Infection Survey said there had been 27,900 new cases per day on average in the latest week.On Tuesday, Britain’s opposition Labour Party called for a two- to three-week lockdown across England, though it wants schools to stay open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-covid-19-testing-adviser-calls-for-circuit-breaker-lockdown/story-yochm08xaVBocvqu1fFrpN.html
17-10-2020||World||Bangladesh-India flights to resume from October 28 through ‘air bubble’||Bangladesh is all set to resume flights to India from October 28 under ‘air bubble’ arrangement, after nearly eight months the communications were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to media reports on Saturday.Under a bilateral air bubble pact, airlines of both the countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions.Since July, India has established such bubbles with several countries, including the US, the UK, France and Germany. Three Bangladeshi carriers -- Biman Bangladeshi Airlines, US-Bangla Airlines and Novo Air -- would initially operate 28 flights a week, while five Indian airlines -- Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Vistara and GoAir -- would operate 28 flights a week between the two countries, The Daily Star reported, quoting civil aviation and tourism ministry Senior Secretary Md Mohibul Haque. Of the three Bangladeshi carriers, Biman is scheduled to operate flights on Dhaka-Delhi and Dhaka-Kolkata routes, US-Bangla Airlines on Dhaka-Chennai and Novo Air on Dhaka-Kolkata route, the report said. The five Indian airlines are expected to operate flights on Dhaka-Delhi, Dhaka-Kolkata, Dhaka-Chennai and Dhaka-Mumbai routes. The decision to resume flights to India was made at an inter-ministerial meeting at the civil aviation and tourism ministry on Friday, the report said. The resumption of air communications will bring relief to many Bangladeshis who are waiting to travel to the neighbouring country for treatment, it said. According to a report in The Dhaka Tribune, from January 2018 to March 2019, at least 2,876,000 Bangladeshis visited India, and on average 10 per cent of them went for medical treatment. Initially, around 5,000 passengers from both the countries would be able to fly each week, the report quoted Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) Chairman Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman as saying.There is no transit facility for the passengers to fly to a third country, he said, adding that the passengers would have to undergo Covid-19 testing before flying.On October 9, the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh announced resumption of online visa application services for Bangladeshi citizens.For now, visas will be provided in nine categories, including medical, business, employment, journalists and diplomats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-india-flights-to-resume-from-october-28-through-air-bubble/story-1VwrE0SKETweIBc6CMSw3N.html
17-10-2020||World||Jacinda Ardern wins New Zealand election in landmark victory, secures second term||Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern swept to an emphatic victory in New Zealand’s general election and said she would use her mandate to rebuild an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic and tackle social inequality.“Over the next three years there is much work to do,” she told supporters Saturday night in Auckland. “We will build back better from the Covid crisis. We have the mandate to accelerate our response and our recovery.”With 87% of the vote counted, Ardern’s Labour Party had 49% support -- heading to its biggest share of the vote since the 1930s -- after a huge swing to the left in many urban and provincial electorates. The opposition National Party slumped to 27%, its worst showing since 2002.Ardern, 40, has captured the hallowed center ground in New Zealand politics with a blend of empathetic leadership and skilled crisis management that has also won her fame abroad. Her successful handling of the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated those strengths, drowning out criticism that she hasn’t delivered on some key promises during her first term in office.Ardern said she would govern for all New Zealanders and declined to say whether she would invite the Green Party into her government until final results were in. The Greens had 7.6% of the vote.The landslide victory will give Ardern more scope to deliver the transformational government she promised when she came to power three years ago, particularly if the Greens push her to be more progressive on issues such as poverty and climate change. Still, she will be wary of alienating centrist voters with increased social spending at a time when debt is spiraling due to the government’s pandemic response.Voters are rewarding Ardern for crushing community transmission of Covid-19 while countries like the U.K., U.S. and even neighboring Australia are still battling to contain the virus.National in DisarrayMain opposition National Party leader Judith Collins conceded defeat in a speech earlier, saying she had spoken to Ardern to congratulate her.Collins, who struggled to gain traction against the wildly popular Ardern during the campaign, pointed to the economic challenges facing the nation as it recovers from the pandemic.“New Zealand is in for a tough economic ride and it is going to need better fiscal policy than we have so far seen,” she said.National has been in disarray, changing its leader twice this year and suffering a string of scandals that eroded its claim to be a stronger team than Labour and a better economic manager.By contrast, Ardern has been mobbed by crowds on the campaign trail in a repeat of the “Jacinda-mania” first seen in 2017.In the battle against Covid, Ardern was alone among her western peers in pursuing an explicit elimination strategy and imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world.The economy suffered its most severe contraction since the Great Depression, slumping 12.2% in the second quarter, but the lockdown wiped out community spread of the virus and restrictions were removed sooner than in many other countries. After more than 100 days without community transmission, an outbreak flared in largest city Auckland, but that was also quickly stamped out.New Zealand has now gone three weeks without any cases in the community, with all new infections limited to returned overseas travelers undergoing mandatory quarantine. The nation has recorded just 25 coronavirus deaths.The challenges ahead are enormous. The border remains closed to foreigners, crippling the key tourism industry, and unemployment is forecast to rise.Labour is pledging massive spending on infrastructure to boost the economy and has pledged to impose a higher tax rate on income over NZ$180,000 ($120,000) a year to raise more revenue. Ardern has ruled out implementing the wealth tax proposed by the Greens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacinda-ardern-marks-landmark-victory-wins-new-zealand-election/story-nkBEBLcjb9QywhCys5ShyO.html
17-10-2020||World||The IMF has a blueprint for helping the climate without hurting economic growth||In a year when Covid-19 has dominated the International Monetary Fund’s agenda, the organization’s quiet rethinking of climate change in its latest World Economic Outlook report didn’t make much of a splash outside the Twitter feeds of development economics wonks. While the rest of the climate and energy world was poring over a different WEO — the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook — the IMF’s comprehensive assessment of what the energy transition will mean for economies was relatively overlooked.For decades, the need to cut emissions has been dogged by questions that essentially boil down to: how much will it cost, and is it worth it? Unlike the IEA’s analysis, which excludes the impacts of climate change altogether, the IMF’s role requires it to grapple with the implications for economies of acting versus not acting on global warming. The standard models addressing these tend to have limitations — many of them ably critiqued by my fellow Bloomberg Green contributor Gernot Wagner — but the underlying assumption is often that cutting emissions means sacrificing growth.In its new report, the IMF takes a different tack, arguing that there is no trade-off between the two. It also goes further than a lot of climate economists by factoring in the so-called “co-benefits” from cutting emissions — the often neglected side effects, such as fewer deaths from air pollution, and reduced traffic.The IMF’s climate chapter models a package of policy measures that it says would enable the world to get to net zero carbon emissions by mid-century. In addition to a carbon price starting at a modest $6 to $10 per ton, the package includes 80% subsidies for renewable energy production, a swathe of green public investments, compensation for households, and a supportive fiscal approach — that is, being prepared to load up on debt for the next decade. The IMF points out, reasonably enough, that we seem to be in a low-for-long interest rate environment.Cleverly, the IMF tests its measures against those reductive cost/benefit models — both the old school modelling by William Nordhaus, which is notorious for downplaying the damage caused by climate change, and the newer methodology developed by Marshall Burke, Solomon Hsiang and Edward Miguel in 2015 that found up to a quarter of global GDP could be affected by 2100 if emissions aren’t cut. The IMF still concludes that its proposed measures are net beneficial throughout the rest of the century. Even using the model where climate action is most harmful to growth — Nordhaus’ — the IMF’s projections show only a slight drag on GDP from 2037 to 2050, before the longer term benefits kick in. Even this, the IMF authors say, would be negated by benefits from lower air pollution and reduced traffic.The IMF’s WEO chapter builds on other evidence  published this year that green measures are good for economic growth, particularly when it comes to recoveries. It also adds to the growing understanding among policy makers that climate change is far more risky than most models would have us believe. The Network for Greening the Financial System — a coalition of dozens of central banks and financial supervisors — noted last year that higher cost estimates were more “robust”, and that most attempts to model the cost of climate change leave out effects such as catastrophic events and sea level rise.The IMF’s new approach might herald a tipping point not just in the institution’s thinking about climate change, but the mainstream views of economics and policy making. The fund’s Fall 2012 World Economic Outlook included the argument that austerity measures might counteract growth, marking the crumbling of a prevailing orthodoxy that had long been advanced by the IMF itself.Still, the IMF has to figure out how to implement its new thinking. A Dutch think tank, Recourse, last week published analysis suggesting that the IMF’s Article IV country reports don’t take climate change seriously enough. Its detailed review of the reports on Indonesia, India, South Africa, the Philippines and Mozambique found that climate change was only identified as a macroeconomic risk for the last two. The IMF analysis, Recourse argued, seemed to downplay the risks of South Africa and Indonesia’s heavy reliance on export earnings from coal, and of Mozambique being on the cusp of becoming a big exporter of both coal and natural gas. The report cites numerous instances where seemingly neutral IMF recommendations in areas such as tax or infrastructure would effectively lock in more dependence on fossil fuels.High level models are well and good, but as the Recourse report demonstrates, the details of implementation are what matters. That probably isn’t lost on IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. “Macro decisions have micro consequences,” she told Bloomberg Economics’ Stephanie Flanders last month, in a wide-ranging interview that also highlighted a little-known fact about her background: her PhD was, it turns out, in environmental economics. Kate Mackenzie writes the Stranded Assets column for Bloomberg Green. She advises organizations working to limit climate change to the Paris Agreement goals. Follow her on Twitter: @kmac.

17-10-2020||World||Vaccines against Covid-19 may not need to be administered annually: WHO Official||Ekaterina Ivanova - Any safe and effective vaccine against Covid-19 may not need to be administered annually, unlike vaccines for influenza, Dr. Richard Mihigo, the program area manager for immunization and vaccine development at the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, told Sputnik in an interview.“It’s difficult to predict now for how long the effect of the vaccine will last. It’s true that for flu vaccines, most of the time we need to repeat it every year, depending on the different strains of the virus being seasonal for north, west, etc. For the coronavirus, we believe that it may not necessarily be the case,” Dr. Mihigo remarked.Citing the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials of several candidate vaccines in South Africa, as well as of therapeutic treatments such as the steroid dexamethasone, the WHO official said it was unclear how long it will take for conclusive results to be drawn from the tests.“Our role is to create an enabling environment in which these therapeutics, these vaccines can be tested. And then we observe what will be the outcome of such clinical trials. It’s very difficult to predict when [we will see] the outcome,” Dr. Mihigo said.Three vaccine producers - AstraZeneca, Johnson&Johnson, and Novavax - are currently conducting trials of candidate vaccines in South Africa, the WHO official outlined.“We do have a few clinical trials currently going on, mainly in South Africa ... The AstraZeneca trial started a couple of weeks ago. We have a Novavax vaccine that also started in South Africa and, most recently, the Johnson&Johnson vaccine that also started in South Africa. Other countries have also been approached - Kenya, Uganda - but clinical trials have not yet started there,” Dr. Mihigo said.Johnson&Johnson on Tuesday announced that clinical trials of their candidate vaccine against COVID-19 would be paused after one patient exhibited symptoms of an “unexplained” illness.AstraZeneca, which is producing its candidate vaccine in conjunction with the UK’s University of Oxford, was also forced to temporarily suspend its trials in early September after adverse side effects were seen in one patient.Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has said that Russian vaccines against Covid-19, which are based on the well-researched human adenovirus platform, may prove safer than using Western vaccines that are based on a chimpanzee adenovirus.The RDIF is producing the Sputnik V vaccine in conjunction with its developer, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-against-covid-19-may-not-need-to-be-administered-annually-who-official/story-u814G6NXV4s9Wk25OdODoL.html
17-10-2020||World||New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern headed for landslide win and a second term||Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was headed for a landslide win and a second term in office Saturday in New Zealand’s general election.With more than half the votes counted, Ardern’s liberal Labour Party had nearly double the support of its main challenger, the conservative National Party.Labour was on the cusp of winning an outright majority in Parliament, something that hasn’t happened since New Zealand implemented a proportional voting system 24 years ago. Typically, parties must form alliances to govern, but this time Ardern and Labour may be able to go it alone.“It’s a landslide that looks like our vote is the best it has been since the 1940s,” said Labour Minister David Parker. “It’s a tremendous accolade first and foremost to the prime minister, but also to the wider Labour team and the Labour movement.”A record number of voters cast early ballots in the two weeks leading up to the election.On the campaign trail, Ardern was greeted like a rock star by people who crammed into malls and spilled onto streets to cheer her on and get selfies with her.Her popularity soared earlier this year after she led a successful effort to stamp out the coronavirus. There is currently no community spread of the virus in the nation of 5 million and people are no longer required to wear masks or social distance.Ardern, 40, won the top job after the 2017 election when Labour formed an alliance with two other parties. The following year, she became only the second world leader to give birth while in office.She became a role model for working mothers around the world, many of whom saw her as a counterpoint to President Donald Trump. And she was praised for her handling of last year’s attack on two Christchurch mosques, when a white supremacist gunned down 51 Muslim worshippers.She moved quickly to pass new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons.In late March this year, when only about 100 people had tested positive for COVID-19, Ardern and her health officials put New Zealand into a strict lockdown with a motto of “Go hard and go early.” She shut the borders and outlined an ambitious goal of eliminating the virus entirely rather than just trying to control its spread.With New Zealand having the advantage of being an isolated island nation, the strategy worked. The country eliminated community transmission for 102 days before a new cluster was discovered in August in Auckland. Ardern swiftly imposed a second lockdown in Auckland and the new outbreak faded away. The only new cases found recently have been among returning travelers, who are in quarantine.The Auckland outbreak also prompted Ardern to postpone the election by a month and helped increase the early voter turnout.The National Party’s leader, Judith Collins, is a former lawyer. She served as a minister when National was in power and prides herself on a blunt, no-nonsense approach, a contrast to Ardern’s empathetic style. Collins, 61, was promising sweeping tax cuts in response to the economic downturn caused by the virus.In the election, voters also had a say on two contentious social issues — whether to legalize marijuana and euthanasia. Polls taken before the election indicated the euthanasia referendum was likely to pass while the marijuana vote remained uncertain. The results of both referendums will be announced Oct. 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-s-jacinda-ardern-headed-for-landslide-win-and-a-second-term/story-5RlLkh9yU8Ca5c06tGzSeP.html
17-10-2020||World||‘Something close’ to genocide in China’s Xinjiang, says US security adviser||The US national security adviser said on Friday that China was perpetrating “something close to” a genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.“If not a genocide, something close to it going on in Xinjiang,” Robert O’Brien told an online event hosted by the Aspen Institute, while highlighting other Chinese crackdowns including one on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.The United States has denounced China’s treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses. It has not, though, so far termed Beijing’s actions genocide, a designation that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.O’Brien referred to seizures by US customs of “massive numbers” of hair products made with human hair from Xinjiang.“The Chinese are literally shaving the heads of Uighur women and making hair products and sending them to the United States,” he said.US Customs and Border Protection said in June it had detained a shipment originating in Xinjiang of hair products and accessories suspected of being forced-labor products made with human hair.In June, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled as “shocking” and “disturbing” reports that China was using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against Muslims in Xinjiang.He said last month Washington was considering the language it would use to describe what is happening in the region but added: “When the United States speaks about crimes against humanity or genocide ... we’ve got to be very careful and very precise because it carries an enormous weight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/something-close-to-genocide-in-china-s-xinjiang-says-us-security-adviser/story-YHUs3BSyIF3yE9H8FxlQCO.html
17-10-2020||World||In his speech, Nawaz Sharif takes on Imran Khan||Pakistan’s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday directly hit out at Imran Khan and the economic situation of the country as he addressed the first public rally of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) in Gujranwala city. Sharif addressed the rally of the newly-formed joint opposition alliance, which is being headed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the chief of the Jamiat-Ulema Islam (F), virtually from London.“The smiling faces I left behind look gloomy today. Gujranwala has always loved Nawaz Sharif. I am talking to you after three years. Many things have changed in the last three years,” he told the audience. “If I was not removed from the premiership the country and the economy would have been in a much better condition today,” Sharif said during the rally, which many said was attended by thousands.From joblessness to the prices of gold and basic items such as medicines, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) leader attacked the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government on multiple fronts .”I heard that the cost of per tola gold has crossed 110k. Will someone tell me how will a poor person’s daughter get married? PTI government used to say that they will give 10 million jobs, but about 15 million people have gone unemployed in this government. They said they will give five million houses. Tell me, has anyone gotten a single home?” he asked.In the speech of the 70-year-old Sharif, who is in London since November last year after Lahore High Court granted him permission to go abroad for four weeks for treatment, India also figured. During his time as prime minister, Sharif said, the government stood tall with the nuclear tests that it conducted in response to the tests carried out by India. “But we saw Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit us and talk to us,” he said. He was referring PM Modi’s trip to Pakistan in 2015.Also read | Imran Khan govt would ‘go home’ before January: Maryam NawazSharif also recalled former Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s comments in the visitors’ book at Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. “What beautiful sentiments he expressed. Wasn’t that a better Pakistan?” he asked. “Some people have a desire that my voice doesn’t reach you but their conspiracies will fail,” he said.The three-time premier also attacked the Pakistan army, saying it “broke the country into two”. Sharif directly accused army chief General Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt General Faiz Hameed of rigging the elections and making fabricated cases of corruption against opposition leaders. “They have to be held accountable for their crimes.”Sharif, who is currently out on bail and is facing multiple corruption charges, also accused the military and the intelligence agency of being behind his ouster as premier and installing their “puppet government” by bringing Imran Khan into power. “Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa ended my government. He rigged 2018 elections and imposed incapable Imran Khan on the nation. Gen Bajwa is a direct culprit and he will have to give an answer to this,” he said.PML (N) vice-president Maryam Nawaz, also Sharif’s daughter, was also at the rally in Gujranwala and so was Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. Maryam Nawaz was muted on a live telecast when she started speaking against Gen Bajwa. The next PDM rally is scheduled to be held on Sunday in Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-his-speech-nawaz-sharif-takes-on-imran-khan-recalls-pm-modi-s-visit/story-054rS12usTvZD05fEPZZtN.html

The economy is already shifting into lower gear. Other data on Friday showed an unexpected drop in output at factories last month.“Although sales growth is strong, it will slow through the rest of this year and into next year,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “The slowing will be even larger if Congress does not pass another stimulus bill. Unemployment remains pervasive throughout the U.S. economy.”Retail sales jumped 1.9% last month as consumers bought motor vehicles and clothing, dined out and splashed out on hobbies. That followed an unrevised 0.6% increase in August.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 0.7% in September. Some said September’s surge was likely exaggerated by difficulties stripping seasonal fluctuations from the data after the shock caused by Covid-19. Unadjusted retail sales fell 2.8% after dropping 1.0% in August.Retail sales have bounced back above their February level, with the pandemic boosting demand for goods that complement life at home, including furniture and electronics. An aversion to public transportation has boosted motor vehicle purchases. Retail sales rose 5.4% on a year-on-year basis in September. They account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, sales increased 1.4% last month after a downwardly revised 0.3% drop in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have dipped 0.1% in August.Economists have attributed the strength in retail sales to fiscal stimulus, especially a weekly subsidy paid to tens of millions of unemployed Americans. September’s robust sales reinforced expectations for record consumer spending and economic growth in the third quarter.Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate. That would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of Covid-19. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.U.S. stocks bounced from three straight days of losses on the retail sales data and Pfizer’s announcement that it could apply for emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate as early as November.BROAD SALES GAINS Last month, sales at auto dealerships surged 3.6%. Receipts at restaurants and bars increased 2.1%. Receipts at clothing stores jumped 11.0%.“Some of the gain may have reflected increased demand from back to school sales, but with most schools remote learning the reported strength seems dramatic and likely unsustainable,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.Even with September’s gains, sales at bars, restaurants and clothing stores remain well below their pre-pandemic levels. Purchases at electronics and appliance stores fell 1.6%. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.5%. Furniture store sales gained 0.5%. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores rebounded 5.7%. These categories notched big year-on-year increases in September, which economists said showed the uneven impact of the recession.“It’s further evidence of how many top earners have managed to dodge the pandemic by working from home, while most lower- paid workers have been forced to choose between jobs putting them at risk, when they can find them, and unemployment,” said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.The White House and Congress are struggling to reach a deal on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed. The government reported on Thursday that new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a two-month high last week.Last month’s jump in retail sales set consumer spending on a higher growth path heading into the fourth quarter, which will likely ensure that the economy continues to expand, though at a moderate pace. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been slashed to as low as a 3% rate from above a 10% pace. Some economists believe that historic savings could cushion consumer spending in the absence of more financial aid from the government. Others, however, caution that rising Covid-19 infections and job losses could encourage some consumers to hunker down and conserve savings.A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment edging up in early October. Consumers, however, worried about current economic conditions because of “slowing employment growth, the resurgence in Covid-19 infections and the absence of additional federal relief payments.”They were less enthusiastic about buying household appliances. The share who believed it was a good time to buy a car was the lowest in nine years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-retail-sales-blow-expectations-in-september-dark-clouds-gathering/story-my8NwbnLT6adV1NH806efP.html

Lock up Hillary,” Trump declared at a rally in Macon, Georgia, stoking the crowd that chanted “lock him up” in favor of the Democratic candidate’s imprisonment.“We’ve learned over the last couple of months: Joe Biden is a corrupt politician,” Trump said to his supporters, “and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise.”Trump frequently demanded that his 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, be incarcerated over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. It was believed to be the first time he has ever used that sort of attack against the Bidens.The FBI declined in 2016 to recommend charges against Clinton for sending a small number of classified emails through a private server at her New York home.Trailing behind Biden in most opinion polls with the election less than three weeks away, Trump has zeroed in on a New York Post report from earlier this week that highlights documents purporting to show the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and China.The Post article, citing unverified emails from a laptop abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop, alleged that Hunter Biden introduced a Ukrainian businessman to his father, who has said he’s never talked with his son about his international business dealings. The emails provided no proof of a meeting. The businessman, according to the article, thanked Hunter Biden for “the opportunity to meet your father.”The Biden campaign said his calendars turned up no record that the former vice president ever met with the businessman.The laptop’s hard drive was given to Trump ally Steve Bannon, who gave it to Rudy Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert Costello. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump’s lawyer, gave it to the Post.“I have no response. Another smear campaign,” Biden said Friday when asked about the reports.The Washington Post reported Thursday that Trump was warned last year that Giuliani had become the target of Russian intelligence for an influence operation. Giuliani’s efforts to obtain disparaging information about the Bidens from Ukrainian officials contributed to Trump’s impeachment in the House of Representatives.Biden and Trump are scheduled to meet for a presidential debate in Nashville next Thursday, their final encounter of the 2020 campaign.During the rally, Trump raised the possibility of a loss to Biden, though making light of it.“I shouldn’t joke because you know what, running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics puts pressure on me,” he said. “Could you imagine if I lose? My whole life, what am I going to do, I’m going to say, I lost to the worst candidate in the history of politics. I’m not going to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country, I don’t know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lock-up-the-bidens-donald-trump-says-at-georgia-campaign-rally/story-O2s1kaITetRcfbKJmfxqkK.html

Instead of providing relief to families, Senate Republicans are trying to rush through a Supreme Court nominee in an illegitimate process. Don’t forget this,” Harris tweeted.Americans are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a historic economic crisis. Instead of providing relief to families, Senate Republicans are trying to rush through a Supreme Court nominee in an illegitimate process. Don’t forget this.The Senate Judiciary Committee is currently conducting the confirmation hearings of Barrett whose nomination will ensure conservative majority in the US Supreme Court for decades to come. Barrett is a Republican favourite and Donald Trump picking her could not have come at a more convenient time as the US president faces a re-election at a time when Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is leading in the national polls.The nomination of Barrett will also help around a dozen Republicans who face tough re-elections in their own states as she is known for her stance against abortion and Obamacare.Barrett also faced tough questions from Harris on October 14 when the Democratic vice-presidential nominee asked her if she believed that climate change was real, whether smoking caused cancer and if she thought coronavirus is infectious. Barrett answered yes to the questions regarding coronavirus disease and cancer.Kamala Harris, according to Associated Press, asked Barrett, “Do you believe that climate change is happening and that it’s threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink?” Barrett answered, “...very contentious matter of public debate. I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially when that is politically controversial.”Amy Coney Barrett will admit that COVID-19 is infectious. She’ll admit that smoking causes cancer. But whether climate change is real? Apparently that’s up for debate.Democrats fear that Barrett’s nomination will challenge the progress made so far regarding abortion in the United States and will help repeal the Affordable Care Act. The Judiciary Committee will hold the voting on October 22 to nominate Barrett to the US Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-slams-republicans-for-rushing-barrett-s-nomination-instead-of-helping-covid-19-struck-us/story-WiARSLsSFImqoBuD6jFKtL.html

The citywide testing was ordered after 13 people were infected in China’s first locally transmitted cases in over two months.The source of the outbreak was traced to two dock workers who had tested positive for the virus in September but did not exhibit any symptoms at first. They had visited a hospital in Qingdao and were sent to a CAT scan room, which was not disinfected properly afterward and led to the infection of other patients, according to health officials.Health Commission Director Sui Zhenhua and Deng Kai, president of Qingdao’s thoracic hospital to which the cases have been linked, have been placed under investigation in connection with the outbreak.On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported 13 new imported cases. China has reported 4,634 deaths among 85,659 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/basically-eliminated-qingdao-mayor-on-community-transmission-risk-after-testing-11-mn-citizens/story-S6Tely25QcxBPNPrEPhyCL.html
17-10-2020||World||Georgia’s Republican senator mispronounces Kamala Harris’s name at a rally for Donald Trump, sparks outrage||Republican Senator David Perdue, who is seeking re-election from the state of Georgia, has sparked a storm after mispronouncing Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s first name during a speech at a rally for US President Donald Trump.“Kamala? Kamala? Kamala-mala-mala? I don’t know. Whatever,” Perdue said at a campaign stop in Macon, Georgia, in a comment that is being seen by many as a deliberately racist ploy to denigrate Harris.It is unlikely that Perdue would have made the remark out of ignorance or by accident because he has served with Harris, a senator from California, for at least three years. Mispronouncing Harris’s name has become standard practice for Republicans in recent times in what is seen by many as an effort to belittle her by highlighting her heritage - she’s the daughter of an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father.President Trump has been seen as leading the effort to belittle Harris by mispronouncing her name even as his re-election campaign has sought to reach out to Indian-American voters by claiming close ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.After Perdue’s controversial remark, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff shot back in a tweet, writing, “My opponent, GOP Sen. David Perdue of anti-Semitic attack ad infamy, just mocked Sen. Harris’ name as ‘Kamala-mala-mala-whatever’ at a Trump rally.”He added, “Senator Perdue never would have done this to a male colleague. Or a white colleague. And everyone knows it.”Perdue’s comment was a reminder of a 2006 incident at a campaign stop in Breaks, Virginia. There was an outcry after George Allen, a Republican senator from Virginia, had reportedly referred to SR Sidarth, an Indian-origin Democrat shadowing his campaign, as “macaca”, which is a genus of monkey. Allen subsequently lost his seat. As a standard opposition practice, Sidarth had been filming Allen’s campaign event on behalf of rival Jim Webb’s campaign.John Burke, a spokesperson for Perdue, sought to play down the incident, tweeting, “Senator Perdue simply mispronounced Senator Harris’s name, and he didn’t mean anything by it. He was making an argument against the radical socialist agenda that she and her endorsed candidate Jon Ossoff are pushing.”Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for White House hopeful Joe Biden’s campaign, replied to Burke, tweeting, “Yes, that’s why he articulated all of those things by saying, ‘Kamala-ma-la-ma-la’. How many staff refused to put this in their name before you debased yours? Christ, y’all are pathetic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-s-republican-senator-mispronounces-kamala-harris-s-name-at-a-rally-for-donald-trump-sparks-outrage/story-U1GfcDNCww7d21SG0wk90L.html
17-10-2020||World||Pro-Brexit electorates have tough questions for UK PM Johnson as Covid-19 cases rise||Celebrating his election victory at a hotel bar in Barrow-in-Furness, Simon Fell made a promise to supporters: as the northern English town’s new Conservative member of Parliament he’d make sure the leadership in London “listens to us.”Less than a year after ousting the Labour Party in one of its heartlands in December, Fell is concerned those voters aren’t being heard as the coronavirus rips through the country. “A lot of people explicitly said to me that they lent me their vote at the last election,” he said this week. “People quite rightly look around their town and think we’ve been left behind.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s strategy for dealing with surging infections with localized restrictions has sparked an insurrection in some northern regions and further divided the country. But crucially, it’s also complicated his relationship with the places that propelled him to power on the back of his promises to deliver Brexit and tackle economic inequality.Swathes of the north and Midlands, parts of the “red wall” of Labour strongholds than turned Tory blue in the election, are in lockdown. Many pubs and restaurants are shuttered and people are banned from visiting their relatives. Some areas have suffered tough restrictions for over two months, while London and the more affluent southeast of England have—until this week—escaped the sharp end of the pandemic.Many Tory MPs who were vital to Johnson’s electoral success complained on Twitter that they aren’t being kept in the loop on the latest measures.A group of Conservatives representing districts in and around the northern city of Manchester turned on health minister Helen Whately in a Zoom call on Thursday as she made the case for the area to be put in the highest of the UK’s three levels of restrictions. Two days earlier, Chris Green, the Conservative MP for neighboring Bolton, resigned as a ministerial aide and warned Johnson that “the cure is worse than the disease.” The backlash is a concern for Johnson. He scored the biggest Conservative win since the 1980s on a campaign to “level up” the country with investment in the poorer northern regions after taking the UK out of the European Union.Those places are now recording the biggest spikes in virus cases in a country that already has Europe’s highest death toll from Covid-19. Infection rates in the north are more than double the average for the rest of England. Unemployment is surging, while talks on a post-Brexit trade deal could go either way. Negotiations resume next week after Johnson said on Friday an agreement looks unlikely. One minister said it was a “nightmare” that the regions suffering the most—and requiring the tightest restrictions on business—were the same ones that gave the Tories a big majority. The key is to win back trust by delivering on investment, the minister said. “If we do that, we can recover. If we fail to do that, we’re toast.”Fell joined a group of Conservative MPs pushing to ensure Johnson sticks to his promises. Of the 5.5 million people who live in the most deprived areas of England, almost 60 percent of them live in the three northern regions.The government made a down payment on investment promises in the March budget, with extra billions for infrastructure projects. But the plans have been thrown into doubt by the vast cost of protecting an economy facing its worst year for three centuries.Debt is already above 100% of economic output, and is expected to keep rising rapidly unless the government raises taxes or cuts spending. Unemployment, meanwhile, could surpass 3 million people, levels not seen since the 1980s, with northern regions among the hardest hit.The growing anger is reflected in Conservatives who now seem more politically aligned with local Labour Party mayors when it comes to new measures to curb the virus, such as shutting the hospitality industry.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, vowed to fight plans for tighter controls, saying on Thursday the north wouldn’t be “forgotten and pushed aside.” He refused Johnson’s request to move to the highest level of pandemic curbs unless there’s more financial support. On Friday, Johnson warned he will have no choice but to impose the toughest available measures on Manchester unless Burnham backed down.One Tory MP representing a more affluent southern English district said his northern party colleagues already know they won’t last, and that makes them more rebellious. But they are also critical. As Jake Berry, who represents a district in Lancashire, put it: “We are literally the prime minister’s majority, so he needs to look after us.”Britain’s next general election isn’t due until May 2024, but the government faces an effective referendum on its coronavirus strategy in a series of local and mayoral votes next May.Polls show the Conservatives are now neck and neck with Labour, the worst showing since before Johnson became leader in July 2019. Scotland, whose leadership has also been critical of Johnson, also holds elections with the pro-independence nationalists on course to win big again.A scientist who sits on the government’s pandemic advisory committee said on Friday that the fragmentation of the country risks damaging public health. “Frankly, making this either a north-south or a party political issue, that’s a very dangerous route to go on,” Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust research charity, told the BBC. Johnson has time to turn it around because many voters who defected to his party want to have their decision vindicated, according to Deborah Mattinson, co-founder of consultancy Britain Thinks and author of “Beyond the Red Wall.” But her research showed people who voted Tory for the first time feel “they have been ignored and hard done by compared with other places,” she said. “There’s a sense of being picked on.”The task in heading up a coherent and effective response to Covid-19 is complex because of the sheer level of political devolution in the UK Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have long had their own parliament. But now the premier is also negotiating with a raft of metropolitan mayors across England, many of whom are Labour.Burnham in Manchester stood in a navy anorak on the steps of the city’s Central Library as he told the government he would not accept the region being forced into the toughest coronavirus restrictions. People clapped behind the TV cameras as he said Manchester and other northern cities were “being set up as the canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy.”“The north is fed up of being pushed around,” Burnham said. “This is real—the north stands on the brink of being back where we were in the 1980s. But we won’t let that happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-brexit-electorates-have-tough-questions-for-uk-pm-johnson-as-covid-19-cases-rise/story-0xGMeDHFFRro68q097yZLJ.html

The suspected attacker was shot and killed by police.French President Emmanuel Macron denounced what he called an “Islamist terrorist attack” and urged the nation to stand united against extremism. The teacher had discussed caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad with his class, authorities said.The French anti-terrorism prosecutor opened an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive, the prosecutor’s office said.Macron visited the school where the teacher worked in the town of Conflans-Saint-Honorine and met with staff after the slaying. An Associated Press reporter saw three ambulances arrive at the scene, and heavily armed police surrounding the area and police vans lining leafy nearby streets.“One of our compatriots was murdered today because he taught ... the freedom of expression, the freedom to believe or not believe,” Macron said.He said the attack shouldn’t divide France because that’s what the extremists want. “We must stand all together as citizens,” he said.The incident came as Macron’s government works on a bill to address Islamist radicals who authorities claim are creating a parallel society outside the values of the French Republic. France has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe with up to 5 million members, and Islam is the country’s No. 2 religion.The killing of the teacher occurred in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine while the fleeing suspect was killed by police in adjoining Eragny.A police official said the suspect, armed with a knife and an airsoft gun — which fires plastic pellets — was shot dead about 600 meters (yards) from where the male teacher was killed after he failed to respond to orders to put down his arms, and acted in a threatening manner.The teacher had received threats after opening a discussion “for a debate” about the caricatures about 10 days ago, the police official told The Associated Press. The parent of a student had filed a complaint against the teacher, another police official said, adding that the suspected killer did not have a child at the school.An ID card was found at the scene of the suspect, but police were verifying the identity, the police official said. French media reported that the suspect was an 18-year-old Chechen, born in Moscow. That information could not be immediately confirmed.France has seen occasional violence involving its Chechen community in recent months, in the Dijon region, the Mediterranean city of Nice, and the western town of Saint-Dizier, believed linked to local criminal activity.It was not known what link, if any, the attacker might have with the teacher or whether he had accomplices. Police were fanning out on searches of homes and potential family and friends of the man in question, French media reported — a “classic” scenario in a terrorism case, the police official said.The two officials could not be named because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing investigations.“We didn’t see this coming,” Conflans resident Remi Tell, who as a child had attended the Bois D’Aulne middle school, said on CNews TV station. He described the town as peaceful.It was the second terrorism-related incident since the opening of an ongoing trial on the newsroom massacre in Jan. 2015 at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo after the publication of caricatures of the prophet of Islam.As the trial started, the paper republished caricatures of the prophet to underscore the right of freedom of expression. Quickly, a young man from Pakistan was arrested after stabbing two people with a meat cleaver outside the newspaper’s former offices. They did not suffer threatening injuries. The 18-year-old told police he was upset about the publication of the caricatures.In a video posted recently on social media, a man describing himself as a father at the school said the teacher who was slain had recently shown an offensive image of a man and told students it was “the prophet of the Muslims.” Before showing the images, the teacher asked Muslim children to leave the room because he planned to show something shocking, the man said.“What was the message he wanted to send these children? ... Why does a history teacher behave this way in front of 13-year-olds?” the man asked. He called on other angry parents to contact him, and relay the message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-teacher-beheading-murdered-because-he-taught-freedom-of-expression-says-french-pm-macron/story-gfEtkUOquuRFvc2uPJPEBJ.html
17-10-2020||World||Nawaz Sharif accuses Pakistan’s army chief of toppling his government||Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan’s former prime minister, told an election rally on Friday night that the country’s army chief, General Qamar Bajwa, was responsible for toppling his government and installing Imran Khan as prime minister.Addressing the first public rally of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), the newly-formed joint opposition alliance, in Gujranwala via video link from London, Sharif accused army chief General Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt General Faiz Hameed of rigging elections, removing his government, muzzling the media, pressurising the judiciary, and victimising opposition politicians.Several opposition leaders attended the PDM’s opening rally. Much of Sharif’s speech was not covered by TV news channels due to a ban by the country’s broadcast regulator that disallowed the airing of speeches, statements and interviews of proclaimed offenders and absconders. But the ban didn’t stop thousands of people from attending the PDM’s rally. One estimate put the number of people attending it at around 20,000. “This is all your doing,” Sharif said, addressing Bajwa in his speech, adding, “I hold you responsible for all the mess you have created. We are seeing unemployment, unprecedented inflation. The ‘roti’ now costs ten rupees and medicine prices have reached new heights. People cannot afford to pay their electricity bills.” Sharif added, “Call me a traitor. Call me a rebel. Make me a convict. Label me a hijacker. Seize my properties. File false cases against me, but Nawaz Sharif will continue to speak for his people.”The former PM pointed out that dictators in Pakistan have repeatedly labelled politicians as traitors. “The army has accused most of those who fight for the constitution as traitors,” he said. Recalling the past, Sharif said that Fatima Jinnah, often referred to as one of the founders of the country, had also been accused of being anti-state, and that since then, the trend has continued. “Sheikh Mujib (Mujibur Rahman) was accused of being a traitor, and that led to the creation of Bangladesh. But the real traitor was General AAK Niazi, who surrendered shamelessly in Dhaka, but no one can calls him a traitor,” Sharif said.Sharif said that during his time as prime minister, the government stood tall with the nuclear tests that it conducted in response to the tests carried out by India. “But we saw Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit us and talk to us (in 2015)”, he added.Sharif told his audience that the comments of former Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the visitors’ book at Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore must be read. “What beautiful sentiments he expressed,” recalled Sharif, adding, “Wasn’t that a better Pakistan?”Taking on the current PM, Sharif said that the source of the funding behind Khan’s property should be investigated. “We will investigate Imran Khan. We will investigate his sister Aleema Khan. We will investigate the dealings of General Asim Saleem Bajwa, who has made billions,” he said.Pakistan Muslim League (N) vice-president Maryam Nawaz arrived at the rally in Gujranwala at around 9pm, local time, followed by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.Most political analysts in the country believe the PDM’s opening rally, held in an open stadium in Gujranwala in biting cold, was a success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-accuses-pakistan-s-army-chief-of-toppling-his-government/story-iyB1l9dA5Z47ta2pq8XhvM.html
17-10-2020||World||Republican senator Perdue’s mocking ‘mispronunciation’ of Kamala Harris’ name earns him flak||Republican US Senator David Perdue appeared to mock Kamala Harris at a rally for President Donald Trump in battleground state Georgia on Friday, where he repeatedly mispronounced the vice presidential nominee’s name.Harris, a US senator from California, is the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica. Former Vice President Joe Biden named Harris as his running mate in August, making her the first Black woman and first Asian American to join a major party’s presidential ticket.She has said her name should be pronounced “comma-la.”Perdue, who is in a closely fought battle for re-election to the senate against Democrat Jon Ossoff, spoke ahead of Trump in the central Georgia city of Macon on Friday evening.Video of his speech shows Perdue repeatedly making exaggerated attempts to pronounce the name before saying, “I don’t know, whatever.” The crowd responds with laughter.David Perdue is just gross. He mispronounced @KamalaHarris' name just now warming up the stage for @realDonaldTrump to score race-baiting, cheap political cheers. pic.twitter.com/kiLmn8682AOssoff tweeted that Perdue would not have mocked a fellow senator who was male or white.John Burke, a spokesman for Perdue’s campaign, tweeted that the senator “simply mispronounced Senator Harris’ name, and he didn’t mean anything by it.”Republican incumbent Trump is trailing Biden in national opinion polls, but state polls show a close race in Georgia, a state that has become increasingly diverse and more Democratic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-senator-perdue-s-mocking-mispronunciation-of-kamala-harris-name-earns-him-flak/story-SM63GwuX8pdgugIpc5dxPL.html
17-10-2020||World||US to carry out first federal execution of a woman in seven decades||The US Justice Department said on Friday it has scheduled the first federal execution of a woman in almost 70 years, setting a Dec. 8 date to put to death Lisa Montgomery, convicted of a 2004 murder. Montgomery, who was found guilty of strangling a pregnant woman in Missouri, will be executed by lethal injection at US Penitentiary Terre Haute, Indiana, the department said in a statement. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who was put to death in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The justice department on Friday also scheduled a Dec. 10. execution for Brandon Bernard, who with his accomplices murdered two youth ministers in 1999. The two executions will be the eighth and ninth the federal government has carried out in 2020. The Trump administration ended an informal 17-year-hiatus in federal executions in July, after announcing last year that the Bureau of Prisons was switching to a new single-drug protocol for lethal injections, from a three-drug combination it last used in 2003.The new protocol revived long-running legal challenges to lethal injections. In August, a federal judge in Washington, DC ruled the Justice Department was violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in not seeking a doctor’s prescription to administer the highly regulated barbiturate.But an appeals court held the violation did not in itself amount to “irreparable harm” and allowed federal executions to proceed. In 2007, a US District Court for the Western District of Missouri sentenced Montgomery to death after finding her guilty of a federal kidnapping resulting in death.Her attorney, Kelley Henry, said that Montgomery deserves to live because she is mentally ill and suffered childhood abuse.“Lisa Montgomery has long accepted full responsibility for her crime, and she will never leave prison,” Henry said in a statement. “But her severe mental illness and the devastating impacts of her childhood trauma make executing her a profound injustice.”Bernard’s attorney, Robert Owen, said in a statement the federal government misled the jury in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, which in 2000 found Bernard guilty of murder. Its decision was tainted by false testimony, Owen said. “This evidence confirms that Mr. Bernard is simply not one of the ‘worst of the worst’ offenders for whom we reserve the death penalty, and that sparing his life would pose no risk to anyone,” Owen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-carry-out-first-federal-execution-of-a-woman-in-seven-decades/story-gJ78VU4JeP9tpd7lJMarJJ.html
17-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Covid-19, national security among topics of next Donald Trump-Joe Biden debate||The next debate between US President Donald Trump and his Democratic contender Joseph Biden will focus on several topics including Covid-19 and national security, the Commission on Presidential debates said in a statement on Friday.“Kristen Welker, moderator of the October 22, 2020 presidential debate, has selected the topics for that debate,” the Commission said.The full list of topics includes fighting Covid-19, American families, Race in America, climate change, national security and leadership, it added.The next debate will be held on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-covid-19-national-security-among-topics-of-next-donald-trump-joe-biden-debate/story-aISFWxP9LwekATnp9YMIGP.html
17-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Donald Trump revels in division, chaos, says Joe Biden||US President Donald Trump “revels” in division and chaos, and he will do anything to distract people from his failures to deal with the Covid-19 situation, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has alleged.Speaking at a restricted election campaign event on Friday at Southfield in Michigan, a battleground state, Biden said the country is paying a heavy price for Trump’s policies on Covid-19.“Hate never goes away. It only hides. And if you give it oxygen, it grows. So we need to be clear: from the president on down in this country, there is no place for hate in America,” he said.“President Trump revels in division and chaos. He will do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and protect this nation,” Biden said.He is still living in a dream world and “keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear like a miracle”, the presidential candidate said.“But it’s (coronavirus) not disappearing. In fact, it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse. We all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives are being lost. Unemployment is way up,” Biden said.He said that across Michigan and the country, people are worried about making their next rent or mortgage payment, whether their health care will be ripped away in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, worried about school and their children.More than 215,000 dead because of Covid-19 and experts say “we will lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months”, he said.This is “because he refuses to follow science. Because he refuses to embrace wearing a mask. Because he refuses to practice social distancing”, Biden said.He alleged that as a consequence of Trump’s overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible actions, there are empty chairs around dinner tables.“But mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your health care,” Biden said.Trump, he alleged, is still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. “This isn’t hyperbole — this is real. As real as it gets,” Biden said.Reiterating that Trump will be the first president in modern US history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he began, Biden said he has a plan to bring the economy back.“An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, projects that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs — over 7 million more jobs than the President’s economic plan, and USD 1 trillion more in economic growth than the president’s plan,” he said. Biden assured that he is not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than USD 400,000 a year. “You won’t pay a penny more. But I’ll ask big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change,” he said. “Of Trumps’ more than USD2 trillion dollar tax cut, I’m going to roll back USD 1.5 trillion of his giveaways to the biggest companies and top one per cent. The money we raise will allow us to invest in working people and growing the middle class, and make sure everyone is included in the deal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-donald-trump-revels-in-division-chaos-says-joe-biden/story-mCisqSa6Loy6BumCVcLUyJ.html
17-10-2020||World||‘Blocking of URLs was wrong’: CEO Jack Dorsey on New York Post Biden story||Twitter was wrong to block weblinks to an unverified political story, CEO Jack Dorsey said on Friday, as the company responded to criticism over its handling of the story that had prompted cries of censorship from the right.“Straight blocking of URLs was wrong, and we updated our policy and enforcement to fix,” he tweeted. “Our goal is to attempt to add context, and now we have capabilities to do that.”Dorsey was weighing in after an executive at the social media company announced changes late Thursday to its policy on hacked content following an onslaught of criticism.Twitter will no longer remove hacked material unless it’s directly shared by hackers or those working with them, the company’s head of legal, policy, trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde, said in a Twitter thread.And instead of blocking links from being shared, tweets will be labeled to provide context, Gadde said.“We want to address the concerns that there could be many unintended consequences to journalists, whistleblowers and others in ways that are contrary to Twitter’s purpose of serving the public conversation,” she said.Twitter and Facebook had moved quickly this week to limit the spread of the story published by the conservative-leaning New York Post, which cited unverified emails from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son that were reportedly discovered by President Donald Trump’s allies. The story has not been confirmed by other publications.Twitter initially responded by banning users from sharing links to the article in tweets and direct messages because it violated the company’s policy prohibiting hacked content. But it didn’t alert users about why they couldn’t share the link until hours later.Dorsey had first tweeted that it was “unacceptable” the company hadn’t provided more context around its action. A little over 24 hours later, Gadde announced the company was making changes after receiving “significant feedback (from critical to supportive)” about how it enforced the policy.The company said the link to the New York Post story will still be blocked under a policy prohibiting sharing personal information. However, users were widely sharing the story on Friday and it wasn’t clear why they were able to do so.Facebook said it was “reducing” the story’s distribution on its platform while waiting for third-party fact-checkers to verify it, something it regularly does with material that’s not banned outright from its service, though it risks spreading lies or causing harm in other ways.Trump is now incorporating Twitter’s action into his campaign rallies, pleading with his supporters to send a message on Election Day to what he described as “censors.”“We’re not just running against Joe Biden. We’re running against left-wing media and we’re running against big tech,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blocking-of-urls-was-wrong-ceo-jack-dorsey-on-new-york-post-biden-story/story-a0kRlYshIQu3quTBzgwVlN.html
17-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Barack Obama to campaign for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris||Former US president Barack Obama will campaign for Democratic party presidential candidate Joe Biden in Pennsylvania next week, the Biden campaign has said. Biden, 77, was the vice president during Obama’s two terms. While Obama has endorsed Biden and his running mate and India-origin Senator Kamala Harris by making online campaigns for them, this would be the first time that the 59-year-old former president would be campaigning in person.Four years after he left the presidency, Obama because of his oratory skills, still remains the biggest crowd puller for the opposition Democratic party.“On Wednesday, October 21, (former) president Obama will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to campaign on behalf of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” the Biden campaign said in a statement on Friday afternoon. No other details were immediately available. Biden, as per the latest opinion polls, leads against Republican incumbent President Donald Trump by over nine points on an average. However, there are signs that the polls are tightening, especially after Trump resumed his rallies after recovering from Covid-19. He has been attracting thousands of supporters to his election rallies in the battleground states. Obama is the only Democratic leader who can attract a big crowd in his election rallies. His jumping into the campaign, with a little over a fortnight left for the presidential elections, is likely to motivate and encourage Black Americans and fence sitters to come out and vote, Biden strategists believe. A day earlier, the Democratic National Committee released a new ad featuring Obama, “The 2020 Election Is Already Here.” It highlights the stakes of this election, the importance of Americans voting now to make their voices heard and how they can find all the information they need to make their plan to vote. “Millions of Americans are already voting, make sure you stand up and join them,” Obama said in the ad. “There will always be reasons to think your vote doesn’t matter -- that’s not new. What is new is a growing movement for justice, equality and progress on so many issues. This really is a tipping point, and that momentum only continues if we win this election. But it’s gonna be close. It could come down to a handful of voters just like you. So I’m asking you to bring this thing home. Leave no doubt. Vote early,” he said. The ad is being run in all the battleground States through digital platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Hulu, and YouTube. During the Democratic National Convention this summer, Obama had launched a blistering attack against Trump. “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” he said in August. “And the consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-barack-obama-to-campaign-for-joe-biden-and-kamala-harris/story-OCCxS8yFP8ljjsulmP1DuM.html

French media have identified him as Samuel Paty.The teacher had asked pupils who were Muslim to raise their hands and invited them to leave, advising them he would be showing a caricature of Mohammad that might cause offence, said Chaouadi.For Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.Chaouadi said his son, a Muslim, interpreted the teacher’s actions as done out of kindness and respect for their faith.“He did it to protect the children, not to shock them,” said Chaouadi.Some parents took offence, however. Two or three days later, they held a meeting at the school with the teacher, school principal, and an official from the education authority.“It went well. There was no shouting or talking over each other. My wife took part in it. She said it was a man who made a mistake, it happens to everyone,” Chaouadi added.One man who said his daughter was in the class gave a similar account of the lesson in a video recorded around the time of the meeting. However, he branded the history teacher a thug, and posted the video on social media. The post was shared by a Paris mosque, among others.Reuters was not immediately able to authenticate the video.In the video, the man says: “If you want to join forces and say ‘stop, don’t touch our children, then send me a message.’“This thug should not remain in the national education system, should no longer teach our children. He should go educate himself,” he continues in the recording.The school, the College du Bois d’Aulne in the middle-class suburb of Conflans-Saint-Honorine, could not immediately be reached for comment.It was unclear whether the attacker, who was shot dead by police and has not been named, had seen the video.Lawmakers and teachers’ unions hailed the slain teacher’s courage for confronting challenging taboos in French society. Freedom of expression was a core tenet of democracy, they said.Jean-Remi Girard, president of the National Union of School Teachers, told BFM TV that children needed to understand that blasphemy can shock, but is legal.Blood has been spilled before in France over satire targeting Islam. Islamist militants killed 12 in a gun rampage in the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015 after it published a series of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.Local centre-right lawmaker Antoine Savignat said, “If we cannot talk about the Charlie Hebdo caricatures in school, we end up in denialism... In France, the country of freedom of expression, this cannot be allowed to happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-teacher-murder-blasphemy-can-shock-but-is-legal-says-head-of-teacher-s-union/story-0VyPvS3b2DjXdhiGsl3pTM.html
17-10-2020||World||‘Joe Biden is a disaster… living embodiment of corrupt political class’, says Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump again on Friday (local time) hit out at his Democratic counterpart and former Vice President Joe Biden and called him a “disaster” adding that he is “the living embodiment of the corrupt political class”.“Biden is a disaster...Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class. You look at what he has done--it is the political class that enriches itself while draining the economic life and soul from our country,” Trump said at the re-election campaign here.“It’s a corrupt family and these people (during Thursday’s town hall in Philadelphia) did not ask him one single question about it. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden has shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders,” he added.Trump called Biden a “servant of the wealthy globalist who got rich bleeding our country dry”. The Republican candidate also attacked Biden’s son Hunter for making a “deal with a Chinese business magnet” for USD 10 million per year further adding that these deals were made “at the same time Joe Biden was letting China steal our jobs.”Trump said, “IF Biden won, China would own the United States,” adding that the Bidens “got rich while America got robbed.” The US President said he “wasn’t only running against Joe Biden, but also against left-wing media and big tech.”“We are running against the left-wing media and we are running against big tech. They (the big-tech companies) were against us four years ago. Now they have gone crazy and they are doing things, they wouldn’t do; they’re getting caught,” he added.The US Presidential elections are scheduled to take place on November 3.

On Friday, during a rally in Ocala, Florida, Trump said he thinks he’ll win Minnesota in November’s election because of the representative, who was born in Somalia.“She hates our country. She comes from a place that doesn’t even have a government, and then she comes here tells us how to run our country,” he told his audience.“Thank you very much, she’s a real -- she’s a wonderful -- she’s a wonderful person,” he added, sarcastically.“If you look at the House with Pelosi and these people, it’s like they hate Israel and they believe in Omar, who came in here and married her brother or something, came in illegally,” Trump said, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “Come on, come on Justice. Let’s go Justice, Department of Justice.”Omar arrived in the US at the age of 12 in 1995 as a refugee fleeing Somalia’s civil war, according to the Associated Press. She became a citizen five years later, at the age of 17. She was elected to Congress in 2018.She has forcefully denied rumors circulated by conservative media outlets that her second husband was her brother and that she married him to commit immigration fraud, calling the allegation “absurd and offensive” in a statement issued during her congressional campaign. She has said she is the youngest of seven children but declined to identify her siblings for a 2018 AP story.No evidence has emerged that she either married her brother or migrated to the US illegally. Trump has previously promoted the rumor himself, telling reporters in July 2019 that “I’m sure somebody would be looking at that.”Omar’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/married-her-brother-came-in-illegally-trump-targets-democrat-ilhan-omar-asks-justice-department-to-probe/story-E791VrGtX6g9uSmBK6BvqM.html
17-10-2020||World||Nobel Prize winner urges billionaires to save millions from famine||The head of the World Food Program, this year’s winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, again urged billionaires to donate just a few billion to save millions of lives, saying Friday the number of people “marching toward starvation” has jumped from 135 million to 270 million since the Covid-19 pandemic.“Humanity needs the help right now,” David Beasley said. “This is a one-time request. ... The world is at a crossroads, and we need from the billionaires to step up in a way they’ve never stepped up before.”The executive director of the UN food agency told a virtual UN press conference that the global wealth of some 2,200 billionaires rose by about $2 trillion between April and July as the pandemic raged. He was referring to a study by Swiss bank UBS and accounting firm PwC published last week which said the global wealth of billionaires climbed from $8 trillion at the start of April to $10.2 trillion in July.“I just need a few billion to save millions of lives and save humanity from one of the greatest catastrophes since World War II,” Beasley said. “It’s not too much to ask.”Asked for names of some of the billionaires he was targeting Beasley replied: “I don’t get to hang around with that crowd. I’m hanging around people who are starving to death.”He said WFP is “greatly concerned about 2021” because budgets weren’t calculated to take into account the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read| Global hunger rises for first time in decade: UN agenciesBeasley said wealthy countries put $17 trillion into economic stimulus packages for their citizens to tackle the coronavirus, and “that’s $17 trillion that isn’t going to be available for 2021.”This year, he said, many governments reached deeper into their pockets while they could and gave the UN and its agencies more money, but the governments are now “tapped out.”Beasley said debts for middle- and low-income countries were put on hold or deferred until January 2021, and “that’s $8 trillion worth of debt services” coming due. In addition, remittances from overseas workers to families in developing countries have fallen, and lockdowns are adding to deteriorating economies.“It is an appalling situation,” he said.Beasley said that’s why a one-time infusion of cash from the billionaires is so essential for 2021.He said the humanitarian crises in the world are worsening, with Yemen “the worst of the worst of the worst,” Africa’s Sahel region “undoubtedly one of the worst,” Congo “just horrific” and Syria “deteriorating.” He said many other countries are also deteriorating including Nigeria, South Sudan and Ethiopia.Beasley got Covid-19 in March and has resumed traveling, including to Niger in the Sahel where he was last week when the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Program stunned and delighted staff and the broader United Nations family.The WFP chief said he went to the Sahel because “nobody is bringing to the world the calamities that are developing in a catastrophic way, and this is a time we’ve all got to come together.”“So all hands on deck,” Beasley said. “If we don’t get the support we need, you literally can be looking at famine in several dozen countries. But if we get the support we need we’ll avert famine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prize-winner-urges-billionaires-to-save-millions-from-famine/story-sxuRji4NCzDtVrvD827vlI.html
17-10-2020||World||Justices to weigh Donald Trump’s census plan to exclude non-citizens||The Supreme Court agreed Friday to take up President Donald Trump’s policy, blocked by a lower court, to exclude people living in the US illegally from the census count that will be used to allocate seats in the House of Representatives.Never in US history have immigrants been excluded from the population count that determines how House seats, and by extension Electoral College votes, are divided among the states, a three-judge federal count said in September when it held Trump’s policy illegal.The justices put the case on a fast track, setting arguments for Nov. 30. A decision is expected by the end of the year or early in January, when Trump has to report census numbers to the House.Trump’s supreme court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, could take part in the case if, as seems likely, she is confirmed by then.Last year, the court by a 5-4 vote barred Trump from adding a census question asking people about their citizenship. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month, was part of that slim majority. Barrett would take Ginsburg’s seat.Trump left it to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, to figure out how many immigrants are not living legally in each state.Also Read: Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination: Judiciary panel sets October 22 for voteThe outcome of the census case could affect the distribution of political power for the next 10 years. The census also helps determine the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal funding annually.The administration told the court that the president retains “discretion to exclude illegal aliens from the apportionment based on their immigration status.”The American Civil Liberties Union, representing a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, said Trump’s violation of federal law is “not particularly close or complicated.”The Supreme Court separately allowed the administration to end the actual census count this week, blocking a court order that would have kept the count going until the end of the month.The court did not take action on two other administration appeals of controversial policies on asylum seekers and the border wall that also were ruled illegal by lower courts.Since early last year, the administration has made asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for US court hearings, which has forced tens of thousands of people to return to Mexico.Known informally as “Remain in Mexico,” the policy became a key pillar of the administration’s response to a surge of asylum-seeking families from Central America at the southern border. It also drew criticism for having people wait in dangerous cities.The administration also is appealing a ruling that the administration can’t spend more than Congress authorized for border security. After Congress refused to give Trump all the money he wanted for the wall, he declared a national emergency at the border and Defense Department officials transferred billions of dollars to the project.Lower courts sided with states and environmental groups that challenged the transfer as a violation of the Constitution’s provision giving Congress the power to determine spending. A separate suit from members of Congress also is making its way to the court.The justices blocked the court rulings in both the asylum seekers and border wall cases, leaving the policies in effect. Arguments wouldn’t heard before next year and the issues would have much less significance if Joe Biden were to become president. He could rescind Trump’s policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico, for example.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justices-to-weigh-donald-trump-s-census-plan-to-exclude-non-citizens/story-I3mbr10luDvVum3eCoUWmN.html
17-10-2020||World||Sinovac vaccine for Covid offered by Chinese city for emergency use costs $60||A city in eastern China is offering an experimental coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine outside of clinical trials for around $60 to high-risk groups under an emergency inoculation programme, officials said, even as experts raised concerns over the mass rollout for an as-yet unproven vaccine.The Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech’s vaccine — called CoronaVac — is being offered in the city of Jiaxing to care givers, especially epidemic-prevention workers, public service personnel and port inspectors, and will eventually be offered to regular citizens, the state media reported on Friday, quoting officials. “The vaccine, developed by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech, will be provided to people aged between 18 and 59 at a price of 400 yuan ($59.5) for two shots,” the Jiaxing Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, adding that the vaccine hasn’t been “officially approved for marketing” and is only approved for “urgent needs”.However, the Jiaxing CDC did not specify what constituted as “urgent needs”.Authorities also did not say how many people in the city will be given the vaccine, which comes in two doses at an interval of 14-28 days.The Sinovac vaccine is in late stage trials in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey, and the company has said that an interim analysis of phase 3 trial data could come as early as November, news agency Reuters reported. In late June, China’s National Health Commission (NHC), under the Chinese vaccine management law, had allowed emergency vaccines to be used on people who are at a high risk of contracting the deadly virus, including medical workers, frontline pandemic control workers and customs workers – a move considered controversial by experts as the vaccines are still at a trail stage. Since July, China has administered such vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people under the programme.On September 25, a top Chinese health official said Beijing had gained the “understanding and support” from the World Health Organization (WHO) before starting the emergency use programme. In an emailed statement to HT the next day, the WHO said China’s decision to launch the programme was a domestic authorisation. “These are issued at the discretion of countries and not subject to WHO approval,” it said.Until late September, 11 Chinese Covid-19 vaccines had entered clinical trials, with four in phase 3 clinical trials.Last week, China announced it will join COVAX, an international initiative aimed at ensuring equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines, becoming the largest economy to support the initiative so far.The number of daily cases of Covid-19 in mainland China has fallen drastically from the peaks seen in February.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stands at over 85,500, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-vaccine-for-covid-offered-by-chinese-city-for-emergency-use-costs-60/story-u0FAbR5G4e91j4hBUgdyoO.html

The last round of talks was held in 2016.Turkey has also angered Cyprus with its decision to open the beachfront of the fenced-off suburb of Varosha in the divided island’s breakaway Turkish Cypriot north. At their summit in Brussels, leaders said the EU “underlines the importance of the status of Varosha and reiterates its full solidarity with Greece and Cyprus.”In the latest exchange of barbs, Turkey, which is a candidate for EU membership, and Greece this week traded accusations about “provocations,” including plans to hold military drills in the Aegean Sea later this month to coincide with each other’s national public holiday.“I think that is very regrettable but also unnecessary -- we should work on the positive aspects of our agenda instead. We have an interest in being able to go down the road we had intended to with Turkey, because developing EU-Turkey relations further is in the interest of both sides,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.Tensions between the two NATO allies, neighbors and historic rivals flared over the summer and raised fears that open conflict might break out.Cyprus in particular has been pushing hard for the EU to impose sanctions on Turkey. But on Friday, the leaders said only that they would “remain seized of the matter” and assess developments at their next meeting on Dec. 10-11.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis noted that “Europe does not take decisions from one moment to the next. It is like an ocean liner which takes a slow turn. When it turns, it takes a course which is very stable in the new direction in which it has chosen.”“Τhe point where we will have to make decisions will be December. I still hope that we will not have to do so. But no one should doubt that Europe has the determination to do so if Turkey continues these actions. And measures will be painful, not symbolic,” he said.Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hami Aksoy accused the EU of being insincere and unconstructive instead of “encouraging a dialogue, reconciliation and an unconditional positive agenda.”“It should be known that the language of threats will have no effect on Turkey,” Aksoy said. “Instead of threatening Turkey, we expect the EU to present concrete and unbiased proposals that serve our common interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-leaders-hit-out-at-turkey-s-provocations-in-the-mediterranean/story-aYqjJXg3ogNV5QPv83SY4L.html
