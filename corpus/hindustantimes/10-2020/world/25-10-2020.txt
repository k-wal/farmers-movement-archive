The document, after being revised based on opinions raised at Monday’s meeting, will be submitted for deliberation at the fifth plenary session, the channel said.A set of regulations on the work of the CPC Central Committee was also reviewed at the meeting, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, without giving details.The party’s closed-door plenum consisting of about 204 full central committee members and 172 alternate members is held annually to review the policies of the party and the government.Xi, 67, who has emerged as the most powerful leader of the party after its founder Mao Zedong holding the posts of party’s General Secretary, head of the country’s military besides the Presidency with prospects of life long tenure in power, will deliver a report on the party’s work since the previous meeting in October last year.Observers say the significance of the top decision making bodies of the CPC since the advent of Xi to power in 2012 and currently in his second five-year term has declined as he firmly established his stamp of authority doing away with the past system of collective leadership.All CPC meetings, including the plenum, are held in tight secrecy and the proceedings of such meetings other than the official handouts were rarely publicised.The plenum meeting was delayed in October last year due to agitation against the Chinese government’s interference in Hong Kong, posing a major challenge to Xi’s leadership and his handling of the crisis in the former British colony.However, the CPC and the Chinese government pressed ahead by passing hugely controversial National Security Law this year amid massive opposition from people of Hong Kong and the international community, virtually taking over the security of the Special Administration Region for the first time since it was transferred to China by Britain in 1997. The move had accentuated the international adversity faced by China following the outbreak of the Covid-19 which after emerging in Wuhan in December last year has become the worst pandemic the world has seen in recent years with death toll crossing over a million.While the new security law worsened China-US ties, with President Donald Trump declaring a whole range of new political and economic measures downgrading the ties between the top two economies, it evoked strong reactions also from the UK and European countries. This year’s plenum is being held in the backdrop of major trade and economic crisis gripping China and the world as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to create havoc around the world, while China has stabilised the virus situation at home.It is also being held days before the US Presidential polls scheduled to take place on November 3. While China’s ties with the US deteriorated to historically low, a return of Trump was widely expected to result in far more stringent anti-China policy compared to his rival Joe Biden.The plenum is also being held amid the India-China military standoff at the eastern Ladakh with two militaries massing large number of troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-communist-party-to-hold-key-conclave-of-its-top-leaders-ahead-of-us-polls/story-1yT1tWSvouf98U9GMb11oK.html

25-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Vaccine storage issues could leave 3 billion people without access||The chain breaks here, in a tiny medical clinic in Burkina Faso that went nearly a year without a working refrigerator.From factory to syringe, the world’s most promising coronavirus vaccine candidates need non-stop sterile refrigeration to stay potent and safe. But despite enormous strides in equipping developing countries to maintain the vaccine “cold chain,” nearly 3 billion of the world’s 7.8 billion people live where temperature-controlled storage is insufficient for an immunization campaign to bring Covid-19 under control.The result: Poor people around the world who were among the hardest hit by the virus pandemic are also likely to be the last to recover from it.The vaccine cold chain hurdle is just the latest disparity of the pandemic weighted against the poor, who more often live and work in crowded conditions that allow the virus to spread, have little access to medical oxygen that is vital to Covid-19 treatment, and whose health systems lack labs, supplies or technicians to carry out large-scale testing.Maintaining the cold chain for coronavirus vaccines won’t be easy even in the richest of countries, especially when it comes to those that require ultracold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F). Investment in infrastructure and cooling technology lags behind the high-speed leap that vaccine development has taken this year due to the virus.With the pandemic now in its eighth month, logistics experts warn that vast parts of the world lack the refrigeration to administer an effective vaccination program. This includes most of Central Asia, much of India and southeast Asia, Latin America except for the largest countries, and all but a tiny corner of Africa.The medical clinic outside Burkina Faso’s capital, a dirt-streaked building that serves a population of 11,000, is a microcosm of the obstacles.After its refrigerator broke last fall, the clinic could no longer keep vaccines against tetanus, yellow fever, tuberculosis and other common diseases on site, nurse Julienne Zoungrana said. Staff instead used motorbikes to fetch vials in insulated carriers from a hospital in Ouagadougou, making a 40-minute round-trip drive on a narrow road that varies between dirt, gravel and pavement.A mother of two who visits the Gampela clinic says she thinks a coronavirus inoculation program will be challenging in her part of the world. Adama Tapsoba, 24, walks four hours under scorching sun to get her baby his routine immunizations and often waits hours more to see a doctor. A week earlier, her 5-month-old son had missed a scheduled shot because Tapsoba’s daughter was sick and she could only bring one child on foot.“It will be hard to get a (Covid-19) vaccine,” Tapsoba said, bouncing her 5-month-old son on her lap outside the clinic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-storage-issues-could-leave-3-billion-people-without-access/story-vhGIqLPorDC8AI2Y3BRIjJ.html
25-10-2020||World||Top White House aide says United States not trying to control Covid-19 pandemic||A top aide of President Donald Trump on Sunday triggered a potentially devastating storm close to end of polling, saying the United States was not trying to control the Covid-19 pandemic.“We’re not going to control the pandemic,” Mark Meadows, chief of staff to the president, told CNN in an interview, adding, “because it is a contagious virus just like the flu.”Meadows said the administration’s strategy would be to “control the fact that we get vaccines therapeutics and other mitigation efforts.”With Covid-19 cases surging across the country in what is being called the third wave, Trump’s handling of the epidemic has cast doubt on his re-election chances. Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger, has made it his chief argument for electing him and denying the president a second term.More than 224,000 Americans had been killed and 8.5 million infected by the coronavirus till Sunday, according to the John Hopkins University tracker. And over 83,000 new infections were reported in the last 24 hours in a new surge that contradicts the president and his aides’ repeated claims that US was “rounding the corner”.Trump’s White House is facing fresh scrutiny of its own mitigation efforts that could not protect the president and has seen an increasing number of members of the staff contracting the virus — now members of Vice-President Mike Pence’s staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-white-house-aide-says-united-states-not-trying-to-control-covid-19-pandemic/story-ZHcqwxFgMqhs6uy0ZjjEfP.html

The Prime Minister also congratulated the people of Seychelles for the conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections. “Felicitations to H.E. @wavelramkalawan on his historic win in the Presidential and Assembly elections in Seychelles. We look forward to a strengthening of the close and traditional relationship between India and Seychelles under his leadership,” Modi tweeted. “This is a victory for democracy, a common value that binds India and Seychelles,” he wrote.Felicitations to H.E. @wavelramkalawan on his historic win in the Presidential and Assembly elections in Seychelles. We look forward to a strengthening of the close and traditional relationship between India and Seychelles under his leadershipThe opposition has taken power in Seychelles for the first time since 1977 with incumbent President Danny Faure getting 43 per cent votes to 54 per cent of Wavel Ramkalawn . The campaign for the elections took place mostly through social media as large rallies were banned due to Covid- 19. The pandemic was a major issue in the election as it has affected the tourism-based economy of the country. “In this election, there are no losers, there are no winners- our country was given the opportunity as the ultimate winner,” Ramkalawan said after winning the presidential elections in his seventh attempt. The archipelago became independent from the British rule in 1976 and in the following year Danny Faure’s United Party seized power in a coup. In 1993, multi-party democracy was restored but the United Party still remained in power. Faure became the president only four years ago in 2016.The voting turnout was roughly 75 per cent in the nation of just under 100,000 people. The new president is expected to be sworn in on October 26. In June 2018, PM Modi had announced that India was extending $100 million credit to Seychelles for the development of its defence capabilities. Seychelles and India have worked very closely on defence cooperation as the island nation is India’s ally in the Indian Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-greets-ramkalawan-on-his-historic-win-in-presidential-polls-in-seychelles/story-3E51Y3KPRkcA9dRhy2WIfN.html
25-10-2020||World||Seychelles opposition wins Presidency for first time in 43 years||The Seychelles elected an opposition candidate as president for the first time since 1977, authorities announced on Sunday, and winner Wavel Ramkalawan reaffirmed a pledge to hike the minimum wage after Covid-19 stifled the tourism dependent economy. Ramkalawan, a former Anglican priest, defeated President Danny Faure after three decades of unsuccessful runs for the presidency of the East African nation, an Indian Ocean archipelago famed for its natural beauty and rare wildlife. Ramkalawan captured 54.9 per cent of the vote while Faure got 43.5 per cent in the vote held from Thursday through Saturday, the electoral commission announced.Ramkalawan promised to continue working with Faure, an unusually good-natured transfer of power for the nearby African continent where many rulers are eliminating term limits and cracking down on political opposition. “Mr Faure and I are good friends. And an election does not mean the end of one’s contribution to one’s motherland,” Ramkalawan said in his victory speech. “In this election, there were no losers, there were no winners. Our country was given the opportunity as the ultimate winner.”As he spoke, Faure sat close by, nodding his head. Back in 1977, power changed hands via a coup that led to 27 years of rule by Albert Rene, punctuated by several coup attempts including one in 1981 by South African backed mercenaries masquerading as vacationing rugby players. Faure’s United Seychelles party had been in power over the past 43 years but this was the first time he had faced voters himself. He was vice president when his predecessor resigned in 2016 after a constitutional amendment was passed limiting presidents to two terms.Faure’s chances may have been damaged by a severe economic downturn. Travel restrictions imposed due to the global Covid-19 pandemic mean the Seychelles economy is expected contract by 13.8 per cent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund(IMF).It is a stunning reversal of fragile progress since the government defaulted on its debt in 2008 and sought an IMF bailout.Both Ramkalawan, of the Linyon Demokratik Seselwa party, and another opposition candidate, Alain St Ange of the One Seychelles party, had promised voters they would raise the minimum wage.This week’s election was for both the presidency and parliament. Ramakalawan’s party will have 20 directly elected parliament seats and five nominated ones, while Faure’s party will have six directly elected members and four nominated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seychelles-opposition-wins-presidency-for-first-time-in-43-years/story-zX8NP82jU42pVXN77LRPVP.html

25-10-2020||World||Singapore to trial antigen rapid tests for migrant workers||Singapore is seeking to reduce the amount of time it takes to regularly check migrant workers for coronavirus infection by piloting the use of antigen rapid tests.For a period of four weeks, a group of 1,000 migrant workers will undergo antigen rapid testing every seven days, the Ministry of Manpower said in a statement Sunday. That’s in addition to the polymerase chain reaction test that they receive every 2 weeks. The new method potentially allows infected workers to be isolated more quickly, reducing the risk of the virus spreading to other residents in dormitories.Singapore is distributing contact trace tokens and bolstering the testing of workers after infections in dormitories exacerbated the outbreak earlier this year. Airports are also studying rapid antigen checks, which look for the presence of the virus’s proteins, making them quicker and cheaper but less accurate than established methods that detect its nucleic acids. The better known polymerase chain reaction tests have been regarded as the gold standard for Covid testing.Polymerase chain reaction tests, however, take a day to confirm results, while antigen rapid tests indicate if a person is positive within half an hour, the ministry said. It will evaluate the effectiveness of the trial and assess the suitability of including it into regular routine testing for workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-trial-antigen-rapid-tests-for-migrant-workers/story-FaDouKa7gJchu7kcufZSIP.html
25-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: What is fracking and why is it being discussed so much||In the third presidential debate that took place on Thursday, US President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden were at loggerheads once again on the issue of fracking. This is not the first time that fracking has been discussed in this election cycle.Here’s everything you need to know about the issue:What is fracking?Fracking is the technology that allows oil and gas to be extracted from shale rock using a specific technique called horizontal hydraulic fracturing in which drillers bore through thousands of feet of earth to reach the shale. Then the drill bits are turned horizontally deeper into the ground in search of oil and gas. After this, water is shot at the rock at a high speed and oil and gas molecules flow out of the cracks.How is fracking pertinent to US economy?Fracking has helped in the massive expansion of drilling and thereby in creating new jobs in the US economy. It has also helped the United States become the world’s largest oil and gas producer as well as an exporter.What is Biden’s and Trump’s stand on fracking?The debate on fracking is a decade long one as it is the central conversation point in the larger discourse around climate change. It is being discussed so much as it marks a policy difference between Biden and Trump. Biden has promised his ‘Build Back Better’ plan that focuses on renewable forms of energy and creating jobs through them and has called for a limited ban on fracking which means ending the use of federally controlled lands for fracking. On the other hand, President Trump rejects the concept of any ban and has held the idea that he is protecting the oil and coal jobs through his stand.Also Read: Trump deploys 2016 playbook, Biden expands 2020 battle groundWhy is fracking a voting issue in these elections? The issue is a way for Trump to capture working-class voters, who tend to vote for the Democratic Party. Through this, Trump is also aiming to show voters that his focus is entirely on the economy and jobs. Moreover, four swing states—Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado and New Mexico—are largely affected by the issue of fracking and Trump is trying to capture the votes here. Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes; Ohio has 18; Colorado has nine and New Mexico has five electoral votes.Trump is also able to project Biden as bowing to the left extreme of the Democrats as the Green New Deal (‘Build Back Better’ plan is a reformed version of the deal) was initially proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders and supported by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-what-is-fracking-and-why-is-it-being-discussed-so-much/story-zCdLQui1J3eVe1QLZtbj7M.html
25-10-2020||World||Brexit, Covid-19 and climate colluding to raise UK food prices||Supermarket prices in Britain could start increasing in coming months as food supplies get pummeled by a triple whammy of Brexit, Covid-19 and weather-struck harvests.The UK is just 10 weeks from leaving the European Union, yet there’s still no trade deal between the two sides. If the status quo persists, import taxes averaging 18% will be slapped on meat, produce and beverages coming from the bloc starting January 1. Both sides are aiming for zero tariffs, but there’s a chance they won’t succeed. Either way, logistical burdens will stack up as new checkpoint bureaucracies are created.Portions of those extra costs likely will make their way to consumers, putting some foods out of reach and exacerbating existing inequalities. The looming sticker shock dovetails with grocers trying to ward off stockpiling in the face of more Covid-19 lockdowns and domestic wheat output dropping near a four-decade low after a year of weather extremes.“We’re all very nervous,” said Simon Lane, owner of Fruco Plc, which imports about 100 truckloads of fruit and vegetables from the EU every month. “It’s a watch-this-space situation. One thing is for sure: no-deal will equal a bad deal for consumers.”The UK relies on foreign fare for about half the meals consumed domestically, and the deadline for a Brexit trade deal approaches during winter, when little is harvested from local fields. Talks between the two sides resumed Thursday, and Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said “momentum” is building toward a deal.The uncertainty leaves importers scouring tariff codes to calculate the potential hits to their business. Spanish-foods retailer Brindisa needs to decide whether to stockpile as much as 500,000 pounds ($645,000) of shelf-stable items, such as olives and tinned fish, to avoid disruptions for its customers. It also may start transporting goods by sea for the first time.“The UK can’t feed itself,” said Heath Blackford, managing director for Brindisa’s wholesale division. “If we don’t get a deal, we should all be expecting to pay more for our food.”Supply chains snarled by the down-to-the wire negotiations risk sparking food inflation at a time when job cuts are climbing by a record amount. With shops already operating on low margins, higher tariffs likely would ripple into higher consumer prices, said the Food and Drink Federation, with members ranging from cereal makers to soft-drink companies.A season of floods and drought also hurt growers. The paltry wheat crop means imports may double from the prior season as domestic values climb. Porridge maker Pimhill Farm raised prices about 6%, the first increase in seven years, after a May dry spell hampered oats output, and the Shropshire-based company is unsure how Brexit will affect costs for the imported nuts and raisins used in its longstanding muesli recipe, manager Ian Anderson said.“It’s the unknown that’s the worry,” he said.Shoppers in Britain spend a relatively low proportion of their income on food, and prices have been subdued in recent months. Still, the number of people in need has climbed as the coronavirus upends the economy. The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks nationally, expects food-parcel demand to increase 61% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.Nearly a third of children –- about 2.2 million – between the ages of 8 and 17 are enrolled in free school-meal programs this autumn, with 42% of them newly registered, as household income wanes, according to data from The Food Foundation charity.“We are terrified about the predictions there are around the number of people who are going to be struggling,” said Lindsay Boswell, chief executive officer of FareShare, a charity that reroutes surpluses from restaurants and retailers to UK charities and community groups. “Demand for food is going to soar at a time when the supply chain is going to be massively disrupted because of Brexit.”Even with a trade agreement, knock-on effects from logistical hangups or a declining currency could make it pricier to stock pantries. Extra paperwork, and animal and plant health certificates, required at the borders could lengthen transport times, and the chairman of Tesco Plc, Britain’s top supermarket chain, warned of fresh-food shortages if no deal is reached.Lane, owner of Crowborough-based Fruco, said trucks of nectarines and peaches can’t afford to get held up at the border because their shelf life fades quickly. The UK previously said it would grant a six-month grace period for customs checks, but since the EU hasn’t agreed to the same, trucks still could get snarled on that side of the border. Leaving the single market means food-price inflation “under any eventuality,” said Dylan Bradley, an agribusiness director for London-based IHS Markit.The uncertainty arrives at the same time Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government struggles to curb the escalating number of coronavirus infections. Wales is in a two-week lockdown, and the Greater Manchester area is under strict restrictions. Quarantine rules also limited the number of foreign workers that often staff meat plants, risking Christmas turkey supplies.While some have praised the food system’s resilience during the pandemic -- with stores quickly restocking after shortages when lockdowns began -- that was all during the UK’s time in the one market, said Tony Heron, professor of international political economy at the University of York. Removing that buffer just as Europe goes through another surge of infections will prove a tougher test.“It’s a very visible, tangible effect if prices start to shift or if certain produce becomes unavailable,” he said.Yet Harry Smit, a senior analyst at Rabobank in the Netherlands, said it’s unlikely the UK will levy tariffs on food imports because it’s so reliant on foreign fare, and tandem taxes imposed by the EU –- making British exports uncompetitive there – would create domestic surpluses of lamb, barley and other farm products.Plus, increasing commodity prices for food manufacturers don’t always lead to higher costs for consumers, said Sarah Baker, senior strategic insight manager at the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board. For example, wheat only accounts for about a 10th of the cost of a loaf of bread.“If consumers are increasingly price conscious, you can see that everyone in the supply chain needs to take a bit of a knock,” she said.The current upheaval from politics, coronavirus and the climate is prompting some growers to make long-term preparations. Julian Gold invested in new grains storage at the farm he manages in South Oxfordshire so he could diversify his plantings and keep them ready for market over longer periods.The 750-hectare (1,853-acre) estate stopped raising sheep for the first time in his 28-year tenure in case a no-deal cuts off vital sales to the EU, and he plans to rent a small field to a fruit or vegetable grower as the pandemic fuels a buy-local boom.“We’re in a more volatile world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-covid-19-and-climate-colluding-to-raise-uk-food-prices/story-xKCwaiyuaE85salijqDF5I.html

25-10-2020||World||Coronavirus is pummeling Europe’s eateries — and winter is coming||As the Friday night dinner service began earlier this month at the De Viering restaurant outside Brussels, it seemed the owners’ decision to move the operation into the spacious village church to comply with coronavirus rules was paying off. The reservation book was full and the kitchen was bustling.And then Belgium’s prime minister ordered cafes, bars and restaurants to close for at least a month in the face of surging infections.“It’s another shock, of course, because — yes, all the investments are made,” said chef Heidi Vanhasselt. She and her sommelier husband Christophe Claes had installed a kitchen and new toilets in the Saint Bernardus church in Heikruis, as well as committing to 10 months’ rent and pouring energy into creative solutions.Vanhasselt’s frustration is Europe’s as a resurgence of the virus is dealing a second blow to the continent’s restaurants, which already suffered under lockdowns in the spring. From Northern Ireland to the Netherlands, governments have shuttered eateries or severely curtailed how they operate.More than just jobs and revenue are at stake — restaurants lie at the heart of European life. Their closures are threatening the social fabric by shutting the places where neighbors mix, extended families gather and the seeds of new families are sown.A restaurant remains “a place where very special moments are celebrated,” said Griet Grassin of the Italian restaurant Tartufo on the outskirts of Brussels. “It’s not just the food, but it’s the well-being.”This time, the closures are particularly painful because they might stretch into the Christmas season, nixing everything from pre-holiday office drinks to a special meal on the day.When it comes to purely calories and vitamins, “of course we can live without restaurants,” said food historian professor Peter Scholliers.But, he asked: “We can live without being social? No, we can’t.”Successful restaurants have always had to adapt quickly — but never has there been a challenge like this.The European Union said the hotel and restaurant industry suffered a jaw-dropping 79.3% decline in production between February and April. Try bouncing back from that.Summer, with its drop in Covid-19 cases and a hesitant return to travel, brought some respite, especially in coastal resorts.But then came fall. Any giddiness that the fallout from the pandemic could somehow be contained faced the sobering reality of relentlessly rising coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Overall, Covid-19 has killed over 250,000 people across Europe, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Leaders are now warning that things will get worse before they get better.But many restaurant owners have bristled at the new restrictions and some are openly challenging them.In London last week, the preeminent chef Yotam Ottolenghi banged pots on the street to protest restrictions that include earlier closing times.“It’s really hard, we’ve got a great industry with lots of heart,” Ottolenghi said. “And there’s so many people who depend on it.”If the mood of any nation is set by its stomach, surely France’s is. And it is turning as sour as a rhubarb tartlet. The streets of Paris, the culinary capital of Lyon and several other French cities were eerily empty at night during the first week of a 9 p.m. curfew scheduled to last for at least a month.Xavier Denamur, who owns five Parisian cafes and bistros that employ around 70 workers, said the French government is unfairly punishing the industry.“It’s a catastrophic measure,” he said, arguing any curfew should be pushed to at least 11 pm to allow for a proper dinner service.In Italy, just such a late-night curfew went into effect in Milan — and even that triggered protests.Still, highlighting how the world is feeling its way in the near darkness, restaurant and food delivery business owner Matteo Lorenzon argued the opposite. “Having a curfew starting at 11 pm, it’s too late.”Already in September, more than 400,000 employees of restaurants and cafes in Italy, a nation of 60 million, were unemployed, according to an estimate by Fipe, the restaurant lobby group. Its prediction for the coming months was even more dire: “Hundreds of thousands of jobs risk being erased definitively.”In the Netherlands, which has one of the highest virus infection rates in Europe, more than 60 Dutch bars and restaurants sought to overturn a monthlong closure order but failed. Lawyer Simon van Zijll, representing the bars and restaurants, warned that the Dutch hospitality industry faces “a tidal wave of bankruptcies.”The first lockdown in the spring caught the owners of Tartufo, the restaurant on the outskirts of Brussels, off guard.This time, Grassin and her husband chef Kayes Ghourabi, were ready: They will ramp up their takeaway service and even offer their own gin with Mediterranean spices. Still, income will drop by about 70% to 80%.“We lose, but it helps the costs. The electricity, the insurance that keep on going, even in a lockdown,” she said.Across Europe, the stories are the same — of chefs thinking creatively, making something of a bad situation, showing resilience to save something they often built from scratch.“I have a son, and I always say to my husband, ‘the restaurant was our first child.’ And you want to fight for it,” Grassin said.Takeout is also a lifeline for Paolo Polli, who owned five bars and restaurants in Milan before closing four recently. His staff was cut from 60 to six. He said he made more money during the lockdown with his pizza-delivery service than when he reopened for regular service.Down south, a balmy fall offered some reprieve, allowing restaurants to serve on outside terraces.Despite this, in Portugal, the AHRESP restaurant association said restaurants lost more than half of their revenue. Now the chilly weather, stronger winds and rain are forcing everyone back indoors, where the virus spreads most easily.“It will be impossible,’‘ said Artur Veloso, who manages the Risca restaurant in Carcavelos. “Winter will bring more ruin.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-pummeling-europe-s-eateries-and-winter-is-coming/story-JSSIvVsgn9n7h6WZUXdYAL.html
25-10-2020||World||Pak opposition slams Imran Khan-led govt for failing to exit from FATF grey list||The opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) slammed the Imran Khan-led government for its failure to remove Pakistan from the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) alleged that the FATF decision was the result of the “slipshod and obviously done in” law drafting and lack of homework, reported Dawn.Slamming the government over its failure, PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman said, “Why did they (the government functionaries) not get their homework done on time? The news from FATF insiders is that the law drafting is slipshod and obviously done in. Why did they not look at everything in a good time? They were too busy managing a constant anti-opposition narrative which seems to be their only task.”The FATF announced on Friday that Pakistan would continue to remain on its grey list for another four months till February 2021 for six out of 27 unmet action plan targets on AML/CFT, Dawn reported.Taking a jibe at the misgovernance and inefficiency of the present government, Rehman reminded them of the fact that the Paris-led organisation had removed Pakistan from the grey list earlier when terrorism was a bigger threat in the region.“It really is not rocket science. It’s been done before quite smoothly and could have been done again if only the government (functionaries) did not look and behave like the governance amateurs they are,” added Rehman.The FATF had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 due to ‘strategic deficiencies’ in its Anti Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime after a push from India supported by the US, the UK, and some other European countries. Pakistan then committed to a 27-point action plan but failed to meet deadlines. The global watchdog had asked the government to implement a plan of action by the end of 2019, which was later extended due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-slams-imran-khan-led-government-for-failing-to-exit-pakistan-from-fatf-grey-list/story-DVnOEeh8nJ8zW2KwHnmEXO.html

25-10-2020||World||US elections 2020:Coronavirus poses a challenge to exit polls by media‘decision desks’||It has been a long tradition for US television networks to call projected winners on election night as results trickle in, but the unique circumstances of 2020 are likely to create numerous challenges to that practice.“Decision desks” set up by media outlets to project winners of each state, which will determine the presidential race, are gearing up for a complicated election night amid uncertain timing for counting of mail-in and absentee ballots and fears about premature claims of victory.In a campaign marked by the Covid-19 pandemic, the old methods of exit polls are less useful than in the past, says Costas Panagopoulos, chair of Political Science at Northeastern University and a member of the NBC News decision desk team.“With the rise in early voting, absentee and mail-in voting, it’s no longer the case that we can survey voters at the polling places and make accurate predictions,”Panagopoulos said.Some fear an early tally based on votes cast in person on election day may distort the outcome and prompt President Donald Trump to claim victory before absentee and mailed ballots are counted, opening up the potential for chaos.“It’s entirely possible there will be discrepancies across networks because each network has its own standards for how they reach projection decisions even though they are all using virtually the same data,” Panagopoulos said.CBS News said its decision desk will combine exit poll data and vote tallies with the network’s proprietary polling and surveys of some 100,000 people around the United States.Some analysts have warned of a “red mirage” which would show Trump ahead based on early vote counts, even if the absentee ballots counted later reverse the trend, a result which could prompt an outcry.“The contest will be won not only at the ballot box and in the courts but in the court of public opinion,”said a Guardian essay by more than 20 members of the American Political Scientists Association.“All media should adopt the strict standard that no state winner should be declared until the number of votes remaining to be counted has been certified to be less than the margin between the two major party candidates.”A newly formed National Task Force on Election Crises has called on media organizations and the National Election Pool which gathers data for the outlets to use extra caution for projections on November 3.“This presidential election will be like no other in our history,” said a letter from the task force which includes academics, former elected officials, and activists to media organizations.The coalition said that as many as 70 percent of all ballots cast may be by mail or other absentee methods, and that the tallying will depend on different rules for each of the 50 states.“It could take days or weeks to complete an accurate count of all votes,” the letter said.“This period of uncertainty will add further pressure to an already strained system and allow bad actors to attempt to undermine our democratic process.”The different processing times in various states could lead to uncertainty, according to Joe Lenski, Chief Executive of Edison Research, which provides exit polls and vote count data to the National Election Pool.“Some states don’t even allow the by mail ballots to be opened until election day, Lenski said. “So we’re expecting those states based upon what we saw on the primaries to take a lot longer processing and report their by mail ballots. In some cases it could be days or weeks.”While a handful of media outlets will be making calls, one being closely watched is Fox News, a favorite of Trump and Republicans.Fox said in a statement that it will be collecting data and making projections without bias.“The integrity of our decision desk is rock solid,” a Fox statement said.“We will call this presidential election carefully and accurately, relying on data and numbers.”Fox decision desk chief Arnon Mishkin told a recent podcast on the network that making calls will be complicated by the new voting patterns but touted a new tool “that is actually optimal for measuring how people are voting in an election where over 60 percent of the people are not going to be exiting poll on election day.”Despite the fears, a Pew Research Centre survey found 82 percent of US adults have confidence their main news sources will make the right call, with slightly more confidence among Democrat Joe Biden’s supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-coronavirus-poses-a-challenge-to-exit-polls-by-media-decision-desks/story-RAlpI3f0YXY2LtM3HXkQNO.html

25-10-2020||World||Aman Singh becomes first turbaned Sikh to be elected to British Columbia assembly||Despite having elected Harjit Sajjan to the House of Commons leading to him becoming Canada’s defence minister, the province of British Columbia had never elected a turbaned Sikh to its own legislative assembly. That changed on Saturday night, with human rights lawyer Aman Singh making history as he was projected to win the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Richmond-Queensborough.Singh, who was born in Hong Kong, came close to attaining the feat of being elected an MLA in 2017, but lost by just 134 votes to Jas Johal of the Liberal Party. The latter is also Sikh but does not wear a turban. In fact, the province has even had a Sikh premier (equivalent of chief minister in India) in Ujjal Dosanjh, but he also did not sport a turban.Singh was projected to win with about 47% of the vote and with a margin of less than 600 ballots. The snap elections were called by BC Premier John Horgan, the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) provincial government, as he sought to turn a minority into a majority. He succeeded in that objective as the NDP captured 55 seats, a gain of 14, while the Liberals lost 12 to total 29 seats. The legislature has a strength of 87 members.The outgoing government had two ministers of Sikh heritage in Jinny Sims and Harry Bains, both of whom were also re-elected. Overall, eight MLAs of Indian-origin were elected to the assembly this time, as against seven previously. Among other prominent winners was Nikki Sharma, a Hindu with roots in Punjab, who emerged victorious from the riding of Vancouver-Hastings and Ravi Kahlon from Delta North, who was a Parliamentary Secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aman-singh-becomes-first-turbaned-sikh-to-be-elected-to-british-columbia-assembly/story-nPdVVFjEVVEE3dZZgxuQyN.html
25-10-2020||World||Sri Lanka imposes new curfew zones to check Covid-19 spread||Authorities in Sri Lanka increased the coronavirus-related curfew zones to 56 police divisions on Sunday, to check the virus spread through community-level transmission.So far, the island nation has reported 7,521 Covid-19 cases. The virus death toll rose to 15 on Saturday after a 56-year-old heart patient died in the North Western Province due to coronavirus complication.“There are 56 police divisions which have been placed under police curfew and violators would be strictly dealt with,” Police Spokesman Ajith Rohana said on Sunday.Rohana added that people’s movement in these areas will be monitored.The new curfew zones are mostly from capital district Colombo and eastern district Batticaloa.The Colombo municipality area has seen sharp rise in infections, Chief City Medical Officer Dr Ruwan Wijemuni said. Colombo city has reported 548 cases in the last four days.Sri Lanka reported 743 cases on Saturday, along with its 15th Covid-19 death.The country has reported 4,050 cases since October 4 from just two clusters -- a garment export factory in Minuwangoda, Western Province and a wholesale fish market in Peliyagoda, a suburban area of Colombo.Dr Wijemuni said the fish market cluster was more dangerous with too many secondary and tertiary contacts.Of the total 7,521 Covid-19 cases reported till now, 3,714 have been discharged from hospitals after complete recovery. Health authorities said investigation is currently underway to establish whether the export factory or the fish market is the originating point of the second wave since October 4.Authorities have ruled out a blanket lockdown due to the strain on the economy.Meanwhile, Health minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi has said that the World Health Organisation has asked the government to be prepared for the distribution of vaccine depending on successful clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-imposes-new-curfew-zones-to-check-covid-19-spread/story-HSeyWJCwvbyHwSzjqzUpfK.html
25-10-2020||World||Nigerian police mobilise to quell worst unrest in two decades||Nigeria’s police chief ordered the immediate mobilisation of all force resources on Saturday to try to control the worst street violence in Africa’s most populous country in two decades, stemming from protests against police brutality.The unrest, unprecedented since the 1999 return to civilian rule, is the most serious political crisis confronting President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler elected in 2015. Curfews have been imposed on millions of people in recent days in response to violence and looting in parts of the country.Violence, particularly in the commercial capital Lagos, escalated after demonstrators were shot on Tuesday night in the city’s Lekki district during a round-the-clock curfew. Witnesses blamed soldiers. Rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police had killed at least 12 protesters in two districts, though the army and police denied any involvement.Several states, mostly in southern Nigeria, have imposed curfews after two weeks of confrontations between protesters and members of the security services. As pockets of unrest flared again on Saturday in parts of the country, a spokesman for southern Cross River state said several buildings had been vandalised over the last two days including a shopping mall, a bank and electoral offices. A round-the-clock curfew was reimposed on parts of the central city of Jos, just a day after it was relaxed on Friday, following the looting of emergency food supplies stored there by the disasters ministry, authorities said.“This looting has spread to other facilities and is gradually degenerating thereby threatening the peace and security of the state,” the governor of Plateau state, Simon Lalong, said in a statement. And a round-the-clock curfew was imposed in the northern state of Kaduna on Saturday. The move was to “protect lives and property and contain criminal elements”, state security commissioner Samuel Aruwan said in a statement. The Nigeria Police Force said its inspector general Mohammed Adamu had ordered the immediate deployment of all assets and resources to end violence, looting and destruction of property by criminals masquerading as protesters.“The IGP enjoins law-abiding citizens not to panic but rather join forces with the police and other members of the law enforcement community to protect their communities from the criminal elements,” the force said in a statement.During a call on Friday between Buhari and former Nigerian presidents, the head of state said 51 civilian fatalities and 37 injuries had been recorded as a result of “hooliganism” in recent weeks, according to a statement released on Saturday. Unrest escalated in parts of Nigeria after the shooting of the protesters who gathered in Lagos on Tuesday night in defiance of a curfew to demonstrate against police brutality. Olusegun Samuel, the guardian of one protester who was shot at that demonstration, said on Saturday that the 24-year-old may have his right leg amputated due to a severe wound.“It is a very painful issue; very, very painful issue. A young boy of his age,” said Samuel, speaking at a Lagos hospital.David Ivwrogbo was working as a truck driver at a railway construction site when the curfew was announced on Tuesday. He said he was not part of the protest, and was trying to reach home when he was also shot in the leg. He said he was dragged to safety by demonstrators.“The youths are awake and they don’t want to go back to sleep,” he said, referring to frustrated young people who have taken to Nigeria’s streets in the wake of the campaign against police brutality. Lagos state eased curfew restrictions on Saturday to 6 p.m.-8 a.m. Workers took to streets to sweep away broken glass while cars again filled the roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigerian-police-mobilise-to-quell-worst-unrest-in-two-decades/story-TfEpUDGkvRppOoUAompnaN.html
25-10-2020||World||Joe Biden, Donald Trump rallies show sharp contrast as coronavirus surges again||President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden gave starkly contrasting messages on Saturday about the coronavirus pandemic, taking their campaigns for the White House on the road as Covid-19 cases surged again.Trump addressed a few thousand supporters at a tightly packed, in-person, outdoor rally in North Carolina, one of the battleground states in the Nov. 3 election. He again said America was turning the corner in the fight against Covid-19 and mocked Biden’s more cautious campaigning style. Biden, a former vice president, addressed supporters in about 130 vehicles at a drive-in rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania and warned of a grim winter ahead unless the Trump administration did a better job of halting the disease, which has killed 224,000 Americans. Opinion polls show Biden leading Trump nationally, but the race is much closer in the battleground states that will decide the election. Trump was headed to large rallies in two more of those states, Ohio and Wisconsin, later on Saturday. In Lumberton, North Carolina, he told supporters he was offering a fast recovery from the economic damage wrought by virus lockdowns, which have devastated small businesses and put millions out of work.“It’s a choice between a Trump super boom and a Biden lockdown,” the Republican president said. “We are rounding the turn,” he said, repeating a claim he has been making for months that America is close to getting the better of the virus.By contrast, Biden warned that the cold months ahead could be even harsher due to a resurgence of the virus, which has killed more people in the United States than anywhere else and is on the rise in several battleground states. “It’s going to be a dark winter ahead unless we change our ways,” he said of Trump’s attempts to contain the coronavirus.Biden was addressing supporters in the town of Bristol who had gathered in pickup trucks or cars, many with their windows or sunroofs down, to avoid possible coronavirus infection. Biden’s campaign limited each vehicle to a maximum of four passengers.At one point, Biden called out a group of Trump supporters who were shouting into microphones nearby. “We don’t do things like those chumps out there with the microphone are doing. The Trump guys. It’s about decency.”At his event in Lumberton, Trump made fun of the Biden rally, which he said he had seen on television.“There were so few cars. I’ve never seen an audience like that,” he said. “It was a tiny, tiny little crowd. You could hear the cars: honk honk.”The United States set a single-day record of more than 84,000 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, with the spike in infections hitting election swing states Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. North Carolina reported 2,584 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, down from a record high of 2,716 the day before. Many states have expanded in-person early voting and mail-in ballots as a safer way to vote during the pandemic. Trump voted in his adopted home of Florida on Saturday, joining more than 56 million Americans who have cast early ballots at a record-setting pace.Trump cast his ballot at a library in West Palm Beach, near his Mar-a-Lago resort, after switching his permanent residence and voter registration last year from New York to Florida, a must-win battleground for his re-election bid.“I voted for a guy named Trump,” he told reporters after voting.With 10 days to go in the campaign, the pace of early voting could lead to the highest voter turnout rate in more than a century, according to data from the US Elections Project.Trump has regularly condemned mail-in voting without evidence as prone to fraud, even though experts say it is as safe as any other method. The large number of early voters is a sign of the intense interest in this year’s election, as well as concerns about avoiding crowded polling places on Election Day and reducing the risk of exposure to the coronavirus.In New York state, voters jammed polling places and stood in line for hours to cast ballots on the state’s first day of early voting on Saturday. Long lines formed before polls opened across New York City and Long Island, videos on social media showed.In Pennsylvania, polls show Biden narrowly leading. A Reuters/Ipsos survey released earlier this week showed Biden with a four per cent point advantage over Trump in the state, down from seven points the week before.Biden got some help again on Saturday from former President Barack Obama, who held a drive-in rally in Miami. Obama, still popular in the party nearly four years after leaving office, delivered a blistering attack on Trump’s leadership “He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody except himself and his friends or treating the Presidency like a reality show to give himself more attention,” Obama said. “The rest of us have to live with the consequences of what he’s done. At least 220,000 Americans are dead.” About 200 cars, many decorated with American flags and Biden signs, crept past temperature checks and bomb sniffing dogs on the way to the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-donald-trump-rallies-show-sharp-contrast-as-coronavirus-surges-again/story-fTn53s5WSY0WDN38yWhArJ.html
25-10-2020||World||Donald Trump had offered me post of Secretary of State: Nikki Haley||Popular Indian-American Republican politician Nikki Haley on Saturday revealed that Donald Trump, soon after winning the November 2016 US presidential election, had offered her the position of Secretary of State which she politely refused.However, 48-year-old Haley, who at that time was the South Carolina Governor, said she could not refuse the second offer of the post of US Ambassador to the United Nations as Trump had met all the conditions she had set for accepting the position.Haley is now campaigning in support of Trump’s re-election bid.“There is a stark contrast” between President Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, she said at a fireside chat event organised by the Indian Voices for Trump in the battleground state of Philadelphia.“There is a lot at stake with this election,” she said.Responding to a question from Dr Merlynn Carson, co-chair of Indian Voices for Trump, Haley, for the first time, revealed that Trump, soon after winning the November 2016 presidential elections, offered her the position of Secretary of State,and sent a plane to fly her to New York.However, Haley said, she politely refused the offer, noting that she was not the right fit for the post as she had no experience in that. Days later, after she returned from New York, Trump through his Chief of Staff offered her the position of US Ambassador to the United Nations.Responding to the offer, she set three conditions -- the position should be of Cabinet rank, the envoy should be a member of the national security council and that she will not be a ‘yes woman’. To all the conditions, Trump’s response was “Done. What next?”, leaving her with no option but to accept the position, she recalled.Responding to a question, Haley said Trump has stopped giving aids to countries like Pakistan, which harbour terrorists.“The relationship (of US) with India (under Trump administration) has never been stronger,” she said, adding that President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi get along very well.  Under Trump administration, the US is partnering with India on various issues, including defence, Haley said. In the aftermath of the coronavirus, there is a far greater need to collaborate between India and the US, she added, referring to the increased co-operation between India and US along with Japan and Australia. China, she said, is the number one national security threat to the US President Trump has “put China on notice,” Haley told the audience.Trump is “not very much a politician”, “what you see, what he is”, she said when asked about the president. She referred to a conversation that she had with Trump, before he was scheduled a deliver an address at the United Nations and asked her opinion on calling the North Korean leader as the “Rocket Man”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-had-offered-me-post-of-secretary-of-state-nikki-haley/story-ZAHnSTQCoIq1pbt5tO1SYN.html
25-10-2020||World||Mike Pence adviser Marty Obst caught Covid-19, adding to White House outbreak||One of Vice President Mike Pence’s closest political advisers, Marty Obst, tested positive for coronavirus infection this week, according to three people familiar with the matter, adding to the number of cases in and around the White House.It wasn’t immediately clear if Obst developed symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.Obst tested positive on Wednesday, two of the people said. He was quiet on Twitter that day, with just one retweet, but has since been active on the social media platform, posting criticism of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.While he’s not a government employee, Obst is frequently in contact with Pence and his staff and visits the White House grounds.Obst and spokespeople for Pence didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The coronavirus has swept the White House since September, infecting President Donald Trump, his wife and youngest son, and a number of top aides, including his campaign manager, his press secretary, and the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.The outbreak has served as a punctuation mark on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which polls show has been widely panned by voters.Pence’s press secretary Katie Miller contracted Covid-19 in May. Pence himself has so far escaped infection.The virus has infected about 8.6 million Americans so far and more than 225,000 have died. The US is in the midst of yet another surge of infections, with new cases exceeding 83,000 on Friday, a record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-adviser-marty-obst-caught-covid-19-adding-to-white-house-outbreak/story-rZV4H02PrWpq54IqWG6DrK.html
25-10-2020||World||Indus valley had dairy production way back in 3rd millennium BCE||Dairy production in India began as far back as in the 3rd millennium BCE and may have been a factor behind sustaining the Indus Valley Civilisation, according to findings from a team of Canadian and Indian researchers.The study, published in the journal Nature, was led by Kalyan Sekhar Chakraborty, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto Mississauga, and dates dairy production to 2500 BCE. “This is the first time it’s been proved scientifically that dairy production was in place in the Indus Valley civilization in 2500 BCE, and the earliest known evidence of dairy production,” Chakraborty said in an interview.The results were based on molecular chemical analysis of residue in shards of pottery found at the archaeological site of Kotada Bhadli, a rural settlement located in Gujarat. Of the 59 samples studied, 22 showed the presence of dairy lipids. Through a process called stable isotope analysis, the researchers were also able to identify the type of ruminant used for dairy, and concluded that these were cattle, like cows and buffalo, rather than goats and sheep.The availability of dairy production may have helped sustain such ancient societies, as Chakraborty explained, “This would have allowed the accumulation of a surplus of animal protein, without affecting the number of animals in your herd.” He said the level of production meant that this was “definitely beyond household consumption.”Chakraborty is with the Department of Anthropology at the university, and the study also involved Prof Heather Miller of the same department and Prof Greg Slater of the School of Geography and Earth Sciences at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. The Indian participants in the research were Prof Prabodh Shirvalkar of the Department of Ancient Indian History and Culture and Archeology at Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute in Pune, who excavated the archaeological settlement, provided the samples, site photographs, and background information of the region, and Yadubirsingh Rawat of the State Department of Archeology and Museum in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.Chakraborty pointed out such research was complex because it was simpler to identify animals used for meat from cut marks on their bones, but “uses like dairy are generally invisible.” This was the first time such scientific analysis was used in India for this purpose. The type of vessels used pointed to the milk being processed rather than being used raw.Chakraborty’s interest in this project started in 2010 as he started excavating this rural site and became interested in applying chemistry to archaeology, especially since food habits were “embedded” in such material.He now intends to take the research forward, in this case further back into time to analyse even older remnants from Indus Valley settlements, potentially as far back as when animals were first domesticated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indus-valley-had-dairy-production-way-back-in-3rd-millennium-bce/story-5UZmi5tbyAyukYUsnn25mL.html
25-10-2020||World||Trump deploys 2016 playbook, Biden expands 2020 battle ground||President Donald Trump appears to have gone back to the 2016 playbook for the final nine days of the 2020 race for White House, hoping to pull off a similar win, with not much help from polls or pundits.Democratic nominee Joe Biden, on the other hand, has kept the focus on the present and is seeking to expand the battleground states. He will be addressing two rallies in Georgia, a solidly Republican state, his campaign announced on Saturday. Earlier in the day, Biden and his former boss Barack Obama hammered Trump at separate rallies on his failure to contain Covid-19.“There’s something going on. It happened this time four years ago. This time more,” President Trump told supporters at a rally on Saturday in Ohio, a battleground state he had won easily in 2016 but now leads Biden by a precariously thin margin of 1.5 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.Trump has begun portraying himself, starting with the last debate, as an outsider, and has striven to paint Biden as a corrupt politician just as he did with his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, and indulgently watched his supporters chant “Lock him up,” a 2020 version of “Lock her up”.Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told The Washington Post, which first reported Trump’s back-to-2016 strategy, “There are striking similarities to the president’s campaign in 2016 — a tight race, an enthusiasm advantage and clear momentum down the stretch for Donald Trump.”Trump had indeed trailed Clinton in polls at this stage in 2016 by similar margins — by 6.1 percentage points (43.2-49.4) in the FiveThirtyEight average on October 24, 2016. Four years since, Trump trails Biden by 9.1 percentage points (32.8-51.9). Not exactly the same, but not too far apart either.There are crucial differences though between the 2016 and 2020 races: Trump is the president, for one, with a record to defend or flaunt, and not just a candidate; both he and Clinton had high unfavourable ratings in 2016, but this time, there is a huge gap — Biden is seen far more favourably than both Trump and Clinton (compared to her ratings then). Biden, meantime, is seeking to expand his advantage by taking the battle into Republican territory: Georgia, where he will address two rallies on Tuesday, hoping to flip a solidly conservative state that has not voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1992. Citing previous day’s number of Covid-19 infections, the former vice-president said, “Yet at the debate on Thursday night, Donald Trump was still saying, ‘we’re rounding the corner… it’s going away … we’re learning to live with it’.”He added, recounting his own remarks from the debate, “But as I told him, we’re not learning to live with it. We’re learning to die with it, and there is a dark winter ahead.”Obama was scathing in his remarks on his successor. “Eight months into this pandemic, new cases are breaking records,” he said. “Donald Trump isn’t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself.”That was a reference to Trump’s own bout with Covid-19. The president has since recovered and resumed campaigning energetically, addressing multiple rallies every day. But White House staffers have continued to test positive for the deadly virus, with new reports adding vice-president Mike Pence’s chief of staff and a political adviser to the growing list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-deploys-2016-playbook-biden-expands-2020-battle-ground/story-FYwK6J9OnDoiBX3Cl00vXO.html
25-10-2020||World||Mexico’s legendary masked wrestlers seek new ways to keep fighting||Mexico’s famed masked wrestlers are trying to get their coronavirus-hit sport off the canvas by taking their colorful fights to a small island nestled in the heart of Mexico City’s popular Xochimilco canals.With sporting events largely banned and the pandemic showing no signs of easing off, performers behind Mexico’s free-style wrestling, known as Lucha Libre, are seeking innovative ways to make a living out of their craft.Lucha Libre is one of Mexico’s most popular sports and a tourist magnet, featuring masked fighters who capture the public’s imagination with their mysterious identities and eccentric performances.A group of Lucha Libre fighters and promoters are planning to fuse two tourist crowd-pullers by holding fights on a small island in the network of waterways and man-made islands on the famed Lake Xochimilco. After erecting a ring on the island, promoters plan to allow fans to watch the fights from boats if they pay a little extra for their ride, starting from next Friday, “You will be able to enjoy real quality wrestling,” said Ciclope, a fighter and promoter of the concept. The small Xochimilco islands, known as chinampas, and their waterways feature on the Unesco World Heritage list. Visitors tour the area on boats, often accompanied by mariachi singers. “Well, with the pandemic, one has to take the positive side out of the negative things,” added Ciclope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-s-legendary-masked-wrestlers-seek-new-ways-to-keep-fighting/story-9Q4MKEg0Eg48RRxFCb6AgK.html
25-10-2020||World||VP Mike Pence tested negative for Covid-19 after top aide tested positive||Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, has tested positive for coronavirus along with at least one other key adviser, raising the prospect of another outbreak within the White House less than two weeks before the election.Pence has tested negative and will continue to campaign for President Donald Trump’s re-election, according to a statement from the vice president’s office announcing Short’s diagnosis. It said Pence was considered “essential personnel” under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.Short is Pence’s top aide, a constant presence at his side who frequently acts as a spokesman for the vice president. In the statement, Pence’s office acknowledged that he’s considered a close contact of Short under infection tracing procedures.Pence traveled to Florida to deliver a campaign speech in Tallahassee on Saturday evening after learning of Short’s diagnosis, according to people familiar with the matter. Short, who tested positive earlier in the day, did not accompany him.Pence is scheduled to campaign on Sunday in Kinston, North Carolina.Earlier Saturday, Bloomberg News reported that one of Pence’s closest political advisers, Marty Obst, had tested positive on Wednesday, adding further to the cases in and around the White House.Coronavirus has swept through the White House since September, infecting President Donald Trump, his wife and youngest son, and a number of top aides, including his campaign manager, his press secretary, and the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. The outbreak has served as a punctuation mark on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which polls show has been widely panned by voters.The US is experiencing yet another surge of infections, with new cases exceeding 83,000 on Friday, a record. About 8.6 million Americans have contracted the virus so far and more than 225,000 have died.The infections of Short and Obst -- as well as Pence’s exposure -- risk overshadowing the closing week of Trump’s re-election campaign. Trump has repeatedly said in recent days that the country is turning a corner on the pandemic, even with a spike in infections.“The bottom line is we have to be vigilant, we have to be careful, we have to be everything, but we also have to get our lives back,” the president said on Saturday at a rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin. “We have to take our country back. It’s going away, it’s rounding the turn.”Both Obst and Short have developed minor symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to people familiar with the matter.Obst is not a government employee, but is frequently in contact with Pence and his staff and often visits the White House grounds. He was last around Pence about a week ago but wasn’t in close proximity to the vice president, two of the people said.Obst was quiet on Twitter the day of his diagnosis, with just one retweet, but has since been active on the social media platform, posting criticism of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.Short and Obst declined to comment.Another Trump ally, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, was hospitalized with Covid-19 after helping the president prepare for his first debate with Biden last month. Since recovering, Christie has issued a public mea culpa, declaring he was wrong not to wear a mask at the White House and urging Americans to follow the guidance of public health authorities.Trump has seldom worn a mask before or after his illness and discourages it among his aides and people around him. The president wore a mask on Saturday when he voted in Florida.Pence, after avoiding the West Wing during the outbreak that sickened the president, was in the building this week.On Saturday, the vice president was photographed wearing a mask as he walked from Marine Two and boarded Air Force Two in Washington. He didn’t wear a mask during events in Lakeland or Tallahassee but was alone on stage, at a distance from other people. US Secret Service agents around him wore masks.The CDC recommends that “essential personnel” wear a mask at all times in their workplaces for 14 days following exposure to someone infected with coronavirus and maintain social distancing, to the extent practicable.Pence’s press secretary Katie Miller contracted Covid-19 in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vp-mike-pence-tested-negative-for-covid-19-after-top-aide-tested-positive/story-dCBEODLY4AvyuOJdN6IyYJ.html
25-10-2020||World||‘That’s no way to talk about friends’: Biden scolds Trump over ‘filthy’ India||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden slammed US President Donald Trump on Saturday for calling India “filthy” and admonished him for speaking that way about “friends”.“President Trump called India ‘filthy’,” Biden wrote in a tweet. “It’s not how you talk about friends—and it’s not how you solve global challenges like climate change.”He added, referring to his Indian-descent running mate Kamala Harris, “@KamalaHarris and I deeply value our partnership—and will put respect back at the center of our foreign policy.”During an exchange at their final presidential debate on Thursday, Trump had sought to defend his record on climate crisis and his decision to exit the Paris Accord, alleging the global agreement was partial to India, China and Russia that were more polluting.“Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India, it’s so filthy, the air is filthy,” the American president had said. “The Paris accord I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars, and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there, they did us a great disservice,” he had added.Indian Americans and surrogates of the Biden campaign had responded angrily at the time. “His rhetoric has proven time and time again that he has disdain for India, as well as for people who draw their heritage from South Asia,” South Asians for Biden, a group of backers and surrogates, said in a tweet.A congressional aide who spoke on background had said it was a “bizarre comment from a president who is trying to court India as a key part of his national security strategy in the Indo-Pacific”. And it was “oddly timed, especially when his secretary of state and defence (Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper) are headed to India next week to meet with their Indian counterparts”. The aide was referring to the 2+2 ministerial dialogue in New Delhi on October 27.Indian Americans have been courted in this election like never before. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns have reached out to the community extensively, each arguing they would be better shepherds of the bilateral relationship with India.There are an estimated 1.9 million eligible Indian American voters. A recent poll of the community showed an overwhelming 72% of them will vote for Biden and 22% for Trump (an earlier survey with smaller sample size was more generous to Trump — 28% to vote for him, 66% for Biden).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-scolds-trump-over-filthy-india-remarks/story-VuzaHFM2WIBsGPeQshVuVP.html
25-10-2020||World||US: First ‘Murder hornet’ nest vacuumed from tree in Washington||A team of entomologists in full-body protective gear vacuumed Asian giant hornets out of a tree in Washington state on Saturday, eradicating the first nest of the so-called murder hornets found in the United States.The state’s agricultural department said it had spent weeks searching for and trapping the hornets, which attack honeybee hives and could pose a threat to humans, because they can sting repeatedly with venom that is stronger than a honeybee’s.The state’s entomologists succeeded by attaching radio trackers to three hornets they had trapped earlier in the week, one of which they followed to the nest, located in a tree near Blaine, Washington, on Thursday.They returned on Saturday to make the extraction.“Got ‘em. Vacuumed out several #AsianGiantHornets from a tree cavity near Blaine this morning,” the agriculture department said on Twitter, adding that more details would be provided at a news conference on Monday.The stinging hornet, the world’s largest, can grow as large as 2-1/2 inches (6.4 cm) in length and is native to Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan. It was first discovered in the United States in December by a homeowner in Blaine.Aside from the danger to humans, the hornet presents a threat to agriculture and the apiary industry, officials have said, because it is a known predator of honey bees, with a few of the hornets capable of wiping out an entire hive in hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usa-s-first-murder-hornet-nest-vacuumed-from-tree-in-washington/story-PfbSJ41p601UVLYrANHWRK.html
25-10-2020||World||Italy plans further curbs as coronavirus cases hit new record||Italy reported another daily record for Covid-19 cases on Saturday as the government planned further restrictions to contain a resurgence of the pandemic, despite a second night of street protests against curfews ordered this week.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he wants to avoid a repeat of the blanket lockdown earlier in the year. But a number of regions have imposed overnight curfews and the central government is expected to announce more measures soon.After clashes in the southern city of Naples on Friday night, police faced off against dozens of masked protestors in the centre of Rome after the far-right Forza Nuova group called for a protest against the curfews.Earlier, health ministry data showed 19,644 new Covid-19 cases and 151 dead as the disease surged in areas like Lombardy, Milan, Campania and Lazio.Conte pledged to speed up help for businesses suffering in the crisis but said the weeks ahead would be very difficult. “We cannot lower our guard,” he added.According to a draft decree circulated on Saturday, public gyms and swimming pools may be closed and bars and restaurants told to shut from 6PM, while people will be encouraged not to travel outside their home districts.Like many authorities across Europe, the Italian government is desperate not to close down the economy completely but is facing growing public anger at renewed restrictions being imposed to limit public gatherings.Earlier in the week, overnight curfews were ordered by local governors in Campania, the area around Naples, Lazio around Rome, and Lombardy, the epicentre of the first wave where the financial capital Milan recorded more than 1,000 new cases on Saturday.The northern region of Piedmont and Sicily in the south will follow next week and other regions are expected to match them.With public health services coming under strain, authorities have reopened temporary intensive care facilities built during the first phase. Despite this, Italy’s top public health body warned on Friday services were approaching crisis point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-plans-further-curbs-as-coronavirus-cases-hit-new-record/story-h49LX8gnAdrDAhEhvaashI.html
25-10-2020||World||Officials issue evacuation order to Estes park residents as wildfire rages in Colorado||Residents remaining in Estes Park, in Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, were told to evacuate their homes on Saturday as wind gusts fanned the second largest wildfire in state history and the blaze claimed the lives of an elderly couple. Officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for eastern Estes Park as wind gusts pushed the 191,000-acre (77,300-hectare) East Troublesome Fire east, threatening the town of 6,300 people that serves as a base camp for the popular national park.Noel Livingston, incident commander for the fire, said firefighters waged a “very aggressive” battle on Saturday to hold the line at Estes Park and expressed hopes that a winter storm overnight would aid in containment.“They’ve had a very long day, a very tough day,” Livingston told a briefing on Saturday evening. “A lot of active fire spread there with the community certainly still at risk.”Livingston said the fire probably was caused by a human, but noted that the investigation was not complete.At a Red Cross evacuation center in the Denver suburb of Westminster, a steady stream of evacuees from Estes Park waited in line to be processed and receive hotel and restaurant vouchers. Many exchanged information and stories about their experience with others forced out of their homes.Estes Park resident Suzanne Adams, 44, and her husband Phillip, 49, fled their home on Thursday when just voluntary evacuations were in place. The couple decided to leave when smoke blanketed the town on Thursday afternoon.“The sky turned pink and red and ash started to fall – we thought it was snowing,” she said.Phillip Adams said as the blaze “roared like a freight train” as it moved toward the town. “I looked out to the west and could see flames 300 feet high over the mountain,” he said. Near the town of Grand Lake, some 17 miles (30 km) southwest of Estes Park, the fire killed Lyle and Marilyn Hileman, who were 86- and 84-years-old. The couple, who were married for almost 70 years, chose not to leave their home, local officials said after finding their bodies on Friday.“Our parents left this world together and on their own terms. They leave a legacy of hard work and determination to overcome - something all of Grand County will need,” the family said in a statement released to local media. The fire, which started on Oct. 14, was 4% contained as of Saturday. As the flames spread and jumped the Continental Divide on Thursday, authorities closed all 415 square miles (668 square km) of Rocky Mountain National Park to visitors, and ordered the evacuation of several mountain communities.Livingston said he was hoping that a winter storm warning would translate into lots of snow. “We are hoping, fingers crossed, that we get significant snow tonight,” he said. “We’ll take advantage of that tomorrow.” The closure of the park is in addition to more than one million acres of wilderness in Colorado that the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and state authorities have been forced to declare off limits to the public. Further north, Colorado’s largest wildfire on record, the Cameron Peak Fire, has been burning since mid-August. It has burned more than 207,400 acres and scorched swaths of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests. As of Saturday morning, it was 60% contained. Making conditions worse, most of Colorado is in the grip of some level of drought, according to information released this week by the US Drought Monitor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-issue-evacuation-order-to-estes-park-residents-as-wildfire-rages-in-colorado/story-hcNIEr6FKO8WnWlcuPkTNO.html
25-10-2020||World||Wavel Ramkalawan wins Seychelles elections: Reports||Opposition candidate and Anglican priest Wavel Ramkalawan has won the elections in the island nation of Seychelles, local media reported. He won both presidential as well as parliamentary elections, early reports said. @wavelramkalawan Congratulations Mr. PRESIDENT. We Did IT 💚💚💚💚According to provisional figures reported by the local media, Ramkalawan’s party Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS) secured 55 per cent of votes, while incumbent Danny Faure trailed with 43 per cent of votes.Voting took place Thursday and Friday on a few dozen of these outer islands, mainly for employees of hotels or the island management authority. Some on the main islands deemed essential workers, such as hospital and nursing staff, also voted Thursday.The opposition was narrowly defeated in a presidential election in 2015.The elections were held in Seychelles as the island nation’s economy was battered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The Indian Ocean archipelago nation is expected to see its tourism-dependent economy contract by 14 per cent this year, according to rating agency Fitch, reversing some fragile progress since the government defaulted on its debt in 2008 and sought an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout.The same party has been in power since 1977. Faure, who previously vice president, was elevated to the presidency in 2016 when his predecessor resigned after a constitutional amendment was passed limiting presidents to two terms.There are about 74,600 voters in Seychelles out of a population of 100,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wavel-ramkalawan-wins-seychelles-elections-reports/story-rRpqUtgt5UYdeAwMNOIe8O.html
25-10-2020||World||China reviewing strategy for internationalization of Yuan, says official||China is reconsidering its strategy for the internationalization of yuan after completing a comprehensive review recently, according to a senior central bank official.“As everybody knows in the past, the internationalization of the RMB sticks to the market principles,” Zhu Jun, director general of the People’s Bank of China’s international division, said at the Bund Summit in Shanghai on Saturday. “The role of the authorities was mainly focused on removing the policy obstacles for the free use of the currency. At this moment, we think there are some kinds of complications in the domestic and overseas situations.”The yuan rallied to the strongest in more than two years earlier this week, aided by dollar weakness and China’s economic recovery from the virus pandemic. The prospects of a victory by Joe Biden over President Donald Trump in the upcoming US election are also supporting the currency. Trump’s trade war with China last year sent the currency to its lowest since 2008.Zhu said going forward the government can be more proactive with policy support to facilitate the role of the markets. For instance, the central bank can improve bilateral currency swap agreements to better promote trade and investments, and try to coordinate various means of yuan cross-border settlements and payments infrastructure.The authorities will remove existing obstacles for the yuan’s internationalization, with a steady liberalization of the capital account and increasing the RMB exchange-rate flexibility as well as improving liquidity in the bond market, Zhu said.While China over the years made some progress -- promoting offshore yuan trading, winning official reserve-currency status from the International Monetary Fund and introducing commodity contracts priced in yuan -- the renminbi is a small player on the global stage, with 2% market share.From Fixing to Signaling, How China Manages the Yuan: QuickTakeAnd while a steady opening of China’s financial markets to overseas investors has lured inflows, foreign ownership of mainland stocks and bonds is relatively minor. China’s capital account, a term for the flow of funds across borders, currently remains subject to significant regulations on the transfer of the yuan.Separately, central bank governor Yi Gang said on Saturday the reform of the yuan exchange-rate formation mechanism and the internationalization of the currency should be jointly promoted with the financial opening.“The yuan internationalization should be market-oriented,” he said. “The regulator’s main job is to reduce restrictions on the cross-border use of the currency, and let it take its own course.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reviewing-strategy-for-internationalization-of-yuan-says-official/story-BCU8H7boeVQCnzK5Uacf6L.html
25-10-2020||World||Middle East calls for boycott of French products after Macron’s comments||Calls to boycott French goods are growing in the Arab world and beyond, after President Emmanuel Macron criticised Islamists and vowed not to “give up cartoons” depicting the Prophet Mohammed.Macron’s comments, on Wednesday, came in response to the beheading of a teacher, Samuel Paty, outside his school in a suburb outside Paris earlier this month, after he had shown cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed during a class he was leading on free speech. The teacher became the target of an online hate campaign over his choice of lesson material -- the same images that unleashed a bloody assault by Islamist gunmen on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the original publisher, in January 2015.Caricatures of Mohammed are forbidden by Islam.On Saturday, Jordan’s foreign ministry said it condemned the “continued publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed under the pretext of freedom of expression” and any “discriminatory and misleading attempts that seek to link Islam with terrorism.”It did not directly criticise Macron, although the French president had on Wednesday also contended that Paty was “killed because Islamists want our future”. But Jordan’s opposition Islamic Action Front party called on the French president to apologise for his comments and urged citizens in the kingdom to boycott French goods.Such boycotts are already underway in Kuwait and Qatar. - ‘Mental checks’ -Dozens of Kuwaiti stores are boycotting French products, with images on social media showing workers removing French Kiri and Babybel processed cheese from shelves.In Doha, an AFP correspondent saw workers stripping shelves of French-made St. Dalfour jams and Saf-Instant yeast in a branch of the Al Meera supermarket chain on Saturday.Al Meera competes with French supermarket chains Monoprix and Carrefour for market share in the lucrative Qatari grocery sector.Al Meera and another grocery operator, Souq Al Baladi, released statements late Friday saying they would pull French products from stores until further notice.They stopped short of explicitly naming Macron or citing his comments, but the Al Meera statement said customer “comments guided our actions”.Neither operator responded to AFP requests for comment.Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- the president of Turkey and a major ally of Qatar -- on Saturday slammed Macron over his policies toward Muslims, saying that the French president needed “mental checks.”“What can one say about a head of state who treats millions of members from different faith groups this way: first of all, have mental checks,” Erdogan said in a televised address.Before Macron’s comments on Wednesday, he had already sparked a backlash in early October when he said “Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world”.Nayef Falah Mubarak Al-Hajraf, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council called Macron’s words “irresponsible” on Friday, and said they would “increase the spread of a culture of hatred”.The same day, Qatar University wrote on Twitter that following “the deliberate abuse of Islam and its symbols”, French Cultural Week would be postponed indefinitely, in a context where 2020 is the France-Qatar year of culture. Many Jordanians have changed their profiles on Facebook to add the message “Respect Mohammad the Prophet of Allah (God)”.In Jaffa, a largely Arab town next to Tel Aviv, some 200 people protested after evening prayers on Saturday in front of the residence of France’s ambassador to Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/middle-east-calls-for-boycott-of-french-products-after-macron-s-comments/story-NoOP0qpsWDEOBgSbfXmWML.html
25-10-2020||World||President Trump understands the power of Indian American, says campaign official||Indian Americans have become a force to reckon with in the US and President Donald Trump understands their power, said the president’s re-election campaign official Saturday. “You, the powerful Indian Americans are a force to reckon with today. You have not realized your own power, but President Trump understands your power,” Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee said at an event organised by the Indian Voices for Trump. Indian Americans, particularly in the battleground states, can play an important role in getting Trump re-elected, he said, adding his recent survey in these battleground states reveal that the community members are moving towards the president in a big way. For the first time in the history of presidential elections, more than 50 percent of Indian American Democrats are moving towards the Republican party because of Trump, he said, adding the vote of the community will contribute to the victory of the president. Explaining the reasons, Mason, based on a survey, said Trump has respected the community and Indian leadership in a way no other president has done in the past. “Trump has elevated India’s stature on the world stage -- the India-US relationship has been rock solid. Kudos to the brilliance of both President Trump and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi for cementing the bond between India and US,” he said in his remarks at the event. In 2019, Mason explained, when the world was against Modi on the Kashmir issue and world leaders were criticising him on this issue, the only man “who had the guts to stand” by him was Trump. “The president went to the Howdy Modi event in Houston (last year) and never once injected himself into Kashmiri issue ... never once interfered into the internal affairs of India…. Kashmir is a very sensitive emotional topic for every Indian American,” Mason said. During his India trip early this year, Trump said America loves India, America respects India and America will always be faithful and loyal friend to Indians. All this resonates well with the four million Indian Americans, he added.“Every Indian American in the US has a family member back home, like old parents, brother, sister, friend, business - they want India to be respected and protected from China, which is what Trump can provide. They fear that China would start a war with India without Trump. Trump has stood up to China,” he said. Mason had recently created a video “Four More Years” in support of President Trump reflecting his love for Indian Americans and friendship with India, which has received over 25 million views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-understands-the-power-of-indian-american-says-campaign-official/story-vRu7bvjwYuAwGWRdqNtZEP.html
25-10-2020||World||China a ‘number one national security threat’ to US: Nikki Haley||China is the United States’ “absolute number one” national security threat, said Indian-American Republican politician Nikki Haley on Saturday (local time), adding that US President Donald Trump has made sure Beijing does not steal American intellectual property. Speaking during a fireside chat event organised by the Indian Voices for Trump in the battleground state of Philadelphia, Haley, former US Ambassador to the UN, said President Trump has “put China on notice”. “China is our absolute number one threat right now, a huge national security threat. With the trade deal that the President did, not only did he get a better trade deal for us, he put China on notice with intellectual property,” the 48-year-old said.“He has made sure that they know that they can not turn around and steal the intellectual property. They cannot go and spy on our universities, and that we are going to hold them accountable as we go forward,” she added. The two-term governor of South Carolina, Haley was the first Cabinet-ranking Indian-American in any presidential administration. She is now campaigning for Trump ahead of the US election. The US and China relations have swiftly deteriorated in the past few months over a range of issues including Covid-19 origin, Indo Pacific, Hong Kong and trade disagreements. During the event, Haley also hit out at Democratic Presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden and accused former US President Barack Obama’s administration of sponsoring terrorism. “The last administration, under Biden, Obama gave literally planes full of cash to the largest sponsor of terror. And they took that cash and funnelled it and spread terrorism throughout Yemen, and Lebanon, and Syria, and Iraq. And all these places. The President pulled out of the Iran deal so they will have the money to spend,” she said.The presential elections in the US will be held on Tuesday, November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-a-number-one-national-security-threat-to-us-nikki-haley/story-TpHhvYCVf9TkqVckRxEP0K.html
25-10-2020||World||Facebook demands academics disable ad-targeting data tool||Academics, journalists and First Amendment lawyers are rallying behind New York University researchers in a showdown with Facebook over its demand that they halt the collection of data showing who is being micro-targeted by political ads on the world’s dominant social media platform. The researchers say the disputed tool is vital to understanding how Facebook has been used to as a conduit for disinformation and manipulation. In an Oct. 16 letter to the researchers, a Facebook executive demanded they disable a special plug-in for Chrome and Firefox browsers that they have distributed to thousands of volunteers across the US — and delete the data obtained. The plug-in lets researchers see which ads are shown to each volunteer; Facebook lets advertisers tailor ads based on specific demographics that go far beyond race, age, gender and political preference. The executive, Allison Hendrix, said the tool violates Facebook rules prohibiting automated bulk collection of data from the site. Her letter threatened “additional enforcement action” if the takedown was not effected by Nov. 30. Company spokesman Joe Osborne said in an emailed statement Saturday that Facebook “informed NYU months ago that moving forward with a project to scrape people’s Facebook information would violate our terms.” The company has long claimed protecting user privacy is its main concern, though NYU researchers say their tool is programmed so the data collected from participating volunteers is anonymous. The outcry over Facebook’s threat was immediate after The Wall Street Journal first reported the news Friday because the “Ad Observer” tool provides valuable insights into what ads are targeting specific types of voters. It has been used by local reporters from Wisconsin to Utah to Florida to write about the Nov. 3 presidential election. “That Facebook is trying to shut down a tool crucial to exposing disinformation in the run up to one of the most consequential elections in U.S. history is alarming,” said Ramya Krishnan, an attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which is representing the researchers. “The public has a right to know what political ads are being run and how they are being targeted. Facebook shouldn’t be allowed to be the gatekeeper to information necessary to safeguard our democracy.“ “The NYU Ad Observatory is the only window researchers have to see microtargeting information about political ads on Facebook,” Julia Angwin, editor of the data-centric investigative tech news website The Markup, tweet in disappointment. The tool is a key source of data on election interference and manipulation because it lets researchers see how some Facebook advertisers use data gathered by the company to profile citizens “and send them misinformation about candidates and policies that are designed to influence or even suppress their vote,” Damon McCoy, an NYU professor involved in the project, said in a statement. After an uproar over its lack of transparency on political ads Facebook ran ahead of the 2016 election, a sharp contrast to how ads are regulated on traditional media, the company created an ad archive that includes details such as who paid for an ad and when it ran. But Facebook does not share information about who gets served the ad. The company has resisted allowing researchers access to the platform, where right-wing content has consistently been trending in recent weeks. Last year, more than 200 researchers signed a letter to Facebook calling on it to lift restrictions on public-interest research and journalism that would permit automated digital collection of data from the platform.

25-10-2020||World||Here’s what may happen next in Thailand’s historic protests||With Thailand’s parliament set to convene on Monday to find a way out of a political crisis fueled by street protests, one thing is becoming clear: There is no easy solution for the military-backed government.Protesters calling for democratic reforms and changes to the monarchy were undeterred by an emergency decree prohibiting large gatherings, prompting Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha to lift it and call for calm. That was met with fresh calls for his resignation and even more protests.Now the military and royalist elite who have long held power in Thailand must decide whether to meet some or all protest demands, or take more aggressive steps to shut down the demonstrations.Here are possible scenarios for where things go from here:1. Slow-Walking ReformOne key demand is a new constitution to replace the one drafted after a 2014 coup led by Prayuth. Its provision for a military-appointed Senate has been instrumental in helping him retain power following last year’s election.Prayuth’s government has already said it’s open to certain unspecified changes, and prior to Monday’s special parliamentary session it already initiated a process to begin amending the constitution. Still, that process could end up taking years, and it wouldn’t be the first time: Following the bloody ‘Black May’ uprising against military rule in 1992, it took five years before a new constitution was put in place. And that was nullified in a coup less than a decade later.Also Read | Thailand braces for more rallies as Prime Minister ignores calls to quit“The regime could be looking at the same kind of tactics this time around,” said Kevin Hewison, an emeritus professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has researched Thai politics for decades. They could “drag it out for so long, but eventually don’t make many changes at all.”2. Prayuth’s OusterCalls for Prayuth’s resignation have persisted since last year’s election. While he has so far refused to step down, his rule is contingent on the support of the monarchy and other elites in Bangkok. If protests were to garner wider support from the general population, his ouster may be the easiest way to try and soothe tensions.Prayuth’s future is now firmly tied to the challenges to the monarchy, said Lee Morgenbesser, a lecturer at Australia’s Griffith University whose research focuses on authoritarian regimes and Southeast Asian politics. “If the protests persist too long or become violent, which would see the prestige of the king further questioned, the Thai government is an obvious sacrificial lamb.”Having already survived a no-confidence vote in February, the government isn’t likely to face much pressure in parliament. Still, even if Prayuth were to step aside, he could just be replaced by someone else backed by the military.3. Violent CrackdownPast protest movements in Thailand have often ended in bloody crackdowns, most recently in 2010. With groups of royalists organizing to confront the pro-democracy demonstrators, there are concerns they could happen again at some point -- even if the threat isn’t imminent.“There can always be a violent crackdown,” said Paul Chambers, a Thai politics expert at Naresuan University’s College of Asean Community Studies, adding that such a move could backfire on authorities. The government would “do so only because it is desperate for the survival of military and royal privileges unreformed.”4. Monarchy ChangesAfter breaking long-held taboos about publicly criticizing the royal family, protesters are demanding the monarch no longer endorse coups, provide transparency in managing billions of dollars worth of crown assets, and get rid of defamation laws that stifle discussion of the royal family.Any of those changes would require approval from King Maha Vajiralongkorn, which analysts say is a long shot.“Royal abdication, scaled back authority for the crown are highly unlikely anytime soon,” said Chambers. “After all, Thailand’s military, political and economic elites ascribe their legitimacy to close linkages to the palace. A weakening of palace power weakens the power of all of Thailand’s vested power players.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/here-s-what-may-happen-next-in-thailand-s-historic-protests/story-NsEbndgErSPHEYY9ZuoLrK.html
25-10-2020||World||Nuclear weapons ban treaty to enter into force: UN||The United Nations announced Saturday that 50 countries have ratified a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons triggering its entry into force in 90 days, a move hailed by anti-nuclear activists but strongly opposed by the United States and the other major nuclear powers.As of Friday, the treaty had 49 signatories, and UN officials said the 50th ratification from Honduras had been received.“This moment has been 75 years coming since the horrific attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the founding of the UN which made nuclear disarmament a cornerstone,” said Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize-winning coalition whose work helped spearhead the nuclear ban treaty. “The 50 countries that ratify this Treaty are showing true leadership in setting a new international norm that nuclear weapons are not just immoral but illegal.”The 50th ratification came on the 75th anniversary of the ratification of the UN Charter which officially established the United Nations and is celebrated as UN Day.“The United Nations was formed to promote peace with a goal of the abolition of nuclear weapons,” Fihn said. “This treaty is the UN at its best — working closely with civil society to bring democracy to disarmament.”The United States had written to treaty signatories saying the Trump administration believes they made “a strategic error” and urging them to rescind their ratification.The U.S. letter, obtained by The Associated Press, said the five original nuclear powers -- the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France -- and America’s NATO allies “stand unified in our opposition to the potential repercussions” of the treaty.It says the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, known as the TPNW, “turns back the clock on verification and disarmament and is dangerous” to the half-century-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, considered the cornerstone of global nonproliferation efforts.“The TPNW is and will remain divisive in the international community and risk further entrenching divisions in existing nonproliferation and disarmament fora that offer the only realistic prospect for consensus-based progress,” the letter said. “It would be unfortunate if the TPNW were allowed to derail our ability to work together to address pressing proliferation.”Fihn has stressed that “the nonproliferation Treaty is about preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and eliminating nuclear weapons, and this treaty implements that. There’s no way you can undermine the Nonproliferation Treaty by banning nuclear weapons. It’s the end goal of the Nonproliferation Treaty.”The NPT sought to prevent the spread of nuclear arms beyond the five original weapons powers. It requires non-nuclear signatory nations to not pursue atomic weapons in exchange for a commitment by the five powers to move toward nuclear disarmament and to guarantee non-nuclear states’ access to peaceful nuclear technology for producing energy.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has supported the nuclear weapons ban treaty, calling it “a very welcome initiative.”“It is clear for me that we will only be entirely safe in relation to nuclear weapons the day where nuclear weapons no longer exist,” he said in an interview Wednesday with AP. “We know that it’s not easy. We know that there are many obstacles.”He expressed hope that a number of important initiatives, including U.S.-Russia talks on renewing the New Start Treaty limiting deployed nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers and next year’s review conference of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, “will all converge in the same direction, and the final objective must be to have a world with no nuclear weapons.”The treaty was approved by the 193-member UN General Assembly on July 7, 2017 by a vote of 122 in favor, the Netherlands opposed, and Singapore abstaining. Among countries voting in favor was Iran. The five nuclear powers and four other countries known or believed to possess nuclear weapons — India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — boycotted negotiations and the vote on the treaty, along with many of their allies.Setsuko Thurlow, a survivor of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, who has been an ardent campaigner for the treaty, said: “When I learned that we reached our 50th ratification, I was not able to stand.”“I remained in my chair and put my head in my hands and I cried tears of joy,” she said in a statement. “I have committed my life to the abolition of nuclear weapons. I have nothing but gratitude for all who have worked for the success of our treaty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nuclear-weapons-ban-treaty-to-enter-into-force-un/story-9mzQQq7v1Qtxcnqw2pZ2AP.html
25-10-2020||World||Covid-19 rages as Asia, US record grim milestones||Asia surpassed 10 million Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the second biggest regional tally in the world. In another grim milestone, the US broke its daily record for new coronavirus infections on Friday, reporting 84,218 new cases due to outbreaks in virtually every part of the country.Behind only Latin America, Asia accounts for about one-fourth of the global caseload of 42.1 million of the virus. With over 163,000 deaths, the region accounts for some 14% of the global Covid-19 toll.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWithin the region, South Asia led by India is the worst affected, with nearly 21% of the reported global coronavirus cases and 12% of deaths. This contrasts with countries like China and New Zealand that have crushed infections and Japan.Bangladesh is Asia’s second worst-hit country, with nearly 400,000 cases. But daily infections have slowed to 1,453, less than 40% of the July peak.In the US, the spike in cases comes less than two weeks before the election on November 3 and is hitting battleground states such as Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Thursday, the US reported a near-record 76,195 new cases. The previous record was 77,299 new cases on July 16. At the time, hospitalisations for Covid-19 patients hit 47,000 and two weeks later deaths rose to an average of 1,200 per day.Earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of an “exponential” rise in infections threatening health systems’ ability to cope. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said “too many countries are seeing an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close to or above capacity - and we’re still only in October”.France will have to live with the coronavirus at least until next summer, President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday.Macron said there were no plans at this stage to reduce curfews aimed at preventing the virus spreading. “When I listen to scientists I see that projections are for at best until next summer,” he said, adding it was too early to say if France was headed towards lockdowns.France reported 41,622 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday and will break through the 1,000,000 cumulative tally on Friday.Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has tested positive for coronavirus but is feeling well, his spokesman said on Saturday. Duda’s diagnosis comes amid a huge surge in confirmed new cases of Covid-19 and virus-related deaths in Poland, a nation that saw only very low infection rates in the spring.His spokesman, Blazej Spychalski, said on Twitter that the 48-year-old conservative leader was tested the day before and his result was positive. He said the president is in isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-rages-as-asia-us-record-grim-milestones/story-Hob5v2emK1qo1KUGGvZOBK.html
25-10-2020||World||Ethiopia upset after Trump says Egypt should ‘blow up’ dam||Ethiopia on Saturday denounced “belligerent threats” over a huge dam it has nearly completed on the Blue Nile River, a day after US President Donald Trump said downstream Egypt will “blow up” the project it has called an existential threat.Without naming Trump, the statement by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s office came amid an outcry in Ethiopia over the US president’s latest threat over the dam. The $4.6bn Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is seen as a source of pride, and is aimed at pulling millions out of poverty.“The man doesn’t have a clue on what he is talking about,” former PM Hailemariam Dessalegn tweeted, calling Trump’s remark irresponsible.Trump made the comment while announcing that Sudan would start to normalise ties with Israel. Downstream Sudan is a party to the talks with Ethiopia and Egypt over the disputed dam. “They (Egypt) will end up blowing up the dam,” Trump said. “I say it loud and clear… they have to do something.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopia-upset-after-trump-says-egypt-should-blow-up-dam/story-hfoD0tZomfpfVt2mKILg2M.html
25-10-2020||World||Ventilation key to preventing Covid-19, say top UK experts||Check the ventilation in your office space because poor airflow raises the risk of exposure to Covid-19, top British experts advising the UK government on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic have said.Experts on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) have called for making ventilation in public buildings and workplaces integral to policy measures, highlighting risk in poorly ventilated spaces. Measurements of elevated carbon dioxide levels in indoor air are an effective method of identifying poor ventilation in multi-occupant spaces.Their advice is the second such conclusion after a University of Cambridge study in September found an increase in risk of exposure to the virus from ventilation systems in modern office buildings, which are designed to keep temperatures comfortable and increase energy efficiency.The SAGE experts said in a paper released on Friday, “Ventilation is an important factor in mitigating against the risk of far-field (>2m) aerosol transmission… Activities that may generate high levels of aerosol (singing, loud speech, aerobic activity) are likely to pose the greatest risk; in some spaces even enhanced ventilation may not fully mitigate this risk.”“It is more important to improve ventilation in multi-occupant spaces with very low ventilation rates… Virus survival in air decreases with increasing temperature and humidity. In most environments, this effect is likely to be less important than the ventilation rate. However, environments with low temperature and low humidity (for example, chilled food processing, cold stores) may pose an enhanced risk,” they added.The SAGE paper called for updated guidance on environmental control for Covid-19 across all sectors to provide explicit advice on the risk of far-field aerosol airborne transmission, the importance of ventilation, and recommendations on improving it.“In the longer term consideration of infectious disease transmission needs to be embedded into building ventilation regulations and associated statutory guidance in the same way that energy, comfort and air quality have been incorporated,” the paper said.The Cambridge study published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics found that widely used “mixing ventilation” systems, which are designed to keep conditions uniform in all parts of the room, disperse airborne contaminants evenly throughout the space. These contaminants may include droplets and aerosols, potentially containing viruses.The evidence, the study said, increasingly indicates that the virus is spread primarily through larger droplets and smaller aerosols, which are expelled when people cough, sneeze, laugh, talk or breathe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ventilation-key-to-preventing-covid-19-say-top-uk-experts/story-bNnNtg1b0fDv6UTmMGxuxI.html

25-10-2020||World||In Biden’s outreach to Indian Americans, a clear reference to Chinese aggression and Pak||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that while US-India ties were “photo-ops” for President Donald Trump, for him they were about “getting things done”, and reiterated his promise to work with India to combat terrorism and prevent China from threatening its neighbours.To illustrate his contrast with the US president, Biden recalled the role he played in the passage of the “historic” India-US civil nuclear deal as chairman of the US Senate foreign relations committee in 2008. “At the time, I said if the United States and India became closer friends, then the world will be a safer place,” Biden wrote in an Op-Ed in India West, a news publication focused on the Indian diaspora.President Barack Obama’s 2009-2016 tenure saw “some of the best years” between the two countries, Biden wrote, adding that he and his Indian-descent running mate Kamala Harris will “build on that great progress and do even more.”“We can and should be natural allies,” wrote Biden, who currently has the upper hand in the election according to opinion polls, using a phrase first used by late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee during a trip to the US in 1998. Also Read | India is filthy, claims Trump at his final clash with Biden before race for White House closesLeaders from both countries have since tried their own version to define the relationship in their own vision.Biden reiterated his promise—first laid out in an expansive platform he unveiled on August 15 at a virtual event to mark India’s Independence Day—to work with India on its key foreign policy concerns.“If elected President, I will continue what I have long called for: The US and India will stand together against terrorism in all its forms and work together to promote a region of peace and stability where neither China nor any other country threatens its neighbours.” The resolve to combat terrorism was a reference to cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan.Both Biden and Trump have wooed Indian Americans voters—estimated to number 1.9 million—for their potential to make a difference, howsoever small, in battleground states that will determine the outcome. “The Indian American electorate of nearly 2 million voters is a powerful force that can make all the difference from North Carolina and Virginia to Pennsylvania and Michigan to Georgia and Texas and across the country,” he wrote, leaving no doubt the Op-Ed was an appeal to Indian American voters.Also Read | 2020 is the year of Indian-Americans, and they’re not with TrumpHe added: “And as we value the Indian-American diaspora, we’ll continue to value the US-India relationship. For Donald Trump, it’s photo-ops. For me, it’s getting things done.” It could not be immediately ascertained if the former vice-president was referring to a video released by the Trump campaign of clips of the president with Prime Minister Narendra Modi from their joint appearances at the ‘Howdy Modi’ and ‘Namaste Trump’ events in Houston and Ahmedabad to woo Indian American voters.Watch: US Final Presidential Debate: When Donald Trump called India filthyBiden promised them better ties with their country of origin and better lives for them in the US, addressing their main concerns, as with other Americans—promise to contain the Covid-19 epidemic, expand healthcare, not raise taxes for those under a certain income, encourage legal immigration, and make colleges tuition-free for some certain income categories.Also watch | ‘It’s not how you talk about friends’: Biden On Trump’s ‘filthy India’ remarkBide also noted in the Op-Ed the importance of respecting diversity among other shared values. “We will meet every challenge together as we strengthen both democracies—fair and free elections, equality under the law, freedom of expression and religion, and the boundless strength both nations’ draw from our diversity,” he wrote, adding, “These core principles have endured throughout each nations’ histories and will continue to be the source of our strength in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-trump-india-us-ties-are-about-photo-ops-biden/story-lBYVfmJnmwuQIzLu1wQprJ.html
