It also looked at differences in perceptions of democracy between four sets of generations.The four sets are: ‘Millennials’: those coming of age in the 21st century, born between 1981 and 1996; ‘Generation X’: who came of age in the 1990s, born between 1965 and 1980; ‘Baby boomers’ or ‘1960s and 1970s generation’, born 1944–1964’; and the ‘Interwar generation’, born between 1918 and 1943, prior to decolonisation in Africa and Asia and in between the two World Wars.The authors said India was not included in the sample because the survey data for the country begins only in 2002 and also due to limited comparable data points, but would be added in future rounds.Robert Foa, the study’s lead author, says: “This is the first generation in living memory to have a global majority who are dissatisfied with the way democracy works while in their twenties and thirties”.“By their mid-thirties, 55% of global millennials say they are dissatisfied with democracy, whereas under half of Generation X felt the same way at that age. The majority of baby boomers – now in their sixties and seventies – continue to report satisfaction with democracy, as did the interwar generation,” he adds.The study says the idea that the young who are dissatisfied soften in attitude as they age is now reversed the world over. Millennials and Gen Xers have grown steadily less satisfied with democracy as they have advanced in life, it adds.Foa adds: “Right across the world, we are seeing an ever-widening gap between youth and older generations on how they perceive the functioning of democracy. This democratic disconnect is not a given, but the result of democracies failing to deliver outcomes that matter for young people in recent decades, from jobs and life chances to addressing inequality and climate change.”The study reports an average 16 percentage-point increase in satisfaction with democracy among voters under 35 during the first two years of populist leaders. But no comparable swell was seen when moderate politicians narrowly beat populists.According to the study, whether the rise of left-wing Syriza and Podemos in Greece and Spain, or the populist right of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Poland’s Law and Justice party, all boosted pro-democracy attitudes among millennials, as did political realignment in countries from Brazil and Mexico to the Czech Republic. “Countries electing populist leaders see sharp turnarounds in disenchantment, to the point where young people appear more satisfied with democracy under populists than under moderates,” said Daniella Wenger, one of the co-authors of the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-youth-losing-faith-in-democracy-cambridge-study/story-vr0Auh5NFTpPnG0UaZf8qI.html
20-10-2020||World||India-US ties bright regardless of who wins White House: Official||The future of India-US ties was “bright” regardless of the outcome of the US presidential election, US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun said on Tuesday, noting that every American president had left the relationship in a better shape than they had inherited. He also said the goal for the Quad-- the quadrilateral forum of cooperation between India, US, Australia and Japan-- was to tend it towards regularisation and, eventually, formalising of the group.“This relationship is much bigger than one political party,” Biegun said while responding to questions from reporters during a press call organised by the London Regional Media Hub of the US state department. Biegun, who was in India last week, told said he was confident that “regardless of the outcome of our elections, the future is quite bright for relations between the United States and these two very important …partners,” referring to India and Bangladesh. “One of the constants in US-India relations has been that every presidential administration here in the United States has left the relationship in even better shape than the one inherited from its predecessor.” Biegun’s remarks came in the middle of the US election in which the campaign of President Donald Trump has actively sought, with an eye on Indian American voters, to portray him as the better guide and guardian of the relationship than his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, should he get elected.There are an estimated 1.9 million registered Indian American voters and they have been wooed this time by both presidential campaigns like never before in anticipation of the crucial role they could play in closely contested battleground states that will determine the outcome.The Trump campaign released a video of clips from President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s joint appearance at the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston int September, 2019 and from “Namaste Trump” rally in Ahmedabad in February to convey proximity between the two leaders and countries.Members of the campaign and other Republicans have argued that the president’s silence on the change in the constitutional status of Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act reflected the administration’s support and close ties with the Modi government and India.The Biden campaign has pushed back, arguing that the relationship will be in better hands in a Biden administration, pointing to the former vice-president’s crucial role and support in the conclusion of the historic India-US nuclear deal.Biegun’s remarks on the future of the Quad reflected growing ambitions for the informal forum ahead of Australia participating for the first time in the multi-nation Malabar military exercises with India, the US and Japan.The US diplomat did not refer to the military exercises but said in response to a question about the chances of growing the body to include other countries, “I will say that it is our view that in the passage of time the Quad should become more regularised, and at some point, formalised as well as we really begin to understand what the parameters of this cooperation are and how we can regularise it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-ties-bright-regardless-of-who-wins-white-house-official/story-Nk3fy9l5INhSO7MggGlyGN.html
20-10-2020||World||Battered by Covid-19, London plots to recharge future||The celebrated 18th century writer Samuel Johnson once said that ‘when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life’, but he never had to contend with the effects of a Covid-19-like pandemic, which has sucked life out of the vibrant British capital. Central London looks and feels like a dead city: there is none of the buzz, crowds and the atmosphere that millions of tourists and residents have long associated it with. Except for coffee shops, few businesses are open, with traffic lights regulating virtually non-existing traffic.The desolate picture is a result of the pandemic, but another spectre looms in the form of Brexit, which will be formalised on December 31, posing a multi-billion-pound question mark on London’s status as a hub of global finance, trade and business, without a deal with the EU.The City of London Corporation, the governing body of the financial district of City, on Tuesday presented a manifesto to recharge the capital beyond the effects of Covid-19, keen to rebuild it into a vibrant, thriving and open capital that it is globally known for.London hosts European or global headquarters of 40% of Fortune 250 companies; has four universities in the global top 40; is home to 3 million residents born overseas; speaks over 250 languages; has nearly 1,000 art galleries and museums; with one-thirds of its space green, including several sylvan parks.The corporation’s report, ‘London Recharged: Our Vision for London in 2025’, sets out several recommendations to reinvent itself and maintain its position as a global business hub, including simplifying visa and immigration procedures for skilled workers.It calls for investment in skills, digital infrastructure and built environment to ensure that London remains the global centre of choice, and also explores how London’s office stock and built environment can be transformed in response to trends such as increased remote and flexible working imposed by the pandemic.William Russell, the 692nd Lord Mayor of the City of London, said: “The capital’s success throughout history has been a story of constant reinvention. It is more important than ever that London adapts quickly to today’s challenges so that it remains a place where people want to work, live and visit tomorrow”.“This report sets out detailed measures that can help the capital thrive and evolve as we get through the current pandemic. A vibrant London will help to drive our recovery forwards as we work with the rest of the UK.”Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the corporation, added: “London is today facing major challenges. Coronavirus, the UK’s exit from the European Union and increasing protectionism across the globe are all threats to the capital’s role as an international business hub.”“Implementing these recommendations will underpin the capital’s competitiveness by supporting innovation, improving sustainability and offering greater opportunities to our diverse population”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battered-by-covid-19-london-plots-to-recharge-future/story-Dn566S4SLZ4dYdaKbQZSFJ.html
20-10-2020||World||China warns India on trading with Taiwan, slams US-Tibet govt-in-exile meeting||India should remain committed to the one-China principle and deal with Taiwan prudently, Beijing warned on Tuesday following a media report that New Delhi could open trade talks with Taiwan, which the mainland considers a breakaway region.The Chinese foreign ministry also slammed a meeting of the newly appointed US officer for Tibetan affairs with the head of Tibet’s government-in-exile.“There is only ‘One-China’ in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. One-China principle is a universal consensus of the international community, including India,” ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular briefing.Zhao was reacting to a Bloomberg report which indicated that India could begin trade talks with Taiwan.“It (one-China principle) is also the political basis for China to develop ties with other countries. So, we firmly oppose any official exchanges between countries having diplomatic ties with China and Taiwan or signing any official documents,” Zhao added.“The Indian side should remain committed to one-China principle and approach Taiwan-related issues prudently and properly.” Tensions between China and Taiwan has risen recently over the issue of reunification – summarily rejected by the current Taiwanese dispensation led by President Tsai Ing-wen.Beijing has aggressively reacted to developing ties between Taiwan and foreign countries including India.Earlier this month, the Chinese embassy in New Delhi issued guidelines for the Indian media’s coverage of Taiwan’s national day, observed on October 10, saying all countries having diplomatic ties with Beijing should “firmly honour their commitment to the One-China policy”.The Chinese embassy sent out a letter referring to the “so-called forthcoming ‘National Day of Taiwan’”, and saying it “would like to remind our media friends that there is only one China in the world, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China”.“Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory...All countries that have diplomatic relations with China should firmly honour their commitment to the One-China policy, which is also the long-standing official position of the Indian government,” the letter said.In February 2017, China had lodged a complaint with India on the rare visit of a Taiwanese parliamentary delegation, warning New Delhi to follow the “one-China” policy and to not have any official contact with Taipei.In 2015 September, before she became the first woman President of Taiwan, Tsai had spoken about the increasing importance of India in Taiwan’s foreign policy.“Asean and India are poised to become two of the world’s largest economic bodies. Strengthening our overall relations is a natural choice for Taiwan as we diversify our economic and trade ties. In the future, we will form a new task force to actively pursue this policy objective,” Tsai had said in her 29th DPP anniversary speech in September.‘Tibet affairs are purely China’s internal affairs’Spokesperson Zhao also reacted angrily to reports about the meeting between the head of the Tibetan administration in exile, Lobsang Sangey with the newly appointed US special coordinator for Tibetan issues, Robert Destro. Zhao said Tibet’s affairs are purely China’s internal affairs. “No external forces shall interfere in them. Appointing the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is a political move to interfere in China’s internal affairs and sabotage Xizang’s (Tibet’s) stability. It is China’s consistent position we firmly oppose that, and we will not acknowledge that.”“We have lodged stern representation to the US side. The so-called Tibetan government in exile is a separatist political organisation chasing a wild dream of Tibetan independence. It violates China’s constitution and law, and it is not recognised by any nation worldwide,” Zhao added.Calling Sangay an “out and out anti-China separatist”, Zhao said that China firmly opposes him engaging in anti-China separatist activities in whatever status and whatever pretext in any country. “We firmly oppose officials of other countries having any kind of contact with him.”“Destro, by meeting with this person violated the commitment and policy stance of US side of not supporting Xizang’s independence and not acknowledging this government in exile. This will send very wrong signal to Xizang’s independence forces.”“We urge the US side to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs and sabotaging Xizang’s development and stability and refrain from offering any support to the separatist forces. China will take all measures to safeguard its own interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-india-on-trading-with-taiwan-slams-us-tibet-govt-in-exile-meeting/story-jL99zvVjI8rmEZrPSnhnqM.html
20-10-2020||World||New UK ‘challenge’ trial to fast-forward Covid-19 vaccine||Healthy young volunteers aged 18 to 30 years in the UK are to be inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine candidate and then exposed to the virus in a controlled environment to expedite the eventual development of a safe and tested vaccine for the entire population.The Boris Johnson government on Tuesday said that only a vaccine candidate that has proved safe in initial trials (such as the one at the University of Oxford) will be given to some 90 volunteers for the so-called ‘human challenge’ trial.Medics and scientists will closely monitor the effect on the volunteers 24 hours to see exactly how the vaccine works and to identify any side effects. The ‘human challenge’ method of trial has long been used, including in colonial India to develop the vaccine for smallpox.The trial is due to begin in January 2021, with results expected by May, officials said, adding that such human challenge studies have been performed safely and have played important roles in accelerating the development of treatments for diseases including malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus and flu.Deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said: “A safe, fully approved, and meticulously controlled human challenge model for Covid-19 that is conducted by experienced experts may help in the search for safe and effective vaccines.”“First, for the many vaccines still in the mid-stages of development, human challenge studies may help pick out the most promising ones to take forward into larger Phase III trials.“Second, for vaccines which are in the late stages of development and already proven to be safe and effective through Phase III studies, human challenge studies could help us further understand if the vaccines prevent transmission as well as preventing illness,” he added.The first stage of the project will be delivered by a partnership between Imperial College London, the Royal Free Hospital’s specialist and secure research unit in London and industry-leading clinical company hVIVO, which officials said has pioneered viral human challenge models.The aim will be to discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to cause a person to develop Covid-19 infection. This is known as a virus characterisation study. Volunteers will be monitored for up to a year after participating in the study to ensure their long-term well-being.Once this first phase is completed, researchers will deploy the human challenge model which officials said will provide an “unrivalled opportunity” to study closely how vaccines work in the body to stop Covid -19.Meanwhile, Patrick Vallance, chief scientific officer, told a parliamentary committee that a vaccine against coronavirus will not eradicate the disease or be widely available before the spring, amidst some reports that it could be available after Christmas. Before Covid-19, it took at least five years to develop a vaccine from scratch, with an average time of 10 years, but new vaccine technologies had helped to shrink that timeframe, he said.Stressing that a number of vaccines had been shown to trigger antibodies, Vallance said there was still a long way to go before a vaccine was widely available, adding that it was unlikely it would be rolled out for use in the community before spring 2021.According to him, Covid-19 was unlikely to be completely stamped out: “It is likely that this disease will circulate and be endemic…Clearly as management becomes better, as you get vaccination which would decrease the chance of infection and the severity of the disease … this then starts to look more like annual flu than anything else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-challenge-trial-to-fast-forward-covid-19-vaccine/story-tm8fJMoj1p6lmkbUQE1y0O.html
20-10-2020||World||China ‘takes note’ of Australia joining Malabar naval drills||China on Tuesday said it has “taken note” of India’s announcement that Australia will join the annual Malabar naval exercises along with the US and Japan, underlining that military cooperation should be “conducive” to regional peace and stability.India on Monday announced that Australia will join the upcoming Malabar exercise which effectively means that all the four-member countries of the ‘Quad’ or Quadrilateral coalition will be participating in the mega drill.The US and Japan are the other countries that participate in the annual exercise, which is likely to take place next month in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.Commenting on the announcement, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that China has “taken note of this development.” “We always believe that military cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace and stability,” he said in a brief reaction. India’s decision to heed to Australia’s request to be part of the mega naval drill comes in the midst of growing strain in ties with China over the border row in eastern Ladakh.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent participant in the exercise in 2015. This annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in joining the exercise.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takes-note-of-australia-joining-malabar-naval-drills/story-QqHmQDCAHLKQYKyY1DrgAP.html
20-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Stage set for third presidential debate between Trump and Biden||The third and final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden will be conducted on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. The debate will be moderated by NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker.The first presidential debate was conducted on September 29 after which President Trump was criticised for interrupting Biden several times. The second debate was supposed to be held on October 15 but was called off as Trump refused to take part in the same. As Trump tested positive for coronavirus, the Commission on Presidential Debates had decided that the second debate would be conducted virtually but the Trump campaign refused to participate in the debate and Trump called the idea of a virtual debate “a waste of time”.The Commission on Presidential Debates has also come up with new rules for the third and final debate. The 90-minute debate will be divided into 15-minute segments. At the start of each new topic, each candidate will have two minutes of uninterrupted time during which the opponent’s microphone will be off. The rest of the time will be for open discussion for remarks by both the candidates on each other’s statements during which the microphones of both the candidates will not be muted. As has been done before, the moderator will ensure that roughly equal amounts of time are given to both the speakers over the course of 90 minutes.The debate is crucial for both Trump and Biden as even though Biden has a significant lead in the national polls, the gap between him and Trump is reducing in the battleground states. As the coronavirus pandemic has changed the campaigning style for the candidates, debates have become even more significant than ever. Both the campaigns have agreed to the two-minute uninterrupted rule for the debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-stage-set-for-third-presidential-debate-between-trump-and-biden/story-8Id9XB5ISrlT8ZFJwCnZXJ.html
20-10-2020||World||How Trump plowed through USD 1 billion, losing cash advantage||President Donald Trump’s sprawling political operation has raised well over USD 1 billion since he took the White House in 2017 — and set a lot of it on fire.Trump bought a USD 10 million Super Bowl ad when he didn’t yet have a challenger. He tapped his political organisation to cover exorbitant legal fees related to his impeachment. Aides made flashy displays of their newfound wealth — including a fleet of luxury vehicles purchased by Brad Parscale, his former campaign manager. Meanwhile, a web of limited liability companies hid more than USD 310 million in spending from disclosure, records show. Now, just two weeks out from the election, some campaign aides privately acknowledge they are facing difficult spending decisions at a time when Democratic nominee Joe Biden has flooded the airwaves with advertising. That has put Trump in the position of needing to do more of his signature rallies as a substitute during the coronavirus pandemic while relying on an unproven theory that he can turn out supporters who are infrequent voters at historic levels. “They spent their money on unnecessary overhead, lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous activity by the campaign staff and vanity ads way too early,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican consultant who advised John McCain and Jeb Bush and is an outspoken Trump critic. “You could literally have 10 monkeys with flamethrowers go after the money, and they wouldn’t have burned through it as stupidly.” For Trump, it’s a familiar, if not welcome, position. In 2016, he was vastly outraised by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but still pulled off a come-from-behind win. This time around, though, he was betting on a massive cash advantage to negatively define Biden and to defend his own record. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien insisted money was no issue. “We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016,” he told reporters Monday. Biden, Stepien added, was “putting it all on TV,” as he eschewed most door-knocking because of the pandemic, while Trump has roughly 2,000 field staffers across the country knocking on doors and making calls for his campaign. “Where we have states that are sort of tipping, could go either way,” Trump told campaign staffers Monday, “I have an ability to go to those states and rally. Biden has no ability. I go to a rally, we have 25,000 people. He goes to a rally, and he has four people.” The campaign and the Republican National Committee will offer a glimpse of their financial situation Tuesday when they file mandatory monthly campaign finance reports. Advertising spending figures, however, offer a bleak picture. While a half-dozen pro-Trump outside groups are coming to the president’s aid, Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to dump USD 142 million into ads in the closing days of the campaign, outspending Republicans by more than 2-to-1, according to data from the ad tracking firm CMAG/Kantar. On Monday, the firm Medium Buying reported Trump was cancelling ad buys in Wisconsin; Minnesota, which Trump had hoped to flip; and Ohio, which went for Trump in 2016 but now appears to be a tight contest. It’s a reversal from May, when Biden’s campaign was strapped for cash and Parscale ominously compared the Trump campaign to a “Death Star” that was about to “start pressing FIRE for the first time.” The ad campaign they unrolled over the next three months cost over USD 176 million but did little to dent Biden’s lead in public opinion polling. Trump is now in a position that’s virtually unthinkable for an incumbent president, said Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks advertising spending. “Advertising obviously isn’t everything. But we do think ads matter for a couple percentage points in a presidential race. And it’s just not a good sign for the Trump campaign,” Ridout said. A review of expenditures by Trump’s campaign, as well as the Republican National Committee, lays bare some of the profligate spending. Since 2017, more than $39 million has been paid to firms controlled by Parscale, who was ousted as campaign manager over the summer. An additional USD 273.2 million was paid to American Made Media Consultants, a Delaware limited liability company, whose owners are not publicly disclosed. Campaigns typically reveal in mandatory disclosures who their primary vendors are. But by routing money to Parscale’s firms, as well as American Made Media Consultants, Trump satisfied the basic disclosure requirements without detailing the ultimate recipients. Other questionable expenditures by Trump and the RNC that are included in campaign finance disclosures: — Nearly $100,000 spent on copies of Donald Trump Jr.’s book “Triggered,” which helped propel it to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-trump-plowed-through-usd-1-billion-losing-cash-advantage/story-Y0wrJ1nhOQ4afepyXKyOyK.html
20-10-2020||World||Bolivian elections 2020: What it means for Evo Morales and Latin America?||Bolivia’s socialist candidate Luis Arce is set to win the country’s presidential election as indicated by an unofficial rapid count of the votes of the election held on October 18. According to the count, Arce has 52.4 per cent of valid votes and his centrist rival Carlos Mesa has 31.5 per cent. This would bring the left-wing party of Evo Morales back into power. So what does this election mean for Bolivia and for Morales?Background to the electionThe chaotic October 2019 election led to the resignation and exile of left- wing president Evo Morales who came into power in 2006 and governed the nation since then. On November 12, 2019, conservative Senator Jeanine Anez took over as interim president and promised the country that a re-run of the October 2019 elections would be conducted. The elections were initially set to be conducted on May 3, 2020 and then on September 6, 2020 but due to the coronavirus pandemic they were postponed and conducted on October 18, 2020.Eva Morales in this electionMorales has been an iconic figure not only in Bolivia but in Latin America as he is part of the wave of leftist presidents of the region. But this will be the first time since 2002 that Morales has not fought the election himself as he is in exile in Argentina after the 2019 polls. He has supported Luis Arce unequivocally through media interviews and social media campaigns. If Morales’ Movement Towards Socialism (Mas) party’s presidential pick Arce wins the election, it would ensure Morales’ return to Bolivia.How is the world looking at the elections in Bolivia?A victory for Morales’ party Mas and his imminent return would be welcomed by left wing presidents of Cuba, Venenzuela and Nicaragua who have been long term allies of Bolivia. However, the election is being dimly viewed by the US as Morales has been a lifelong critic of US’ “imperialism”.As official results are awaited, if no candidate succeeds in obtaining more than 50 per cent of the votes or 40 per cent votes with a 10-point lead over the nearest challenger, a run-off between the two top contenders will be held on November 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolivian-elections-2020-what-it-means-for-evo-morales-and-latin-america/story-SvhgLdPhCF5dXdbibCi4UN.html

Harris, whose mother was from India and father from Jamaica, scripted history in August when she was picked by the Democratic Party as its vice presidential nominee. She is the first Black woman and the first Asian-American woman to be selected as the vice presidential nominee of a major political party in the US. “Rain or shine, democracy waits for no one,” Harris, 55, said in a tweet along with a picture of herself dancing in the rain with an umbrella over her as supporters cheer her along in Jacksonville, Florida. Rain or shine, democracy waits for no one. pic.twitter.com/DMimsHbmWO On Monday, Harris resumed her election campaign, which she had paused for a few days after two of her staffers tested positive with Covid-19. On Monday, she campaigned in Orlando and Jacksonville. “Kamala Harris is dancing in Florida rain,” tweeted news portal The Recount with a 15-second video. By mid-night, it had received nearly a million impressions. “Twitter Can’t Get Enough of Kamala Harris Dancing in the Rain,” said news site InStyle.Com. “Harris wore her go-to campaign footwear, Converse Chuck Taylors, and seemed unbothered by the shower,” it said. “When we vote, we win,” Harris told carloads of people who covered a rain-soaked parking area behind a University of North Florida conference center. In her remarks, Harris stressed on Florida’s importance for the national presidential race and said the state’s voters “are very likely going to decide” the contest. Earlier she stopped at the Jacksonville Public Library’s Highlands branch to greet people casting early ballots there. “I’m so excited to be back in Florida for early voting,” she told reports, as she headed towards people leaving the library. “It is so important,” she told people who had just cast ballots. “Thank you for voting early,” she said. “Sometimes you just got to dance! And with that, thank you Jacksonville!” her spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-wins-nearly-million-impressions-with-her-florida-rain-tweet/story-kOUSMMb669Zvm184Jcz4LP.html
20-10-2020||World||From HCQ to remdesivir, the treatment options for Covid-19||What are the treatment options for Covid-19?There are several, and which one is best depends on how sick someone is.For example, steroids such as dexamethasone can lower the risk of dying for severely ill patients. But they may do the opposite for those who are only mildly ill.In the United States, no treatments are specifically approved for Covid-19, but a few have been authorized for emergency use and several more are being considered. A panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health updates guidelines as new studies come out.Here’s what’s advised for various patients:-- Not hospitalized or hospitalized but not needing extra oxygen: No specific drugs recommended, and a warning against using steroids.-- Hospitalized and needing extra oxygen but not a breathing machine: The antiviral drug remdesivir, given through an IV, and in some cases also a steroid.-- Hospitalized and on a breathing machine: Remdesivir and a steroid.What about convalescent plasma, an infusion of blood from a Covid-19 survivor that contains antibodies that fight the virus?

But they have prompted anger from the Palestinians.Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, described Tuesday’s UAE visit as “shameful”.Speaking in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, he said it came amid Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank.“The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and arrogance,” he said.In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group Hamas, said: “Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands,” he added.The five-hour visit would be restricted to the airport near Tel Aviv, due to coronavirus concerns, Israeli organisers said.“This is an historical moment for the UAE country and Israel and we are looking forward to salaam (peace) ... in the region,” one of the Etihad pilots could be heard saying in a video posted on Twitter by US Middle East envoy Ari Berkowitz.Berkowitz and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are accompanying the Emirati delegation, which is being led by Economy Minister Abdullah bin Touq al-Mari and Minister of State for Financial Affairs Obaid Humaid al-Tayer, according to a UAE foreign ministry spokeswoman.The US officials had on Sunday joined an Israeli delegation to Bahrain for a signing ceremony to formalise ties.Israel and the UAE have already signed several commercial deals since mid-August, when they first announced they would establish full relations.Israeli officials said the two sides were expected to sign a mutual visa-exemption agreement - Israel’s first with an Arab country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-delegation-us-officials-visit-israel-palestinean-concerns-unheeded/story-PrpsCZ4y7bwuNI6KQSqggP.html
20-10-2020||World||Pak fails to prevent forced conversions of religious minorities: Parliamentary committee||A parliamentary committee in Pakistan has said that the country has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect religious minorities from forced conversions, according to a media report on Tuesday.The parliamentary committee on forced religious conversions headed by Senator Anwarul Haq Kakar recently visited parts of Sindh where forced conversions of young Hindu girls have been reported.During a media interaction on Monday, Kakar said that “the state has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect religious minorities from forced conversions”, The Dawn News reported.He, however, noted that most of the cases of conversions “have some degree of willingness”. Replying to a question, Kakar said there are several definitions of forced conversion, and the subject was debated by the committee at length.“Although conversion to seek a better lifestyle is also considered forced conversion, economic reasons can be considered exploitation and not force, as eventually it is after consent,” he said, adding that there is a thin line between consent and exploitation. Kakar said people who “encourage girls from the Hindu community to move out and marry according to their own wishes are not as liberal about their own daughters”. The worst part of the situation, he said, was that the family’s “pain and shame” were not taken into consideration. “If we all start taking the families into confidence and devise a mechanism to console them, the cases of forced conversions will decline,” he said.Kakar suggested introducing a new marriage rule that includes the mandatory presence of a ‘vali’ (guardian) at the time of wedding and the establishment of shelters managed by the district administration to house underage girls who wanted to get married, in order to clear the confusion between force and consent.According to the report, the most vulnerable districts for forced conversions are Sanghar, Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur and Mirpurkhas. There have been negligible reported cases from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while a few cases involving Christians have been reported in Punjab.Civil society activist Krishan Sharma said there are two kinds of forced conversions, the first involving kidnapping and illegal confinement, and a second kind.“The second kind is rampant in Sindh and that has to be taken care of by the state - this is procedural forced conversions, [in which] the whole system of the country, from the police, the courts, etc, are violating the laws and facilitating such conversions,” the report quoted Sharma as saying. “When the parents present a certificate that the age of the girl is below 18 years, the police usually do not attach this document in the FIR, but we have women protection laws in the country and we need to implement them. Besides that, Pakistan is signatory to several international obligations,” he said.Sharma said there has to be a law stating that the minimum age for religious conversion is 18, which is also the marriageable age in Sindh. “The courts too should take note of marriages of girls below the age of 18 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-fails-to-prevent-forced-conversions-of-religious-minorities-parliamentary-committee/story-I0gbQ08ZoKLoYK2VZ0XjuL.html
20-10-2020||World||FATF plenary meeting: What next for Pakistan?||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will begin a three-day virtual plenary meeting on Wednesday that will decide on the next course of action against Pakistan with regard to steps taken by the country to crack down on fund-raising by terror groups. Pakistan’s case: The multilateral watchdog, which counters money laundering and terror financing, put Pakistan on its list of “jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or “grey list” in 2018 for not doing enough to curb financial activities of terror groups. The grey list now has 18 countries, ranging from Iceland to Mauritius and Panama, and most of these nations have been cited for lax money laundering regimes and none face as serious charges related to terror financing as Pakistan. After a plenary meeting in February, FATF warned Pakistan that all deadlines set for implementing an action plan against terror financing had expired, and that the country had largely addressed only 14 of 27 action items in the plan. According to a more recent assessment, Pakistan is understood to have largely addressed about 20 action items. However, FATF’s regional affiliate Asia-Pacific Group (APG) concluded last month that Pakistan has fully complied with only two out of 40 recommendations to curb money laundering and terror financing. The abuse of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and registered charities by groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was cited by APG in its latest report as a “significant threat”, and the group retained Pakistan in its “enhanced follow-up” category. Terror financing: Combating terror financing has been a priority for FATF since 2001. FATF plays a key role in global efforts to fight terror financing by setting global standards, assisting countries to implement financial provisions of the United Nations Security Council resolutions on terror, and evaluating their ability to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute the financing of terrorism. FATF carries out assessments throughout the year of countries on the grey list, though this work has been curtailed in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of its work in Pakistan has been focused on getting the government to introduce laws to enforce UN sanctions, improve coordination between different government organisations and law enforcement agencies, and prosecution of terrorists involved in fund-raising. Though Pakistan has arrested LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and a handful of other terrorist leaders and successfully prosecuted several of them – Saeed was given a prison term of five-and-a-half years in February – there have been other developments that have been criticised by Western nations. For instance, Pakistani authorities have removed some 3,800 names from a terror watch list this year. Pakistan has also enacted some 10 new laws for freezing and seizing the assets of terror groups and to impose fines and prison terms for terror financing but FATF has said enforcement and prosecution needs to improve further. What’s next: Pakistan is widely expected to remain in the grey list, with very little chance of it being included in FATF’s list of “high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action” or “black list” – which currently has only two countries, North Korea and Iran – for a variety of reasons. Some Western countries are reluctant to push for stiffer action against Pakistan at a time when it is perceived as crucial for the troubled peace process in Afghanistan, while the backing of just three of FATF’s 39 members is adequate to keep it out of the black list. Pakistan has China in its corner and its leadership has reached out to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey for support. What remains to be seen is how much leeway FATF will give to Pakistan to deliver on the action plan against terror financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatf-plenary-meeting-what-next-for-pakistan/story-syKRYz5UWwlgx48O6LZw6I.html
20-10-2020||World||UK to start controversial ‘challenge’ vaccine study, will infect healthy volunteers with virus for research trial||UK researchers are preparing to begin a controversial experiment that will infect healthy volunteers with coronavirus to study the disease in hopes of speeding up the development of a vaccine.The approach, called a challenge study, is risky but proponents say it may produce results faster than standard research, which waits to see if volunteers who have been given an experimental treatment get sick. The government is preparing to invest 33.6 million pounds ($43.4 million) in the study.Imperial College London said Tuesday that the study, involving healthy volunteers between 18 and 30, would be conducted in partnership with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and hVivo, a company that has experience conducting testing .“Deliberately infecting volunteers with a known human pathogen is never undertaken lightly,’‘ said Peter Openshaw, co-investigator on the study. “However, such studies are enormously informative about a disease, even one so well studied as Covid-19. ‘’In the first phase of the study, researchers will aim to determine the smallest level of exposure needed to cause the disease. Researchers will then use the same challenge model to study how potential vaccines work in the body, the body’s immune response and potential treatments.Vaccine Taskforce chair Kate Bingham said the research will improve our understanding of the virus and will help in making decisions about research.“There is much we can learn in terms of immunity, the length of vaccine protection, and reinfection,’‘ she said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-start-controversial-challenge-vaccine-study-will-infect-healthy-volunteers-with-virus-for-research-trial/story-Amb5J1kxIo92aHQ50ebEmL.html
20-10-2020||World||UK lab joins network to compare Covid-19 vaccine candidates||A second British laboratory is joining a global lab network to assess data from potential coronavirus vaccines, set up by a major non-profit health emergencies group to establish the effectiveness of different vaccine candidates. Earlier this month, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) set up the network, allowing scientists and drugmakers to compare vaccines and speed up selection of the most effective shots.Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said on Tuesday the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) was joining the scheme, and had received funding from CEPI to develop an international standard for the Covid-19 antibody.That means the NIBSC will produce a sample of antibody with a defined amount of biological activity that can be used by regulators and vaccine makers to calibrate their tests.“This is an important initiative providing a service to vaccine developers globally and permits accurate evaluation of candidate vaccines for this pandemic,” Dr Mark Page, who is leading the work at NIBSC, said.Public Health England is also involved in the CEPI scheme.Hundreds of potential coronavirus vaccines are in various stages of development around the world, with shots developed in Russia and China already being deployed before full efficacy trials have been done, and front-runners from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca likely to have final-stage trial results before year-end.CEPI itself is co-funding nine of the vaccines in development, including candidates from Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and CureVac.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lab-joins-network-to-compare-covid-19-vaccine-candidates/story-4il2zWUhX3CwZkx0u2i7IP.html
20-10-2020||World||India considers trade talks with Taiwan as both spar with China||Support is growing within India’s government to formally start talks on a trade deal with Taiwan as both democracies see relations with China deteriorate.Taiwan has sought trade talks with India for several years, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been reluctant to move ahead because it would involve a messy fight with China once any pact is registered at the World Trade Organization, according to a senior Indian government official who asked not be named, citing rules for speaking with the media.Yet over the past few months the hawks in India who want to start trade talks are getting the upper hand, the official said. A trade deal with Taiwan would help India’s goal of seeking greater investments in technology and electronics, the official said, adding that it’s unclear when a final decision would be made on whether to start talks.Earlier this month, Modi’s government gave approval to firms including Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. as he looks to attract investment worth more than 10.5 trillion rupees ($143 billion) for smartphone production over five years.Indian Commerce Ministry spokesman Yogesh Baweja didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Taiwan’s top trade negotiator, John Deng, didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Any formal talks with India would amount to a big win for Taiwan, which has struggled to begin trade negotiations with most major economies due to pressure from China. Like most countries, India doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan, with the two governments maintaining unofficial diplomatic missions in the form of “representative offices.”India and Taiwan in 2018 signed an updated bilateral investment agreement in a bid to further expand economic ties. Trade between them grew 18% to $7.2 billion in 2019, according to India’s Department of Commerce.‘Country’ SpatPresident Tsai Ing-wen’s administration has raised its profile in India in recent weeks after China issued a statement telling Indian media outlets not to refer to Taiwan as a country when reporting on its Oct. 10 National Day celebrations. Twitter users in India lambasted China and its ambassador to New Delhi, Sun Weidong, while heaping praise on Taiwan and making the hashtag #TaiwanNationalDay go viral.Indian public sentiment toward China has fallen in the wake of deadly border clashes between the two neighbors starting in May. Modi’s government has since banned dozens of Chinese apps including TikTok, while also speaking with Japan, Australia and the U.S. about creating alternative supply chains to diversify away from China in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. India has seen more than 7.5 million infections and 115,000 deaths from Covid-19.China’s Insistence That Taiwan Isn’t a Country Starts BackfiringThat displeasure with China, as well as Taiwan’s successful handling of the pandemic, is translating into a soft power opportunity for Tsai. Taiwan’s 24 million have seen fewer than 600 infections and only seven deaths.“We have to think about the way for democracies, for like-minded countries, to work further together,” Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu said during an interview last week on the television network India Today. “We have traditional good relations with the United States, with Japan, and we want to develop closer ties with India as well.”Tsai, who was voted into a second term in a January landslide, has sought to capitalize on the wave of interest in Taiwan among Indians online. On October 11, she thanked Indian Twitter users who had sent national day greetings. Two days later she went viral again, posting photos of her visiting the Taj Mahal.On October 15, Tsai tweeted a photo of Indian food accompanied by a cup of masala chai, which some Twitter users saw as a possible reference to the so-called Milk Tea Alliance that has united activists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and elsewhere against Chinese nationalism. All three tweets received more than 40,000 likes each and thousands of friendly messages from Indian accounts.China’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as its territory despite having never ruled it, has pushed back against the Tsai administration’s overtures to India.“We urge relevant Indian media to adhere to the correct position with regard to the significant core interests of China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ji Rong, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in New Delhi, said in a statement on Friday. Indian media, Ji continued, “should not provide ‘Taiwan independence’ forces a platform, so as to avoid sending the wrong message.”Sana Hashmi, a fellow at Taipei-based National Chengchi University and author of “China’s Approach Towards Territorial Disputes: Lessons and Prospects,” said it makes sense for India to align with Taiwan economically.“Increasingly there seems to be an awareness not just among Indians but even in other nations about how China has dictated relationships in the region,” said Hashmi, who has penned op-eds in Taiwanese and Indian media encouraging closer ties between the two democracies. “And it’s not like China is going to give any concessions to India or Taiwan for toeing its line.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-considers-trade-talks-with-taiwan-as-both-spar-with-china/story-YKh61mYdcL2ZPEWlPnetcI.html
20-10-2020||World||Why Beijing may want to keep Trump in the White House||Donald Trump has frustrated and enraged China during a tumultuous first term, but Beijing may welcome his re-election as it scans the horizon for the decline of its superpower rival.Relations are as icy as at any time since formal ties were established four decades ago, with China warning it does not want to be drawn into a new “Cold War” with the United States.Under his ‘America First’ banner, Trump has portrayed China as the greatest threat to the United States and global democracy.He has launched a massive trade war that has cost China billions of dollars, harangued Chinese tech firms and lay all the blame for the pandemic with Beijing.But another Trump triumph in November may have its advantages for China as President Xi Jinping seeks to cement his nation’s rise as a global superpower.China’s leadership could be handed “the opportunity to boost its global standing as a champion for globalisation, multilateralism, and international cooperation,” said Zhu Zhiqun, professor of political and international relations, Bucknell University.Trump has pulled America from a sprawling Asia-Pacific commercial deal and climate agreements, imposed billions of dollars of tariffs on Chinese goods, and withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization at the height of a global pandemic.Where the US has retreated, Xi has stepped forward.He has presented his country as the champion of free trade and a leader in the fight against climate change, as well as vowed to share any potential Covid-19 vaccine with poorer nations.“A second Trump term could give China more time to rise as a great power on the world stage,” Zhu said. Philippe Le Corre, a China expert at the Harvard Kennedy School in the United States, agreed an extension of Trump’s ‘America First’ policies would be of long-term benefit for Beijing.“(It) partially cuts Washington off from its traditional allies,” he added, and that gave China room to manouevre. China’s nationalists have openly cheered, or jeered, for Trump.“You can make America eccentric and thus hateful for the world,” Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a chest-beating nationalist paper, warned in a Tweet directed at the US president. “You help promote unity in China.” Trump is also lampooned on China’s heavily censored social media as ‘Jianguo’, meaning “help to build China”. - Biden trouble -Trump has undoubtedly inflicted economic and political pain on China.“China has lost out enormously in its plan for trade and technology,” said Beijing-based political analyst Hua Po.In January the US and China signed a deal bringing a partial truce in their trade war that obliged Beijing to import an additional $200 billion in American products over two years, ranging from cars to machinery and oil to farm products.Washington has also turned its guns on Chinese tech firms it says poses security threats, throwing the future US operations of video-sharing app TikTok -- owned by Chinese parent company Bytedance -- into uncertainty.Mobile giant Huawei is also on Trump’s hitlist.The enmity also extends into defence and human rights, with Taiwan, Hong Kong and the treatment of China’s Muslim Uighur minority all making waves in US. But China may not win much relief in any of these areas if Trump loses to Democratic challenger Joe Biden.Beijing worries that Biden is likely to renew American leadership on human rights, pressing China on issues of the Uighurs, Tibet and freedom in Hong Kong.“Biden is likely to be tougher than Trump on human rights issues in Xinjiang and Tibet,” said Zhu, of Bucknell University.And on tech and trade -- crucial flash points in the US-China rivalry -- it is unclear just how much room a Biden White House would have to manoeuvre. “Biden will inherit the tariffs, and I’m doubtful he would lift them unilaterally,” said Bonnie Glaser, Director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“Beijing will probably have to concede to other US demands if it wants the tariffs lifted.”China will also have to come up with convincing arguments on data security if it is to avoid more damaging bans on its tech firms.Washington sees Huawei -- the global leader on 5G internet -- as a serious security threat.“Politically, it will be almost impossible for Biden to reverse these policies,” Fallon said. “Huawei has been on the US radar as a security threat even before the Trump presidency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-beijing-may-want-to-keep-trump-in-the-white-house/story-m7E5zXlEZbgvXfVNfzV5hK.html

In recent years, Beijing has increasingly provided financing and construction for critical infrastructure in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, alarming traditional regional power India.Last week, an Indian government source said Pompeo was also set to visit New Delhi this month, along with Defense Secretary Mark Esper, for talks with Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-to-visit-sri-lanka-and-maldives-to-check-chinese-influence/story-Cj7WTH1M9z8XgM4huz9VoI.html
20-10-2020||World||Lawsuit challenges Trump administration’s new H-1B visa rules||Several individuals and organisations, including the US Chambers of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s recent rules related to the H-1B visa, terming them “arbitrary” and “haphazard” regulations that will undermine high skilled immigration into America. Early this month, the Trump administration announced new restrictions on H-1B non-immigrant visa programme which it said is aimed at protecting American workers, restoring integrity and to better guarantee that H-1B petitions are approved only for qualified beneficiaries and petitioners, a move which is likely to affect thousands of Indian IT professionals. The interim final rule announced by the Department of Homeland Security will narrow the definition of “speciality occupation” as Congress intended by closing the overbroad definition that allowed companies to game the system. It will also require companies to make “real” offers to “real employees,” by closing loopholes and preventing the displacement of the American workers. And finally, the new rules would enhance the department’s ability to enforce compliance through worksite inspections and monitor compliance before, during and after an H1-B petition is approved. The lawsuit filed by the US Chambers of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and several other organisations in the Northern District of Columbia on Monday alleges that “harmful and haphazard rules on H-1B visas” if left in place, would affect hundreds of thousands of American-based workers and disrupt manufacturers’ ability to hire and retain critical high-skilled talent. “The rules being implemented by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor undermine high-skilled immigration in the US and a company’s ability to retain and recruit the very best talent,” said US Chamber CEO Thomas J Donohue. If these rules are allowed to stand, they will devastate companies across various industries, he said. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. It is most sought-after among Indian IT professionals. “We need high-skilled innovators now more than ever, and the administration’s attempt to rush these rules forward without properly considering their impact on thousands of people on the front lines of developing vaccines and treatments and making critical supplies, as well as saving lives in our hospitals, could have devastating consequences at a critical moment in our history,” said NAM senior vice president and general counsel Linda Kelly. Rewriting laws through a “dark-of-night-style” rulemaking leads to dangerous policy outcomes, and this pair of interim final rules is an illegal attempt to dismantle legal immigration by rendering the H-1B visa programme unworkable for hundreds of thousands of American-based workers who are essential to the recovery and renewal of the industry and the economy, Kelly said. Seventeen individuals and organisations, including universities and businesses, in their lawsuit, have challenged the US Department of Labour’s recent rule on wages related to H-1B visas. The lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday alleged that the poorly-drafted and improperly-issued rule did not comply with the procedural rules for rule-making and is substantively “arbitrary”, incorrect and irrational. “The increase to the prevailing wages will manifestly not benefit US economic growth or any workers; study after study has shown that H-1B visa holders create American jobs,” said Jesse Bless, director of federal litigation at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). The regulation has caused immediate and unnecessary harm in every corner of the economy, including academic institutions, non-profits, hospitals, start-ups and small businesses, he said. Early this month, the Department of Labour published a rule to appropriately identify wage levels for H-1B holders and other foreign labour programmes. The rule will limit an employer’s ability to replace workers with cheap foreign labour and help ensure wages are not suppressed by the presence of low-cost foreign workers, the White House argued. Among those who have filed the lawsuit are Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Denver, Chapman University, Bard College, International Institute of New England, Information Technology Industry Council, Arizona State University, Scripps College, Northern Arizona University, Indiana University, Study Mississippi, Dentists for America, Physicians for American Healthcare and Hodges Bonded Warehouse. Jeff Joseph, Senior Partner of Joseph and Hall, in a statement alleged that dealing with the Department of Labour often feels like “The Hunger Games”. “Everyone is required to play the game, but no one knows the rules and the rules are constantly changing. This is not a game. The fact that the rule was made effective without thinking about the destructive impact it would have on industries and the economy illustrates how out of touch this administration is regarding the symbiotic relationship between legal immigration and the economy,” he said. The days when the federal government blatantly ignores the law in its rule-making are over, said Charles Kuck, managing partner of Kuck Baxter Immigration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawsuit-challenges-trump-administration-s-new-h-1b-visa-rules/story-qHXcNhtE4fYO2bXdV46FtI.html

Donald Trump Jr and Guilfoyle have taken up the mantle to campaign in the battleground states. In the week gone by and this week, Trump Jr, 42, has more than 30 campaign events, in addition to his multiple appearances on national television channels and local media. Similarly, Guilfoyle, who is in-charge of fund-raising in her capacity as National Chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, has been joining Trump Jr in the rallies. The Palm Coast Observer, a Florida-based newspaper, this week, reported that Trump Jr’s election rally was attended by more than 2,000 people, a large number considering the present coronavirus risks.Also Read| Trump-Biden debate: Candidates’ mics to be muted at the start of each segment Trump Jr has defended his father’s policies and attacked the Democratic candidates on two core issues -- the Joe Biden family’s links to China and allegations of corruption. His arguments have been well received. “Donald Trump Jr. fires up Kernersville crowd,” North Carolina’s News and Record newspaper headlined on the Republican event in Kernersville on Monday. Trump Jr, who is presently campaigning in North Carolina, has scheduled multiple campaign stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this week. “The president’s son got one of his loudest cheers when he talked about Trump’s success in brokering peace deals in the Middle East,” said Mukesh Modi, a Indian-American community leader and one of the organisers of a meet-and-greet event in Long Island, New York.Also Read | US Election 2020: ‘2021 will be greatest economic year in US history,’ predicts Trump Modi recalled one of Trump Jr’s go-to tagline’s on the president, “He continues to deliver.” At the same event, Modi, who is also co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, described Guilfoyle as someone who runs the most successful fund-raising machine juggernaut in the history of presidential elections.

20-10-2020||World||UNICEF prepares for Covid-19 vaccinations, to stockpile half a bn syringes by end of 2020||UNICEF said it will stockpile 520 million syringes in its warehouses, as part of a larger plan of one billion hypodermic needles by 2021, to guarantee initial supply and help ensure that syringes are available in countries before the Covid-19 vaccines arrives.“As the world awaits a Covid-19 vaccine, UNICEF has begun laying the groundwork for the rapid, safe and efficient delivery of the eventual vaccine by purchasing and pre-positioning syringes and other necessary equipment,” the UN agency said on Monday.The agency said as soon as Covid-19 vaccines successfully emerge from trials and are licensed and recommended for use, the world will need as many syringes as doses of vaccine. To begin preparations, this year, UNICEF will stockpile 520 million syringes in its warehouses, part of a larger plan of one billion syringes by 2021, to guarantee initial supply and help ensure that syringes arrive in countries before the Covid-19 vaccines, it said.During 2021, assuming there are enough doses of Covid-19 vaccines, UNICEF anticipates delivering over one billion syringes to support Covid-19 vaccination efforts on top of the 620 million syringes that it will purchase for other vaccination programmes against other diseases such as measles, typhoid and more.“Vaccinating the world against Covid-19 will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.“In order to move fast later, we must move fast now. By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively. That’s enough syringes to wrap around the world one and a half times,” Fore said. In line with the longstanding collaboration between the two partners, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will reimburse the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the procurement of the syringes and safety boxes, which shall then be used for the Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) and for other Gavi-funded immunisation programmes if necessary.Besides syringes, UNICEF is also buying 5 million safety boxes so that used syringes and needles can be disposed of in a safe manner by personnel at health facilities, thus preventing the risk of needle stick injuries and blood borne diseases. Every safety box carries 100 syringes. Accordingly, UNICEF is “bundling” the syringes with safety boxes to ensure enough safety boxes are available to go along with the syringes.UNICEF said injection equipment such as syringes and safety boxes have a shelf life of five years. Lead-times for such equipment are also long as these items are bulky and need to be transported by sea freight. Vaccines, which are heat sensitive, are normally transported more quickly by air freight. In addition to saving time, early purchase of syringes and safety boxes also reduces pressure on the market and pre-empts potential early spikes in demand when vaccines do become available.As the key procurement coordinator for Gavi, UNICEF is already the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, procuring more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. Every year, UNICEF provides vaccines for almost half of the world’s children and procures and supplies around 600-800 million syringes for regular immunisation programmes. Covid-19 vaccines will likely treble or quadruple that number, depending on the number of Covid-19 vaccines that are ultimately produced and secured by the UNICEF.“Over two decades, Gavi has helped an additional 822 million children from the world’s most vulnerable countries access critical, life-saving vaccines,” CEO of Gavi Seth Berkley said. “This would not have been possible without our partnership with UNICEF, and it is this same collaboration that will be essential to Gavi’s work with the COVAX Facility.” To make sure that vaccines are transported and stored at the right temperature, the UNICEF, along with WHO, is also mapping out existing cold chain equipment and storage capacity – in the private as well as public sector – and preparing necessary guidance for countries to receive vaccines.“We are doing everything we can to deliver these essential supplies efficiently, effectively and at the right temperature, as we already do so well all over the world,” Fore said.Even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, with support from Gavi and in partnership with WHO, UNICEF has been upgrading the existing cold chain equipment across health facilities in countries to ensure that vaccines remain safe and effective throughout their journey. Since 2017, over 40,000 cold-chain fridges, including solar fridges, have been installed across health facilities, mostly in Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-prepares-for-covid-19-vaccinations-to-stockpile-half-a-bn-syringes-by-end-of-2020/story-e9D9MqLCUup7lGrYlOfMXP.html
20-10-2020||World||Thai Cabinet approves parliament session to discuss protests||Thailand’s cabinet backed a proposal from lawmakers to convene a special session of the parliament to discuss anti-government protests that have swept the nation’s capital and other major cities in the past week.The house will meet for two days from Oct. 26, Anucha Nakasai, minister for Prime Minister’s Office, told reporters after a cabinet meeting in Bangkok Tuesday. The proposal needs to be endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn.Thai lawmakers on Monday sought an early parliament meeting to discuss ways to end the protest movement calling for the ouster of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha’s government, a rewriting of the constitution and reform of the monarchy. Thousands of protesters rallied in Bangkok for a sixth straight day on Monday, defying a ban on gatherings and the threat of crackdowns by the police.The protests have weighed on the country’s stocks and currency as concerns mount a prolonged standoff may erode company earnings and delay an economic recovery. The benchmark stock index, the worst performer in Asia this year, was headed for a fifth straight day of losses, while the baht fell 0.2% to 31.259 to a dollar, extending losses this year to 4.2%.On Tuesday, Prayuth ordered police to reconsider censorship of media outlets, a day after police said they would probe four news outlets that may have violated the emergency rules imposed in Bangkok last week.“Our job is to protect the country and eliminate ill-intentioned actions aimed at creating chaos and conflict in the country,” Prayuth told reporters after the cabinet meeting.The protesters have vowed to carry on the demonstrations until all their demands are met. The organizers said there would be a “surprise” for the government if authorities failed to release all detained protesters and lift the emergency rules by 6 p.m. local time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-cabinet-approves-parliament-session-to-discuss-protests/story-rHqd2WWuExysOKp8Ev00jP.html

Taiwan says the Chinese diplomats were trying to take pictures of a Taiwan national day event at a hotel to see who was there, and that in the altercation that followed people from both sides were injured.Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said Taiwan was a “peace-loving country” that invited people to events around the world for its Oct. 10 national day, which marks the founding of the Republic of China, Taiwan’s official name.“Going forward we will continue to hold national day receptions,” she said. “This will not change.”China can spread as many lies as it likes but Taiwan shouldn’t pay too much attention, Ou said.“The reality is this year we had 108 offices hold national day events in different ways, inviting the world to celebrate our birthday.”Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said the world needed to see what China was capable of, saying what they did was a “barbaric act”. “China’s officials posted overseas are acting like hooligans; beating people is not acceptable. We sternly condemn this,” he told reporters. The issue was hard to deal with because the Chinese diplomats there have diplomatic immunity, Su added.“But we must appeal to the international community with the relevant evidence.”Fiji’s foreign ministry has yet to comment on the incident, though Ou said Fiji’s government had been trying to mediate to bring a close to the issue.

20-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: ‘2021 will be greatest economic year in US history,’ predicts Trump||US president Donald Trump has predicted that the American economy will soon recover from the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown and that the next year will be the greatest economic year in the country’s history.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage) Republican incumbent Trump faces a stiff challenge from the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, Joe Biden, in the November 3 elections. The handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic condition and racial tensions have emerged as the main poll topics. “Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, that’s what’s going to happen,” Trump said at an election rally in Arizona, a battleground state, on Monday. The coronavirus has claimed 220,119 lives with over 8.2 million confirmed infections in the US. The pandemic has also resulted in one of the greatest recessions and job losses in the country’s history. Of the 22 million jobs that were lost in early spring, 11 million jobs have been recovered. The budget deficit is at an all-time high of USD 3.1 trillion. Acknowledging that the country was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus, Trump promised his supporters that the country will soon get back to normal life. “That’s what we want, just a normal. Just seven months ago (is where) we want to get back (to) and we will be better than that very soon, we build a foundation that (is) so strong and you see what’s happening, (the) stock market (is going) through the roof,” he said. “We saved millions of lives by doing what we did and we built it (the economy) back up and it’s a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare,” Trump said as he continued with his criticism of Biden and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris. “That’s what it is. Biden will postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, and shut down our country and we are opening and we are opening rapidly and we’ve got a V (victory) shape. It may be a super V. It looks like it’s a super V which nobody ever even heard of before,” he said. The president alleged that a Biden administration would massively raise taxes. “You will be buried in regulations. You know we cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved, we have it down to one year and you know what from two to one very shortly to be exact,” he asserted. The Biden administration, he said, will bring all of those regulations back. “They want to dismantle your police departments,” he said. Trump alleged that Harris is a left liberal. “Biden even chose as his running mate the most liberal senator in America. Senator Kamala Harris is a sponsor of the socialist Green New Deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans,” he said. The Green New Deal is a Congressional resolution which aims to tackle factors contributing to global warming. “Harris also urged her supporters to donate to a fund that build out the rioters, the ones that knocked out your towns, your cities, not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas,” Trump alleged, referring to the race protests after George Floyd’s death in police custody. “Joe Biden is a servant of the left-wing globalists and lobbyists, the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, they (Democrats) raise a lot of money. You know why? Because they make deals. They make deals,” he alleged. Trump said, if he wants, he can raise money for his campaign pretty soon and with ease. “I would be the greatest fundraiser in history if I wanted to call Wall Street. I know them all. ‘I want USD 10 million for my campaign.’ - ‘Yes, sir.’ All I have to say is I want USD 10 million, I want USD 15 million, I want USD 25 million. I would set every record,” he said. “In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as president, who is finally putting America first. About time. It’s about time. It’s about time. Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. And you know what? You knew that, a lot of people knew it for a long time,” he said. “And as far as I’m concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. And that’s what it is. It’s a criminal enterprise,” Trump said alleging that the mainstream media and the Big tech companies were trying to hide the entire corruption.

Panama’s government meanwhile continues to petition the international community to remove it from several tax haven blacklists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arrest-warrants-issued-for-founders-of-panama-papers-firm-report/story-9QH2w7h5WLNtonS3mHYkAK.html
20-10-2020||World||Pakistan lifts ban on TikTok after the Chinese app promises to moderate content||Pakistan’s telecom regulator on Monday announced that it was lifting a ban on popular video-sharing app TikTok. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that the decision was taken after TikTok’s management assured the PTA that it will block all accounts “involved in spreading obscenity and immorality” in the country.The Pakistan telecom body’s decision has come more than a week after it had blocked the Chinese video-sharing platform over “immoral and indecent” content.ByteDance-owned TikTok later said in a statement that it was pleased to see the app unblocked for users in Pakistan. “We appreciate the PTA’s commitment to ongoing productive dialogue and recognise their care for the digital experience of Pakistani users,” it said.The move was widely welcomed in Pakistan where a number of people have turned into stars overnight because of the content they produced and the followers they amassed. Pakistan is TikTok’s 12th largest market and analysts say the popularity of the app grew phenomenally in the country this year during the lengthy coronavirus-related lockdown. The video-sharing app has been downloaded nearly 43 million times in Pakistan, including 14.7 million this year alone, according to data from research firm SensorTower.Amid TikTok’s growing popularity across Pakistan, there have been complaints over some of the content that is shared on the platform. The company’s transparency report shows that it has taken down nearly 6.5 million videos between January and June - the third highest for any country after India and the US.The report also shows that the Pakistani government had reported 40 accounts to TikTok over content it didn’t agree with, but only two of those accounts were removed or restricted by the app.Pakistan closely monitors online content and has put in place regulation that asks digital platforms to remove content that the government finds objectionable. In September, the government said it blocked access to the dating apps Tinder, Tagged, Skout, Grindr and SayHi for what it called “immoral and indecent content”. The government had also blocked YouTube from 2012 to 2016 reportedly over blasphemous content that hadn’t been removed by the platform at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-lifts-ban-on-tiktok-after-the-chinese-app-promises-to-moderate-content/story-wYAnsktgpFYhlsDIcAjiTN.html

20-10-2020||World||‘Running Angry’: Trump attacks Dr. Fauci, press and polls||An angry President Donald Trump came out swinging Monday against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the press and polls that show him trailing Democrat Joe Biden in key battleground states in a disjointed closing message two weeks out from Election Day.On the third day of a western campaign swing, Trump was facing intense pressure to turn around his campaign, hoping for the type of last-minute surge that gave him a come-from-behind victory four years ago. But his inconsistent message, another rise in virus cases and his attacks on experts like Fauci could undermine his final efforts to appeal to voters outside his most loyal base.“I’m not running scared,” Trump told reporters before taking off for Tucson, Arizona, for his fifth rally in three days. “I think I’m running angry. I’m running happy and I’m running very content ‘cause I’ve done a great job.”His aggressive travel comes as Trump plays defense in states he won four years ago, though the president insisted he was confident as he executed a packed schedule despite the pandemic.“We’re going to win,” he told campaign staff on a morning conference call from Las Vegas. He went on to acknowledge that he “wouldn’t have told you that maybe two or three weeks ago,” referring to the days when he was hospitalized with Covid-19. But he said he felt better now than at any point in 2016. “We’re in the best shape we’ve ever been,” he said.Seeking to shore up the morale of his staff amid growing private concerns that he is running out of time to make up lost ground, Trump blasted his government’s own scientific experts as too negative, even as his handling of the pandemic that has killed nearly 220,000 Americans remains a central issue to voters.“People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” Trump said of the government’s top infectious disease expert. “Every time he goes on television, there’s always a bomb. But there’s a bigger bomb if you fire him. But Fauci’s a disaster.”At a rally in Prescott, Arizona, Trump assailed Biden for pledging to heed the advice of scientific experts, saying dismissively that his rival “wants to listen to Dr. Fauci.”The doctor is both respected and popular, and Trump’s rejection of scientific advice on the pandemic has already drawn bipartisan condemnation.At his rally, Trump also ramped up his attacks on the news media, singling out NBC’s Kristen Welker, the moderator of the next presidential debate, as well as CNN for aggressively covering a pandemic that is now infecting tens of thousands of Americans every day.Fauci, in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, said he was not surprised that Trump contracted the virus after he held a series of large events with few face coverings.“I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,” Fauci said of the president.Biden was off the campaign trail Monday, but his campaign praised Fauci and criticized Trump for “reckless and negligent leadership” that “threatens to put more lives at risk.”“Trump’s closing message in the final days of the 2020 race is to publicly mock Joe Biden for trusting science and to call Dr. Fauci, the leading public health official on Covid-19, a ‘disaster’ and other public health officials ‘idiots,’“ the campaign said.Monday’s professed confidence in victory stood in contrast to some of Trump’s other public comments in recent days reflecting on the prospect that he could lose.“Could you imagine if I lose my whole life? What am I going to do?” he asked a rally crowd last week in Macon, Georgia. “I’m not going to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country. I don’t know.”Biden, meanwhile, was in Delaware for several days of preparation ahead of Thursday’s final presidential debate. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, returned to the campaign trail after several days in Washington after a close adviser tested positive for the coronavirus.Late Monday, the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced that Trump and Biden will each have his microphone cut off in Thursday’s debate while his rival delivers his opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics.The rule changes come three weeks after a chaotic opening faceoff between the two presidential contenders that featured frequent interruptions — most often by Trump. The open discussion portion of the debate will not feature a mute button, but interruptions by either candidate will count toward their time.The commission has faced pressure from the Trump campaign to avoid changing the rules, while Biden’s team was hoping for a more ordered debate. In a statement, the commission said it “had determined that it is appropriate to adopt measures intended to promote adherence to agreed upon rules and inappropriate to make changes to those rules.”Trump’s campaign said he would participate in the debate despite his concerns about the new rule.“I just think it’s very unfair,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from Arizona. “I will participate but it’s very unfair that they changed the topics and it’s very unfair that again, we have an anchor who’s totally biased.”In addition to public polling that indicates Biden has an edge, the former vice president enjoys another considerable advantage: money.Over the past four months, Biden has raised over $1 billion, a massive amount of money that has significantly eclipsed Trump’s once-overwhelming cash advantage.That’s become apparent in advertising, where Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to spend twice as much as Trump and the Republicans in the closing days of the race, according to data from the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.“We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016,” said Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, who insisted Trump has the advantage with the campaign’s field staff and data targeting.Though Trump has pulled back from advertising in Midwestern states that secured his 2016 win, he’s invested heavily elsewhere, including North Carolina, where he is on pace to slightly outspend Biden.Concerns about a possible loss to Biden that have been spilling into the open in recent days have been percolating behind the scenes at the Trump campaign. Trump himself has alternated between disbelief and anger at the idea that he could lose to a candidate whom he views as washed up and incompetent, according to three campaign and White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.Trump has directed anger at press coverage but also has vented about his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, whom he blames for mishandling his hospitalization for the virus and Covid relief talks.He has asked some of his closest advisers if a campaign shakeup was needed, according to the officials. The president was encouraged to hold off on any moves so close to Election Day.Meanwhile, aides have started privately wondering whether or not Trump’s campaign rallies, which have helped define American politics for the last five years, were in their final days.In recent weeks, meanwhile, some White House staff offices have also tried to rotate in aides who have never flown on Air Force One or have done so infrequently so they can do so before Election Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/running-angry-trump-attacks-dr-fauci-press-and-polls/story-5mzaCzr4w2yfhIraPZhGdO.html
20-10-2020||World||Justin Trudeau’s party counters opposition’s WE probe move with snap poll threat||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party has pitched the possibility of calling snap polls if the opposition goes ahead with an attempt to form a parliamentary body to examine potential corruption and conflict of interest related to the grant of a billion-dollar project to a charity with links to the PM and his family.The opposition’s motion seeking to form a 15-member committee is expected later this week. However, Trudeau’s party has warned that if the motion is passed, it could lead to early elections. Pablo Rodriguez, leader of the government in the House of Commons, made this point in a letter to the leaders of the opposition parties, saying, “If passed, the proposal will raise serious questions about whether the House of Commons continues to have confidence in the government.” Instead, he proposed to form a 12-member committee with a “the mandate to conduct hearings to examine and review all aspects of the government’s spending in response to the pandemic”. Unlike the committee proposed by the opposition, this one would have an equal number of Liberal Party members, even though the government has a minority status in the House.Gérard Deltell, leader of the opposition Conservative Party in the House, criticised the government’s stance. He told the daily National Post, “To threaten to plunge the country into a general election while Canada is in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic, all because you want to avoid some tough questions, is simply reckless and irresponsible.”The latest confrontation is over the opposition seeking to investigate the project related to student volunteerism granted during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic to WE Charity. It later emerged that Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother had been paid thousands of Canadian dollars for appearances at events conducted by the organisation. Trudeau later apologised for not recusing himself when the cabinet cleared the proposal. The grant was scrapped after the controversy erupted. The Canadian PM also made an appearance before a parliamentary committee on this issue and is being investigated by the country’s conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. The ruling party, meanwhile, is also against the opposition’s demand seeking details of fees paid to Trudeau’s family. In his letter, Rodriguez said, “We will continue to oppose efforts by the opposition to force private citizens, including the extended family of politicians, to divulge personal financial information. This demand goes too far.”Canada, meanwhile, is seeing a peak in new coronavirus cases, though with a lower number of fatalities. Rodriguez, however, used the argument of the renewed challenge to combat the virus to counter the opposition’s demand for the formation of a special committee. He said in Ottawa, “When you’re asking the government to concentrate all their efforts on what is requested by this committee instead of fighting the pandemic, or instead of being there for Canadian households, we think that it’s extremely irresponsible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-s-party-counters-opposition-s-we-probe-move-with-snap-poll-threat/story-ux9VVfoHKTG5frBpgQGNbI.html
20-10-2020||World||Moderna CEO expects Covid-19 vaccine interim results in November: Report||Moderna Inc Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel expects interim results from its Covid-19 vaccine trial in November and that the US government could give an emergency use nod in December, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.Speaking at the newspaper’s annual Tech Live conference, Bancel also said sufficient interim results from the study takes longer to get and that the government’s permission to use the vaccine may not come until next year.The first interim analysis of the vaccine’s efficacy will happen when 53 people in the entire study get symptomatic Covid-19, the report said.“That first analysis is likely to occur in November, but it’s hard to predict exactly which week because it depends on the cases, the number of people getting sick,” the report quoted Bancel as saying.Bancel had told Financial Times last month that Moderna would not be ready to apply for emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine before Nov. 25 at the earliest.Bancel also highlighted that a ramping up of production is a challenge. “If one ingredient is missing, we cannot make the vaccine,” as per the Journal’s report.Moderna is on track to produce 20 million doses of its experimental vaccine by the end of the year, the company had said last month, adding that 25,296 participants had enrolled out of a planned 30,000 in its late-stage study.Drugmakers are racing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, with more than 150 potential vaccines being developed and tested globally.Besides Moderna, Pfizer Inc, and AstraZeneca Plc , among others, are front-runners to develop the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/moderna-ceo-expects-covid-19-vaccine-interim-results-in-november-report/story-ZAksSIygPTuAZitOjgWUSN.html
20-10-2020||World||Trump-Biden debate: Candidates’ mics to be muted at the start of each segment||New rules have been announced for the final presidential debate between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden that will see the opponent’s microphone muted during the initial comments of every segment in order to allow the candidates uninterrupted speaking time.The decision was announced by the US commission on presidential debates. The in-person face-off is scheduled for Friday morning, India time, at Belmont University in Nashville.At the debate, Trump and Biden will get two minutes each to answer, without interruptions, the opening question of each of the six 15-minute segments. “The only candidate whose microphone will be open during these two-minute periods is the candidate who has the floor under the rules,” the commission said. Both the microphones, however, will remain open for follow-up questions or exchanges between them.The opening presidential debate had devolved into a shouting match. Trump and Biden had repeatedly interrupted each other and talked over each other. The second scheduled debate was cancelled after Trump pulled out when it was turned into a virtual event forced by the US president’s Covid-19 illness.Now recovered, Trump has appeared eager to take on Biden and will seek to change the course of the race that has seen him trailing by double digits in some polls.On Monday, the US president opened up a new line of attack against Biden, accusing the Democrat of listening to Dr Anthony Fauci, the top American epidemiologist, suggesting that it wasn’t the right thing to do. “You know, Biden wants to lock it down,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Prescott, Arizona, referring to the debate on the need for more curbs to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump added, seeking to mock Biden, “He wants to listen to Dr Fauci. He wants to listen to Dr Fauci.”Biden, who has been calling for the Trump administration to listen to Dr Fauci, welcomed the charge with a one-word tweet: “…yes”.Dr Fauci, when asked to respond to Trump’s earlier charge that he was a “disaster”, cited the 1972 crime film, The Godfather, to say “Nothing personal, strictly business” – in a reference to actor Al Pacino in the protagonist Michael Corleone’s role arguing to volunteer to kill two men who tried to kill his father.Failing to stop the spread of Covid-19, which has killed more than 218,000 Americans and infection more than 8 million, and frustrated by the shadow it has cast on his re-election chances, the American president has indiscriminately attacked all his targets. He has questioned the science behind mitigation measures, argued that face masks are not as effective as they are said to be, and has attacked public health officials who have refused to toe his line.During a conference call with his campaign staff earlier on Monday, Trump had said, “People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people - these people that have gotten it wrong. Fauci is a nice guy, he’s been here for 500 years; he called every one of them wrong. Fauci is a disaster. I mean, this guy, if I listened to him, we would have 500,000 deaths.”Trump was ticked off reportedly at a Sunday interview in which Dr Fauci had said that he was not surprised when the US president contracted the disease because of a super-spreader event that the White house had hosted recently to announce Trump’s pick for a Supreme Court judge.Trump’s handling of the pandemic is a key issue in the 2020 White House race with 57.5% of Americans disapproving of it, according to the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls – one of the reasons why he trails Biden in national polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-debate-candidates-mics-to-be-muted-at-the-start-of-each-segment/story-wg6yIkuntPB20Mcq2hnHPP.html
20-10-2020||World||Argentina passes 1 million cases as coronavirus hits Latin America||At the edge of Argentina in a city known as “The End of the World,” many thought they might be spared from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.Sitting far from the South American nation’s bustling capital, health workers in Ushuaia were initially able to contain a small outbreak among foreigners hoping to catch boats to the Antarctic at the start of the crisis.But as Argentina passed 1 million virus cases Monday, it is now smaller cities like Ushuaia that are seeing some of the most notable upticks. Doctors have had to quadruple the number of beds for Covid-19 patients over the last month. At least 60% of those tested recently are coming back positive for the virus.“We were the example of the country,” said Dr. Carlos Guglielmi, director of the Ushuaia Regional Hospital. “Evidently someone arrived with the coronavirus.”Across Latin America, three other nations are expected to reach the 1 million case milestone in the coming weeks — Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The grim mark comes as Latin America continues to register some of the world’s highest daily case counts. And though some nations have seen important declines, overall there has been little relief, with cases dropping in one municipality only to escalate in another.The trajectory is showing that the pandemic is likely to leave no corner of Latin America unscathed.“The second wave is arriving without ever having finished the first,” said Dr. Luis Jorge Hernández, a public health professor at the University of the Andes in Colombia.Argentina has seen cases spiral despite instituting one of the world’s longest lockdowns. Colombia’s major cities have seen a dip, but smaller areas like the department of Caldas in the coffee region are only now reaching a peak. Peru’s overall numbers have dropped, but officials recently reported 12 regions are spiking back up. Mexico, likewise, has seen a rise in a quarter of all states over the last week.The result is that rather than a second virus wave like that being seen in Europe, epidemiologists anticipate a more sustained, plateau-like trend.“Our countries are still getting out of the first wave,” said Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of the Pan American Health Organization’s Department of Communicable Diseases. “A great part of the population remains exposed and community transmission continues.”The virus’ cruel path through Latin America is a consequence of weak public health systems, social factors like poverty and poor government decisions early on that resulted in flawed or limited testing and little contact tracing. Today the region is home to half the 10 countries with the highest total cases around the globe.Argentina initially registered low virus case numbers but now has one of the highest rates of new daily infections per capita, according to Our World in Data, a non-profit online scientific publication based at the University of Oxford. It is on par with several European countries that are experiencing a resurgence of the virus.Dr. Adolfo Rubinstein, a former Argentine health minister, said the nation depended too heavily on lockdowns as its primary means of controlling the virus, failing to purchase enough tests in the initial months of the pandemic.Where the virus is appearing is also shifting. Initially, up to 90% of the confirmed cases were in metropolitan Buenos Aires. Today, 65% of Argentina’s cases are in its provinces and even faraway places like Ushuaia, authorities said.“Now it is everywhere in the country,” Rubinstein said.Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, director of the Americas branch of the World Health Organization, warned recently that the coronavirus is appearing in places that were previously not affected, with high numbers popping up in regions like the English-speaking Caribbean.“In many countries, the pandemic has also moved to less populated areas,” she said.That can be seen not just in Argentina but in Colombia as well. The city of Manizales in a region known for its coffee farms now registers 440.98 cases per 100,000 residents, far higher than the nationwide average of 284.09 per 100,000, according to the Ministry of Health. Officials say the slower rise in cases allowed them to expand ICU capacity.“Here we didn’t have a peak like in Europe,” Hernández said. “We had a plateau.”Throughout the region, testing remains a hurdle. In Peru, officials have relied heavily on antibody tests to identify cases — even though the tests are not designed to make a diagnosis because they can only detect proteins that develop a week or more after infection. Argentina’s testing is still far below that of neighboring countries; on Sunday, just 13,890 were tested, compared to 31,988 the same day in Colombia.The high percentage coming back positive in Argentina suggests the country is still likely missing vast numbers of infections.Brazil reached 1 million cases in June and now is up to 5.2 million for the pandemic.“These are huge undercounts of what is really going on in terms of numbers,” said Felicia Knaul, director of the Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas at the University of Miami. “We need more consistent mask use — but we have to couple that with testing and tracing — or else the numbers are going to rise tremendously.”In Ushuaia, officials believe truckers carrying in produce from the Buenos AIres region may be responsible for the rise in cases since mid-September. The city famous as a departure point for cruises to the Antarctic had been a model for the nation. Closed off air travel and a halt on tourism left it virus free for months.But that false sense of comfort may have led people to relax on basic pandemic norms like hand washing and social distancing. The Tierra del Fuego province, which has a population of about 150,000, now has over 8,000 confirmed cases.In Ushuaia, anxious residents line up in their cars for drive-thru testing. A sports center that had been empty is now set up to take care of patients. One month ago, the regional hospital was treating just seven Covid-19 patients; now it has 28, occupying all of its bed set aside for adults with the illness.“The failure in Argentina was the low amount of testing,” Guglielmi said.José Bongiovanni, a lawyer in Ushuaia, said a worry that seemed distant now feels close.“Living at the end of the world was never easy,” he said. “It’s a lot less easy in a moment like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentina-passes-1-million-cases-as-coronavirus-hits-latin-america/story-NQkCTDOQ1IrZq0K7buHpmM.html
20-10-2020||World||H-1B lawsuit filed against US Department of Labour||Seventeen individuals and organisations, including universities and businesses, have filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Labour challenging its recent Interim Final Rule on wages related to H-1B visas.The lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday alleged that the poorly-drafted and improperly-issued rule did not comply with the procedural rules for rule-making and is substantively arbitrary, incorrect and irrational. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. It is most sought-after among Indian IT professionals.“The increase to the prevailing wages will manifestly not benefit US economic growth or any workers; study after study has shown that H-1B visa holders create American jobs,” Jesse Bless, director of federal litigation at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), claimed.The regulation, he said, has caused immediate and unnecessary harm in every corner of the economy, including academic institutions, non-profits, hospitals, start-ups and small businesses.“Frankly, the last thing we need during a (Covid-19) pandemic and economic turmoil is a rule based on a false and incorrect understanding of the market and American workforce. This will impede our economic recovery, not enhance it,” Bless said.Early this month, the Department of Labour published a rule to appropriately identify wage levels for H-1B holders and other foreign labour programmes, which according to the White House will improve the quality of H-1B workers and better reflect wages paid to similarly employed workers in the US.The rule will limit an employer’s ability to replace workers with cheap foreign labour and help ensure wages are not suppressed by the presence of low-cost foreign workers, the White House argued.Among those who have filed the lawsuit are Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Denver, Chapman University, Bard College, International Institute of New England, Information Technology Industry Council, Arizona State University, Scripps College, Northern Arizona University, Indiana University, Study Mississippi, Dentists for America, Physicians for American Healthcare and Hodges Bonded Warehouse.Jeff Joseph, Senior Partner of Joseph and Hall, in a statement alleged that dealing with the Department of Labour often feels like “The Hunger Games”.“Everyone is required to play the game, but no one knows the rules and the rules are constantly changing. This is not a game. The fact that the rule was made effective without thinking about the destructive impact it would have on industries and the economy illustrates how out of touch this administration is regarding the symbiotic relationship between legal immigration and the economy,” he said.The days when the federal government blatantly ignores the law in its rule-making are over, said Charles Kuck, managing partner of Kuck Baxter Immigration. US universities, employers, and healthcare systems can no longer stand by and watch while the US immigration system is dismantled by a nativist administration and in contravention of federal law, he said.Aside from the blatantly unlawful way, the Department of Labour dropped this rule on the economy, its basic premise is also wholly incorrect, alleged Greg Siskind, founding partner of Siskind Susser.“The workers impacted are in occupations with extraordinarily low unemployment. And as we show in the complaint, these outstanding immigrants are doing critical work benefiting everyday Americans, whether it is providing critical research to cure disease, making our country globally competitive, providing medical and dental care to rural Americans, or caring for our country’s senior citizens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h-1b-lawsuit-filed-against-us-department-of-labour/story-kQ92UMZYSftU4NYPobii0K.html

The five civilian porters from the Tagin tribe of Arunachal Pradesh had gone missing in early September.Ahead of their release in the second week of September, state-run nationalistic tabloid Global Times claimed in a report that the five were “spies” working for the Indian Army.The five had disguised themselves as “hunters”, the report said, quoting an anonymous source, adding that they were “India’s intelligence staff”.“They recently trespassed the China-India border and entered the Shannan prefecture of Tibet,” the report claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-soldier-went-missing-looking-for-yaks-hope-india-returns-him-soon-says-china/story-XFah5ImYMHYMTDrpCPyIPO.html
20-10-2020||World||China’s leisure spending remains drag on growth amid recovery||China’s hotels and restaurants, one of the hardest-hit sectors of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, remained a significant drag on growth in the third quarter even as the recovery gained momentum.Output in the sector fell 5.1% from a year ago, the statistics bureau said Tuesday in a supplemental report on gross domestic product. That was smaller than the 18% decline in the second quarter. For the first nine months of the year, the sector’s output was down 19.1% compared to the same period in 2019.Gross domestic product data released Monday showed consumption in China continued to improve in September as virus-related restrictions eased further and consumer confidence picked up. However, spending hasn’t returned to pre-Covid levels, with retail sales in the first nine months of the year down about 7% compared with the same period last year.China’s Third Quarter Gross Domestic Product: Details (Table)Leasing and commercial services was the worst performer last quarter, declining 6.9% from a year ago. The information technology sector continued to outperform, rising 18.8%.Growth in the construction sector remained solid, rising 8.1% in the quarter from a year ago, reflecting strong credit support from the government to boost infrastructure and a buoyant property market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-leisure-spending-remains-drag-on-growth-amid-recovery/story-ODQWd1phx3ZQBYf1MZGVCM.html

20-10-2020||World||Ireland imposes some of Europe’s toughest Covid-19 curbs||Ireland announced some of Europe’s toughest Covid-19 constraints on Monday, shutting non-essential retail, limiting restaurants and pubs to take away service and telling people not to travel more than five kilometres (3 miles) from their home.Ireland imposed one of Europe’s longest lockdowns during the first surge in coronavirus cases and eased restrictions at such a cautious pace that pubs that only serve drinks in Dublin had not reopened by the time a rise in infections prompted a tightening of curbs.This time, schools will stay open and essential services such as construction are allowed to continue, prime minister Micheal Martin said, as he moved the country to the highest level of restrictions, Level 5, for six weeks from midnight Wednesday. Hotels may remain open, but only if their rooms are needed by essential workers.“The evidence of a potentially grave situation arising in the weeks ahead is now too strong,” Martin said in a televised address, two weeks after rejecting what was then seen as a surprise call by health chiefs to move to Level 5, marking the first time ministers went against their advice.Martin said the government’s aim was to return to Level 3 by Dec. 1. That would allow all retailers to reopen and restaurants to serve 15 customers outdoors. Even then, another lockdown could not be ruled out in 2021, he added.“WE NEED A VACCINE”While countries struggling with high rates of infection like Belgium, the Netherlands and France have shut bars, restaurants and imposed a nighttime curfew, none have such strict travel restrictions within the country.Harder hit Northern Ireland last week shut schools for two weeks and restaurants for four, although most retailers remain open. In Wales, people have been asked to stay at home in a two-week “fire-break” lockdown announced on Monday.On Sunday, Ireland broke its single-day record for new for the fifth time in nine days, and has the 12th highest rate among the 31 countries monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. To cushion the blow, the government will increase the amount it contributes to coronavirus-related jobless payments and wage subsidies until Jan. 31. Last week’s budget, the biggest stimulus package in the history of the state, introduced much larger grants of up to 5,000 euros ($5,884.50) per week for shuttered or battered businesses. The supports will cost about 1.5 billion euros for six weeks, based on a forecast that around 150,000 people will be temporarily laid off on top of the 40,000 let go in the last two weeks, deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar said.The jobless rate, including those on the emergency payment, stood at 14.7% last month. The finance ministry forecast that the economy could contract again next year if there is a prolonged period of stringent restrictions.“We can do it this year, we can do it next year,” Martin said of financial support for the economy, adding, “We need a vaccine next year.”  (Writing by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Hugh Lawson and Bill Berkrot)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-imposes-some-of-europe-s-toughest-covid-19-curbs/story-35EXsDKVPSMkKrjfgsaYlM.html

Both microphones will be turned on to allow a back-and-forth after that time.Trump’s campaign objected to the change but said he would still take part.“President Trump is committed to debating Joe Biden regardless of last-minute rule changes from the biased commission in their latest attempt to provide advantage to their favored candidate,” campaign manager Bill Stepien said.The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest developments.The news came the day the number of Americans voting early ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3 crossed the 30 million mark and as Trump tries to reframe a contest in which national and state opinion polls show him trailing.Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden during a chaotic and ill-tempered debate on Sept. 29, and Biden responded with insults. Trump backed out of a second scheduled debate set for last Thursday over a disagreement about the virtual format following his COVID-19 infection. At that time, he raised concerns about having his microphone muted. “You sit behind a computer and do a debate - it’s ridiculous, and then they cut you off whenever they want,” Trump said in an Oct. 8 interview on Fox Business.On Monday, Trump’s campaign said it was unhappy with the announced set of topics for Thursday’s debate, arguing that it should focus more on foreign policy and complaining that the nonpartisan group was tilted toward Biden. Biden’s campaign said both sides previously agreed to let moderators choose the subjects. It said Trump wanted to avoid discussing his stewardship of the coronavirus pandemic, which surveys show is the top issue for voters.“As usual, the president is more concerned with the rules of a debate than he is getting a nation in crisis the help it needs,” Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-objects-mute-button-in-presidential-debate-but-confirms-participation/story-oMIfXDORFl0hj9D4rK5rbL.html
20-10-2020||World||Major 7.5 magnitude quake off Alaska triggers small tsunami waves||A major 7.5-magnitude quake off the coast of Alaska triggered small tsunami waves Monday, US agencies said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.Residents evacuated to higher ground as tsunami warnings covered much of the southern coast of the remote US state, including the thinly populated Alaska Peninsula, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Two-foot waves were recorded at the tiny nearby city of Sand Point, some 60 miles (100km) from the epicenter of the quake which struck at a depth of 25 miles (40 km).The at-risk zone extended hundreds of miles northeast to the entry of the Cook Inlet.But it stopped short of the state’s largest city of Anchorage, located some 600 miles (1,000 km) from the epicenter and at the end of that gulf.And the tsunami warning was downgraded to a less-severe advisory, with NOAA stating that affected areas “should not expect widespread inundation.”The earthquake itself was felt in the nearby Alaska Peninsula community of King Cove, but everything seemed to be intact, city administrator Gary Hennigh told the Anchorage Daily News. Cold Bay resident Michael Ashley said the quake was “a pretty good ride.”“All the couches, recliners and bookcases were moving around, and I had to pretty much hold one of them up,” he told the newspaper.There was “a low likelihood of casualties and damage” from the quake itself, the United States Geological Survey said.The major quake was followed by at least five aftershocks of 5.0-magnitude or higher.Monday’s quake came nearly three months after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck a close by region.Alaska is part of the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire.The US state was hit by a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in March 1964, the strongest ever recorded in North America.It devastated Anchorage and unleashed a tsunami that slammed the Gulf of Alaska, the US west coast, and Hawaii.More than 250 people were killed by the quake and the tsunami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-7-5-magnitude-quake-off-alaska-triggers-small-tsunami-waves/story-dqxABZX4Rbk5KVLZ2gd3xK.html
20-10-2020||World||10 residents dead amid Covid-19 outbreak at Kansas nursing home||A coronavirus outbreak has killed 10 residents in a nursing home in a northwestern Kansas county that proportionally already had the nation’s largest increase in cases over two weeks.The health department in Norton County reported Monday night that all 62 residents and an unspecified number of employees at the Andbe Home in Norton had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The agency also said one Andbe Home resident was hospitalized, while the remaining 51 were being treated at the home.“Steps are being taken to prevent any further outbreak, including quarantining residents in their rooms and not allowing outside visitors into the facility,” the county health department said in a statement Monday evening.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe outbreak at the nursing home came after the state Department of Health and Environment last week reported more than 100 cases at the state’s prison in Norton over the two weeks ending Wednesday.Kansas is seeing an average of more than 700 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases a day, its largest numbers since the pandemic reached the state in early March.But northwestern Kansas has been hit hard by coronavirus in recent weeks, and Norton County had the largest number of new cases per 100,000 residents of any county in the US for the two weeks ending Sunday, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.The Kansas health department said that cases in Norton County rose from 46 two weeks ago to 340 as of Monday in Norton County. With about 5,400 residents, that was an increase of 5,484 cases per 100,000 residents, according to the state’s figures.But the state released its report before Norton County officials confirmed that all Andbe Home residents had tested positive for coronavirus and before local officials reported 10 deaths at the home.The 15 counties in the state’s northwest corner together had 987 new coronavirus cases during the past two weeks, an increase of nearly 49%, to bring the total to 3,024, according to state health department data. With 80,000 people living in the region, the increase was 1,226 cases for every 100,000 residents, more than three times the state’s figure.Two other northwest Kansas counties, Sheridan and Gove, also were among the top 20 counties in the nation for the largest proportional increases in cases for the two weeks ending Sunday, based on Johns Hopkins data.Also Read: World struggles as Covid-19 infections cross 40 millionThe state health department reported Monday that Kansas had 2,113 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases since Friday, an increase of 3% that brought the pandemic total to 72,968. The department also reported 13 additional Covid-19-related deaths, bringing the total to 872 before the nursing home deaths in Norton were reported.Kansas had an average of 729 new cases a day for the seven days ending Monday after first exceeding 700 cases a day for the seven days ending Oct. 12. The record is 743 cases for the seven days ending Wednesday.The state on Monday also reported its first Covid-19-related staff death at one of its four hospitals for the mentally ill or the developmentally disabled.The Department for Aging and Disability Services, which oversees the hospitals, said an employee at the state’s mental hospital in Larned in southwestern Kansas died last week but said the staffer had not been on hospital grounds for several weeks. The department did not identify the staffer.In Olathe in the Kansas City area, a middle school classroom assistant died from Covid-19-related complications, KCTV reported. Mission Trail Middle School’s principal said in an email to parents that the staffer had been sick for several weeks and had not been in the building since Sept. 24.Meanwhile, Gov. Laura Kelly and Wichita State University officials celebrated the opening of a new laboratory that can run 32,000 coronavirus testing specimens a week. Kansas has averaged about 29,000 tests a week over the past month, according to data from the state health department.Kelly said the high-capacity lab will help the state identify coronavirus hot spots so that its residents can avoid them.“We can help provide certainty that our schools and our businesses can stay open safely,” Kelly said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-residents-dead-amid-covid-19-outbreak-at-kansas-nursing-home/story-H3pKhSfZgrw7vHpxXKDUrM.html

Additional strengthening was expected and Epsilon was forecast to be at or near hurricane strength by early Thursday, the US National Hurricane Center said.The storm was centered Monday afternoon about 730 miles (1,180 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda and was stationary. A slow northward motion is expected during the night, forecasters said, adding the storm was then expected to take a more northwestward track as it approaches Bermuda by Thursday.This year’s hurricane season has had so many storms that the Hurricane Center has turned to the Greek alphabet for storm names after running out of official names.Epsilon also represents a record for the earliest 26th named storm, beating out Nov. 22 in 2005, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-epsilon-strengthens-in-central-atlantic/story-HFYq9FDDjK59Wc3KscS9CJ.html

Baby Boomers held 21% of the wealth at the same age.The study suggested that the populist challenge to mainstream, “establishment” politics could actually help improve democratic engagement by shocking moderate parties and leaders into reversing the decay.The Cambridge Centre for the Future of Democracy delved into data from over 4.8 million respondents collected across 160 countries between 1973 and 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-study-shows-millennials-dissatisfied-with-democracy/story-YkmS3oGXXJK9Bilq7Id2JO.html
20-10-2020||World||France: Police crackdown after beheading of teacher||French police on Monday raided Islamic associations and foreigners suspected of extremist religious beliefs, police sources said, three days after a suspected Islamist beheaded a school teacher.History teacher Samuel Paty, 47, was murdered on Friday in broad daylight outside his school in a middle-class Paris suburb by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin, who was shot dead by police.The assassin sought to avenge his victim’s use of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of expression to 13-year-olds. Public figures called the killing an attack on French values. Interior minister Gerald Darmanin said there were some 80 investigations being conducted into online hate and that he was looking into whether to disband about 50 associations within the Muslim community.“Police operations have taken place and more will follow, concerning tens of individuals,” the minister told Europe 1.A police source said France was preparing to deport 213 foreigners who were on a government watch list and suspected of holding extreme religious beliefs, among whom about 150 are serving jail sentences. French authorities said they detained 11 people following the killing. Darmanin said they include the father of a student and an Islamist activist who along with the attacker “obviously launched a fatwa”, or religious ruling, against the teacher.A judicial source told Reuters the man known to the intelligence agencies was Moroccan-born Abdelhakim Sefriuoi. French President Emmanuel Macron held a defence council on Sunday at the Elysee presidential palace. The government will reinforce security at schools when classes resume on November 2, Macron’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-police-crackdown-after-beheading-of-teacher/story-BqlNR67QowMPdkcm97KP2I.html
20-10-2020||World||Pakistan police briefly detain Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law||Pakistani police on Monday briefly detained the son-in-law of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, allegedly forcing their way into his hotel room in Karachi, just hours after a massive rally was held in the port city by a joint opposition front that seeks the ouster of the Imran Khan government.“Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested” Muhammad Safdar Awan, said Maryam Nawaz, PML-N vice-president, who had addressed the rally on Sunday. She said she was asleep when the police “barged in” her hotel room where she was staying with her husband.She alleged that Karachi police were being used by “unknown but known forces” to suppress their voice, implying that the military had a hand in her husband’s arrest. Safar was freed later after a court granted him bail, his party and family said. The 11-party Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) claimed earlier that the provincial police chief of Sindh was kidnapped by paramilitary forces and made to register cases against him and 200 others, including Maryam Nawaz. Safdar on Sunday had visited the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan’s founder, and led a crowd in chanting, “Give respect to the vote.” That slogan was viewed as criticism of Pakistan’s military, which ruled the country directly or indirectly for much of its history. Also, chanting political slogans at Jinnah’s tomb is widely considered a taboo. Police say they arrested Safdar after receiving a complaint from a citizen.At Sunday’s rally, Maryam attacked Prime Minister Imran Khan. “When you are pressed for answers, you hide behind the armed forces. You coward! You bring the army into disrepute. You use them (the army) to hide your own failures. Who gave you this right?” she said. Maryam also responded to comments made by Khan a day earlier. “You tell people not to worry because there’s been only one rally. But you are already worried.” She asked him to not think about banning PML-N, asserting that it’s the country’s biggest political party. She was softer towards the military, saying the PDM was not against the army but only a few generals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-police-briefly-detain-nawaz-sharif-s-son-in-law/story-1uSlx5ii0pVUEttBvZ8USK.html

The actual worldwide tally is likely to be far higher as testing has been variable, many people have had no symptoms, and some governments have concealed the true number of cases.

20-10-2020||World||Trump lumps Fauci among ‘idiots’ but suggests he won’t fire him||Donald Trump complained to his campaign staff about the government’s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, including him among people he considers “idiots,” but said he couldn’t fire him because of public perception.“People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” Trump said Monday in a call intended to boost morale at a campaign running well behind his challenger, Joe Biden. Trump’s campaign invited reporters to listen in.“Anytime he goes on television” there’s a “bomb,” Trump told his staff, adding that if he fired Fauci it would be a “bigger bomb.”He claimed without substantiation that “if we listened to him” there would be 700,000 to 800,000 American deaths. More than 220,000 Americans have died so far from the coronavirus pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAfter disparaging Fauci, Trump remarked that he didn’t care whether reporters were on the call.Trump has previously said he accepted Fauci’s recommendations while fighting the pandemic. But Fauci is a strong proponent of public use of face masks, a precaution the president hasn’t followed himself and has discouraged among his staff.Trump’s Monday comments came after Fauci appeared on the CBS program “60 Minutes” and said he wasn’t surprised the president contracted Covid-19. “I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,” Fauci said.Fauci, who has been a regular presence on TV, said his media interviews had been limited by the White House. He said he wasn’t allowed to go on “many, many, many shows that have asked for me.”Trump tweeted on Monday that Fauci “seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope. All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions.” Trump also said Fauci “threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!” -- a reference to Fauci throwing the ceremonial first pitch of the 2020 Major League Baseball season.The president’s campaign has aired television ads that take remarks by Fauci out of context to suggest he’s complimented Trump’s response to the pandemic. Fauci has publicly objected, saying he’s always been publicly non-partisan, and he’s urged Trump’s campaign to pull the ad.Trump’s closest medical adviser is now Scott Atlas -- a neuroradiologist with no epidemiology expertise affiliated with the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University -- who came to the president’s attention with frequent appearances on Fox News.The Washington Post reported Monday that Atlas has repeatedly sparred with Fauci and Deborah Birx, an epidemiologist who is the White House coronavirus task force coordinator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-lumps-dr-fauci-among-idiots-but-suggests-he-won-t-fire-him/story-X5BivJp2UBVtMJQVZpvFYO.html
