28-10-2020||World||Blowout US economic growth in summer is already fading||Americans may feel whiplashed by a report Thursday on the economy’s growth this summer, when an explosive rebound followed an epic collapse. The government will likely estimate that the economy grew faster on an annualized basis last quarter than in any such period since record-keeping began in 1947. Just be forewarned: The sizzling pace won’t last. The economy is weakening and facing renewed threats. Confirmed viral cases are surging. Hiring has sagged. Government stimulus has run out. And even last quarter’s outsize growth will leave the economy far below its level before the pandemic struck in March. “The strength of this figure is an optical illusion,” Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note. “Growth has since slowed, and we expect markedly weaker activity” in the October-December quarter and beyond In the last major report on the U.S. economy before Election Day, economists have forecast that growth in the July-September quarter soared to a 31 per cent annual rate, according to data provider FactSet. That would follow a plunge of 31.4 per cent in the April-June period — by far the worst quarterly drop ever — when the eruption of the coronavirus closed businesses and threw tens of millions out of work. If the analysts’ outlook proves roughly accurate, the economy, as of last quarter, will have recovered only a bit more than two-thirds of the output it lost to the pandemic recession. The economy shrank 5 per cent in the first three months of the year. Mathematically, a bounce-back that equals or even slightly exceeds an earlier drop doesn’t mean the economy has fully recovered. The reason is that the rebound comes off a smaller numerical base. To use a simple example: A drop from 100 to 70 is a 30 per cent fall. Yet a 30 per cent rebound from 70 gets you only back to 91. You’d need a 43 per cent gain to get back to 100. There are deeper reasons, too, for viewing Thursday’s report on gross domestic product with skepticism. It reflects huge gains last quarter that resulted from simply reopening many businesses after the virus had paralysed the economy in March and April. Since August, the economic outlook has darkened as hiring has slowed. Consumers may spend warily during winter. And if the rise in Covid cases were to cause widespread business shutdowns or restrictions, the economy would struggle to sustain a solid recovery. Economists at Goldman Sachs have already slashed their growth forecast for the fourth quarter to a 3 per cent annual rate from 6 per cent. The seven-day rolling average for confirmed new cases in the US soared over the past two weeks from 51,161 to 71,832, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and confirmed infections are rising in 47 states. “The basic reality is that the virus remains out of control, and the risks of social and economic activity are maybe even higher than in the spring,” said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the University of Minnesota. Americans are showing growing concern about the economy. Consumer confidence slipped in October after having risen sharply in September. Consumers’ outlook for the economy over the next six months fell particularly hard, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. “There is little to suggest that consumers foresee the economy gaining momentum in the final months of 2020, especially with COVID-19 cases on the rise and unemployment still high,” said Lynn Franco, the board’s senior director of economic indicators. The unemployment rate is 7.9 per cent, down significantly from 14.7 per cent at the outset of pandemic recession but still historically high. And hiring has slowed sharply, from a peak of 4.8 million in June to 661,000 in September. The economy is still roughly 10.7 million jobs short of recovering all the 22 million jobs that were lost to the pandemic. “We bounced off the bottom really aggressively, but since then, there is this deceleration,” said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS. “The big issue is not how big the third quarter rebound is, but how fast is the next phase of the recovery coming?” Carpenter said he thinks growth is slowing to just a 2.5 per cent annual rate in the current quarter, and that the economy won’t return to its pre-pandemic levels of output until late next year or early 2022. The job market may take longer to fully recover, Carpenter said. Millions have dropped out of the work force and are no longer looking for work, artificially reducing the unemployment rate. They includes many women who have had to leave jobs to care for children now attending school online from home. The proportion of Americans who are either working or looking for work has sunk to 61.4 per cent, the lowest level since 1976. “That’s the real measure from my perspective as to whether we’re recovered,” Carpenter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blowout-us-economic-growth-in-summer-is-already-fading/story-0pEH5LxGGcniq3hJ2uOoiN.html
28-10-2020||World||Social media CEOs get earful on bias, warning of new limits||With next week’s election looming, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google were scolded by Republicans at a Senate hearing Wednesday for alleged anti-conservative bias in the companies’ social media platforms and received a warning of coming restrictions from Congress.Lawmakers of both parties are assessing the companies’ tremendous power to disseminate speech and ideas, and are looking to challenge their long-enjoyed bedrock legal protections for online speech.The Trump administration, seizing on unfounded accusations of bias against conservative views, has asked Congress to strip some of the protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.“The time has come for that free pass to end,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Wicker, R-Miss., said the laws governing online speech must be updated because “the openness and freedom of the internet are under attack.”He spoke at the opening of the hearing as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai waited to testify via video.Wicker cited the move this month by Facebook and Twitter to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden’s son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.Republicans led by President Donald Trump have accused the social media platforms, without evidence, of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.In their prepared testimony, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Critics in both parties say that immunity under Section 230 enables the social media companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.Zuckerberg acknowledged that Congress “should update the law to make sure it’s working as intended.”Dorsey and Pichai urged caution in making any changes. “Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,” Dorsey said.Pichai appealed to lawmakers “to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers.”The session lacked the in-person drama of star-witness proceedings before the coronavirus. The hearing room was nearly empty except for Wicker and a few colleagues, but their questioning was sharp as tempers flared among members.“Twitter’s conduct has by far been the most egregious,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Dorsey. Cruz cited Twitter’s limitations on the newspaper story as part of “a pattern of censorship and silencing Americans with whom Twitter disagrees.”Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, went after Republicans, saying the hearing was a “sham.”“This is bullying,” Schatz told the CEOs. “Do not let US senators bully you into carrying the water” for politicians seeking to discredit their opponents. With their questions, Schatz said, the Republicans “are trying to bully the heads of private companies into making a hit job” on political leadersTrump earlier this year signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under the 1996 telecommunications law.Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent, and said the restrictions by Twitter and Facebook related to the newspaper story was “quite concerning.”Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections — an about-face from the agency’s previous position.Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have imposed a misinformation label on content from the president, who has about 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.Starting Tuesday, Facebook didn’t accept any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close Nov. 3, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized the tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the US.Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views — a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump’s presidential campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-media-ceos-get-earful-on-bias-warning-of-new-limits/story-fW18rs6ie4MnV8B6C1mlKI.html

The other three are believed to be in China.The arrests are among a series of recent actions the Trump administration has taken against China, a country President Donald Trump regards as a prime adversary.In July, for instance, the Justice Department charged hackers working with the Chinese government with targeting firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.“China is violating laws and norms left and right,” FBI Director Chris Wray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-8-in-alleged-chinese-surveillance-effort-in-us/story-TIRm8KuYyDBwL8itFlV4gJ.html
28-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: President Donald Trump’s campaign website briefly hacked, defaced||US President Donald Trump’s campaign website was briefly hacked on Tuesday, just a week before the presidential elections.The spokesman for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, said in a statement that the website was “defaced.” “We are working with law enforcement authorities to investigate the source of the attack. There was no exposure to sensitive data because none of it is actually stored on the site. The website has been restored,” Murtaugh said.A report in The New York Times said Trump’s campaign website was briefly taken over by hackers and the hack lasted less than 30 minutes. The paper said in a screen posted to Trump’s website - donaldjtrump.com - the hackers claimed to have compromised “multiple devices” that gave them access to the president and his relatives “most internal and secret conversations,” including classified information.The hackers also accused the Trump administration of having a hand in the origins of the coronavirus and cooperating with “foreign actors manipulating the 2020 elections.” The NYT added that the hackers appeared to be looking to generate cryptocurrency and invited visitors to donate cryptocurrency to one of two funds - ‘Yes, share the data’ and the other labeled ‘No, Do not share the data’. “After the deadline, we will compare the funds and execute the will of the world,” the hackers wrote, without specifying a deadline. The hackers also posted what they said was their encryption key to Trumps’ campaign site.With less than a week left for the elections, the defacement highlighted cybersecurity risks facing the election campaigns.The report said intelligence agencies have been closely monitoring hacking groups, including teams backed by Iran and Russia, that have tried to break into election-related systems and have been involved in influence operations in recent weeks.Last week, the director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe had identified Iran and Russia as two nations responsible for disinformation and some limited intrusions into voter registration databases.Trump last week told a campaign rally in Arizona that “Nobody gets hacked. To get hacked you need somebody with 197 I.Q. and he needs about 15 percent of your password.” PTI YAS ZH ZH||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-president-donald-trump-s-campaign-website-briefly-hacked-defaced/story-ZFgT6y6Wz5MfxMaTYm4cgM.html
28-10-2020||World||Kept out of traditional jobs, transgender people see hope in tech world||As a transgender woman living in Russia, where LGBT+ people often face abuse and state repression, Chloe Golovleva said she felt like an animal trapped in a cage.“There was no life for me,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Two years ago, Golovleva left Russia and sought asylum in Argentina where trans people have greater legal protections, but she still felt her co-workers did not accept her.“It’s very difficult to start a new life,” the 40-year-old said. “There’s transphobia and homophobia, just like everywhere else in the world.”Golovleva’s experience is common across the Americas, where conservative social norms often leave trans people locked out of formal work and pushed to the margins of society.But increasingly, LGBT+ advocates and tech entrepreneurs are teaming up to offer training and employment in one of the world’s fastest growing industries:Information Technology.With relatively well-paid jobs, a disruptive attitude toward traditional work environments, and an emphasis on innovation, advocates say the tech industry offers opportunities for trans people who are often left out in the cold.“There’s a lot of trans folks ... who are working in the tech space and who are also leveraging their access to resources to help other trans folks,” said US tech entrepreneur and academic Kortney Ziegler.Because the industry “is focused on innovation and the next big thing, there’s a lot of room for people of all identities,” Ziegler said.Representation in techIn countries such as the United States, Brazil and Argentina, LGBT+ rights have become increasingly accepted in recent years, despite resistance from conservative groups.In June, the US Supreme Court ruled that workers could not be discriminated against for being LGBT+, while Brazil’s highest court made homophobia and transphobia a crime last year.Argentina established a quota system in September under which at least 1% of public sector jobs are reserved for trans workers.Despite these strides, trans people are often left out of the workforce.In the United States, 16% of trans people reported losing a job due to their gender identity, according to the National Centre for Transgender Equality, a non-profit, while in Brazil, some 90% of trans women work in prostitution.But in the tech industry, often centered in liberal, LGBT+-friendly urban centres like San Francisco in the United States or Buenos Aires in Argentina, acceptance of gay and trans people tends to be higher, experts say.“The representation in tech is genuinely higher than it is in a lot of more old-school industries,” said Vivienne Ming, a US-based researcher and tech entrepreneur.According to Ming’s research, nearly 7% of people in the US tech industry identify as LGBT+, compared with about 4% of Americans overall, according to polling firm Gallup.Despite the greater openness, trans people may face discrimination in the industry, especially in the recruitment process, Ming said.As a result, many trans people in tech have taken it upon themselves to make the industry more inclusive.Ziegler had a doctorate degree and was living near San Francisco, but as a Black trans man struggled to find work.So in 2013, Ziegler founded Trans*H4CK, an organization to provide training and support for trans and non-binary people, meaning those who don’t identify as male or female, in the tech industry.“I was inspired by this space of innovation, this idea of folks of different backgrounds and skills coming together to build something that’s tangible and usable and can save lives.”In its three years of operation, the organization said it helped more than 100 transgender developers to create mobile apps for other trans people to find work, health care, and friends.Ziegler admits the industry has a long way to go toward trans inclusion, and research from Trans*H4CK suggests trans tech workers often are paid less than are their non-transgender peers.But Ziegler said Trans*H4CK’s impact has been long lasting.“In our existence we birthed so many different organizations focused on trans folks,” he said. “So many different ideas and platforms that are still in operation to this day have come out of that.” ‘Profound Impact’ Initiatives like Trans*H4CK have become more and more common. In 2014, US transgender actor and entrepreneur Angelica Ross founded TransTech Social Enterprises, providing training and co-working spaces for trans people in tech.“I wanted to create a program that was really powered by the community,” Ross said on a recent Facebook live.“I wanted to make sure that folks had access to community, to mentorship, to resources, job opportunities.”In Brazil, Noah Scheffel runs EducaTRANSforma, an organization which provides training for trans people as well as inclusion training for potential employers in the tech industry.The organization began in 2019 with 16 students taking in-person classes, although with the coronavirus pandemic shutting down much of the country, Scheffel moved courses online and hopes to train 200 trans people by August next year.“(My dream) is to give them an opportunity that they’ve never had in their lives,” Scheffel said via WhatsApp message.In Argentina, Daniel Coletti founded Trans-TI two years ago, providing coaching and jobs for trans people, helping them prepare for tasks like online software testing.According to Coletti, jobs in tech do not necessarily require formal education, so trans people with few prospects can quickly learn the skills they need.“A lot of times, the impact can be quite profound,” he said. “It’s not that we’re giving them charity, we’re giving them a job.”Among the trans people employed by Trans-TI is Russian refugee Golovleva, who started working at the organization in March.It’s been a steep learning curve, she said, but after two years in Argentina, she said she finally feels at home.“I have formal work, and in this job, there’s no transphobia,” she said. “In that sense, I’m happy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kept-out-of-traditional-jobs-transgender-people-see-hope-in-tech-world/story-wbOpap1qlA3xpF6mPqPtNL.html
28-10-2020||World||Singapore takes small step in easing controls on migrant workers||Singapore will allow some migrant workers, who have largely been confined to dormitories, to visit recreation centres as the city-state gradually relaxes measures to stem the spread of Covid-19.The more than 300,000 overseas workers have been confined to their living quarters since April, and have only been allowed out in recent months to go to work and for essential errands, after the coronavirus ripped through the tightly packed dormitories. That’s even as life has been slowly returning to normal for local Singaporeans and white-collar expatriates.They will also be allowed to visit restaurants, mini marts and other outlets at selected recreation centres on their days off from Oct. 31, the Ministry of Manpower said in a statement. Visits must be booked in advance via a smartphone application with dormitory operators checking that workers have valid passes before being allowed to leave.The relaxation of controls on the workers comes after more than two months of trials and with infection rates in the community and dormitories having stayed at low levels, the ministry said. Around 30,000 workers have already booked exit passes as part of the trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-takes-small-step-in-easing-controls-on-migrant-workers/story-IbkXeDqKMblu9GvlG0eLKN.html
28-10-2020||World||Germany moves to shutter bars and restaurants for one month||Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing for a partial lockdown in Germany that would include closing bars, restaurants and leisure facilities through the end of November, as coronavirus infections continue to surge across Europe.Merkel is also urging citizens to keep private contacts to an absolute minimum, and to avoid all non-essential private travel, according to a draft federal government briefing paper obtained by Bloomberg.She’ll discuss the proposals with regional premiers starting at 1 p.m. in Berlin in what is likely to be contentious meeting, with some state leaders already signalling opposition to the measures.Like many of her European counterparts, the German leader’s hand has been forced by a spike in virus cases that has been gathering pace since the start of August, fuelled by travellers and people failing to observe hygiene and distancing rules at social or family gatherings. French President Emmanuel Macron is also set to announce tighter restrictions when he addresses the nation on Wednesday evening.Merkel has pledged to do all she can to avoid imposing another lockdown as strict as the one that hammered Europe’s biggest economy in the second quarter.The latest steps, which would take effect Nov. 4, are designed to stem the spread of the disease while broadly allowing activity to continue. They’re likely to provoke protests from industry groups and from citizens already weary of what they see as government intrusion into their private lives.Economists at Commerzbank estimated the measures will depress German output by almost 1% in the fourth quarter, leading to “at best stagnation,” with a “considerable risk” of a second recession. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank more than 2%, with auto and construction shares seeing the steepest declines. Haven assets, such as Treasuries and the yen, rose.Some states may refuse to back all of Merkel’s proposals, and they have already prompted a Vice President of the Lower House of Parliament to declare on national radio that he won’t follow the new rules.“I urgently warn against alarmism, which can also lead to erroneous decisions,” Wolfgang Kubicki, a Bundestag Vice President from the opposition Free Democrats, said on Deutschlandfunk(DLF).The government briefing document notes that effective contact tracing has become impossible in many parts of Germany, and that without further restrictions, exponential growth in the number of infections would overburden the health system within a few weeks and lead to a significant rise in serious cases and deaths.Merkel’s government is also planning to extend and enhance assistance for sectors especially hard hit by the restrictions, such as hotels and restaurants. Aid for the self-employed and those working in the arts will also be made available.“We’re in a very difficult situation, the infection numbers are exploding,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in an interview with ARD TV. “It’s a threat to the health system and therefore to human life and that’s why policy makers must act.”Germany’s new coronavirus cases rose Wednesday by a record 14,964 to a total of 464,239, according to data from the RKI public health institute.“We are currently in a critical phase of the pandemic,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said after the cabinet approved new measures including expanding laboratory testing capacity and support for working parents. “The situation is serious.”While the situation in Germany is deteriorating rapidly, governments elsewhere in Europe are faced with even more alarming increases in infections and deaths.French officials favour a one-month lockdown starting midnight Thursday, BFMTV reported, without identifying the source of its information. It will be more flexible than the initial shutdown in the spring, the report said.French deaths linked to the virus jumped by 523 to 35,541, health authorities reported Tuesday, the biggest daily increase since April 22.As governments grapple for an effective response, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will step in with a set of proposals later on Wednesday ahead of Thursday’s conference call with European Union leaders.The measures include improving the flow of real-time data between member states, implementing rapid testing, expanding the use of mobile tracing apps, nudging countries to speed up vaccination strategies and creating common protocols to restore safe travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-to-shutter-bars-and-restaurants-for-one-month/story-KybHXJpRAEicvgDOyDeZgI.html

The 2016 Uri attack and the Pathankot attack in 2016 were blamed on Pakistan-based JeM.In its response on Wednesday, a Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement that failing to take cognizance of the “grave humanitarian and human rights situation” in Kashmir is “tantamount to abdication of international responsibility.”it said “gratuitous and self-serving references” in joint statements “cannot mask the fact that it is India that continues to be the nerve centre of state-terrorism, besides being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and Islamophobia.”It claimed that the international community “recognizes Pakistan’s efforts, sacrifices and success in the fight against terrorism.”“As a country that has suffered the most from cross-border terrorism, Pakistan would continue to contribute constructively to regional and global efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.“It is important that partner countries take an objective view of the issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-seethes-at-india-us-statement-asking-it-to-rein-in-terror/story-qsegWdxRz1vokpb0WFg1LJ.html
28-10-2020||World||Pak opposes changes to India’s land ownership laws in J&K||Pakistan on Wednesday said it “categorically rejects” amendments to Indian laws that allow outsiders to buy non-farm land in Kashmir, calling them “illegal”. In a gazette notification on Tuesday, the home ministry had omitted the phrase “permanent resident of the state” from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with the disposal of land in the Union Territory. The new rules allow outsiders to buy non-agricultural land in Jammu & Kashmir.The Pakistan foreign office termed this a “highly condemnable Indian action and yet another clear violation of the UN Security Council resolutions, bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India, and international law.”“India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019, and subsequent measures, particularly the domicile law and now the land ownership laws, are aimed at changing the demographic structure” to convert the Kashmiris into a minority in their own land, it claimed in a statement. Changing the demographic structure “is a violation of the 4th Geneva Convention and constitutes war crime,” it said.All these measures and laws, “lacking legal and moral legitimacy are forced upon the oppressed people” through the barrel of the gun, it claimed.The statement said such steps can neither change the disputed nature of Kashmir or “prejudice the inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people.”It asked the United Nations and the international community to take immediate action to stop India from changing the demography and distinct identity Kashmir “and facilitate resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute as per the relevant UNSC Resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-opposes-changes-to-india-s-land-ownership-laws-in-j-k/story-0bj6lQuH2kAJFnZeQZeubL.html
28-10-2020||World||Japan PM says plan to release Fukushima water coming soon||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday that his government is working on the final details of a plan to release massive amounts of radioactive water being stored at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, a decision that has been delayed by protests.More than nine years after the disaster, the government still hasn’t made clear what it will do with the water at the plant, though a release into the ocean has been largely speculated on in recent years.“We cannot put off our decision forever without making a plan,” Suga told a parliamentary session Wednesday, saying the plant is running out of storage space. “Based on discussions and expertise we’ve had, we will further deepen our discussion and responsibly make a decision at an appropriate time.”A government panel in February issued a report recommending releasing the water into the ocean as the most realistic plan. The government and the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., or TEPCO, say all radioactive materials but tritium can be safely removed, and that tritium is largely harmless.The plant now has more than 1.2 million tons of the water stored in 1,000 huge tanks that occupy a large amount of space at the plant. TEPCO says that it will run out of space in the summer of 2022 and that the tanks hamper the decommissioning process.Suga did not give a timeline, though a decision is expected in weeks, if not months. An actual release would be about two years away because TEPCO still has to set up a facility for a release and have it authorized by the Nuclear Regulation Authority, officials said. A controlled release of the water will take decades.The plant suffered a triple meltdown in the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and is undergoing decades-long decommissioning. The contaminated water, a mixture of injected cooling water and groundwater that flows into the reactor area, has accumulated since the accident.The government and TEPCO say water treatment systems can remove all but water-soluble tritium, though currently 70% of the water contains other radioactive materials exceeding allowable limits. TEPCO says it can meet the safety standard by running the water for a second round of treatment before releasing it.Suga visited the Fukushima plant last month and said he hoped to make a decision as soon as possible.Government officials said they need more time to discuss ways to mitigate reputational damage to the local industries and gain public understanding. Fishermen especially have opposed a release, saying their already badly hurt business would die. Their local and national representatives visited Tokyo last week to protest to environment and agriculture ministers.On Wednesday, Japanese officials from the foreign and industry ministries provided an online session for foreign diplomats to provide updates on the water situation.Nuclear officials inside and outside of Japan have said a controlled release of the water into the ocean is the only realistic way of getting rid of the water safely.Nuclear Regulation Authority chairman Toyoshi Fuketa recently said that tritium below allowable limits is routinely released from nuclear plants around the world. He said he is not concerned about safety, but understands psychological and reputational concerns about the water associated with the Fukushima disaster. He said careful monitoring of the water samples is crucial to gain public understanding.But some scientists say the long-term environmental impact from radioactive water is unknown and could pose higher risks than explained. Ken Buesseler, a marine biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said in a recent article that not only tritium but how other isotopes affect marine life should be carefully examined.___Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-says-plan-to-release-fukushima-water-coming-soon/story-6ezSlAxHbZGhv0a5CLxbZI.html
28-10-2020||World||Covid-19-hit Heathrow no longer Europe’s biggest airport||The Heathrow airport has lost its status as the largest European airport after the Covid-19 pandemic and lack of testing at airport hit passenger numbers, besides losing £1.5 billion in nine months this year until September, results released on Wednesday showed.Heathrow, with 18.97 million passengers during the period, has been overtaken by the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, which had 19.27mn. Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt airports are close behind, Heathrow said, adding that in 2019 it had 81mn passengers.The company said the forecast for demand has been revised down: Passenger numbers are now forecast to be 22.6mn in 2020 and 37.1mn in 2021, compared to its June forecast of 29.2mn in 2020 and 62.8mn in 2021.“The reduction is caused by the second wave of Covid and slow progress on introducing testing by the UK government to reopen borders with ‘high risk’ countries…The UK Government has announced an intention to introduce testing for passengers from high risk countries by 1st December to help restart the UK economy,” the company said.Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “Britain is falling behind because we’ve been too slow to embrace passenger testing. European leaders acted quicker and now their economies are reaping the benefits.”“Paris has overtaken Heathrow as Europe’s largest airport for the first time ever…Bringing in pre-departure Covid tests and partnering with our US allies to open a pilot airbridge to America will kickstart our economic recovery and put the UK back ahead of our European rivals.” The company added that its finances remained robust. Liquidity at the end of September was boosted in October to £4.5 billion.

28-10-2020||World||Spike in Covid-19 cases at worst possible time for Donald Trump||Record-setting levels of U.S. coronavirus cases are coming at the worst possible time politically for Donald Trump.The president, who has spent months attacking mail-in voting, needs a dramatic turnout on Election Day to have any hope of overcoming his sagging poll numbers and the advantage Democrats have with mail-in voting. But the spiking cases numbers and rising hospitalizations in key battleground states could deter some Republicans from voting, even though the party insists that Trump’s supporters remain fiercely motivated to show up.The surge in cases also puts Trump on the defensive and keeps the focus at the end of the race on his handling of the pandemic, which Democrat Joe Biden has made a central part of his campaign, with the president spending the past eight months downplaying the virus and insisting it would go away.“To a certain extent, it’s going to cost him some votes,” said Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist who’s chairman of the pro-Trump Great America political action committee. “Our vote will hopefully turn out, but I’d much rather have them in the box than waiting for them to come.”The Covid spikes will make it more difficult for Republicans to execute their voter turnout plans, especially with polls showing Trump trailing Biden, said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.The concern for Trump isn’t just turnout but also the economic anxiety the pandemic has spawned, how it has affected older voters who are an important constituency for the president as well as working-class and rural voters who backed him in 2016 and may “have a bit of buyers’ remorse,” Madden said.“If a voter walks into the polling place thinking about the coronavirus pandemic, they’ll leave having cast a ballot for Joe Biden,” said Ben Wikler, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, a state recording record highs in hospitalizations and cases.At the same time, there are risks for Biden too. Black voters, some of Biden’s strongest supporters, also have been hard-hit by Covid cases in the weeks leading up to the election in the key swing state of North Carolina. Experts say that could depress turnout. But that state is an outlier: Nationwide, the largest Black communities have never had fewer virus cases relative to other counties.Rising cases also could cause a shortage of poll workers that reduces the number of polling locations in urban areas, disproportionately affecting Democratic voters. And there are concerns that large numbers of mail-in ballots being cast by Democrats in response to the pandemic could be rejected because of delays in U.S. Postal Service delivery or on technical grounds.Any political impact of the coronavirus is already baked into the race after eight months, so a spike now isn’t likely to make much of a difference, said Republican strategist Bryan Lanza, deputy communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign. While the heavy Democratic early voting is a concern if they’re new voters and wouldn’t have voted anyway on Election Day, Trump’s supporters will be there for him, Lanza said.“His voters are going to show up on Election Day irrespective of what’s happening in the world,” Lanza said. “Whatever the fears are of Covid, I don’t think it’s going to be enough to scare his voters away.”Another factor is that a record number of Americans have voted early. More than 69 million Americans have cast mail-in or in-person ballots -- far exceeding the early vote total from 2016 and accounting for more than half of the total vote count in 2016, according to the U.S. Elections Project.Of the more than 33 million votes cast so far in states that report party registration data, Democrats account for 48% of the total and Republicans 29%, according to the same data.U.S. Early-Voter Turnout Surges Past 50% of All Ballots in 2016At the same time, the virus statistics are worsening each day. The U.S. reported 73,096 new Covid-19 cases Tuesday, bringing the seven-day average to a record 71,532, according to the Covid Tracking Project. More than 226,000 people have died, Johns Hopkins University data show.Despite Trump blaming rising cases on increased testing, current hospitalizations with Covid-19 have climbed 36% to 44,212 in the past three weeks, after months of decline and a brief plateau. About 6% of America’s inpatient beds are now occupied by Covid-19 patients, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.The coronavirus spike is being driven by sharp increases in the Midwest and adjacent states, including in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- three states that Trump won by a combined 77,744 votes in 2016 and he needs to carry this year to win re-election.Wisconsin now has the third-worst number of per-capita cases in the U.S. in the past week, and it’s getting worse, with the seven-day average rising 23% in the past week. Weekly cases per capita jumped 25% in Michigan and 33% in Pennsylvania in the past seven days, and current hospitalizations rose 27% in Pennsylvania, 10th-most in the U.S.No swing state has been immune as cases and hospitalizations have been rising in most states, including Florida and Arizona. The pandemic is now hitting rural areas and white voters -- key for Trump’s re-election -- harder relative to other groups, and the record Covid-19 surge that started with young Americans is increasingly reaching the older communities at elevated risk of severe outcomes.Even after a first outbreak hit Trump and White House staffers, a second outbreak came to light over the weekend when the chief of staff and other members of the inner circle for Vice President Mike Pence -- who leads the coronavirus task force that has been largely marginalized in recent months -- contracted the virus. That hasn’t stopped Trump from saying the U.S. is “rounding the turn” on the pandemic and that the surge is part of a “fake news media conspiracy.”“You turn on MSDNC, you turn on this network, it’s Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,” Trump said at a rally Friday in Florida. “They want to scare you to try to make you vote for Biden.”While Biden has held limited events without big crowds to contrast his response to the pandemic to Trump’s, the president has continued to hold boisterous rallies with supporters packed together and few wearing masks -- despite Trump being only weeks removed from his own battle with the virus. Health experts fear the rallies could be super-spreader events.“The bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to try to lead us through this pandemic,” Biden said during a campaign event Monday in Pennsylvania.There are challenges with Covid that other countries are also facing, but Trump’s approach will soon defeat the virus, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, said on “Fox & Friends” on Monday. Politically, Trump’s campaign is designed to turn out the vote, and state directors feel more confident about where they are now than in 2016, he said.Still, some analysts say Trump is pursuing a risky strategy depending on a strong Election Day vote to overcome Democrats’ advantage with early voting -- especially if some voters stay home and any uncommitted voters want to hold him responsible for an unchecked coronavirus.In Wisconsin, Trump’s handling of the coronavirus has gone from 51% approval in March to 56% disapproval in early October in the Marquette Law School poll -- even as a majority still support him on the economy. If the virus surge does impact the race, it probably affects Trump more because more Republicans plan to vote on Election Day, said Charles Franklin, the poll’s director.“I really think it’s an issue,” David Axelrod, the former chief strategist for President Barack Obama, said on his “Hacks on Tap” podcast on Friday. “The virus has defined this election, and it may define Election Day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spike-in-covid-19-cases-at-worst-possible-time-for-donald-trump/story-rwBngChBIukGFLZDNvEktK.html
28-10-2020||World||US Supreme Court lays out path to help Donald Trump win a contested race||The U.S. Supreme Court’s conservatives started carving a path that could let President Donald Trump win a contested election, issuing a far-reaching set of opinions just as Amy Coney Barrett was getting Senate confirmation to provide what could be a crucial additional vote.In a 5-3 decision released minutes before the Senate vote Monday night, the court rejected Democratic calls to reinstate a six-day extension for the receipt of mail ballots in Wisconsin, a hotly contested state that is experiencing a surge of Covid-19 cases. The Supreme Court as a whole gave no explanation for the decision.The outcome was bad enough for Democrats, but an opinion by Trump-appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh bordered on catastrophic. Kavanaugh suggested sympathy for Trump’s unsubstantiated contentions that votes received after Election Day would be tainted by fraud, warning that “charges of a rigged election could explode” if late-arriving ballots change the perceived outcome.Most states “want to avoid the chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue if thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election,” Kavanaugh wrote. “And those states also want to be able to definitively announce the results of the election on election night, or as soon as possible thereafter.”Although Trump is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in national polls, the race is tighter in Wisconsin and other swing states that will determine who wins and are the focus of the two campaigns. Two other pivotal states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, are awaiting Supreme Court action in cases raising similar issues.Kavanaugh’s vote -- and those of fellow Trump appointees Barrett and Neil Gorsuch -- could be crucial in any post-election dispute. With Chief Justice John Roberts showing less willingness to second-guess state election decisions, Trump could need the support of all three of his appointed justices to overturn election results that seem to favor Biden.All three Democratic appointees dissented Monday night. Writing for the group, Justice Elena Kagan blasted Kavanaugh’s word choice, as well as his reasoning.“There are no results to ‘flip’ until all valid votes are counted,” Kagan wrote for herself and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. “And nothing could be more suspicious or improper than refusing to tally votes once the clock strikes 12 on election night.”The court’s decision Monday means ballots must be received by Election Day to count in Wisconsin. Democrats were seeking to revive an extension that had been ordered by a federal trial judge because of the Covid outbreak and then blocked by an appeals court.Kagan said the worsening pandemic in Wisconsin means that without the extension voters would have to “opt between braving the polls, with all the risk that entails, and losing their right to vote.” Kavanaugh countered that the high court order wouldn’t disenfranchise any voter who had adequately planned ahead.The dueling opinions, however, went well beyond the Wisconsin circumstances. Kavanaugh embraced a legal theory that could let Republican-controlled state legislatures override results certified by Democratic officials. That argument, developed by three conservative justices in the 2000 Bush v. Gore case, says the Supreme Court should intervene in a presidential election dispute even when a state court is interpreting its own laws.Citing that opinion, Kavanaugh pointed to a constitutional provision that says state legislatures get to determine how electors are appointed to the Electoral College, the body that formally selects the U.S. president.“The text of the Constitution requires federal courts to ensure that state courts do not rewrite state election laws,” Kavanaugh wrote. He was one of three current justices, including Roberts and Barrett, who worked as lawyers for Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 election fight.Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan all have Republican-controlled legislatures and Democratic governors, creating the possibility those states could send duelling slates of electors to the Electoral College in the event of a disputed election.Kavanaugh’s opinion doesn’t necessarily mean he would invalidate votes that arrive after Election Day in states where extensions are in place, said Edward Foley, director of the election law program at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law.“There’s a due process principle, at least that’s recognized by lower courts,” Foley said. “You’re not supposed to change rules governing elections after ballots have been cast. That might come into play.”The Kavanaugh opinion nonetheless left many liberals alarmed at the growing possibility of a replay of Bush v. Gore, when the Supreme Court reversed the Florida Supreme Court and stopped ballot recounts that might have led to Democrat Al Gore’s election.Kavanaugh “signaled that at least some of the conservative justices are willing to stop both state and federal courts, and state agencies, from easing voting restrictions and fixing voting problems when doing so deviates from the wishes of the state legislature,” said Rick Hasen, a election-law expert who teaches at the University of California, Irvine School of Law.Gorsuch expressed views similar to Kavanaugh’s, if in less detail. “The Constitution provides that state legislatures -- not federal judges, not state judges, not state governors, not other state officials -- bear primary responsibility for setting election rules,” Gorsuch wrote in an opinion Kavanaugh joined.Kavanaugh’s and Gorsuch’s opinions distinguished them from Roberts. Although Roberts joined the majority in the Wisconsin case, he wrote his own opinion to explain why he previously voted to allow an extra three days for ballots to arrive in Pennsylvania. The court split 4-4 in that case last week, leaving the extension intact for the time being.Roberts said the difference was that the Pennsylvania case involved a state court applying its own constitution.“Different bodies of law and different precedents govern these two situations and require, in these particular circumstances, that we allow the modification of election rules in Pennsylvania but not Wisconsin,” he wrote Monday.Pennsylvania Republicans have now filed a new request to block the extension, aiming to take advantage of Barrett’s arrival on the court.Barrett, who began work as a justice Tuesday after taking the second of two required oaths, could now be positioned to cast the deciding vote in a 2020 version of Bush v. Gore. The dynamic “is putting Justice Barrett on the spot to make that decision,” Foley said.Although Democrats have called on Barrett to disqualify herself from Trump-related election cases, she has given no indication she will do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-lays-out-path-to-help-donald-trump-win-a-contested-race/story-vUKDqVk8PZ3yBPNxBWA6MP.html
28-10-2020||World||China: Coronavirus epicenter Hubei lags as regional growth picks up||Most Chinese provincial economies regained the ground they lost in the first half of the year, with the notable exception of Hubei, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged in its capital Wuhan.Hubei’s gross domestic product shrank 10.4% in the first three quarters compared with the same period last year, according to data released by the provincial statistics bureau. It was among only four of China’s 29 provinces that reported year-to-date contractions in the nine-month period.China’s recovery from the pandemic picked up pace in the third quarter, taking GDP in the nine-month period to 0.7% as the economy regained the ground it lost in the early months of the year. The regions largely mirror that outcome, with inland provinces like Guizhou and Gansu posting the strongest recoveries.Hubei’s economy -- which in the first quarter plunged 39.2% from a year ago as Wuhan was placed under quarantine -- has a long way to go to reach full-year growth. But momentum is clearly picking up, with GDP expanding sequentially about 74% and 11% in the second and third quarters, respectively, according to Bloomberg calculations.​Authorities have rolled out measures to stimulate growth in Hubei, including giving out 500 million yuan ($74.5 million) in shopping vouchers, doling out cash to some households, and providing tax breaks until the end of the year. The national government also promised to expand free-trade zones in Hubei province to lure investment back to the region.​Inner Mongolia, northeastern Liaoning and Heilongjiang were the other three provinces to post contractions in the nine months through September from a year earlier. The city of Tianjin, a key port city in the north, made up all its GDP losses in the first half of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-coronavirus-epicenter-hubei-lags-as-regional-growth-picks-up/story-FLQ5dvC5GJcHQ6ay8k9AgK.html
28-10-2020||World||Satellite photos show construction at Iran nuclear site||Iran has begun construction at its Natanz nuclear facility, satellite images released Wednesday show, just as the United Nation’s(UN) nuclear agency acknowledged Tehran is building an underground advanced centrifuge assembly plant after its last one exploded in a reported sabotage attack last summer.The construction comes as the US nears Election Day in a campaign pitting President Donald Trump, whose maximum pressure campaign against Iran has led Tehran to abandon all limits on its atomic program, and Joe Biden, who has expressed a willingness to return to the accord. The outcome of the vote is likely to decide which approach America takes. Heightened tensions between Iran and the US nearly ignited a war at the start of the year.Since August, Iran has built a new or regraded road to the south of Natanz toward what analysts believe is a former firing range for security forces at the enrichment facility, images from San Francisco-based Planet Labs show. A satellite image Monday shows the site cleared away with what appears to be construction equipment there.Analysts from the James Martin Centre for Non-Proliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies say they believe that site is undergoing excavation.“That road also goes into the mountains so it may be the fact that they’re digging some kind of structure that’s going to be out in front and that there’s going to be a tunnel in the mountains,” said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert at the institute who studies Iran’s nuclear program. “Or maybe that they’re just going to bury it there.”Iran’s mission to the UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state television last month that the destroyed above ground facility was being replaced with one “in the heart of the mountains around Natanz.”Rafael Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA), told The Associated Press on Tuesday that his inspectors were aware of the construction. He said Iran had previously informed IAEA inspectors, who continue to have access to Iran’s sites despite the collapse of the nuclear deal.“It means that they have started, but it’s not completed. It’s a long process,” Grossi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-photos-show-construction-at-iran-nuclear-site/story-wJP6wnIl1zHeNZvrqEI9yK.html

India has formed such pacts with approximately 18 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-bars-air-india-flights-for-fourth-time-as-passengers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-c5AKvRinHeLgCxBVwY1xKL.html
28-10-2020||World||Sex cult founder Keith Raniere sentenced to 120 years in prison||Keith Raniere, the founder of the cult-like group NXIVM where women were kept on starvation diets, branded with his initials, and ordered to have sex with him, was sentenced on Tuesday to 120 years in prison following his conviction for sex trafficking and other crimes.The sentence was imposed by US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, after a hearing where 15 former NXIVM members spoke out against Raniere, 60. Garaufis said “no words can adequately express the lasting pain” Raniere caused his victims.He also fined Raniere $1.75 million, the maximum allowed by the law.“I do believe strongly that I’m innocent of these crimes,” Raniere said before being sentenced. He said some of the victims’ statements were false, but that he was “truly sorry” for causing them pain.“It is our sincere hope that today’s sentence does deliver some measure of justice to those victims,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme, whose office prosecuted the case, said after the sentencing. “Keith Raniere will not be able to victimize people anymore.”Federal prosecutors had sought a life sentence for Raniere for crimes he committed as the leader of NXIVM, a purported self-help group based near Albany, New York.Marc Agnifilo, Raniere’s attorney, asked for just 20 years, saying his client did not mean to hurt anyone. Agnifilo said the sentence should take into account Raniere’s “perspective,” drawing a sharp rebuke from Garaufis. “We’re not sentencing him based on a perspective,” the judge said. “We’re sentencing him based on his behavior.”The victims, most of whom were women, described what they called Raniere’s devastating impact on their lives. The first speaker, identified in court only as Camila, recounted a 12-year sexual relationship with Raniere starting when she was 15 and he was 45.“He screwed with my mind for so long that trying to find the strength and clarity to tell my story has been a slow and painful journey,” Camila said.Her sister Daniela, who testified at the trial about her own abusive relationship with Raniere, called Raniere “pathetic” and said he “deserves no mercy.”Their brother Adrian and mother Adriana, who were also part of NXIVM, lamented how his father and oldest sister remained loyal to Raniere.“Before being part of NXIVM, my family was close,” Adrian said. “He destroyed my family.”Another former member, the actress India Oxenberg, told Raniere at the hearing: “You stole seven years of my life that I’ll never get back.”Jurors convicted Raniere in June 2019 of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and possession of child pornography in the form of photos of 15-year-old Camila, among other crimes, following extensive testimony from former NXIVM members.Prosecutors said Raniere created a secret sorority within NXIVM called DOS, where female “slaves” turned over nude photos and other compromising materials that could be used for blackmail if they tried to leave.More than 50 people wrote letters to Garaufis urging leniency for Raniere, including Camila’s and Daniela’s father, Hector. Many said NXIVM classes, which could cost thousands of dollars, had greatly improved their lives.“I find Hector’s letter in support of the man who abused his own daughters a disgrace,” Garaufis said.Several other people affiliated with NXIVM have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.They included Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, actress Allison Mack, former NXIVM President Nancy Salzman and her daughter Lauren Salzman, who became a star prosecution witness.Bronfman was accused of helping bankroll NXIVM, and was sentenced last month to more than six years in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sex-cult-founder-keith-raniere-sentenced-to-120-years-in-prison/story-Cyv8hquZrcKCBML6UiKxDN.html
28-10-2020||World||China snaps at US, says LAC faceoff with India is a bilateral issue||China on Wednesday said the Sino-India boundary dispute is a bilateral matter under negotiation and described Washington’s efforts to push the Indo-Pacific policy as an “outdated cold war strategy”.The Chinese foreign ministry was reacting to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s remarks in New Delhi on Tuesday that the US stands with India on the ongoing military faceoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“The border affairs between China and India are things between the two countries. Now the situation across the border is generally stable and the two sides are in resolving relevant issues through consultations and negotiations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said at the regular ministry briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.Wang was responding to a question on Pompeo pushing for closer ties with India in the backdrop of the Sino-India border conflict.On Tuesday, referring to the Indian soldiers who were killed in Galwan Valley on June 15, Pompeo said Washington will stand with New Delhi to protect its sovereignty.Actual numbers are hard to come by but both militaries are said to have deployed thousands of soldiers at multiple friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh in the longest – since May – and worst military faceoff in decades.Criticising, and focusing on, Washington rather than on India, Wang said: “We always believe that the development of bilateral relations between any countries should be conducive to peace and stability and development of the region. It should not harm the interests of a third party.”“In meantime, any concept for regional development should be in line with the trend of the times for peaceful development and win-win cooperation. The Indo-Pacific strategy proposed by the US is preaching outdated cold war mentality and preaching confrontation and geopolitical game.”Beijing perceives the Indo-Pacific strategy, involving the US, India, Japan and Australia and aimed at freedom of maritime navigation, as a move to counter its influence in the region, critical because of sea trade routes. Wang added: “It is aimed to uphold the hegemony of the US. This runs counter to the common interest of the region and we urge the US to stop this.”Wang continued to criticise the US when asked about Pompeo’s visit to Sri Lanka where he is expected to influence the leadership in Colombo against Beijing.“I just responded to a question concerning Pompeo’s remarks in India. I want to add that forcing small and medium-sized countries to pick sides is a habitual behaviour of certain US politicians.”The spokesperson referred to a Lankan foreign ministry statement that said Colombo will handle its foreign relations in accordance with the wishes of its citizens and relevant laws and not of foreign powers.“Sri Lanka and China are traditional friendly neighbours. We have been conducting friendly cooperation on the basis of equal-footed negotiations and mutual benefit which brings tangible benefits to the two people. This will never be altered by any smears or slanders by other people or other countries.”“We will work with Sri Lanka to expand and deepen our strategic cooperative partnership, to bring more benefits for our people and to contribute to regional peace, stability and development,” Wang added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-snaps-at-us-says-lac-faceoff-with-india-is-bilateral-issue/story-ZXRv4faHBIXo2li1vpgUbI.html
28-10-2020||World||Donald Trump slams media for ‘blocking’ alleged graft cases against his rival Joe Biden||US President Donald Trump has slammed the mainstream American media and big tech companies for blocking the alleged corruption charges against his opponent Democratic challenger Joe Biden.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020They have accused each other of serious corruption charges during the election campaigning, with the president alleging that Biden got USD 3.5 million from Russia and it came through Russian President Vladimir Putin because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow. Biden has denied the allegations. Trump, before leaving for a campaign trail on Tuesday, told reporters at the White House that the mainstream media was not showing corruption against Biden. “Nobody has ever seen anything like we’re witnessing right now. I think it’s a very sad time and it’ll go down as a very sad era for the media and certainly for big tech (companies). “I think what is going on with all of those companies -- I think they’ve hurt themselves very badly because they’ve been so restrictive… when they don’t want to show corruption, like you have with Biden -- that’s totally corruption and everybody knows it -- and they’re trying to protect, because he can make them wealthier, whereas they understand me,” Trump said. “They understand where I’m coming from. It’s very unfair. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. It’s not freedom of the press… it’s the opposite. And, of course, the media is in the same bag,” said the president. At a separate election rally in the battleground State of Wisconsin, his eldest son Donald Trump Jr alleged that the media and the big tech companies are now campaigning on behalf of Biden and the Democratic Party.Also read | Twitter flags Donald Trump’s tweet on mail-in ballots over ‘disputed’ content The mainstream media today is indulging in censorship, he said, alleging that they are not letting any negative news against Biden and his family getting out. “Your First Amendment is on the table. They will do everything they can to silence you. It is a point of no return,” he said, accusing social media of backing Democrats. The president’s son said that the Democratic Party no longer represents America’s hard-working men and women as it is now pushing for socialism and Marxism. Launching a scathing attack on the opposition party and Biden and his running mate California senator Kamala Harris, he urged the Republican supporters to help re-elect his father. “And when we win, we can not only make ‘America Great Again’, but also we can make ‘liberals cry again’,” he told hundreds of cheering supporters in this small city of Wisconsin on Tuesday. Trump Jr has been campaigning across the states, making multiple stops seeking vote for his father. Like his father, his talking points remains the same such as the achievement of the Trump administration, Covid-19, corruption and the left liberals that now dominate the Democratic Party. He prominently compares himself with Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who has been facing serious corruption charges. It is in this context that he launched a scathing attack against the mainstream media and the big tech companies who he alleges have double standards: one for the Trump family and the other for the Biden family. “Our freedom is under attack. The Democratic Party used to represent the hard-working men and women across the country. That Party is no more. That party is gone. We think of the things that they’re pushing these days. What other than socialism and Marxism? What are their priorities? It’s not that hard-working men and women of this country. “This is not your grand-parents Democratic Party. This is not your parents Democratic Party. It’s a party of AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ), Rasheeda Talib, Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris. Who’s going to be in charge folks. You realise they want to use Joe Biden as the camouflage,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-slams-media-for-blocking-alleged-graft-cases-against-his-rival-joe-biden/story-u2aMQaT0DcJ0Chxkz3aAIJ.html
28-10-2020||World||London’s Heathrow Airport no longer Europe’s busiest air hub||London’s Heathrow Airport says it has lost its place as Europe’s busiest air hub to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris after the Covid-19 pandemic grounded flights and Britain failed to approve passenger testing that could scale back quarantine requirements.Heathrow said Wednesday that it expects passenger numbers to fall more than previously forecast this year and rebound more slowly in 2021.The airport now expects to serve 22.6 million passengers this year and 37.1 million in 2021, down from a June forecast of 29.2 million and 62.8 million. The forecast for this year represents at 72% drop from 2019.Commercial aviation plunged this year as governments implemented travel restrictions and passengers cancelled flights amid efforts to control the spread of Covid-19. Some countries have sought to revive the market by implementing passenger testing regimes that reduce or eliminate the need for quarantines.Despite pressure from the travel industry, Britain still requires travellers from most countries to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival, making most business and leisure travel impractical.“The UK’s hub airport is no longer the busiest airport in Europe, competitors such as Charles de Gaulle have exceeded us in terms of passenger numbers as they benefit from a testing regime,” Heathrow said in a statement. “Without a rapid move to testing, the UK will fall even further behind its European competitors and the economic recovery will fail to get off the ground.”Heathrow on Wednesday reported a pre-tax loss of 1.52 billion pounds ($1.97 billion) for the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of 76 million pounds in the same period of 2019. Revenue plunged 59% to 2.3 billion pounds.The number of passengers using Heathrow during those nine months fell 69% to 19 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heathrow-loses-claim-to-being-europe-s-biggest-airport/story-4zKyqWRDFM6C8PNrwufuJJ.html
28-10-2020||World||200 million Covid-19 vaccine doses pledged for ‘equitable’ use||Drugmakers Sanofi and GSK said Wednesday they would set aside 200 million doses of a future coronavirus vaccine for a global initiative to ensure equitable distribution, including in poor countries.There has been great concern about fair access to Covid-19 vaccines as rich countries have bought up billions of doses long before a jab has even been approved.Several dozen vaccine candidates are in clinical trials and ten are in the most advanced “phase 3” stage involving tens of thousands of volunteers.The French and British drug giants said they had signed a statement of intent with the Gavi alliance, which administers the Covax plan for fair vaccine distribution.“Both companies intend to contribute to Covax’s ambition to ensure successful Covid-19 vaccines reach those in need, whoever they are and wherever they live, once they obtain appropriate approvals,” a statement said.On Sunday, the World Health Organization warned against “vaccine nationalism” and underlined that global protection can only be attained with widespread vaccination.More than 180 countries and economies have signed up to the Covax plan, which seeks to “equitably allocate and deliver” two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.Last month, Gavi said 200 million vaccine doses had been secured for delivery to poor countries.It had also signed up with AstraZeneca for access to another 300 million doses of its candidate vaccine, but those would be made available to all participants in Covax, not just poorer countries.“Gavi is seeking to secure doses of the most promising vaccine candidates -- so that the 184 participants involved in the Covax Facility can make sure their most at-risk groups ... have rapid access to doses of a safe and effective vaccine,” the initiative’s CEO Seth Berkley said.“That is the world’s best chance to end the acute stage of this pandemic, and we encourage other vaccine manufacturers to work with us towards that shared global goal.”Sanofi and GSK said they hope to start Phase 3 trials before the end of the year.If successful, they plan to seek regulatory approval from the first half of 2021.In the meantime, the companies said they are scaling up manufacturing of the vaccine’s antigen and adjuvant component parts.According to Oxfam a group of wealthy nations representing just 13 percent of the global population have already bought up more than half of the doses of future Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/200-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-pledged-for-equitable-use/story-DonhVylV79pjIiUlGZT2aO.html
28-10-2020||World||Covid: Japan PM Suga to announce plan for new stimulus package to ease pandemic pain||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will announce next week a plan for fresh stimulus to help the recession-stricken economy shake off the coronavirus crisis, four government and ruling party sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Although the size of the package has yet to be decided, some ruling party lawmakers have already called for one of about 10 trillion yen ($95.51 billion) to cushion the blow from the pandemic.The bulk of the package will consist of about 7 trillion yen left over from a 10 trillion yen pool set aside to meet emergency needs to combat the pandemic, the sources told Reuters. The rest will be made up of new spending, they added.The total size of the package will likely be smaller than a combined $2.2 trillion rolled out in two earlier stimulus packages this year, they said.“It’s better to avoid making Japan’s fiscal cliff even steeper” by ramping up near-term spending too much, one of the sources said.The package is likely to include extensions to existing programmes offering subsidies to help companies keep jobs and address funding strains, the sources said.The government is also expected to extend past January a campaign offering discounts to domestic travel to rescue the country’s tourism industry, the sources said.A third extra budget will be compiled around mid-December to fund part of the package, they added.After posting its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, Japan’s economy is expected to have rebounded in the three months through September.But the recovery has been patchy and fragile, as continued weakness in consumption and capital expenditure offset a rebound in exports and output, keeping policymakers under pressure to top up fiscal and monetary support.Analysts, however, say the expected new stimulus package will have only a limited effect in boosting growth.“The size of the package isn’t expected to be that large,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “That means the measures will likely focus on putting a floor on growth, rather than stimulating the economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-japan-pm-suga-to-announce-plan-for-new-stimulus-package-to-ease-pandemic-pain/story-hdwGuwmiRgdVXPh1vIxdeO.html
28-10-2020||World||Early Covid-19 vaccines may be imperfect: UK Vaccine Taskforce||UK Vaccine Taskforce Chair Kate Bingham said on Tuesday that the first generation of Covid-19 vaccines “is likely to be imperfect” and that they “might not work for everyone”.“However, we do not know that we will ever have a vaccine at all. It is important to guard against complacency and over-optimism”, Bingham wrote in a piece published in The Lancet medical journal. Also Read: Genes may decide the coronavirus disease path | Opinion“The first generation of vaccines is likely to be imperfect, and we should be prepared that they might not prevent infection but rather reduce symptoms, and, even then, might not work for everyone or for long,” she added.Bingham wrote that the Vaccine Taskforce recognises that “many, and possibly all, of these vaccines could fail”, adding the focus has been on vaccines that are expected to elicit immune responses in the population older than 65 years.She said that the global manufacturing capacity for vaccines is vastly inadequate for the billions of doses that are needed and that the United Kingdom’s manufacturing capability to date has been “equally scarce”.Earlier on Tuesday, a study by scientists at Imperial College London found that antibodies against the novel coronavirus declined rapidly in the British population during the summer, suggesting protection after infection may not be long lasting and raising the prospect of waning immunity in the community.The Telegraph newspaper reported that the British government is working on the assumption that the second wave of coronavirus will be more deadly than the first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-covid-19-vaccines-may-be-imperfect-uk-vaccine-taskforce/story-4TOkSKowTIi6e5aQ2zzO1L.html
28-10-2020||World||Australia’s second-largest city ends 111-day Covid-19 lockdown||Coffee business owner Darren Silverman pulled his van over and wept when he heard on the radio that Melbourne’s pandemic lockdown would be largely lifted on Wednesday after 111 days.Silverman was making a home delivery Monday when the announcement was made that restrictions in Australia’s second-largest city would be relaxed. He was overwhelmed with emotions and a sense of relief.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“The difficulty over the journey, when you’ve put 30 years of your life into something that’s suddenly taken away with the prospect of not returning through no fault of your own — I felt like I could be forgiven for pulling over and having a bit of a sob to myself,” he said.According to the Victoria state government the lockdown changes will allow 6,200 retail stores, 5,800 cafés and restaurants, 1,000 beauty salons and 800 pubs to reopen, impacting 180,000 jobs.Crowds on the city’s streets — where mask wearing remains compulsory — were still thin Wednesday since Melbourne residents are still restricted to travelling no more than 25 kilometers (16 miles) from home and most of the city’s office blocks remain empty as work-from-home orders continue.And while there were pedestrians on the downtown Bourke Street Mall, it was also clear from the number of now empty shops that many retail outlets and eateries did not survive the lockdown, the city’s second since the pandemic began.But many that are left are reporting record demand from the city’s pandemic weary residents, with some restaurants already fully booked a month in advance now that they are no longer restricted to takeout.“People are anxious to get out, to be able to sit outside at a table and have a cup of a coffee or something to eat,” café owner Maria Iatrou said. “People are really enjoying it and it’s going to be a bit of a crush for the next few weeks while people get that out of their system.”The lockdown had been particularly tough on those in Melbourne because the rest of Australia beyond Victoria successfully contained second waves of infections without increasing restrictions. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews faced enormous pressure from businesses and the federal government to reopen for the sake of the economy.Andrews resisted until Monday, when he announced the relaxation hours after the state recorded no new infections in the latest 24-hour period. It was the first time Melbourne had gone a day without a new infection since June 9 and the milestone was celebrated on social media as Donut Day.Tuesday was another Donut Day, Melbourne’s first consecutive days with no new infections since March 5 and 6. Two new cases were reported on Wednesday, but they were infected by known cases and were already in isolation.Andrews thanked the retail and hospitality industries for working with his government to safely reopen.“They know and understand deep down that we’ve all got to be Covid-safe, we’ve all got to follow the rules to protect staff, to protect customers, but also to protect this fragile thing that we’ve all built,” Andrews said, referring to containment of the virus.Iatrou said the lockdown was difficult both professionally and personally. Her café struggled through by selling takeout and delivery. Even worse, she lost her uncle and godmother to Covid-19 and could not attend their funerals because of pandemic restrictions.They were in aged care, where most of Victoria’s 819 coronavirus deaths have been recorded. Only 88 people have died of Covid-19 elsewhere in Australia.“Unless you were here, it’s difficult to understand what kind of a toll it does have on you,” Iatrou said of the lockdown. “It’s a strain to get through most days.”Mary Poulakis said she’s thrilled to have reopened the upscale clothing boutique she’s owned for 35 years in suburban Coburg. She also said there’s no way she would obey a third lockdown.“It’s been tumultuous. It’s been like a roller coaster. You’re up, you’re down. You’re open, you’re closed. You’re on, you’re off,” Poulakis said.“I’m staying open. I cannot close my doors again,“ she added.Silverman, the coffee business owner, said he was pleased to be open again not just for business reasons, but for the mental well-being of staff, some of whom had been isolating alone at home for months.His business has been able to sell wholesale coffee to cafes and online, but he says his downtown café though now open will struggle until office workers return.“We’re told that stay-at-home order in terms of office workers will probably be in place for the foreseeable future, certainly into the New Year, which is going to make life in the C.B.D. for retailers and hospitality very, very difficult,” he said, referring to Melbourne’s central business district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-second-largest-city-ends-111-day-covid-19-lockdown/story-mE7gG6p8ZKhxu7efQz7s4K.html
28-10-2020||World||Louisiana braces for third hurricane strike this year as ‘Zeta’ approaches||Louisiana braced Wednesday for what is expected to be its third hurricane strike this year as Zeta, the 27th named storm of a historically busy Atlantic hurricane season, headed toward an expected landfall south of New Orleans.Zeta raked across the Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday, striking as a hurricane, before weakening to a tropical storm. It’s forecast to regain hurricane strength before hitting the Gulf Coast sometime Wednesday evening.Hurricane warnings stretched from Morgan City, Louisiana, along the Mississippi coast to the Alabama state line. Late Tuesday, the storm had sustained winds of 65 mph (105 kph) and was centered 410 miles (655 kilometers) south-southwest of the Mississippi River’s mouth.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards asked President Donald Trump for a disaster declaration ahead of the storm. He and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey both declared emergencies, as did Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich in Biloxi, Mississippi. Trump declared an emergency for Louisiana Tuesday evening.“There’s no doubt that we’ve seen a lot this year, with Covid and so many threats from so many storms,” Gilich said in a news release, “but this storm shows that we haven’t seen it all yet.” The storm approached as New Orleans officials announced that a turbine that generates power to the city’s aging drainage pump system broke down Sunday, with no quick repair in sight. There was enough power to keep the pumps operating if needed but it left authorities with little excess power to tap should a breakdown of other turbines occur, officials said at a news conference with Mayor LaToya Cantrell.Officials said they were running through contingencies to provide power and make repairs where needed should there be other equipment problems. Forecasts, meanwhile, called for anywhere from 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 centimeters) of rain to fall in the New Orleans area. Officials noted that Zeta is expected to be a relatively fast-moving storm, possibly mitigating the flood threat.Zeta broke the record for the previous earliest 27th Atlantic named storm that formed Nov. 29, 2005. It’s also the 11th hurricane of the season. An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms.The extraordinarily busy hurricane season has focused attention on the role of climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.Louisiana has been hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes: Laura, blamed for at least 27 Louisiana deaths after it struck in August, and Delta, which exacerbated Laura’s damage in the same area just weeks later. New Orleans has been in the warning area for potential tropical cyclones seven times this year but has seen them veer to the east or west.“I don’t think we’re going to be as lucky with this one,” city emergency director Colin Arnold said.Another approaching storm piled on more worries for evacuees from previous hurricanes. The state is sheltering about 3,600 evacuees from Laura and Delta, most in New Orleans area hotels.“I’m physically and mentally tired,” a distraught Yolanda Lockett of Lake Charles said, standing outside a New Orleans hotel.Meanwhile, many along the coast renewed an unwanted ritual of preparation.On Dauphin Island, off the Alabama coast, workers at Dauphin Island Marina prepared for Zeta, although there was little left to protect after Hurricane Sally hit in September.“We don’t have any docks or fuel pumps at this point. Sally took it all out,” employee Jess Dwaileebe said.In Louisiana’s coastal St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans, Robert Campo readied his marina, again, for an approaching storm. “We’re down for four or five days, that’s four or five days nobody’s fishing. That’s four or five days nobody is shrimping. That’s four or five days, no economic wheels are turning,” he said.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Thomas Hymel, an extension agent in Jeanerette with the LSU Agricultural Center, said of this year’s series of storms and other troubles. He said the storms have meant more than a month of down time for seafood harvesters, many of whom are suffering a drop in demand from restaurants due to the coronavirus pandemic.

28-10-2020||World||Turkish leaders condemn Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Erdogan||Turkish officials on Wednesday railed against French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo over its cover-page cartoon mocking Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and accused it of sowing “the seeds of hatred and animosity.”The cartoon could further heighten tensions between Turkey and France, which erupted over French President Emmanuel Macron’s firm stance against Islamism following the beheading of a teacher who showed his class caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad for a free speech class.The Prophet cartoons upset many in the Muslim world. But it was Erdogan who led the charge against France and questioned Macron’s mental state. France then recalled its ambassador to Turkey for consultations, a first in French-Turkish diplomatic relations.“We strongly condemn the publication concerning our president of the French magazine, which has no respect to faith, the sacred and values,” Erdogan’s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, wrote on Twitter.Kalin said: “The aim of these publications, that are devoid of morality and decency, is to sow seeds of hatred and animosity. To turn freedom of expression into hostility towards religion and belief can only be the product of a sick mentality.”The cartoon depicted Erdogan in his underwear holding a drink and lifting the skirt of a woman wearing an Islamic dress.“I condemn this incorrigible French rag’s immoral publication concerning our president,” Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter. “I call on the moral and conscientious international community to speak out against this disgrace.”Macron’s stance sparked anti-France protests in Turkey and in other Muslim countries as well as calls for the boycott of French good.Tensions between France and Turkey have mounted in recent months over Turkish actions in Syria, Libya and the Caucasus Mountains region of Nagorno-Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-leaders-condemn-charlie-hebdo-cartoon-of-erdogan/story-Q3sxYvHBwOtudNdzgwr03K.html
28-10-2020||World||Mike Pompeo brings Trump administration’s ‘anti-China’ campaign to Sri Lanka, Maldives||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday brought the Trump administration’s anti-China campaign to two Indian Ocean island nations considered particularly at risk for what American officials allege is Chinese exploitation.Pompeo is visiting Sri Lanka and the Maldives to press the two countries to be on guard against potential predatory lending and investment by China. He was making the case less than a week before the American election in which President Donald Trump is seeking to paint his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, as weak on China and beholden to it.Even before Pompeo arrived in Sri Lanka, China had fired back at the US message, accusing Washington of bullying smaller nations. Pompeo, who will also visit the Maldives and Indonesia, will press each nation to push back against increasing Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.US officials complain development and infrastructure projects benefit China more than the presumed recipients — a refrain Pompeo repeated with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. Pompeo said the country could be “a beacon” for freedom and democracy in the region as long as it retained its “full sovereignty.”“That is quite a contrast to what China seeks,” Pompeo said. “The Chinese Communist Party is a predator. The United States comes in a different way. We come as a friend and a partner.”Gunawardena appeared unwilling to get involved in the spat with China, and said Sri Lanka is willing to cooperate with all friendly countries.“Sri Lanka is a neutral, non-aligned country committed to peace,” he said. “We hope to continue in our relations with the United States and with other parties.”Earlier this month, Beijing announced it would provide Sri Lanka with a $90-million grant to help rural development, after President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa sought help from a visiting Chinese delegation in disproving a perception that China-funded megaprojects are “debt traps.”China considers Sri Lanka to be a critical link in its massive “Belt and Road” global infrastructure building initiative and has provided billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade. The projects include a seaport, airport, port-city, highways and power stations.Critics like the US say that the Chinese-funded projects are not financially viable and that Sri Lanka will face difficulties in repaying the loans.In 2017, Sri Lanka leased out a Chinese-built port located near busy shipping routes to a Chinese company for 99 years to recover from the heavy burden of repaying the Chinese loan the country received to build it.Ahead of Pompeo’s arrival in Colombo, the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka denounced his visit, accusing one of his top aides of making unacceptable threats against the country. In those comments, the top U.S. diplomat for South Asia, Dean Thompson, urged Sri Lanka “to make difficult but necessary decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity.”The Chinese Embassy said the comments were a “blatant violation” of diplomatic protocols and also chided the US for organizing Pompeo’s 24-hour visit and imposing a major logistical burden on the country, which. like much of the rest of the world is in the midst of a spiraling surge in coronavirus cases.“Does this approach truly prove your respect to the host country? Is it helpful to local epidemic prevention and control? Is it in the interests of the Sri Lankan people?” the embassy said in a statement.The US-China tug-of-war plays out against concerns that the Sri Lankan government is backsliding on democratic reforms. Last week, Parliament by a large majority approved a constitutional amendment concentrating powers under Rajapaksa and reversing efforts a previous government had made to curb authoritarianism.With the change, Rajapaksa will be able to hold ministries, as well as appoint and sack ministers. He will also be the appointing authority of the elections, public service, police, human rights, bribery or corruption investigation commissions.In his meeting with Rajapaska, Pompeo “stressed the importance of strengthening democratic governance, human rights protections, and of fundamental freedoms to ensure long-term stability and prosperity,” the State Department said in a statement.Sri Lanka has been ruled under a powerful executive presidential system since 1978, but a reformist government in 2015 clipped much of the president’s powers and gave them over to Parliament and independent commissions, saying successive presidents had been more authoritarian.Pompeo arrived in Sri Lanka late Tuesday from India, where he and Defense Secretary Mark Esper had stepped up the Trump administration’s anti-China message by playing on Indian suspicions about the Chinese to shore up a regional front against Beijing in the Indo-Pacific.Just hours before the meetings in New Delhi began, the Trump administration notified Congress of plans for a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan — the second major arms sale in two weeks to the democratic island that Beijing regards as a renegade province. China angrily reacted to the first sale by announcing sanctions on US defense contractors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-brings-trump-administration-s-anti-china-campaign-to-sri-lanka-maldives/story-K8IvFU3eI0uVfJnQTjFAiP.html

A baby girl had earlier been found in a trash can at the airport, concealed in a plastic bag in what “appeared to be a shocking and appalling attempt to kill her,” the Qatari government’s communications office said in a statement.“While the aim of the urgently decided search was to prevent the perpetrators of the horrible crime from escaping, the State of Qatar regrets any distress or infringement on the personal freedoms of any traveler caused by this action,” the statement said. The baby, whose mother has not been located, is safe and receiving medical care in Doha, it added.Australian officials told a government committee hearing in Canberra on Wednesday that in addition to 18 women on a Qatar Airways flight to Sydney, another nine flights had been searched and Australia was working closely with other countries on the issue, without naming the countries.“Other countries affected absolutely share Australia’s views and the strength of Australia’s views,” said Frances Adamson, secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. “This is not by any standard normal behaviour and the Qataris recognise that, are appalled by it, do not want it to happen again.”Australia was notified of the incident by a female Australian diplomat who was on the flight and was “shocked at what happened”, Adamson added. The Australian diplomat was not searched. The results of the investigation will be shared with international partners, the Qatari statement said.“The Qatari investigation is to determine which laws might have been violated, any individuals responsible, and recommend disciplinary and prosecutorial action where appropriate,” a source with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters.Human Rights Watch said in a statement Qatar should prohibit forced gynecological exams, and it was also concerned at the circumstances that may have led to a baby being abandoned. Sexual relations outside of wedlock are criminalised in Qatar, with hospitals required to report pregnant women to authorities.Human Rights Watch senior researcher Rothna Begum said the alleged actions of Qatari authorities had “failed many women – the unknown woman apparently forced to give birth in an airport toilet, unable to ask for assistance with her labour or on what to do with the baby, and the multiple women reportedly pulled off the plane for examinations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatar-expresses-regret-as-australia-says-women-on-10-flights-searched/story-OC6FIdRysvPNNIFgslIeKI.html
28-10-2020||World||Trump campaign shifts Florida ad spending burden to Republican National Committee||Donald Trump’s campaign has slashed its advertising budget in Florida, relying on the Republican National Committee to carry the message there as the president’s re-election effort moves resources to the industrial northern states that carried him to victory in 2016.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020Since Labor Day, Trump has cut $24 million from his national ad budget, while former Vice President Joe Biden has added $197 million. Biden has outspent Trump three-to-one over that time nationally, according to data compiled from ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics.The president’s campaign still has $350,275 budgeted to spend on ads in Florida through Election Day, but has cancelled $5.5 million in the final two weeks of the campaign, the data showed.The RNC is picking up some of that slack, buying $4 million in ads beginning last week. It’s now airing an ad in Florida attacking Biden on Medicare, falsely claiming that the Biden health care plan would eliminate private health insurance.By comparison, Biden has booked $16.7 million in ads in Florida for the last 15 days of the campaign, compared with $4.3 million for Trump and the RNC, according to Advertising Analytics.The Trump campaign held a call with reporters on Tuesday to discuss Biden’s positions on fracking and the state of play in Pennsylvania. Communications Director Tim Murtaugh said the campaign’s organizational strength in Florida would carry the state into Trump’s column on Election Night as Republicans get more in-person voters to the polls.“We are spending more in Florida, and we are winning big in Florida,” Trump said in a tweet late Tuesday night after a campaign rally in Nebraska.‘Ground Game’“You have to have a ground game. Joe Biden does not have one. The president does,” Murtaugh said. “That’s why you saw the president close the gap in Florida.”Campaigns often lock in advertising time early in the campaign, reserving the best time slots at the lowest rates. They often move that time to other states, stations or time slots as they adjust their strategies.The Trump campaign said publicly available data doesn’t account for all its television spending, which includes local cable systems not included in Advertising Analytics data. The campaign said it has $61 million of television ads already booked through the election.Kaelan Dorr, the Trump campaign’s chief marketing officer, said it is spending six figures on Spanish-language ads, six figures on cable and six figures on radio in Florida.“Our TV budget in the state has remained consistent week by week. We have invested seven figures in the state this week alone. We’re up 4 points in polls, we’re up consistently and we kind of look forward to celebrating with the people on November,” Dorr said.The RNC, however, is now paying for those ads.Biden and Trump are effectively tied in the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the state.About 312,000 more registered Republicans have voted in person in Florida than registered Democrats since early voting began a week ago. But Democrats lead by more than 615,000 votes in mail-in voting, according to the US Elections Project, giving Democrats a 41.8% to 37.1% overall advantage.“Florida is going to go the president’s way,” Murtaugh said.The Trump campaign itself is now placing most of his advertising budget on just four battleground states: Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania, with advertising buys of more than $1 million in each state. Polls show he’s behind in all those states but Ohio, where he and Biden are effectively tied.The Biden campaign has added $41 million to its ad budget in the home stretch, pouring more money into every battleground state except Texas. Through Election Day, the campaign has budgeted $8.3 million in Florida, $7.1 million in Pennsylvania, $5.3 million in Michigan and $4.9 million in North Carolina.In the final week, Biden is set to outspend Trump in every battleground state except for Minnesota and Ohio, where Biden still maintains an overall advantage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-shifts-florida-ad-spending-burden-to-republican-national-committee/story-aA2zZI07mOudlSr1acM6uK.html
28-10-2020||World||Canada passes 10,000 deaths due to Covid-19 pandemic||Canada’s death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic has crossed 10,000, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warning that if the current trajectory of the winter surge continues, it may well impact family gatherings during the upcoming Christmas season.Fatalities reached 10,000 on Tuesday, with an additional 28 deaths reported in the country, while the total confirmed cases spiked to 222,654, an increase of over 20% over the past fortnight. Some of that was attributed by public health officials to the gatherings to celebrate Thanksgiving in the country on October 12, with the virus being spread during the period and reflecting in the latest uptick in numbers.The Canadian PM said the current second wave conditions in the country “sucks”. Given that context, Trudeau underscored that people’s behaviour in the weeks ahead could dictate how Christmas is observed this year. “Unless we’re really, really careful, there may not be the kinds of family gatherings we want to have at Christmas,” he said, during a media interaction.“It’s going to be a tough winter,” he said, even as the tallies for new infections have recorded new highs in several provinces like Ontario and Quebec in recent days, surpassing single-day numbers during the peak of the coronavirus crisis in spring this year. However, even as cases mount, deaths remain relatively low when compared with March and April.The spike is partly being driven by Covid “fatigue” among younger Canadians, with those in the 20 to 29 bracket accounting for 18% of new cases, the largest group, with nearly 50% of fresh infections being reported from those below the age of 40.However, authorities have also said that more restrictive measures like the sort of lockdowns seen earlier this year are not under consideration at this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-passes-10-000-deaths-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-He3OmQGNaM5yahkIZL8d5M.html

28-10-2020||World||Biden goes on the offensive in Republican country, Trump seeks to defend turf||Democratic candidate Joe Biden went on the offensive on Tuesday with rallies in Georgia, hoping to breach the Republican stronghold and expand the battle ground as President Donald Trump played defence, holding rallies in key states that won him the presidency in 2016.“You know, there aren’t a lot of pundits who would have guessed four years ago that the Democratic candidate for president in 2020 would be campaigning in Georgia one week before Election Day,” Biden told supporters at a drive-in rally in Atlanta, the second of his Georgia rallies.He added: “But we do—because something is happening.”FiveThirtyEight has Biden ahead of Trump by 1.1 percentage points, in the average of polls in Georgia, but RealClearPolitics has him trailing the president by 0.4 points. It’s a tie, in effect, but in a state that has not voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1992, when Bill Clinton took it in a three-way fight in which an independent had split the Republican votes with sitting President George H W Bush.The former vice-president believes he has a chance in Georgia, with down-ballot implications for two Senate races. And as a sign of his growing confidence, he plans to also campaign in Iowa, on Friday, just three days before close of polling — Trump won the state by 9.5 percentage points in 2016 but now trails by a thin margin.The American president held rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin — the two states that won him the presidency in 2016 with Pennsylvania — and Nebraska, a conservative state that comes into play because of its unique system (which it shares only with Maine) of granting electoral college votes by congressional districts, not winner-takes-all.The rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin came amidst a surge in Covid-19 there. The president delivered the same narrative that he has before — he diminished the epidemic claiming it is waning and ridiculed the coverage in the media saying it will be over the day after polling.It’s all about “Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid …” on television now, he said at a rally in Lansing, Michigan, venting his frustration with the epidemic. He also framed the election as a choice between the “Trump recovery” and “Biden depression”, claiming his Democratic rival will shut down the country again, pushing it into depression.Trump is trailing Biden in both Wisconsin and Michigan — by 7.1 percentage points and 8.3 points respectively in the FiveThirtyEight average of polls and by 5.5 points and 9 points in the RealClearPolitics average. His path to victory will shrink dramatically without these states.With just seven days to the close of polling, both candidates deployed their surrogates across the battleground states to keep up the momentum. First Lady Melania Trump addressed her first rally this cycle in Chester, Pennsylvania, the most critical of the key states this election.And former President Barack Obama was in Orlando, Florida, where he launched a scathing attack on Trump. “What’s his closing argument? That people are too focused on Covid,” he said at a rally, referencing the president’s complaints about the epidemic. “He said this at one of his rallies. ‘Covid, Covid, Covid’ he’s complaining,” Obama said. “He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-goes-on-the-offensive-in-republican-country-trump-seeks-to-defend-turf/story-T2qx7XWjQLpuyama6jIDBO.html
28-10-2020||World||Sharp spike in China Covid cases including 22 in Xinjiang||China has reported 42 new cases of Covid-19 including 22 local transmissions, recording the sharpest increase in several weeks, national health authorities said on Wednesday.Tuesday’s tally was sharply up from 16 on Monday, with all the 22 new local cases reported in the past 24 hours from the remote Xinjiang region’s Kashgar prefecture.The national health commission (NHC) and Xinjiang health authorities said the local infections were asymptomatic cases that were re-categorised as confirmed ones.All were reported in Shufu county of Kashgar, the Xinjiang health commission said, adding that 19 new asymptomatic cases were also reported on Tuesday.By Tuesday night, the autonomous region had completed Covid-19 testing for all 4.75 million people in Kashgar following the recent local cases, state media reported.Apart from the confirmed and asymptomatic cases, the remaining population had tested negative for the disease, Li Linyu from the Kashgar prefectural health commission told a press conference.Li said investigations have shown the new cases have no relation to the cluster in the regional capital of Urumqi in July and source tracing for the new cases in Shufu was underway.Experts have told Chinese state media that the origin of the latest flare-up in Kashgar remains to be determined. An official from the prefecture told the tabloid Global Times that none of the asymptomatic patients had any contact with cold-chain products or with wild animals. A virologist told the tabloid that it is not certain if the virus that caused the Kashgar outbreak was local or imported.“More epidemiological surveys need to be done to find out, such as contact with people from other countries, or international flights,” the tabloid reported.As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 85,868. Of them, 298 patients were still being treated, including four in severe condition.Altogether 80,936 patients had been discharged after recovery, and 4,634 had died of the disease on the mainland, the NHC said in its daily report on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sharp-spike-in-china-covid-cases-including-22-in-xinjiang/story-xbFPqbCWTHsjQdutiz6kyH.html
28-10-2020||World||Social media CEOs to face grilling from Republican senators||Less than a week before Election Day, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google are set to be grilled by Republican senators making unfounded allegations that the tech giants show anti-conservative bias. Democrats want to expand the discussion to include issues such as the companies’ impact on local news.The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives have agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.With the election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech’s social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden’s son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.Trump, asked by reporters about the companies Tuesday as he left Washington for the campaign trail, said they are trying to suppress revelations of Joe Biden’s “corruption.”“They don’t want to show corruption, like you have with Biden. That’s totally corruption, and everybody knows it,” Trump said. “It’s very unfair. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. It’s not freedom of the press, it’s the opposite.”Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.Starting Tuesday, Facebook is not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators will examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.The tech platforms are gateways to news online. Critics say their dominant position in the advertising market has crushed the struggling US news industry, especially local news publishers.A report issued Tuesday by the committee’s Democratic staff cited the additional devastating impact of the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. About 7,000 newspaper employees are expected to be laid off this year, and newspaper revenues will be down 70% from two decades ago, according to the report.“Local news is an incredible engine for the creation of accurate information. We don’t want to lose that infrastructure,” Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the panel’s top Democrat, said in an interview.The Democrats’ report accuses the big platforms of unfairly using news content, taking news consumers’ data and diverting customers from local news websites, with little compensation. It proposes that Congress enact rules preventing tech platforms from taking local news content without fair payment.“These unfair and abusive practices should be called out,” Cantwell said.Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the USFacebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views — a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump’s presidential campaign.The Trump administration’s Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies’ limitations “quite concerning.”Trump signed an executive orde r this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law. A provision known as Section 230 has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.“For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,” Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the committee chairman, said recently.The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump’s order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency’s previous position.The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising — the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.With antitrust in the spotlight, Facebook, Apple and Amazon also are under investigation at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-media-ceos-to-face-grilling-from-republican-senators/story-F5jPZTaltSr3ebMrNHGPvI.html
28-10-2020||World||Joe Biden vows his unity can save United States||Joe Biden traveled Tuesday to the hot springs town where Franklin Delano Roosevelt coped with polio to declare the US is not too politically diseased to overcome its health and economic crises, pledging to be the unifying force who can “restore our soul and save this country.”The Democratic presidential nominee offered his closing argument with Election Day just one week away while attempting to go on the political offensive in Georgia, which hasn’t backed a Democrat for the White House since 1992. He promised to be a president for all Americans regardless of party, even as he said that “anger and suspicion is growing and our wounds are getting deeper.”“Has the heart of this nation turned to stone? I don’t think so,” Biden said. “I refuse to believe it.”While Biden worked to expand the electoral map in the South, President Donald Trump focused on the Democrats’ “blue wall” states that he flipped in 2016 — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — and maintained a far busier travel schedule taking him to much more of the country.At a cold, rain-soaked rally in the Michigan capital of Lansing, Trump said that Biden supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, both of which he said hurt the auto industry and other manufacturing in the state.“This election is a matter of economic survival for Michigan,” the president said, arguing that the state’s economy was strong before the coronavirus pandemic hit. “Look what I’ve done.”Trump also cheered Senate candidate John James — who may ultimately have a better chance of winning the state than the president — while attacking Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for moving aggressively to shut down much of the state’s economy to slow the virus’ spread. He even seemed to cast doubt on federal authorities breaking up what they said was a plot to kidnap her, which Whitmer has argued Trump’s “violent rhetoric” helped spark.“It was our people that helped her out with her problem. And we’ll have to see if it’s a problem. Right?” Trump said. “People are entitled to say ‘maybe it was a problem. Maybe it wasn’t.’”Biden, even as he predicted the country could rise above politics, went after his election rival, accusing Trump anew of bungling the federal response to the pandemic that has seen new cases surging in many areas, and failing to manage the economic fallout or combat institutional racism and police brutality that have sparked widespread demonstrations.“The tragic truth of our time is that Covid has left a deep and lasting wound in this country,” Biden said, scoffing at Trump’s pronouncements that the nation is turning a corner on the virus. He charged that the president has “shrugged. He’s swaggered. And he’s surrendered.”Venturing into Georgia was a sign of confidence by the Biden team, which is trying to stretch the electoral map and open up more paths to the needed 270 Electoral College votes. The former vice president plans to travel to Iowa, which Trump took by 10 points in 2016, later in the week. And his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, is hitting Arizona and deep red Texas.Besides Lansing, Trump was traveling to West Salem, Wisconsin. First lady Melania Trump was on the road, too, making her first solo campaign trip of the year in Pennsylvania. And Vice President Mike Pence was in South Carolina, maintaining his campaign schedule despite several close aides testing positive for the coronavirus last weekend. There, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is in a potentially tight reelection race.Hillary Clinton flirted with GOP territory in 2016, only to lose traditional Democratic Midwestern strongholds. But a top Biden adviser rejected the notion that the campaign is spreading itself too thin, noting that the former vice president’s visit follows weeks of paid advertising in Georgia and visits by Harris and the candidate’s wife, Jill Biden.Biden will also visit in coming days Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida, where former President Barack Obama gave a speech in Orlando on Tuesday, blistering Trump as only worrying about the virus because it was dominating news coverage.“He’s jealous of Covid’s media coverage,” Obama said. “If he had been focused on Covid from the beginning, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country this week.”Trump expressed his displeasure that Fox News carried his Democratic predecessor’s speech live, complaining to reporters about it and tweeting the network was “playing Obama’s no crowd, fake speech for Biden.”In Atglen, Pennsylvania, Melania Trump said she was feeling “so much better now,” just weeks after being diagnosed with the virus. She slammed Biden’s “socialist agenda,” praised her husband as “a fighter,” and also commented on the president’s use of social media.“I don’t always agree the way he says things,” she said, drawing laughter from the crowd, “but it is important to him that he speaks directly to the people he serves.”The Trumps left for their campaign trips at the same time, and the president gave the first lady a quick peck on the cheek before they boarded separate planes.The president will also visit Omaha, Nebraska, after a Sunday stop in Maine. That anticipates a razor-thin Electoral College margin since both areas offer one electoral vote by congressional district.While Biden rarely travels to more than one state per day, the Republican president has maintained a whirlwind schedule, focusing on his argument that he built a booming economy before the coronavirus pandemic upended it. Trump is planning a dizzying 11 rallies in the final 48 hours before polls close.His latest swing is also something of a victory lap after the Senate on Monday approved the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to give conservatives a commanding 6-3 advantage on the Supreme Court. Trump has sought to use the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg lo animate conservative evangelical and Catholic voters, though the high court fight has been overshadowed by concerns over the coronavirus with cases surging.Biden, meanwhile, is hoping to lift Democrats running for Senate in Georgia and Iowa. He was visiting Atlanta after his address in Warm Springs, where Roosevelt sought treatment while governing a nation weathering the Great Depression and World War II.“This place, Warm Springs, is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healed,” Biden said. “That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.”His appearance was meant to bookend his visit earlier this month to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, when Biden used the site of the bloody Civil War battle to issue a call for putting country ahead of party. On Tuesday, he evoked Roosevelt’s New Deal sensitivities to say he could harness the power of the government to move the country forward.“If you give me the honor of serving as your president, clear the decks for action,” he said. “For we will act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-his-unity-can-save-united-states/story-xhUr1X2MYQDnfqB3teX1TN.html
28-10-2020||World||Thailand pro-democracy movement: Student protesters aim for ambitious political change||He was only 7 when he saw his first military coup. He was 15 during the second. Now 21, he is among those at the front of Thailand’s growing pro-democracy movement pushing for sweeping political reforms.And because of his activities, Bunkueanun Paothong has been charged with crimes that could see him jailed for the rest of his life.“I took a stand I know that would be risky,” Bunkueanun said. “I stand firm in my principles and beliefs. Because it’s the right thing for me to do.”Fed up with an archaic educational system and enraged by the military’s efforts to keep control over their nation, the student-led campaign that began earlier this year has shaken Thailand’s ruling establishment with the most significant campaign for political change in years.The protesters have three main demands: They want Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s resignation; changes to a constitution that was drafted under military rule; and, most controversially, reforms to the constitutional monarchy.Political protest is nothing new in Thailand, and its past 15 years have been defined by it. Whether it was the red-shirted supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra or his yellow-shirted conservative opponents, some group could be counted on every few years to seize an airport, occupy a government building or blockade a key road in a bid to topple the government.And like clockwork, the courts or the military could be counted on to intervene. Prayuth, a former general, first came to power in a 2014 coup.But never before have protesters made such open calls for the reform of the monarchy in a country where reverence for the royal institution is inculcated from birth and protected by a law that makes defaming senior royals punishable by prison. The calls have infuriated some, resonated with others and most certainly complicated any solution to the latest crisis.“We won’t back down, we won’t retreat and we won’t be open for talks until the government agrees on the three demands,” said Chonticha Changrew, who at 27 is one of the more senior protest organizers.Many of those on the streets spent much of their lives living under military rule, and those old enough to vote got their first real chance last year. They flocked to a new party — Future Forward — whose smart and charismatic young leaders espoused a strong anti-military viewpoint.The party shocked the establishment by winning the third-most seats. The military’s proxy party was able to cobble together a ruling coalition that put Prayuth back in the prime minister’s post. But Future Forward looked like it had room to grow.Then in February, the Constitutional Court ruled Future Forward had violated campaign finance laws, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics for 10 years.The students, already upset at what they saw as an undemocratic constitution that shifted power away from elected politicians to appointed bodies aligned with the military, took to the streets.“What motivates the student protesters is that they see the ‘game’ of politics as being fixed,” said Chris Ankersen, an associate professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies Center for Global Affairs, who previously worked with the U.N. in Bangkok.The initial protests barely had time to spread before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and the students retreated. They returned in July, when the virus threat eased, and pushed their core demands of new elections, constitutional changes and an end to intimidation of activists.The protests gathered steam and took a stunning turn in August, when a few students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticized King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany. Among their calls were for greater oversight of royal budgets and an end to the practice of Thai monarchs endorsing military coups.While shocking to many, it emboldened others.Events escalated on Oct. 14 when protesters heckled a royal motorcade that unexpectedly passed nearby. Security personnel stood between the vehicles and the crowd, and there was no visible violence.Nevertheless, Bunkueanun and two others were charged under an obscure criminal statute on committing violence against the queen, who was in one of the vehicles.“I was numbed, dumbstruck, and feared for my life,” Bunkueanun recalled. He turned himself in to police the next day and spent a day in jail before his release on bail.Prayuth and his government responded to the incident and the protests with their tested playbook, declaring a state of emergency for Bangkok that banned gatherings of more than four people and gave authorities other broad powers. That only led to even bigger protests and the government eventually removed the emergency decree to try to ease tensions.Prayuth has said he is open to some changes but has maintained that the monarchy should remain off-limits.“While I can listen to and acknowledge the demands of protesters, I cannot run the country based on protester or mob demands,” he said Monday, opening a special session of Parliament his government called to ease tensions.The students’ questioning of Thailand’s social structure is rooted in their experiences at school, said Thak Chaloemtiarana, a historian who has also been an administrator at Bangkok’s Thammasat University and Cornell University in the U.S.“The current movement, while led by a handful of university students, has attracted younger students who have become politicized through more news and information from the internet and social media, and spurred by how their teachers and school administrators suppress individualism and exercise authoritarian policies that control dress code, haircuts, gender choice, and ceremonies that are seen as originating from feudal times,” he said.In addition to political injustices, Thak said, young people were spurred to action by what they saw as the king’s accumulation of power and wealth with the acquiescence of the military, as well as the military’s needless expenditures during a pandemic-weakened economy.The protesters’ aim at the monarchy has led to counterprotests by royalists who allege the students are being used as pawns by unidentified powers behind the scenes.Unlike previous protests, today’s demonstrators are far younger and have no clear links to any group or party, making them appear untainted by past quarrels, said Allen Hicken, political science professor at the University of Michigan.The government has so far seemed indecisive about how to deal with the protests, torn between trying to placate or punish those involved. Neither approach has lessened the ardor or number of protesters, who adroitly use social media to organize short, quickly announced events that don’t require the infrastructure of past demonstrations.Police use of water cannons and chemical irritants against the young protesters this month drew broad public outrage, so it’s not clear if the government would push a more violent crackdown like those in 1973, 1976, 1992 and 2010.Chonticha is aware history is not on the protesters’ side, but she says in some ways they have already succeeded.“Our movement has changed the perception of Thais toward the monarchy and military,” she said. “If we cannot win this time, we still have planted the seed of criticism of the ruling elite and monarchy in the people’s minds.”___Associated Press journalists Tassanee Vejpongsa and Busaba Sivasomboon contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-pro-democracy-movement-student-protesters-aim-for-ambitious-political-change/story-cduo9bzULg1yI83Npn3gdI.html
28-10-2020||World||Philadelphia police shooting: Had called for ambulance and not police, victim’s kin say||The family of a Black man killed when Philadelphia police officers fired a dozen rounds in a shooting caught on video had called for an ambulance to get him help with a mental health crisis, not for police intervention, their lawyer said Tuesday.Additionally, Walter Wallace’s wife is pregnant and is scheduled to have labor induced in coming days, the lawyer, Shaka Johnson, told reporters from the steps of a family home. Wallace’s father planned a statement later Tuesday, Johnson said.Chief Police Inspector Frank Vanore said earlier at a news conference that police had received a call Monday about a man screaming and that he was armed with a knife.The two officers each fired at least seven rounds — at least 14 total shots — but could not say how many times Wallace, 27, was struck.Wallace’s father, Walter Wallace Sr., earlier told The Philadelphia Inquirer that his son was on medication and struggled with his mental health.“Why didn’t they use a Taser?” he asked.The officers had not been interviewed as of Tuesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. They and their races have not been publicly identified. Neither officer had a Taser or similar device, with Outlaw saying the department has previously asked for funding to equip more officers with those devices.Wallace was shot before 4 p.m. Monday in an episode filmed by a bystander and posted on social media. Witnesses complained that police fired excessive shots.Police arrested at least 91 people during unrest Monday night and Tuesday morning, with three people cited for failing to disperse and about a dozen charged with assault of an officer. Police had previously said 30 officers were injured in the unrest, most of them hit with thrown objects like bricks. One officer was still hospitalized Tuesday with a broken leg after being purposely run over by a pickup truck, police said.Officials with the Fraternal Order of Police, the union representing officers in Philadelphia, said the officer injuries were unacceptable and called for public patience as the investigation into the shooting continued.Officers said they found Wallace holding a knife and ordered him to drop the weapon several times. Wallace advanced toward the officers, who fired several times, said Officer Tanya Little, a police spokesperson.In the video, a woman and at least one man follow Wallace, trying to get him to listen to officers, as he briskly walks across the street and between cars. The woman, identified by family members as Wallace’s mother, screams and throws something at an officer after her son is shot and falls to the ground.The video does not make it clear whether he was in fact holding a knife, but witnesses said he was.Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest, Little said. One of the officers drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said.No officers or bystanders were injured in the initial confrontation, Little said. Both were wearing body cameras and were taken off street duty during the investigation.Hundreds of people took to the streets in west Philadelphia into the wee hours of Tuesday, with interactions between protesters and police turning violent at times, the Inquirer reported. Video showed many yelling at officers and crying.Dozens of protesters gathered at a nearby park, chanting “Black lives matter.”Police cars and dumpsters were set on fire as police struggled to contain the crowds. More than a dozen officers, many with batons in hand, formed a line as they ran down 52nd Street. The crowd largely dispersed then.The 52nd Street corridor was also the site of protests against police brutality at the end of May, after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police. Those protests have been the subject of City Council hearings, with protesters describing harsh and unnecessary tactics, including tear gas and projectiles fired by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philadelphia-police-shooting-had-called-for-ambulance-and-not-police-says-victim-s-kin/story-ec5CTf3mU3qBUv1ZR5568O.html
28-10-2020||World||US announces Taiwan defence systems sale||The US on Monday said it had approved a $2.4 billion sale of 100 Harpoon coastal defence systems to Taiwan, defying Beijing’s anger over a $1 billion missile deal last week.The announcement came just hours after Beijing said it would sanction US firms involved in an earlier arms sales to the democratic self-ruled island.The deal involves 100 Harpoon Coastal Defence Systems, which includes 400 RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II surface-launched missiles with a range of around 125 kilometres. The missiles, manufactured by Boeing, can be positioned on fixed platforms or mounted on trucks.The office of Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said the sale would “upgrade asymmetric warfare capabilities”.China views Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing said on Tuesday it “firmly opposed” such moves, urging the US to “call off the relevant arms sales plan to Taiwan, so as not to cause further damage to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”.Hong Kong police on Tuesday detained three people under the city’s contentious national security law on suspicion of publishing content to incite others to secede from China. Police said two men and a woman, aged between 17 and 21, were in custody and an investigation was under way. Authorities did not name the suspects but pro-independence group Studentlocalism said three of its members, including Tony Chung, a former leader of the organisation, were among them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-taiwan-defence-systems-sale/story-whdN9uGUxRWRaB0285MZhL.html
28-10-2020||World||New protests loom as Europeans tire of curbs||European governments moved on Tuesday to launch new clampdowns to try to rein in a fresh Covid-19 surge amid protests by people tired of the curbs.World leaders face an increasingly difficult task holding the disease at bay while keeping their economies afloat as they pin their hopes on as-yet unproven vaccines.The US, Russia, France, Sweden, Poland and other countries have registered record numbers of infections in recent days as autumn turns to winter in the Northern Hemisphere and people socialise indoors where the risk of infection is higher.Hundreds of protesters took to the streets across Italy on Monday to vent their anger at the latest round of restrictions, including early closing for bars and restaurants, with demonstrations in some cities turning violent.In Milan, youths hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with volleys of tear gas. In nearby Turin, luxury shops had their windows smashed and some were ransacked, leading to the arrest of 10 rioters. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was expected to approve measures to help companies hit by the new curbs introduced at the weekend after daily infections increased eightfold in less than a month.In France, interior minister Gerald Darmanin warned the country to prepare for “difficult decisions” after some of the strictest restrictions currently in place anywhere in Europe have failed to halt the spread of the disease.The Czech government will ask lawmakers to extend its emergency powers until December 3, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday, as it tries to stem one of the strongest surges in infections in Europe.There have been at least 8.54 million reported infections and 251,000 deaths caused by coronavirus in Europe so far, according to latest Reuters data. The continent registered a record 230,892 new cases on October 26, up from 67,739 on October 1.Authorities in Russia, which with 1.55 million infections has the world’s fourth largest Covid-19 case load, ordered people to wear facemasks in some public places and asked regional authorities to consider shutting bars and restaurants overnight.Even Germany, widely praised for its initial response to the pandemic, signalled concern on Tuesday over rising infections, with officials saying the country was likely to reach 20,000 cases a day by the end of this week.Dr Michael Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said the European Union’s open borders might even need to be shut down again to “take the heat out of this phase of the pandemic.”“There’s no question that the European region is an epicentre of disease right now,” he said.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even more stringent measures should be applied to stop the virus. “If it’s let go freely, it can create havoc, especially when we don’t have vaccines at hand.” Iran on Tuesday again hit a record single-day Covid-19 death toll, reporting 346 new deaths. That brings the country’s total fatalities to 33,299. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said that daily new coronavirus cases have also hit a record, with 6,968 reported. That brings Iran’s total number of infections to 581,824.The remote Kashgar area of China’s Xinjiang region reported 164 asymptomatic Covid-19 cases until Monday night, as a rapid mass testing campaign for over 4.75 million people is underway.All the positive results were traced to the Shufu county of Kashgar prefecture where a 17-year-old girl had tested positive over the weekend||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-protests-loom-as-europeans-tire-of-curbs/story-GyWMLUGWEADw11y9AtRkNN.html
28-10-2020||World||Ahead of Election Day, NYC bikers hit the roads to encourage people to vote||With little more than a week to go for the contentious US presidential election, hundreds of New Yorkers, dressed in grey, biked nearly 23 kilometres from Bronx to Lower East Side as part of an initiative arranged by Brooklyn-based collective Street Riders NYC.The so-called Justice Rides are part of the group’s strategy to encourage people get out and vote. Bronx for instance has reported historically low levels of voter turnout. As they rode through the borough, many residents watched them pass and even participated in the chanting.“The first step in the push for change is to get [Republican President Donald] Trump out of office,” says Peter Kerre, one of the co-founders of Street Riders NYC. The group has been arranging Justice Rides weekly, with next weekend being the last before Election Day on November 3.Boosted by the effects of Covid-19, the US cycling industry has seen “unprecedented growth” with sales increasing by 31% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of the year, according to reports by NPD Group, a market research company. While some use the two-wheelers for leisure and other as a way to commute, bikes have also increasingly become a feature of activism across New York. Their presence was tangible over the summer months as protests against police brutality erupted after the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man killed during his arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Kerre, who is of Kenyan heritage and comes from the same town where Floyd was killed, had bought a scooter to commute to work, but found that it came in handy when protests began in New York. “There would be 20-30 protests a day,” Kerre tells HT. “The scooter made it easy to get from one protest to another.” It was at these protests that he repeatedly ran into the six cyclists who later became co-founders of Street Riders NYC. The organisers of Riders4Rights, another New York-based group, also met at protests. “Riders4Rights essentially grew out of McCarren Park,” says Rutuja Ganoo, one of the organisers, referring to the park in Brooklyn which became a popular location for sit-ins, vigils and demonstrations. “The riders essentially provide protection to the people as they march.” What started as a small group has now grown to include between 60 to 70 organisers. As the elections approach, Riders4Rights has been involved in education and awareness campaigns. It organises community meet-ups and webinars where people can get together and talk about difficult topics and policy issues. The group has also been involved in voter canvassing in Philadelphia. With early voting underway, New York is seeing long lines at polling booths. Street Riders NYC has also been part of an effort to stop voters from giving up due to the long waits by setting up water, refreshments and chairs, especially for senior citizens.Kerre also believes that the presence of bikers could also deter voter intimidation and harassment, which has become a huge concern this time especially after President Trump encouraged his supporters to go to polling stations and “watch carefully”.On October 14, Kerre received a call from Floyd’s brother requesting biker protection for a vigil to mark what would have been Floyd’s 47th birthday. “It was a last-minute request, but in the end, it shows the easy resilience and malleability of our movement,” says Kerre. The whole movement community is built on love and respect, says Ganoo. They offer people the chance to meet like-minded individuals and engage in something that bigger than themselves and to engage in their shared interests — activism and cycling. The goals of the groups are much larger than just the election; they believe in total systemic change and hope to keep working towards it post-elections. “The long-term goal of Riders4Rights is to see liberation for all — especially the most oppressed,” says Ganoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-election-day-nyc-bikers-hit-the-roads-to-drive-people-to-vote/story-BfPLnuOFtiDQFOPQN6FCFO.html
28-10-2020||World||At least 8 killed in blast at Peshawar seminary||A bomb blast at a religious seminary in the Pakistani city of Peshawar on Tuesday killed at least eight people and wounded more than 130 others, several of them critically, police and eyewitnesses said.The explosive device kept in a bag detonated inside the madrassa in Dir Colony in the morning as students were entering the premises. Most of the victims appear to be young men between the ages of 22 and 28 who were already within the building and possibly attending a class at the seminary when the device exploded.Witnesses said they saw an unidentified man leave a bag in the school premises and leave almost immediately. Police said they are trying to retrieve the footage of this person so that they can identify him. A video shared by police showed the madrassa’s religious scholar Sheikh Rahimullah addressing students, citing religious texts on the importance of education, when a huge blast ripped through the hall, knocking over the camera.Police said the explosive device was believed to have exceeded five kilogrammes.Police fear the number of casualties may increase because some of those injured are in a serious condition. Most of the victims were in Peshawar’s Lady Reading Hospital. Most students in the premises at the time of the blast were hurt in the blast, many of them critically, said police. The total strength of the Madrassa is believed to be over 1,000 but at the time of the explosion, many had not entered the building. It is believed that the students of the junior classes had not come to the school at the time of the explosion. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomb in the city, which has long been plagued by Islamist violence. Prime Minister Imran Khan on Twitter sent his condolences to family members of the victims and the injured. “I want to assure my nation we will ensure the terrorists responsible for this cowardly barbaric attack are brought to justice ASAP,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-in-pak-madrassa-kills-7-injures-80/story-9fovXQTAcwkTsPDdTl4DcJ.html
