But in nine of them, China’s unpopularity was at the highest Pew had recorded since it started tracking this subject more than a decade ago-- in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, Sweden and South Korea.A median of 73% of those polled in 14 countries (Belgium, Japan, Italy, Denmark and France in addition to the nine named above) had unfavorable views of China.Australians had soured the most, with 81%, going up by 24 points over 2019; the last year has seen a sharp deterioration in ties between the two countries. Negatives views of China went up by double digits in the last one year in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the US, South Korea and Spain.And China’s handling of the Coronavirus epidemic appeared to be central to its record unpopularity. A median of 61% of the respondents across all 14 countries polled said China had done a bad job dealing with the epidemic, worse in every case than their own country and global bodies such as WHO.China’s Covid-19 failure reflected in the way people in these countries perceived President Xi Jinping. A median of 78% had no confidence in Xi’s ability to do the right thing in world affairs’ seven-in-10 in every country.But Xi’s unpopularity was overtaken by President Donald Trump in some countries. While 78% of the Germans, for instance, had no faith in Xi, 80% said the same for Trump, who was more distrusted than Xi, Germany’s Angela Merkel, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Boris Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-unpopularity-hits-historic-highs-in-many-countries-says-pew-research-poll/story-mL4XR8iXIcZvZbYIgwXs0K.html

And so the allocation within the U.S., and between the U.S. and other countries will be a very top point of contention.”The vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford University are two of the leading candidates in the race for the first jab to get regulatory approval in the West to prevent Covid-19.Gates added that in the United States people should be thinking about ways to reduce hesitancy about having a Covid-19 vaccine when one is ready. Asked about Russian and Chinese vaccines, he said the Western companies were further ahead on Phase III studies.“The one Russian construct and six of the Chinese constructs are perfectly valid constructs actually with some similarities to what the Western companies are doing, but the Western companies are further ahead on doing these phase three studies,” Gates said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-world-could-be-close-to-normal-by-late-2021-if-vaccine-works-bill-gates/story-FjByZHTNoblJv5c9PqrNGO.html

06-10-2020||World||Michelle Obama slams Donald Trump; calls him ‘racist’, ‘not up to the job’||Former first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday launched a scathing attack at President Donald Trump, accusing him of being a “racist” and not being “up to the job” and urged fellow Americans to make informed and engaged choice in the presidential election to regain stability in the country.Pitching for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, she made an impassioned plea through a 24-minute video, saying that the country is in chaos and the voters should know what is at stake.Titled ‘Closing Argument’, the video was released on social media platforms and also by the Biden campaign.“Believe it or not, the election is right around the corner. Votes are already being cast. And if you’re still deciding who to vote for, or whether to vote at all, I wanted to take a moment to remind you what’s at stake and to urge you to make a plan to vote today. Because let’s be honest right now, our country is in chaos because of a president who isn’t up to the job,” she said in the video.While the presidential elections are scheduled for November 3, early-voting and mail-in-voting has already started in states across the country.Alleging that the president, already hit by the coronavirus, continues to “gaslight the American people by acting like this pandemic is not a real threat,” Michelle said, “so what the president is doing is once again, patently false. It’s morally wrong, and yes, it is racist. But that doesn’t mean it won’t work because this is a difficult time, a confusing time. And when people hear these lies and crazy conspiracies repeated over and over and over again, they don’t know what to think with everything going on in their lives.” She said that to regain any kind of stability, “we’ve got to ensure that every eligible voter is informed and engaged in the selection. Because the stakes are on display every day, not just in the headlines, but in our families.” “If you are a parent like me, you’re feeling the consequences of this president’s failure to take this pandemic seriously from his constant downplaying of the importance of mask and social distancing to his relentless pressure on schools to open with offering a clean plan or meaningful support to keep students and teachers safe,” she said.Trump returned to the White House on Monday night after spending four days at a military hospital where he was treated for coronavirus.Urging people to vote for Biden, the former first lady said that Americans have the chance to elect a president who can meet this moment, a leader who has the character and the experience to put an end to this chaos, start solving these problems and help lighten the load for families all across the country.“The one thing this president is really, really good at is using fear and confusion and spreading lies to win,” she alleged.Former president Barack Obama and Michelle have not campaigned much in person this election season. But they have been issuing videos in support of Biden and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris. Obama has also attended a number of fundraisers for Biden and Harris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michelle-obama-slams-donald-trump-calls-him-racist-not-up-to-the-job/story-1PVXdRRx4jgghhyksHIxhI.html

Berlin asked the OPCW to take samples from Navalny and test them after German doctors concluded he had been poisoned with Novichok.Western governments have called for sanctions against Moscow over the case. Russia denies any involvement and has said it doubts Navalny was poisoned.“No doubt Novichok nerve agent used to poison Alexey #Navalny,” Britain’s delegation at the OPCW said on Twitter. “Any use of a banned chemical weapon is a matter of great concern.”#OPCW Issues Report on Technical Assistance Requested by Germany https://t.co/vWm45YuNRPNovichok, a Soviet-era nerve toxin, was also used to poison a former Russian spy in England in 2018.

Trump, who returned late on Monday after nearly four days at Walter Reed Medical Center outside Washington, was due to receive a fifth transfusion of the antiviral drug remdesivir while being treated with the steroid dexamethasone, normally used only in the most severe cases.The Republican president, who is running against Democrat Joe Biden in an election four weeks away, has repeatedly played down the disease, which has killed more than 1 million people worldwide. The United States has the world’s highest death toll from the pandemic, with more than 209,000 deaths.“Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. About 22,000 people are estimated to die from influenza in the 2019-2020 season, according to U.S. government statistics. Even before he contracted Covid-19, Trump acknowledged in taped conversations with a journalist that the disease was deadlier than the flu. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley has also stressed Trump would have world-class medical care available around the clock, something many health experts have noted is unavailable to millions of other Americans.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a video after his return on Monday night.“I’m better, and maybe I’m immune - I don’t know,” he added, flanked by American flags and with the Washington Monument in the background. “Get out there. Be careful.” He returned to the White House in a made-for-television spectacle, descending from his Marine One helicopter wearing a white surgical mask, only to remove it as he posed, saluting and waving, on the mansion’s South Portico.Trump has repeatedly flouted social-distancing guidelines meant to curb the virus’ spread and ignored his own medical advisers. He mocked Biden at last Tuesday’s presidential debate for wearing a mask when campaigning.“I was aghast when he said Covid should not be feared,” said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.“This is a disease that is killing around a thousand people a day, has torpedoed the economy, put people out of work. This is a virus that should be both respected and feared.”Democrats also weighed in. “This is a tragic failure of leadership,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons tweeted.But Trump depicted himself as a man who vanquished the disease and emerged stronger.“If the President bounces back onto the campaign trail, he will be an invincible hero, who not only survived every dirty trick the Democrats threw at him, but the Chinese virus as well,” he wrote on Twitter.A Twitter post by Biden showed images of himself donning a mask and Trump removing his. “Masks Matter. They save lives,” the caption read.White House spokesman Judd Deere said every precaution was being taken to protect the president and his family. Physical access to Trump would be limited and appropriate protective equipment would be worn by those near him. Questions swirled around the true state of Trump’s health after a weekend when his doctors offered contradictory or opaque assessments of his condition.His oxygen saturation dipped enough to require supplemental oxygen on Friday and Saturday, his doctors said, but have not answered key questions about his lung function, his blood work, or when he lasted tested negative. SETBACK POSSIBLEMany aides and confidants have been diagnosed with the disease since his announcement last week that he had tested positive for it, intensifying scrutiny and criticism of the administration’s handling of the pandemic. Trump had no public events listed for Tuesday and it was unclear when he would be able to resume a full schedule.“I’m sure he’ll rest the next two days. And he’ll get going as soon as they say it’s OK to get going,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday, adding that Trump would still do light work like making phone calls.“You never know with this disease, but it seems like he is making a very rapid recovery and a strong one. And certainly his spirit is back. He’s raring to go,” Giuliani said. Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who also tested positive for Covid-19 after a Sept. 26 White House visit, said on Twitter that Trump called him Monday night and said he was “feeling great and working hard.”After recent opinion polls showed Trump slipping further behind Biden, early voting data indicated that nearly 4 million Americans have already cast ballots four week before election day, suggesting there may be a record turnout.The severity of Trump’s illness has been the subject of intense speculation, with some experts noting that, as an overweight, elderly man, he was in a high risk category.#GaspingForAir began trending on Twitter after video showed Trump appearing to take several deep breaths while standing on the White House balcony.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Trump looked good when he came out of the hospital, but noted that patients sometimes have a setback five days after they get sick.“Sometimes when you’re five days in you’re going to have a reversal ... It’s unlikely that it will happen, but they need to be heads-up (alert) for it,” Fauci said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-critics-donald-trump-says-americans-are-learning-to-live-with-covid-19/story-LqNfjOsgOnic99grqLYRII.html

It commemorates the slaughter of six million Jews by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime.The visit by Sheikh Abdullah to the Holocaust Memorial is a highly symbolic step, marking the shift in attitudes in the Arab world towards Israel and Jews.Political conflicts have led to fierce tensions between Islam and Judaism and Holocaust denial is rampant in many Arab countries.Maas called it “a great honour that the Israeli and Emirati foreign ministers picked Berlin as the site for their historic first meeting.“The most important currency in diplomacy is trust and I am personally thankful to both my colleagues that they are placing this trust in Germany.”Bahrain and the UAE became the first Arab nations to establish relations with Israel since Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.For the Mideast, the deals dubbed the Abraham Accords mark a distinct shift in a decades-old status quo where Arab countries have tried to maintain unity against Israel over its treatment of the stateless Palestinians.Maas called the agreement between Israel and the UAE as the “first good news in the Middle East for a long time -- and a chance for new movement in the dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians”.“This opportunity must be seized,” he said, voicing the readiness of the European Union to help.hmn/dlc/pma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-uae-ministers-visit-holocaust-memorial-during-historic-meet/story-7cW7WMCQYeC2N3RWHHar1L.html
06-10-2020||World||Joe Biden regrets calling Donald Trump a ‘clown’ during debate||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that he regrets calling President Donald Trump a “clown” during the first presidential debate, which was marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations.“I should have said, this is a clownish undertaking, instead of calling him a clown,” Biden said in response to a question at a town hall organised by NBC News in Miami, Florida.During the first of the three presidential debates in Cleveland last week, Biden termed Trump a “liar” and a “clown” as the two candidates fiercely clashed over a number of issues, including racism, economy and climate. “It was an ugly debate. And it hit some lows. You called him a clown, a fool. You told him to shut up. I think most people believe that the president was interrupting you. But it seemed to go against some of the language you have said about not being divisive. Do you regret any on your part?” Biden was asked Monday night in Miami.“It did,” Biden responded. “I was trying to figure out how I could possibly have him respect the debate, respect the evening, respect the moderator, and get us an opportunity to speak. The one thing that became absolutely clear, he didn’t want to answer any questions. He did not want to talk about substance,” Biden said explaining the reasons for using the word clown for Trump.“If you notice, not one single time that I can recall did he offer a substantive answer or criticism related to a policy matter. It was all invective. It was all personal. It was all things that had nothing to do with whether you’re going to change these people’s lives for the better. And I did get very frustrated,” Biden said, adding that he used the word out of frustration.“But the fact is,… I will be very honest with you. I think it was embarrassing for the nation to see the president of the United States just hectoring like he did, and everything was about a personal attack,” Biden said. Biden and Trump are scheduled to face off two more presidential debates later this month.Top Republican leaders had slammed Biden for calling Trump a clown. “The real concern I had -- when you watched Joe Biden -- I mean, just the way he handled - to refer to, shut up man and clown. He was more concerned about cheap shots than even talking about the concerns we have with China, with the virus, with really putting the business and the economy back on track,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox Business in an interview. Biden said during the Miami townhall that “it was just very difficult.” “I didn’t want to further demean the process of the debate by getting in a shouting match with him, on the one hand. And I tried very hard, if you noticed, to look in the camera and answer the questions directly, but they kept getting banged,” he said.“I hope this next meeting we’re going to have, it’s called a debate, but a town meeting we’re going to have supposedly coming up, but I hope we at least have an opportunity to hear the question and answer the question directly, before there’s an interruption. But, as I said to the president, not here, not tonight, not me. I’m not putting up with it,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-regrets-calling-donald-trump-a-clown-during-debate/story-BRlsXV7cnibmJ5JxEJqEzH.html

Let’s see what happens.”The case was registered on Monday by the Lahore police against Nawaz Sharif and members of his PML-N party including his daughter Maryam Nawaz, former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, and three retired generals of the Pakistan Army. Late on Monday, the Lahore Capital City Police issued a press release saying, “various speculations were being made in the media regarding the case”. “In fact, the case was registered on the request of a citizen, Badar Rasheed, on which Shahdara police registered a case under the applicate section of the law,” it said.The FIR against Nawaz Sharif came a day after his son-in-law Muhammad Safdar was booked under sedition charges for “provoking the people against the state and its institutions.” The FIR against Sharif alleged that the former premier had conspired against Pakistan’s prestigious institutions by making provocative speeches while being in London. The complainant claimed that in speeches made on September 20 and October 1, Sharif supported the policies of India so that Pakistan would continue to remain on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) ‘grey list’ over non-compliance on terror financing and money laundering.The complainant said that the main purpose of Nawaz’s speeches was to isolate Pakistan in front of the international community and to declare it a rogue state. He added that Nawaz was trying to turn the people against the democratically elected government.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-govt-tries-to-distance-itself-from-sedition-case-against-nawaz-sharif/story-EHjYIoWQ5viZ5CKaJkomFO.html

The firm’s apparel and footwear arms are also listed to be worth more than $50 million each. Last year, Bank of America Corp. valued just the sneaker side of Yeezy at as much as $3 billion, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg.The value of his stakes in Adidas AG and Nike Inc. are worth as much as $50 million and $25 million, respectively, the filing shows. West also lists liabilities of up to $100 million, the bulk of which are made up of various mortgages.West announced his run for president via Twitter in July, though he hasn’t secured a spot on the ballot in many states. He has qualified to appear in at least 12 states, including Mississippi and Vermont. West’s platform calls for a culture of life, restoration of faith and police reform. Democrats have accused Republicans of helping the campaign to act as a spoiler to siphon votes from Joe Biden.At the same time as his run, West has also been vocal about getting a board seat at the companies that have increasingly staked their brands on partnerships with him.“I don’t have a board seat at Gap, I don’t have a board seat at Adidas,” West posted on Twitter last month. “Black board seats matter.”Earlier this year, his personal accountant, David Choi, provided an unaudited balance sheet that pegs the rapper’s net worth at $3.15 billion, with the bulk of his fortune tied to Bank of America’s Yeezy valuation, which was done before the pandemic shook up the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kanye-west-reports-financials-in-filing-for-presidential-run/story-AoodKE86OF1tVa60GJdCLK.html
06-10-2020||World||Second deadline for India to appoint counsel for Kulbhushan Jadhav expires||The second deadline for India to appoint a legal representative for Indian death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav expired on Tuesday, with sources in legal circles saying the Islamabad High Court (IHC) itself may now appoint a counsel after two senior Pakistani lawyers excused themselves.Lawyers Abid Hassan Manto and Makhdoom Ali Khan excused from appearing for Jadhav, citing medical and professional grounds, respectively. IHC had heard the case for the second time on September 3 and directed the federal government to give India “another opportunity” to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav. Attorney general for Pakistan Khalid Javed Khan informed the IHC’s larger bench that Pakistan government had not yet received a reply from India on the matter till date.Jadhav has maintained that he does not want to take the benefit of the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, 2020, for an effective review of the case and requested that his mercy plea, already pending before the Pakistan Army chief, be considered instead. The Pakistan parliament in September had extended by four months the ordinance, which allowed Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in the IHC against his conviction, as required by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ordinance was set to expire on September 17. Prior to this, the Pakistan government had approached the IHC to appoint a defence lawyer to represent Jadhav.Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016, in Balochistan on charges of alleged espionage, and sentenced to death by a military court the following year.In August, the IHC formed a three-member larger bench at the government’s request to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav for his appeal against the death penalty.Last month, Pakistan rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel be appointed for Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial. Queen’s Counsel is a barrister or advocate, appointed Counsel to the UK Crown on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor.“We have repeatedly told them that only those lawyers can represent Commander Jadhav in the Court who have the license to practice law in Pakistan. This is in accordance with legal practice in other jurisdictions as well,” Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri had said at the time. He further said that the Indian Supreme Court, in one of its judgments, had ruled that foreign lawyers cannot practice law within the country.India maintains that Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit. “It has not yet addressed the core issues, which include provision of all documents related to the case, providing unconditional and unimpeded consular access to Kulbhusan Jadhav and appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel to ensure a free and fair trial,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said last month. In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a “farcical” approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-deadline-for-india-to-appoint-counsel-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-expires/story-SYWZJiXyh3HFaVDvNEKcPJ.html
06-10-2020||World||US troop withdrawal deal: Two decades later, Afghans fear resurrection of the Taliban||Almost two decades after the United States launched air strikes against Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban regime and started what would become America’s longest-ever war, the hardline group are in a stronger position than ever.The invasion that followed those October 7, 2001 strikes quickly toppled the militants, who had harboured Al-Qaeda, the group behind the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in America just weeks earlier.Now, 19 years since the collapse of their brutal Islamist regime, the Taliban are pushing for a return to power, having signed a landmark troop withdrawal deal with Washington in February and currently holding peace talks with the Afghan government.Fearful that the Taliban have changed little since the darkest days of their regime -- when they killed women accused of adultery, attacked minority religious groups and barred girls from going to school -- many Afghans worry about a new era of Taliban influence.“I remember the Taliban regime like a nightmare. We are scared for our future and my daughter’s future,” said Kabul resident Katayoun Ahmadi, a 26-year-old mother.She recalled seeing severed hands and fingers on Kabul’s streets following amputations for petty crimes under the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Sharia law.The 2001 invasion heralded some enduring improvements for young Afghans -- particularly girls -- and ushered in a constitution guaranteeing certain freedoms including the right to an education.But so far in peace talks in Doha, which started last month, the Taliban have said little about issues such as women’s rights or freedom of expression.- ‘Afghan-owned’ deal -Ahmadi’s husband Farzad Farnood, 35, a researcher for the Afghanistan Institute for Strategic Studies, said a rise in Taliban violence since a deal was signed between the hardline group and Washington shows the militants have not changed. “Is this creating hope for Afghans? No, it is not,” he said. As a teenager, he witnessed the Taliban stoning a woman to death and public executions and floggings in Kabul’s football stadium. His family had to hide their black-and-white television’s antenna in a tree when the Taliban banned music and entertainment.“All the achievements we have made in the last 18 years did not exist in the Taliban era,” he said.In a statement released Tuesday, the Taliban claimed the US “arrogantly rejected” their appeals for diplomacy in 2001, instead launching a “brutal invasion”.“America, its allies and coalitions would have... been spared from infamy and war crimes along with great human and material losses,” they said, adding they welcomed an opportunity to usher in a “sovereign Islamic government”.Zia-ul-Rahman, a former insurgent who battled foreign troops and Afghan government forces for four years, told AFP the Taliban were pushing for “the establishment of an Islamic system”, even though the country’s constitution already gives primacy to the religion.“We have no problem with girls getting an education or women working, but they have to wear a hijab,” he added.US involvement in Afghanistan has proven painfully difficult for the superpower, draining more than $1 trillion from its coffers and resulting in about 2,400 troop deaths in a war the Pentagon has characterised as a stalemate.In Doha, the Taliban and the Afghan government are struggling to agree common language on a range of issues before they can even establish an agenda, in talks that could continue for years.Some US lawmakers have said they would oppose any deal that fails to protect women and minorities, but President Donald Trump’s administration has stressed it wants little to do with the outcome which he said will be “Afghan-owned”.Jawed Rahmani, a 38-year-old security worker in Kabul, said US disengagement would inevitably lead to a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.“These are not peace talks but a deal to hand over the next government to the Taliban,” he said.“People are happier with whatever we have right now, compared to the darkest era of the Taliban.” mam-wat/ecl/wat/mtp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-troop-withdrawal-deal-two-decades-later-afghans-fear-resurrection-of-the-taliban/story-XANdaJKbUl6PwBpGJAPbfI.html

All countries are now facing what I would call ‘The Long Ascent’ -- a difficult climb that will be long, uneven, and uncertain,” Georgieva said. In the United States and Europe the downturn, though painful, was not as bad as economists feared at the outset, and China is seeing “a faster-than-expected recovery.” But the news elsewhere is bad: “In low-income countries, the shocks are so profound that we face the risk of a ‘lost generation,’“ she said.“There is also now the risk of severe economic scarring from job losses, bankruptcies, and the disruption of education.”Low-income countries have not had the resources to spend as much to support jobs and businesses, and also will need help to deal with their debt burden, including through more grants and debt restructuring.She likened the crisis to World War II when leaders “forged a better world in the worst possible moment,” and called for governments to continue support for workers as long as it is needed, while spending to create a better, more equitable, economic system.“Where the pandemic persists, it is critical to maintain lifelines across the economy, to firms and workers,” she said. “Cut the lifelines too soon, and the Long Ascent becomes a precipitous fall.”But, Georgieva said, “We cannot afford simply to rebuild the old economy, with its low growth, low productivity, high inequality, and worsening climate crisis,” and she called for more spending on green jobs which can generate more employment.“This will require both stimuli for job creation, especially in green investment, and cushioning the impact on workers,” she said. “Safeguarding social spending will be critical for a just transition to new jobs.”She referred to an IMF report released Monday showing that increasing spending by just one percent of GDP could create 33 million new jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-downturn-not-as-bad-as-feared-crisis-not-over-imf-chief/story-Jjcsj3MiSlHXcoEPSV0P0I.html
06-10-2020||World||Donald Trump faces backlash for removing mask on return to White House||US President Donald Trump faced a backlash on Tuesday for removing his mask when he returned to the White House and urging Americans not to fear the Covid-19 disease that has killed more than 209,000 people in the country and put him in hospital.Trump arrived at the White House on Monday in a made-for-television spectacle in which he descended from his Marine One helicopter wearing a white surgical mask, only to remove it as he posed, saluting and waving, on the mansion’s South Portico.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a video after his return from the Walter Reed Medical Center military hospital outside Washington where he was admitted on Friday for the disease caused by the coronavirus.“I’m better, and maybe I’m immune - I don’t know,” he added, flanked by American flags and with the Washington Monument in the background. “Get out there. Be careful.”Trump, who received experimental treatment, has repeatedly played down the disease, which has killed more than 1 million people worldwide. The United States has the world’s highest death toll from the pandemic.White House physician Dr. Sean. P. Conley, stressed that the Republican president, who is running for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election, would have world-class medical care available around the clock.Trump has repeatedly flouted social-distancing guidelines meant to curb the virus’ spread and ignored his own medical advisers. He mocked Biden at last Tuesday’s presidential debate for wearing a mask when campaigning.“I was aghast when he said Covid should not be feared,” said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.“This is a disease that is killing around a thousand people a day, has torpedoed the economy, put people out of work. This is a virus that should be both respected and feared.”Democrats also weighed in. “This is a tragic failure of leadership,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons tweeted.But Trump depicted himself as a man who vanquished the disease and emerged stronger.“If the President bounces back onto the campaign trail, he will be an invincible hero, who not only survived every dirty trick the Democrats threw at him, but the Chinese virus as well,” he wrote on Twitter.A Twitter post by Biden showed images of himself donning a mask and Trump removing his. “Masks Matter. They save lives,” the caption read.White House spokesman Judd Deere said every precaution was being taken to protect the president and his family. Physical access to Trump would be limited and appropriate protective equipment would be worn by those near him.Questions continue to swirl about the true state of Trump’s health after a weekend in which his doctors offered contradictory or opaque assessments of his condition.His oxygen saturation dipped enough to require supplemental oxygen on Friday and Saturday and he will receive his last intravenous dose of the antiviral drug, remdesivir, at the White House on Tuesday, his doctors said.Trump was tweeting early on Tuesday.SETBACK POSSIBLEMany aides and confidants have been diagnosed with the disease since his announcement last week that he had tested positive for it, intensifying scrutiny and criticism of the administration’s handling of the pandemic.Trump has no public events listed for Tuesday and it is not clear when he will be able to resume a full schedule.“I’m sure he’ll rest the next two days. And he’ll get going as soon as they say it’s OK to get going,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday, adding that Trump would still do light work like making phone calls.“You never know with this disease, but it seems like he is making a very rapid recovery and a strong one. And certainly his spirit is back. He’s raring to go,” Giuliani said.Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who also tested positive for Covid-19 after a Sept. 26 White House visit, said on Twitter that Trump called him Monday night and said he was “feeling great and working hard.”After recent polls showed Trump slipping further behind Biden, early voting data indicated that nearly 4 million Americans have already cast ballots four week before election day, suggesting there may be a record turnout.The severity of Trump’s illness has been the subject of intense speculation, with some experts noting that, as an overweight, elderly man, he was in a high risk category.#GaspingForAir began trending on Twitter after video showed Trump appearing to take several deep breaths while standing on the White House balcony.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Trump looked good when he came out of the hospital, but noted that patients sometimes have a setback five days after they get sick.“Sometimes when you’re five days in you’re going to have a reversal ... It’s unlikely that it will happen, but they need to be heads-up (alert) for it,” Fauci said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-backlash-for-removing-mask-on-return-to-white-house/story-Xiu3RSneDdfgPUHauBVfIO.html
06-10-2020||World||At QUAD meet, Pompeo discusses China’s ‘malign activity’ with Australian counterpart||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Tuesday of Beijing’s “malign activity in the region” as he met with key Asia-Pacific allies in Tokyo, presenting a united front against an increasingly assertive China.The top US diplomat is meeting his Japanese, Australian and Indian counterparts on a trip that was scaled back after President Donald Trump and a raft of staff and advisors contracted coronavirus.His first meeting was with Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, in which they “discussed their shared concerns regarding the People’s Republic of China’s malign activity in the region,” a US State Department official said.The talks in Tokyo come with the United States, Australia and India all at loggerheads with Beijing -- leaving Japan in the delicate position of standing alongside its allies while attempting to preserve gradually improving ties with China.Pompeo is the first senior US official to visit Japan since Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga took office last month, and he said he was confident Tokyo and Washington were on the same page.“In his first statement after assuming office, Prime Minister Suga described the free and open Indo-Pacific as ‘the foundation of regional peace and stability’. I could not agree more,” he said at the start of talks with his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi.Speaking later, Suga said the spread of the coronavirus had shown “exactly why right now is the time that we must further deepen coordination with as many countries as possible that share our vision and build our efforts to enhance cooperation.”Pompeo is a vociferous critic of China on issues from security to human rights to the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump’s administration has sought to blame squarely on Beijing ahead of the US election on November 3.He has led an international campaign for other nations to shun China, including its technology.‘Closed, exclusive cliques’But Japan has insisted the talks are not directed at any one country, and the foreign ministry offered a broad summary of bilateral talks, saying they touched on “the situation in the East China Sea, the South China Sea and North Korea”.Despite Pompeo’s promise of “significant announcements”, no joint statement or press conference is expected after the four-way talks later Tuesday.The “Quad” grouping was heavily promoted by Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe as a way for the region’s major democracies to step up cooperation in the face of military and other threats posed by China.Suga told reporters on Monday he would seek to “promote a free and open Indo-Pacific” but also “build stable relations with neighbouring countries including China and Russia”.Beijing has made no secret of its view on the Quad grouping, with the foreign ministry last week urging countries to avoid “closed and exclusive ‘cliques’“.“We hope the relevant countries can proceed from the common interests of countries in the region, and do more things that are conducive to regional peace, stability and development, not the other way around,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said.The first Quad meeting took place in New York last year, and there are moves to make the gathering an annual event.Pompeo heads back to Washington in the late evening. Planned stops in South Korea and Mongolia have been scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-quad-meet-pompeo-discusses-china-s-malign-activity-with-australian-counterpart/story-7KR18vXSfeX5d0vVXpBNtK.html

We can’t now define the mission of this country as merely to restore normality.

Some local politicians have been jailed there for corruption.After he was arrested, McAfee’s official Instagram account posted a “Free McAfee” message with a photo of him. The person running the account did not return a message seeking comment.No other representatives were immediately contactable. U.S. federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment on Monday against McAfee over charges that he evaded taxes and wilfully failed to file returns.That came shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed it had brought civil charges against McAfee, alleging he made over $23.1 million in undisclosed compensation from false and misleading cryptocurrency recommendations. He is alleged to have earned millions in income from promoting cryptocurrencies, as well as through consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-virus-software-creator-john-mcafee-jailed-in-spain-reports/story-fSeiidiKnWST1SnUZAmZDO.html
06-10-2020||World||Germany’s Covid-19 cases rise the most since mid-April||Germany’s new coronavirus cases increased at the highest pace since mid-April, the latest sign of Europe’s struggle to keep the pandemic under control.The country registered 3,100 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, taking the total to 304,673, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That’s the highest daily increase since April 18, but still well below peak levels of almost 7,000.There were 21 new fatalities, lifting the overall number of deaths to 9,554German cases have ticked up since August, similar to trends across the region. Initially, returning vacationers sparked increased infections, but now family and work gatherings are fuelling flare-ups.Officials have warned that containment measures will continue to affect daily life into next year, even if a vaccine becomes available. Health Minister Jens Spahn bemoaned the lack of adherence to existing rules, especially in Berlin where images circulated over the weekend of people mingling without face masks.The country’s reproduction factor -- the average number of people infected by one person with the virus -- inched lower to 1.21 on Monday from 1.23 the day before, according to the latest estimate from the country’s RKI public health institute. A reading above 1.0 indicates that the disease is spreading.The president of the German institute responsible for vaccines said Tuesday he is hopeful that several will be available in early 2021 to help stem the pandemic.“But we have to remember that initially there will only be a limited amount” and distribution will have to be prioritized, Klaus Cichutek, head of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, said in an interview with ZDF television. “And we mustn’t forget that there will also be certain logistical problems” such as having to transport and store vaccines at extremely low temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-s-covid-19-cases-rise-the-most-since-mid-april/story-uh3mVfXxv3WcZzvFk8ewjN.html
06-10-2020||World||New testing method can diagnose Covid-19 in just 30 minutes, study finds||Scientists have developed a new method that allows anyone to easily and quickly detect Covid-19 in just 30 minutes, and is as accurate as the current PCR diagnostic test. The SENSR technology developed by researchers at Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH) in South Korea diagnosis Covid-19 based on the RNA sequence of the virus, reducing the stress on one single testing location and avoiding contact with infected patients as much as possible. RNA is a nucleic acid that mediates genetic information or is involved in controlling the expression of genes. The biggest benefit is that a diagnostic kit can be developed within a week even if a new infectious disease appears other than Covid-19, according to the research published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The researchers noted that PCR molecular test currently used for Covid-19 diagnosis has very high accuracy but entails a complex preparation process to extract or refine the virus. The test is not suitable for use in small farming or fishing villages, or airport or drive-thru screening clinics as it requires expensive equipment as well as skilled experts, they said. The researchers designed the test kit to produce nucleic acid binding reaction to show fluorescence only when Covid-19 RNA is present. The virus can be detected immediately without any preparation process with high sensitivity in a short time. And it is as accurate as the current PCR diagnostic method. Using the new technology, they found the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, the cause of Covid-19, from an actual patient sample in about 30 minutes. In addition, five pathogenic viruses and bacterial RNAs were detected which proved the kit’s usability in detecting pathogens other than Covid-19, according to the researchers. Another great advantage of the SENSR technology is the ease of creating the diagnostic device that can be developed into a simple portable and easy-to-use form, the researchers said. The method not only allows onsite diagnosis before going to the screening clinic or being hospitalised, but also allows for a more proactive response to Covid-19 by supplementing the current centralized diagnostic system. “This method is a fast and simple diagnostic technology which can accurately analyse the RNA without having to treat a patient’s sample,” said POSTECH Professor Jeong Wook Lee. “We can better prepare for future epidemics as we can design and produce a diagnostic kit for new infectious diseases within a week,” Lee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-testing-method-can-diagnose-covid-19-in-just-30-minutes-study-finds/story-Xs7TnzX84EfomjchCLJ1XN.html

The prison sentence, which will be shortened by one year because he served time after a previous conviction on the same charges, also covered charges of corruption and possession of an unlicensed firearm.Adeeb was a protege to former President Yameen Abdul Gayoom during the early years of his presidency between 2013 and 2018.He had been sentenced to 33 years in prison in 2016 for several counts including masterminding a blast in a presidential speedboat in which Yameen’s wife was wounded. He was freed from all charges after Yameen lost reelection in 2018.Under the new President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, many cases perceived to be politically motivated were revisited.After his release, Adeeb testified against Yameen in court saying he was party to his former boss’ corrupt dealings and did not worry about being sent to jail again. Charges were refiled, and Adeeb pleaded guilty to all charges, including money laundering, embezzlement and using his prominent position to gain undue advantage.Yameen is serving a five-year prison term for having facilitated Adeeb to launder $1 million obtained through corrupt deals.Maldives is a tiny archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean known for its luxury tourist resorts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-ex-vice-president-jailed-again-for-money-laundering/story-XUb1l1y60DMsKYoTyGKwTL.html
06-10-2020||World||White House cancels updated FDA guidelines on Covid-19 vaccine approval: What it means||The White House has blocked new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines on bringing potential vaccines for Covid-19 to market.News agency Associated Press quoted a senior Trump administration official as saying that the White House believed there was no “clinical or medical reason” for the additional requirement.What the move means?The intervention by Trump officials is the latest example of the administration undercutting its own medical experts working to combat the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 210,000 Americans. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that a vaccine could be authorised before election day, even though top government scientists working on the administration’s vaccine effort have stated that the timeline is very unlikely.Last week, seven former FDA commissioners blasted the administration for “undermining the credibility” of the FDA in a Washington Post op-ed and called for the release of the pending vaccine guidelines. The former FDA chiefs warned that public perceptions that a vaccine was rushed out for political reasons could derail efforts to vaccinate millions of Americans.Drugmaker Pfizer has suggested it could have data on the safety and effectiveness of its vaccine before Election Day and a number of variables would still have to align for the company to submit, and the FDA to review and approve, a vaccine application before November 3.Additionally, FDA scientists have been discussing the contents of the guidelines publicly for weeks and have made clear that the recommendations have already been shared with each of the vaccine developers.The FDA released its initial expectations for Covid-19 vaccines in June. Among other metrics, the agency said any vaccine would have to be at least 50% protective against the virus. But the guidelines didn’t spell out the conditions under which the FDA would use its emergency authorization powers to speed up the availability of a vaccine. Under emergency review, medical products face a lower standard that merely requires that their expected benefits outweigh their risks for use during a public health crisis.The lack of specifics around using the emergency authorisation for a vaccine became a flashpoint for outside experts, physicians and even politicians. FDA officials then began drafting a second guidance document with additional details.The FDA has faced criticism for allowing emergency use of some Covid-19 treatments backed by little evidence, but FDA officials have made clear that vaccines would face additional standards.But Donald Trump made clear last month that he was skeptical of any regulatory changes that might delay a vaccine’s authorisation, even if those changes are aimed at increasing public trust.“I think that was a political move more than anything else,” he said then, arguing that that the companies testing the vaccines, such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, are capable of determining whether they work. “I have tremendous trust in these massive companies,” he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-cancels-updated-fda-guidelines-on-covid-19-vaccine-approval-what-it-means/story-t9unBLFPfY5lFP4UyK2eaL.html

This helps assist the WHO’s member states and UN procurement agencies to determine the acceptability of the vaccines.“Potentially through this emergency use listing the quality and safety of these vaccines and efficacy could be assessed. ..and then this could be made available for our licensees,” Escalante said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-in-talks-with-who-over-assessing-its-covid-19-vaccines-for-global-use/story-zO9DjWEu9pi2DE8W58UFiO.html

They were arrested over rioting that took place in the region after a man and his son were reportedly killed by police while demanding compensation after they lost their homes due to flooding and landslide on the Hunza river.Sher Ullah Baig and his son Sher Afzal, who were reportedly killed by police, were residents of Shishkat in Gojal Valley.Following protests over their deaths, police had arrested Baba Jan and several others from the area.

Also, one injured person has died,” the spokesman said.On Monday, about 2,000 supporters of parties that did not make it to the republic’s Parliament in Bishkek gathered on the central Ala-Too square. They demanded that election results be canceled and a repeat vote be held. In the evening, clashes between protesters and security officials began.Overnight to Tuesday, protesters broke into the White House building, which hosts the parliament and presidential office. Then they moved towards the State Committee for National Security, where the former leader of the country, Almazbek Atambayev, was in custody, and freed him.Elections to the Kyrgyz parliament were held on October 4. The turnout was 56.5 percent. According to the preliminary voting results, after processing ballots from 98 percent of polling stations, four parties make it to the parliament: Birimdik (Unity, pro-government party) with 24.52% of the vote, Mekenim Kyrgyzstan (Native Kyrgyzstan, pro-government party) with 23.89%, Kyrgyzstan (centrist party) with 8.73% and Butun Kyrgyzstan (United Kyrgyzstan, centrist party) with 7.11%.The remaining parties did not overcome the 7 percent threshold.

06-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: Pence takes lead role in campaign with Trump travel stopped||With President Donald Trump ill with Covid-19, Vice President Mike Pence took the lead role in campaigning on Monday, starting a swing through key states to bolster the president’s chance for reelection.Trump left Walter Reed Military Medical Centre and returned to the White House on Monday evening, but it’s unclear when he’ll be able to travel.“I spoke to the president a little while back. He sounded great,” Pence told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before heading west to Utah for this week’s vice presidential debate.“When the president told me that he was headed back to the White House, he told me to head to Utah. And we’re looking very much forward to the vice presidential debate,” he said. “The stakes in this election have never been higher and the choice has never been clearer.” Pence wants to keep the president’s supporters energised and deflect criticism of the administration’s handling of a virus that has killed more than 210,000 Americans. Trump’s positive diagnosis on Friday has intensified scrutiny of the administration’s cavalier approach to the pandemic.The spotlight on Pence will be especially bright Wednesday when he participates in the vice presidential debate with California Senator Kamala Harris. Pence will almost certainly be pressed to explain shifting accounts of the president’s health over the weekend and justify Trump’s decision to hold large in-person campaign rallies during a pandemic — events that often flouted public health guidelines by congregating thousands of mostly mask-less supporters.“Normally, the vice presidential debate is inconsequential. That is not the case in 2020,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Florida Senator Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential bid. “The public has so many questions about how we got here and it’s an opportunity for Pence to answer some of those.” Pence has often been called upon to smooth over fallout from Trump’s messy decision making and divisive policies. Since the 2016 campaign, he has served as a bridge of sorts between a brash, thrice-married former reality television star who long bragged about womanizing and the more traditional branch of the Republican Party, particularly conservative evangelicals.The smooth diction and humble demeanor Pence brings to the role was honed in the 1990s as a conservative talk-radio host in Indiana, when he referred to himself as “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.” His approach hasn’t always been successful. As Indiana’s governor from 2013 to 2017, he was so relentlessly on-message that he sometimes struggled to contain fallout from fast-moving crises.That includes his handling of backlash over a 2015 law he signed that allowed business owners to deny service to gay people for religious reasons, which was later amended as a result of the uproar. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC when he was governor, Pence grew flustered after failing to answer direct questions about whether discrimination against gay people should be legal.“George!” Pence protested before letting out an audible sigh. “C’mon.” The debate with Harris will be a major test. The former California prosecutor’s political rise was fuelled by searing exchanges with political rivals during major congressional hearings. And she is certain to press the issue of the virus and Trump’s diagnoses when the two meet in Salt Lake City.“That will be his challenge. But it is one he is well-suited for,” said Cam Savage, a veteran Republican strategist from Indiana who has closely observed Pence’s political career. “With Pence you get a very disciplined leader who is not likely to make mistakes.” One major uncertainty is what sort of condition Trump will be in during the weeks ahead. His administration has offered rosy assessments of his health, but Trump’s blood oxygen level abruptly dropped twice in recent days and he was given supplemental oxygen before his hospitalisation.There are also concerns that Pence could himself could catch the virus while campaigning, a troubling scenario that raises serious questions about national security and the transfer of power if either he or Trump took a turn for the worse.After the debate, Pence says, it’s back to “business as usual” and the campaign has appearances planned for him, as well as Trump’s children and other top surrogates, in an effort billed as “Operation MAGA.” Pence is slated to visit Arizona and Florida and will return to Indiana on Friday to vote early.“We’ve got a campaign to run,” Pence said Saturday on a call with staff. “I promise you, this president, as soon as his doctors say so, he’s going to be back out there.” Pence often evokes faith when describing his approach to public office, citing the biblical concept of “servant leadership.” He has been a faithful servant to Trump since he was plucked from a difficult bid for reelection as governor to join the presidential ticket in 2016.Though Pence has long-held presidential ambitions, his own political career was on the ropes.The former congressman turned governor had a dismal approval rating. His enthusiastic support for religious conservative cultural issues alienated moderate Republicans and drew threats of boycott of the state. And he faced a difficult reelection battle against the same Democrat that he narrowly beat in 2012.

06-10-2020||World||External affairs minister Jaishankar to attend second ministerial Quad meeting today||External affairs minister S Jaishankar will on Tuesday participate in the second ministerial meeting of the Quad that will focus on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour across the region. Jaishankar and his counterparts from Australia, Japan and the US are expected to discuss issues such as plans for manufacturing and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine, connectivity, development of 5G technology, maritime cooperation, counter-terrorism, cyber security, and development of critical infrastructure and supply chains, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The issue of Australia’s inclusion in the Malabar naval exercise to be conducted by India, Japan and the US at the end of this year is also expected to figure in the discussions of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which was upgraded to the ministerial level in September last year. The people pointed out that it was rare for four foreign ministers to gather physically for a meeting amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and this highlighted the importance attached to the Quad by the four members. Ahead of the Quad meeting, Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in Tokyo, the people said. He is also expected to hold separate meetings with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi. The external affairs ministry said last week that the foreign ministers of the Quad will discuss the “post-Covid-19 international order and the need for a coordinated response to the various challenges emerging from the pandemic”. They will also discuss regional issues and “collectively affirm the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”, it said. The Quad meeting is expected to make an assessment of China’s aggressive actions, including the border standoff with China, its confrontation with Taiwan and its activities in the South China Sea, the people cited above said. All four members of the grouping have serious differences with China – India is engaged in a border standoff in Ladakh, the Australian government has pledged to halt projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan is worried about Chinese intrusions near the Senkaku Islands, and the US is engaged in a trade war. The members of the Quad, especially India, Japan and Australia, have stepped up work on forging partnerships with like-minded countries in the region, or those with interests in the Indian Ocean, with an eye on China’s increasing assertiveness. Jaishankar recently said India and Japan were looking at cooperating on projects in Bangladesh and Myanmar as part of their efforts to work together in third countries. On September 9, India, Australia and France held their maiden senior officials’ trilateral dialogue, with the focus on building convergences in the Indo-Pacific. On the same day, India and Japan signed the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), a pact for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-to-attend-quad-meeting-today/story-uBlRztc9aa1sFs3uFULgCK.html
06-10-2020||World||India likely to join Canada-led multilateral group tackling Covid-19 pandemic||In a sign of an upswing in India-Canada ties, India is likely to join a group of foreign ministers from several countries that is being led by Canada and is aimed at forging a common strategy to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.The Ministerial Coordination Group on Covid-19 (MCGC) was formed by Canadian foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne on March 15 and has held 10 calls so far between the participating nations. A senior Indian official said that India is likely to join the conversation on multilateral cooperation when the next monthly meeting takes place later this month. “This is an opportunity to coordinate on issues with several countries, and another piece in the coordination with Canada,” the official said.Among the countries that have joined the MCGC are the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, South Africa, Morocco, Brazil, Peru and Australia. Two nations conspicuous by their absence from this grouping are the US and China.In a statement after a monthly meeting in April, Champagne had said, “The Covid-19 pandemic is a global challenge. Maintaining strong coordination with our international partners is critical to mitigate the repercussions of the ongoing challenges we face. Keeping people, goods and services moving is key in both addressing these issues and ensuring the transition to a strong recovery.”The ministers provided an update on their response to the coronavirus pandemic. Among its objectives are focusing on the “importance of multilateral vaccine research and development and ensuring equitable vaccine access to developing countries and vulnerable health systems” as well as “the ongoing need for coordination and multilateralism in response to the economic effects of Covid-19.”In a release, Global Affairs Canada said the MCGC was “proving to be a valuable forum to discuss, coordinate and act together on global challenges related to Covid-19 and beyond” in a “world increasingly characterised by interdependence, speed and complexity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-join-canada-led-multilateral-group-tackling-covid-19-pandemic/story-GKal3JUnuxUdxF200UojvI.html
06-10-2020||World||Nobel Prize for Physics to be announced today; Only 3 women have received it so far||The Nobel Prize for Physics for this year will be announced on Tuesday by the Stockholm-based Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Alfred Nobel, known for his invention of dynamite, signed off his fortunes to a series of five prizes in his last will in 1985 that came to be recognised as the Nobel Prizes. The awards were first given out in 1901. Here are some facts about the Nobel Prize for Physics: Since 1901, the award has been given out 113 times to 212 individuals, including John Bardeen, who has received the award twice for his invention of a transistor and for his work in superconductivity. Each Nobel Prize can be shared by a maximum of three laureates for two separate works. The first person to receive the prize in 1901 was German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen, who is known for his discovery of X-rays. There have been six years when the Nobel Prize for Physics was not awarded, including 1916, 1931, 1934, and 1940 through 1942 because of the prevailing World War-I and II.This was done keeping in mind the statute of Nobel Foundation that said: “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.” As per this statute, the awards were withheld and given out the next year on eight occasions, including the Nobel Prize in 1922 awarded to Albert Einstein, and in 1919 to German physicist Max Plank, who had laid the foundations for quantum theory. One of the delayed awards was also presented to the American-German physicist Otto Stern, who is known to be the second-most nominated persons for a Nobel Prize. Stern was nominated 82 times and had won the coveted prize in 1943.Women’s suffrage activist Jane Addams, who had received a record 91 nominations, had received the Nobel Price for Peace in 1931. Details of nominations are not released until after 50 years. The only Indian to have received the Nobel Prize for Physics was Professor CV Raman in 1930 for his discovery of the Raman effect. The highest number of the Nobel Prize in this category has been received by scientists from the United States of America (94), followed by Germany (26), and the United Kingdom (24). Three women have won the Nobel Prize in this category, including Marie Curie in 1903, Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), and Donna Strickland (2018), to date. Curie had also won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. She is the only woman and one of the four persons to have received two Nobel Prizes in two separate categories. Lawrence Bragg was the youngest to win the Nobel Prize for Physics at the age of 25 in 1915 along with his father for studying crystal structures using X-rays. The oldest person to receive the award was Arthur Ashkin at the age of 96 in 2018 for his work on optical tweezers. Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously. Family of Nobel LaureatesMarie Curie and Pierre Curie became the first family members to win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903. Their daughter Irène Joliot-Curie followed her illustrious parents’ footsteps and bagged the prestigious award with her husband Frédéric Joliot in 1935. Four pairs of fathers and sons have received the prize, including Neils Bohr for his understanding of atomic structure in 1922 and his son Aage N Bohr for his work on motion in atomic nuclei. Of the 113 Noble Prizes for Physics that have been awarded since 1901, 47 were given to only one laureate, 32 and 34 to two and three laureates, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-prize-for-physics-to-be-announced-today-only-3-women-have-received-it-so-far/story-WVxlSxNvlm900iVd6v53WL.html
06-10-2020||World||‘Don’t be afraid,’ US President Donald Trump tells Americans upon return to White House||US President Donald Trump returned to the White House on Monday evening three days into his treatment for Covid-19 at a military hospital, and urged Americans not to be afraid of the disease.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a recorded video message. Critics saw it as an insensitive remark, given the damage inflicted by the deadly virus on Americans so far: 210,000 dead, more than 7 million infected, and several millions left jobless.Trump gave thumbs-up to reporters as he left the Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. At the White House, a 10-minute helicopter ride later, he took off his mask and posed for cameras from one of the stately balconies. He stood there for a while, gave a long salute to the departing presidential helicopter Marine One, and went inside.The US president returned to a White House that has turned into a “hot spot” of coronavirus cases, with a growing number of infections being reported among aides, officials, Trump’s allies and reporters. First lady Melania Trump, who had tested positive for the virus along with the US president, was recovering in the residential wing of the White House. Others infected included Trump’s close adviser Hope Hicks, former adviser Kellyanne Conway, former governor Chris Christie and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.Trump had announced his intention to leave the hospital in a tweet earlier on Monday, saying he was feeling better than he did “20 years ago”. In a video message he tweeted from the White House, Trump suggested that he was feeling better because “maybe I am immune”.Eager to project strength, the US president said in an earlier tweet that he intended to return to campaigning soon. He did not say when, though. Trump’s medical team hasn’t been forthcoming about certain key details of Trump’s illness, and has given confusing and conflicting information. Sean Conley, the US president’s physician who has admitted to lending an “upbeat” twist to his updates on Trump’s health, said on Monday that though Trump was “not out of the woods yet”, he met all the requirements for discharge.“The president has continued to improve,” he told reporters. “He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge.”The team had planned to discharge Trump later after administering the fourth dose of remdesivir, an antiviral drug known to cut recovery time for Covid-19 patients. They did not say if he will continue to get dexamethasone, a steroid he was given earlier to prevent his oxygen levels from dropping.The medical team had said on Sunday that they had expected to discharge the US president on Monday because had been doing well. Trump was airlifted to the Walter Reed hospital on Friday after he showed severe symptoms of Covid-19, high fever and a rapid drop in blood oxygen levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-be-afraid-us-president-donald-trump-tells-americans-upon-return-to-white-house/story-cvLNeJsVgxKNhumcjuJiDJ.html
06-10-2020||World||6 feet distance not enough to prevent Covid-19 spread, says US CDC||The novel coronavirus can spread through the air to people who are more than 6 feet away from an infectious person, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday, in guidance that could raise new challenges for safely re-opening businesses and schools.In an update to its website, the CDC said the coronavirus can sometimes be spread through small particles that can linger in the air and infect people separated by distances previously considered safe. Many social-distancing guidelines adopted by workplaces, restaurants and stores advise people to stand at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart to avoid transmitting the pathogen that causes Covid-19.“Today’s update acknowledges the existence of some published reports showing limited, uncommon circumstances where people with Covid-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet away or shortly after the Covid-19-positive person left an area,” the agency said in a news release.The change follows months of mounting scientific evidence that Sars-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the air at greater distances than understood in earlier stages of the pandemic.There have been indications the CDC was moving toward updating its guidance. Last month, it posted and then removed a guideline on airborne transmission, later describing it as a draft posted in error.The new guidance arrives as the pandemic appears to be shifting into a more intense phase in the U.S. In 34 states, the seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was a month ago, and an outbreak of the virus at the White House appears to be widening. At the same time, schools are reopening, states such as Florida have lifted restrictions on restaurants and other businesses, and the approach of cooler weather and holidays is expected to push more people indoors to socialize.Ventilation IssuesA recent archived version of the CDC’s web page made no mention of airborne transmission, emphasizing that the main way the virus spreads is through close contact among people who are within six feet of each other, through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing, sneezing, and speaking. It acknowledged that the virus may spread in other ways, including on contaminated surfaces.The CDC’s updated site includes a section acknowledging that virus particles also sometimes spread through the air, particularly in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Scientists believe that in these cases, airborne virus particles emitted “became concentrated enough to spread the virus to other people,” including sometimes shortly after the infectious person left.The transmissions sometimes occurred when the infected person was breathing heavily, while singing or exercising, the agency said.Linsey Marr, an expert on the airborne transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech, in a tweet called the update “an accurate, sorely-needed update acknowledging airborne spread and importance of masks at all times around others and of ventilation.”In an open letter in July, 239 scientists urged the World Health Organization to recognize the potential for airborne spread. One study of a meat plant suggested that under certain conditions the virus can travel 26 feet.Recommendations UnchangedThe CDC reiterated that it’s more common for the virus to spread through close contact with an infected person. The update Monday doesn’t change the CDC’s recommendations for how to protect against infection by wearing masks, staying 6 feet apart, washing hands, cleaning surfaces, and staying home when sick.“CDC’s recommendations remain the same based on existing science and after a thorough technical review of the guidance,” the agency said in news release sent to reporters Monday.It’s unusual for the CDC to alert the media to changes in its guidelines, with updates frequently published to the agency’s website with little fanfare.The agency didn’t immediately respond to an emailed question about whether the acknowledgment would lead to changes in guidance for restaurants, businesses, and other settings.(Corrects spelling of name in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-feet-distance-not-enough-to-prevent-covid-19-spread-says-us-cdc/story-HMtKf7CjXETUig3q7nqD8M.html
06-10-2020||World||Pompeo and his Japanese counterpart to lead initiative to counter China’s growing power||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi, said they will lead a regional initiative called “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” aimed at countering China’s growing assertiveness, a main issue they will discuss on Tuesday with the top envoys from Australia and India.The first in-person talks among the foreign ministers since the coronavirus pandemic began also brings together Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.Motegi, opening his working lunch with Pompeo ahead of the so-called Quad talks, said, “I hope Japan and the US will lead the international society to achieve the Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” He also said the Japan-US alliance continues to be “the cornerstone of peace and stability in the region” under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga who took office on September 16, vowing to carry on his predecessor Shinzo Abe’s hawkish security and diplomatic stance.Pompeo welcomed Suga’s recent description of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific as the foundation of regional peace and stability and that “I could not agree him more.” On his way to Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters that the four countries hope to have some “significant achievements” at the meeting, but did not elaborate.Also Read: PM Modi, Xi to come ‘face-to-face’ at virtual Brics Summit next monthJapanese officials say they will discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) initiative for greater security and economic cooperation that Japan and the US have been pushing to bring together “like-minded” countries that share concerns about China’s growing assertiveness and influence.The talks come weeks ahead of the US presidential election and amid tensions between the US and China over the virus, trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights. Pompeo is attending the Quad meeting, though he cancelled subsequent planned visits to South Korea and Mongolia after President Donald Trump was hospitalized with Covid-19. The president was released on Monday and returned to the White House.The talks follow a recent flareup in tensions between China and India over their border issue. Relations between Australia and China have also deteriorated in recent months.Japan, meanwhile, is concerned about China’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea. Japan also considers China’s growing military activity to be a security threat. Japan’s annual defence policy paper in July accused China of unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea, where it has built and militarised manmade islands and is assertively pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea’s key fisheries and waterways.Suga, who had been chief Cabinet secretary under Abe, will make his in-person diplomatic debut as prime minister when he meets the Quad ministers. He will also hold separate talks with Pompeo on deepening the Japan-US alliance and the FOIP.“The world is possibly becoming even more unpredictable and uncontrollable due to heightening selfish nationalism and growing tension between the US and China,” Suga told Japanese media on Monday. He said he will pursue diplomacy that is based on the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone and “strategically promote the FOIP,” while establishing stable relations with neighbours including China and Russia.Also Read: Uncertainty looms large over India-China trade through Nathu La in SikkimHe said he also plans to promote the FOIP during a planned visit to Southeast Asia later this month.Japan sees the FOIP as crucial to have access to sea lanes all the way to Middle East, a key source of oil for the resource-poor island nation.Suga has little experience in diplomacy. Balancing between the US, Japan’s main security ally, and China, its top trading partner, will be tough, analysts say.Japan hopes to regularize the Quad foreign ministers’ talks and broaden their cooperation with other countries. But each Quad member has its own political stance toward China and it would be difficult to agree on concrete steps even though they share perception of China as a common threat, analysts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-australia-india-japan-to-discuss-china-s-growing-power/story-4y736TtXOX66OYV3EEHQ6O.html
06-10-2020||World||Mike Pompeo seeks to show united front on China despite Covid-19 pandemic||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo began meetings with counterparts from three other democratic countries in Tokyo, in a bid to keep up the pressure on China amid the coronavirus crisis rocking Washington.The so-called Quad -- also including Australia, India and Japan -- is slated to hold its second ministerial-level meeting later Tuesday, an event expected to help firm up New Delhi’s participation in the group. The first international gathering of ministers in Japan in almost a year demonstrates solidarity at a time when China is feuding with at least three of its members: Australia, US and India.For the host, newly installed Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the meeting signals a willingness to continue some of his predecessor Shinzo Abe’s more hawkish security projects. China has expressed concerns that the “Quadrilateral Initiative,” which Abe first helped promote more than a decade ago, is an attempt to form “exclusive cliques” and stoke a “new Cold War.”“What they’re doing is sending a message to the Chinese side that engagement is more important than assertiveness,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a former diplomat and visiting professor at Japan’s Ritsumeikan University. “It doesn’t mean that this is something to contain China. Nobody can contain China.”Pompeo’s VisitThe Quad has gained momentum as President Donald Trump pursues a more confrontational approach to Beijing, while India grows increasingly wary of Chinese economic and military influence in South Asia. The U.S. has since 2017 sought to draw India, which has traditionally protected its non-aligned status, into the fold with a re-branded “Indo-Pacific Strategy.”That the meeting is happening at all, as Trump battles a Covid-19 infection in Washington, illustrates its importance to the US Pompeo -- one of the Trump administration’s most vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party -- canceled subsequent stops in Mongolia and South Korea initially planned for later this week.Pompeo was set to hold bilateral meetings with counterparts Marise Payne of Australia and Toshimitsu Motegi of Japan and Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India as well as with Suga ahead of the four-way discussions.Australia and China have been locked in an diplomatic tit-for-tat over Canberra’s support for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus while Indian and Chinese troops are staring each other down after the deadliest clashes in more than four decades on their disputed Himalayan border.The meeting will also be the first big diplomatic event for Suga, after coming to the premier’s job less than three weeks ago with little foreign policy experience. Suga must strike a balance between Japan’s biggest trading partner, China, and its only military ally, the US. He also agreed to work closely with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a recent phone call.Pompeo praised Suga as a “powerful force for good” in his previous role as chief cabinet secretary, adding that: “The United States has every reason to believe he will strengthen our enduring alliance in his new role.”United FrontThe four ministers are expected to discuss the pandemic and the regional situation, as well as the importance of cooperation with other countries in realizing a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” With no joint statement expected from the meeting, its value could be more symbolic than concrete, although Japan is seeking to make it an annual event.“We hope the relevant countries can think more of the regional countries’ common interests and contribute to regional peace, stability and development rather than doing the opposite,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.India is also expected to invite Australia to take part in an annual naval drill, expanding what has been a trilateral event with the US and Japan, Bloomberg News reported in July. The Quad held its first formal ministerial-level gathering about a year ago in New York, which was seen as a sign of growing unease over Xi’s more assertive foreign policy.Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization, said he doesn’t think a strategic alliance aimed at Beijing is useful or productive. “China is a large trading partner for those nations and has regular collaboration with those nations,” Wang said.The elevation last year of the discussion from official-level talks suggests the previously informal framework was being strengthened to improve intelligence-gathering and present a united front on regional security issues. Tuesday’s meeting comes after the trade ministers of Australia, India and Japan agreed last month to work toward achieving supply-chain resilience in the region, following reports that the three nations were looking to work together to counter the trade dominance of the People’s Republic.“The Quad seeks to establish, promote, and secure Indo-Pacific principles, especially as PRC tactics, aggression, and coercion increase in the region,” Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell, of the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told reporters Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-seeks-to-show-united-front-on-china-despite-covid-19-pandemic/story-uATHsAUbIZwBjYQGnG40iL.html
06-10-2020||World||Covid-19 cases surge in US Midwest and Northeast; 10,000 cases in New York last week||After crushing their Covid-19 outbreaks in the spring and keeping them in check all summer, states in the U.S. Northeast are now seeing infections accelerate, with New York reporting nearly 10,000 new cases last week.Compared with the previous seven days, new cases in New York rose 102% in the week ended Oct. 4, while new cases in Connecticut rose 61% to 1,710 and new cases in New Jersey rose 23% to 4,650, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports. Still, the percentage of tests in the Northeast that were coming back positive for the novel coronavirus remains very low, mostly in the 1%-2% range.The Midwest continues to deal with the highest number of new cases per capita, with North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin reporting the largest number of new cases per 100,000 residents in the past two weeks.Health officials have long said they were worried that colder weather -- which is now hitting the Midwest and Northeast -- would increase outbreaks as more activities move indoors. Nationally, more than 300,000 Americans tested positive for the novel coronavirus last week, down 4% from the prior week, as total cases in the country approach 7.5 million. Some of the national decrease was due to Texas, which two weeks ago reported thousands of backlogged cases.New cases have risen for at least two weeks in a row in 21 states, though deaths from Covid-19 have generally declined for the past seven weeks. Still, more than 5,000 lives were lost last week, and deaths are a lagging indicator that generally rises weeks after a surge in cases.For a second week in a row, testing set a record high, with on average 935,000 tests conducted each day last week, according to data from The Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak.For the first time since mid-June, the percentage of tests that came back positive for the virus was under the 5% threshold that the World Health Organization has said is concerning.Four states had positive rates over 20%: Idaho, Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-surge-in-us-midwest-and-northeast-10-000-cases-in-new-york-last-week/story-7W5a6TCJxwmSYryycUy3sM.html

The meeting comes during a difficult year for North Korea as the coronavirus pandemic puts more pressure on a economy hurt by recent storms and flooding.“We have performed historical feats with our costly efforts, boldly overcoming unprecedentedly grave trials and difficulties this year, but we should not rest on our laurels,” KCNA said.“We still face the challenges that cannot be overlooked and there are many goals we have to attain within this year.”In August, Kim had announced that the ruling party will hold a congress in January to decide a new five-year plan, with a party meeting noting serious delays in improving the national economy.Last year, Kim vowed to make a “frontal breakthrough” in the country’s campaign to build a self-reliant economy in the face of tightening sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear and missile programmes.Security officials were watching for signs that North Korea may use an upcoming holiday to unveil new weapons or test fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) on Oct. 10, the 75th anniversary of the ruling workers party.

The plea was heard by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah.The high court in its verdict said that it was not in the public interest to invoke the “constitutional jurisdiction of a high court in matters involving political content”, especially in cases where the law provides “alternative remedies”.“The people of Pakistan, through their chosen representatives, have the will and resolve to safeguard the security of Pakistan. The security of Pakistan is surely not dependent on the issuance of a writ by this court,” the verdict read.The IHC verdict, which was reserved earlier on Monday, said that the petitioner argued that the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had banned speeches delivered by individuals who were declared as absconders in a case.“Taking this argument into account, the court said that the petitioner “could not give a plausible explanation for invoking the jurisdiction of this court when an alternate remedy was available” to them,” said the article on The Dawn.The petitioner had also expressed concern that the country’s security was being “threatened”, the five-page verdict noted. The court, however, dismissed this argument in its ruling, saying that “the security of Pakistan is not frail nor can be threatened by mere political rhetoric”. According to the verdict, the petitioner’s concerns about the country’s security were “misconceived”.A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered against Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the case of criminal conspiracy for the “provocative speeches” he made in London to “defame Pakistan’s institutions”The FIR was lodged against Sharif on October 1 by a local in the Shahdra Police Station’s jurisdiction.Earlier this month, Pakistan failed to execute a non-bailable arrest warrant against Sharif, who was granted permission to fly abroad to get medical treatment in November last year.For nearly one month, the Pakistan government made several attempts to get Sharif’s arrest warrant signed.Last week, the IHC had slammed Sharif over his failure to appear before the court after he was granted permission to fly abroad for medical treatment.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan had tasked relevant authorities to bring back Sharif at the earliest. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister also issued the directive to pursue the matter vigorously.A cabinet member had told Dawn the government had already sent a request to the British government for the repatriation of Nawaz but it would now send a fresh application.Last month, the IHC came down heavily on the Imran Khan-led government for allowing Sharif to go abroad without informing the court and it was up to the dispensation to take steps for ensuring the latter’s return to the country.

06-10-2020||World||Joe Biden aims to expand map as Donald Trump recovers from Covid-19||As President Donald Trump recovers from the coronavirus, Joe Biden is capitalizing on having the campaign trail largely to himself by hitting critical swing states and investing in longtime Republican bastions that he hopes might expand his path to victory.The Democratic presidential nominee made his second trip to Florida in a little over two weeks on Monday. His visit to Miami was designed to encroach on some of Trump’s turf, even swinging through Little Havana, a typically conservative area known for its staunch opposition to the communist government that Fidel Castro installed in Cuba.He’ll follow up with a trip later this week to Arizona, which hasn’t backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996. Even Biden’s former primary rival, Bernie Sanders, has resumed in-person campaigning for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak in March. The progressive Vermont senator held socially distanced rallies in the swing states of New Hampshire and Michigan and proclaimed, “We need Joe Biden as our president.”Biden is complementing the expanded campaign travel with a late-stage ad push, reserving more than $6 million in television airtime in Texas — for decades deeply red — through the end of October, according to an Associated Press analysis of CMAG data. He also plans to spend $4 million on advertising in Georgia, another Republican-leaning state that Democrats are feeling bullish about.Trump, meanwhile, has scaled back advertising in both states and has begun doing the same in Ohio, which he also won in 2016.Also Read: Over 200,000 in US have died from Covid-19. Now Trump says he ‘gets it’Sitting on a massive pile of campaign cash less than a month before Election Day, Biden is trying to put Trump on defense across the country and build an advantage in the Electoral College so large that the president might struggle to contest it. That’s especially important since Trump, who lost the popular vote in 2016, has said he may not accept the election results this year and has raised unfounded allegations that the increased use of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic could lead to fraud.“2020 is not 2016. The ‘Dems in disarray,’ fretting that we’re going to go too far, that’s not the reality this time,” said Kelly Dietrich, founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, which has worked with around 1,500 of the party’s candidates for offices nationwide this cycle. “They are running a solid race focused on the swing states we need to win but now have excess resources to expand the map.”As Election Day nears, Democrats are still stung by the 2016 campaign, when Hillary Clinton focused on Republican-leaning states like North Carolina and Arizona in the final weeks, only to lose ones that long supported Democrats, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said, “It would be a mistake for Biden to take his foot off the pedal,” but added, “I wouldn’t want Biden to make the same mistake Clinton did.”“I’d be careful, if I was Biden, about expanding the map too much,” Bannon said.Biden’s advisers say they have been confident for months they can expand the electoral map while never wavering from their promise to have their candidate travel only when local health guidelines allowed for it. Adhering to that plan has allowed them to expand into other parts of the country at the most critical of moments.Speaking Monday in Little Havana, Biden was careful to continue to wish Trump a speedy recovery but also criticized his administration’s response to the pandemic.“I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,” Biden said. “Now that’s he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I’d encourage him to do this: Listen to the scientists.”Biden also diverted from his usual campaign speech about rebuilding the economy after the pandemic to add, “The richness and beauty of Miami is built with the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America.”Trump left the hospital Monday night. Although it’s not clear when he’ll be well enough for a full travel schedule, he’s already thinking about one.“Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!!” the president tweeted.Biden advisers say they never considered dialing back his campaigning even while the president was hospitalized, especially with Vice President Mike Pence having taken on a larger role, including at Wednesday’s debate with Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, in Salt Lake City, Utah.Also Read: Joe Biden urges Donald Trump to support nationwide mask mandate“The Trump campaign continues to run their presidential campaign, and we are going to continue to run our presidential campaign,” said Biden campaign senior strategist Anita Dunn. “Clearly, both campaigns are continuing to move forward.”Still, Biden faces lingering questions about whether he was exposed to the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends quarantining for two weeks after a person’s exposure to the virus. Biden shared a stage with the president for 90 minutes during last week’s first presidential primary debate.Biden says he’s since been tested three times, all with negative results. His campaign has promised he will be tested regularly and has committed to releasing all results, but they’ve refused to comment on whether quarantine was considered after the debate and they haven’t said how often Biden will undergo tests.During an MSNBC town hall later Monday evening, Biden said presidents should be transparent about their health, though he also “can understand that, in certain circumstances related to national security, where every detail would not be made available in the middle of a particular crisis.”But Biden said withholding such information was only appropriately rarely and for short periods of time, saying it should be done “only on the margins and only for the moment.”Since the president tested positive for the virus, Biden’s campaign has been even more disciplined about minimizing its candidate’s risk. The former vice president has begun keeping on his face mask even when giving speeches. And when he stopped to answer questions before boarding his plane to Miami, Biden’s wife, Jill, physically pulled him back to prevent him from moving too close to reporters, despite everyone wearing masks.“We are not going to put people’s health at risk for a political campaign,” Dunn said, “but we are going to campaign as vigorously as we can.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-aims-to-expand-map-as-donald-trump-recovers-from-covid-19/story-hjukHS0pujiSyV4YZvLXJO.html
06-10-2020||World||Over 200,000 in US have died from Covid-19. Now Trump says he ‘gets it’||Now that he has contracted Covid-19, President Donald Trump says he does “get it.” That revelation, seven months into the pandemic and after almost 210,000 American deaths, is not the first time he has relied on personal experience to shape his views.He said he now “understands” the virus. But because of his own experience, as a patient at one of the nation’s finest medical facilities with treatment options available to very few, the president also reinforced that he has struggled to relate with everyday Americans, millions of whom have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus.Instead, as he has in relationships with other countries, he has prioritized his own personal experience over that of experts. He has been reluctant, for instance, to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin over interference in American elections in the face of clear evidence from the US intelligence community that it has occurred.Also Read: Donald Trump returns to White House after 4-day stay at hospitalHe has also drawn frequently on his experience with the business world or his own family to set the White House agenda. He cited his business acumen as helping him land a deal for the US Embassy in Jerusalem, and he said he understands the airline industry because of his time running the failed Trump Shuttle.Despite months of briefings from the nation’s leading infectious disease experts, it was the onset of his own symptoms, as he was brought low by a lethal virus, that he said gave him a greater understanding.That understanding, however, seemed very much in conflict with expert public health guidance about how the virus behaves and the precautions that people infected, particularly those in a higher risk group like the president, need to take.“It’s been a very interesting journey,” Trump said in a video released Sunday night. “I learned a lot about Covid. I learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. And I get it, and I understand it, and it’s a very interesting thing, and I’m going to be letting you know about it.”Also Read| Donald Trump intends to participate in next US presidential debate: OfficialBut it soon became clear that he did not, in fact, get it.Trump took a surprise ride in a motorcade to pay tribute to his supporters, potentially exposing the Secret Service agents who rode in the vehicle with him. The next day, when announcing that he would be returning to the White House, he took a tone that suggested he was out of touch with suffering Americans who could not receive the same level of presidential care.“Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life,” Trump tweeted. “We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!”At no point since he tested positive for the virus has Trump acknowledged others afflicted with the deadly disease. His general election foe, Democrat Joe Biden, on Monday urged him to fundamentally change how he manages the pandemic.“I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,” Biden said in Miami. “Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.”Even when the virus struck longtime friends, like Stanley Chera, a New Jersey developer who died of the disease in April, Trump did not change his approach and continued to talk about the virus as though it would soon be a thing of the past.“We’ve always said that he has no capacity for empathy. His sense of self-regard is so overwhelming, he views everything that passes through the world through the lens of what it does for him,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the department of African American Studies at Princeton University.“Even though more than 200,000 Americans are dead, the nature of the crisis doesn’t come home unless it actually touches him,” Glaude said. “Could he ever represent anyone other than himself?”Trump has said he could deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un because he had established a personal rapport with the authoritarian figure in ways that his predecessors could not.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“I was being really tough and so was he. And then we would go back and forth,” Trump said at a 2018 rally. “And then we fell in love. No really. He wrote me beautiful letters.”Since Trump has in effect declared his battle with the disease successful — an assessment that available medical evidence suggests is premature — it remains doubtful that Trump would take his personal experience battling Covid-19 and rethink his administration’s policies or attitudes toward the pandemic, especially given the competing imperative of continuing his presidential campaign.Trump often has had difficulty embracing a central role of the American presidency: consoling people dealing with intense grief, regardless of their political affiliation or support for the White House’s agenda. It’s a quality rarely debated or analyzed during a campaign, yet one that can shape the way people view the success of their president.But in 2020, it has become a central issue. The president has rarely mentioned the toll of the virus on the nation, instead focusing on an economic recovery or a rise in the stock market.He has largely eschewed wearing a mask and mocked those who have. And he has ignored his own federal government’s guidelines when holding rallies and large-scale White House events.Trump may draw lessons from his own experiences but will rarely ever acknowledge a misstep, said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg.“He once said, ‘It is what it is’ about the impact of Covid. His video (Sunday night) was better than that, it was probably the closest he is going to get to an apology,” said Nunberg. “That’s not who he is.”The White House sees it differently.“He has experience now fighting the coronavirus as an individual,” said Erin Perrine, a campaign spokeswoman. “Joe Biden doesn’t have that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-200-000-in-us-have-died-from-covid-19-now-trump-says-he-gets-it/story-3kjTajh5LhAWWbW0z5L9QO.html
06-10-2020||World||‘Don’t be afraid’ of Covid-19, says Donald Trump on return to White House||President Donald Trump told Americans “to get out there” and not fear Covid-19 as he returned to the White House on Monday after a three-night hospital stay to be treated for the virus and removed his white surgical mask to pose for pictures.Asked how he felt on arrival at the White House, where his staff has been hit by infections and his re-election campaign shadowed by the pandemic, Trump said: “Real good,” according to a pool report by a journalist covering his return on behalf of other media.Trump wore a mask as he walked out of the helicopter that flew him back from a military hospital outside Washington and climbed the stairs of the White House South Portico, where he removed it and posed for pictures, waving, saluting and giving thumbs-up signs.He then turned to walk into the White House, his mask still in his pocket, TV footage showed.The Republican president, running for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 US election, was admitted to the Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday after being diagnosed with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.“Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said in a recorded video message. “We’re going back, we’re going back to work. We’re going to be out front. ... Don’t let it dominate your lives. Get out there, be careful.”The disease has killed more than 1 million people worldwide and more than 209,000 in the United States alone - the highest death toll of any country.Trump, 74, has not had a fever in more than 72 hours and his oxygen levels are normal, his medical team told reporters in front of the hospital. The doctors declined, however, to discuss any toll the disease could have on the president’s lungs or disclose when Trump last tested negative for the coronavirus.The team added that the president had received supplemental oxygen twice in recent days.“He may not entirely be out of the woods yet,” Dr. Sean. P. Conley, the White House physician, said. “If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief.”But Conley said the medical team believed Trump was ready to leave the hospital, stressing he would have world-class medical care around the clock at the White House.Conley said doctors were in “uncharted territory” because Trump had received certain therapies so early in the course of the illness.The severity of Trump’s illness has been the subject of intense speculation, with some medical experts noting that, as an overweight, elderly man, he was in a category more likely to develop severe complications or die from the disease.Doctors also have been treating him with a steroid, dexmethasone, that is normally used only in the most severe cases.Trump has frequently downplayed the threat of the pandemic. In recent days, he released a series of videos to reassure the public he was recovering from COVID-19.He was reluctant to go to the hospital last week and was eager to get out, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier on Monday.U.S. House of Representatives Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hoped Trump’s decision to return to the White House was not politically motivated and she expressed concern that he could become a “long hauler,” a term that refers to those who suffer COVID-19 complications over an extended period.Trump’s medical team said he had not placed any pressure on the doctors treating him.Even being discharged, Trump will need to continue treatment as he is still undergoing a five-day course of an intravenous antiviral drug, remdesivir, and will have to isolate himself for a certain period of time.The coronavirus outbreak around Trump widened on Monday when White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she had tested positive for the virus.McEnany, who is at the forefront of the White House’s often combative dealings with the media, held a briefing for reporters on Thursday in which she did not wear a face mask.Chad Gilmartin and Karoline Leavitt, who work in the White House’s press office, also have tested positive, a source confirmed to Reuters.TRAILING IN POLLSA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday showed Trump trailing Biden, 77, nationally by 10 percentage points. About 65% of Americans said Trump would not have been infected had he taken the virus more seriously.Trump has repeatedly flouted social-distancing guidelines meant to curb its spread. He also mocked Biden at last Tuesday’s presidential debate for wearing a mask at events, even when he is far from other people.Biden, who has tested negative for the disease several times since the debate, said on Monday he was willing to participate in the next presidential debate scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami if health experts deemed it safe.Trump intends to take part in the debate, his campaign said.A return to the White House might help Trump project a sense of normalcy. Before falling ill, he tried to pivot the campaign toward the U.S. economic recovery and the upcoming confirmation hearings for his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett.But the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the White House as well as in Congress - three Republican senators have tested positive for the virus in the past week - threatens to draw further attention to Trump’s pandemic response.Major U.S. stock markets closed higher on Monday before Trump’s departure from the hospital and amid signs of progress with a new fiscal stimulus bill in Congress. Wall Street’s main indexes slumped on Friday after Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis.(Reporting by Steve Holland and Alexandra Alper; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Andy Sullivan, Andrea Shalal, Susan Heavey, Lisa Lambert, Patricia Zengerle, Susan Cornwell, and Tim Ahmann; Writing by Paul Simao; Editing by Scott Malone, Howard Goller and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-be-afraid-of-covid-19-says-donald-trump-on-return-to-white-house/story-c1mrfPb91xLrHGH6p12WBN.html

06-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, still infectious, back at White House without mask||President Donald Trump staged a dramatic return to the White House Monday night after leaving the military hospital where he was receiving an unprecedented level of care for Covid-19. He immediately ignited a new controversy by declaring that despite his illness the nation should not fear the virus that has killed more than 210,000 Americans — and then he entered the White House without a protective mask.Trump’s message alarmed infectious disease experts and suggested the president’s own illness had not caused him to rethink his often-cavalier attitude toward the disease, which has also infected the first lady and several White House aides, including new cases revealed on Monday.Landing at the White House on Marine One, Trump gingerly climbed the South Portico steps, removed his mask and declared, “I feel good.” He gave a double thumbs-up to the departing helicopter from the portico terrace, where aides had arranged American flags for the sunset occasion. He entered the White House, where aides were visible milling about the Blue Room, without wearing a face covering.The president left Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where his doctor, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley, said earlier Monday that the president remains contagious and would not be fully “out of the woods” for another week but that Trump had met or exceeded standards for discharge from the hospital. Trump is expected to continue his recovery at the White House, where the reach of the outbreak that has infected the highest levels of the US government is still being uncovered.Still, just a month before the election and anxious to project strength, Trump tweeted before leaving the hospital, “Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!!” And in case anyone missed his don’t-worry message earlier, he rushed out a new video from the White House.“Don’t be afraid of it,” Trump said of the virus. “You’re going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines.” His remarks were strong, but he was taking deeper breaths than usual as he delivered them.Trump’s nonchalant message about not fearing the virus comes as his own administration has encouraged Americans to be very careful and take precautions to avoid contracting and spreading the disease as cases continue to spike across the country. For more than eight months, Trump’s efforts to play down the threat of the virus in hopes of propping up the economy ahead of the election have drawn bipartisan criticism.“We have to be realistic in this: COVID is a complete threat to the American population,” Dr. David Nace of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said of Trump’s comment.“Most of the people aren’t so lucky as the president,” with an in-house medical unit and access to experimental treatments, added Nace, an expert on infections in older adults.“It’s an unconscionable message,” agreed Dr. Sadiya Khan of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “I would go so far as to say that it may precipitate or worsen spread.”Likewise, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who spent more than 90 minutes on the debate stage with Trump last week, said during an NBC town hall Monday night that he was glad Trump seemed to be recovering well, “but there’s a lot to be concerned about -- 210,000 people have died. I hope no one walks away with the message that it’s not a problem.”Biden, who tested negative for the virus on Sunday, said in an interview with WPLG Local 10 News in Miami: “I saw a tweet he did, they showed me, he said ‘Don’t let COVID control your life.’” Tell that to all the “families that lost someone.”There was pushback from a prominent Trump political supporter as well.Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told the Houston Chronicle editorial board that Trump had “let his guard down” in his effort to show that the country was moving beyond the virus and had created “confusion” about how to stay safe.Dr. Conley said that because of Trump’s unusual level of treatment so early after discovery of his illness he was in “uncharted territory.” But the doctor also was upbeat at an afternoon briefing and said the president could resume his normal schedule once “there is no evidence of live virus still present.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 can be contagious for as many — and should isolate for at least — 10 days.Trump’s arrival back at the White House raised new questions about how the administration was going to protect other officials from a disease that remains rampant in the president’s body. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced she had tested positive for the virus Monday morning and was entering quarantine.There were also lingering questions about potential long term effects to the president — and even when he first came down with the virusConley repeatedly declined to share results of medical scans of Trump’s lungs, saying he was not at liberty to discuss the information because Trump did not waive doctor-patient confidentiality on the subject. Covid-19 has been known to cause significant damage to the lungs of some patients. Conley also declined to share the date of Trump’s most recent negative test for the virus — a critical point for contact tracing and understanding where Trump was in the course of the disease.Only a day earlier, Trump suggested he had finally grasped the true nature of the virus, saying in a video, “I get it.” But then on Sunday afternoon, he ventured out of the hospital while contagious to salute cheering supporters by motorcade — an outing that disregarded precautions meant to contain the virus.At the hospital, doctors revealed that his blood oxygen level had dropped suddenly twice in recent days and that they gave him a steroid typically only recommended for the very sick.Trump’s experience with the disease has been dramatically different from most Americans, who do not have access to the same kind of monitoring and care. While most must cope with their symptoms — and fear of whether they’ll take a turn for the worse — at home and alone, Trump has been staying in the presidential suite of one of the nation’s best hospitals and has been given experimental drugs not readily available to the public. He returns to the White House where there is a team of doctors on call with 24-hour monitoring.Trump was leaving the hospital after receiving a fourth dose of the antiviral drug remdesivir Monday evening, Conley said. He will receive the fifth and final dose Tuesday at the White House.Vice President Mike Pence returned to the campaign trail moments after Trump announced he would soon leave the hospital. The vice president boarded Air Force Two to fly to Salt Lake City, where he is to face off against Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday.Trump, in his new video, defended his decision to repeatedly flout his own administration’s guidelines to slow the spread of the virus, including by holding rallies with thousands of largely maskless supporters.Apparently referring to any potential danger to himself rather than others, he said, “I stood out front. I led. Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did.” He added, “And I know there’s a risk, there’s a danger. But that’s OK. And now I’m better. And maybe I’m immune, I don’t know.”Even before Trump’s motorcade outing on Sunday, some Secret Service agents had expressed concern about the lackadaisical attitude toward masks and social distancing inside the White House, but there isn’t much they can do, according to agents and officials who spoke to The Associated Press.Trump’s aggressive course of treatment included the steroid dexamethasone and the single dose he was given Friday of an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that supplies antibodies to help the immune system fight the virus. Trump on Friday also began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways — the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus, and remdesivir curbs the virus’ ability to multiply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-still-infectious-back-at-white-house-without-mask/story-O2iB2UuhUqiV2VcGoKnykM.html
06-10-2020||World||Joe Biden urges Donald Trump to support nationwide mask mandate||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Monday urged President Donald Trump to support a nationwide mask mandate to effectively launch a fight against the coronavirus pandemic. “My prayers continue to be with the president and the First Lady for their health and safety as they are like so many American families who are dealing with Covid-19,” Biden said at a campaign event in the swing state of Florida. Last Thursday, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19. The president was admitted to a military hospital for necessary treatment. “I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this listen to scientists. Support masks,” Biden said hours before Trump is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital. Requesting Trump to support a nationwide mandate that requires masks in every federal building and facility, Biden said, “Urge every governor and mayor to do the same. We know it saves lives.” “His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. I believe that was wrong and not very rational,” the former vice president added. Biden, who as per latest polls, has widened his lead over Trump by double digits, has been an ardent advocate of making masks mandatory nationwide. This he argues will save a lot of lives. Experts say that universal masking could have saved 100000 lives between now and January, he said. “You know I backed that mandate months ago; he should back it now,” Biden said. “Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, more than 100,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID and this week at least 5,000 more will die in many states. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful but our nation’s COVID-19 crisis is far far from over,” he added. Nearly 210,000 Americans have died due to the virus so far with about 7.5 million contracting the infection. This pandemic and the economic collapse have hit the Hispanic communities hard, Biden said. Biden said some economists are calling this a K-shaped recovery. It means essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic who have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic, are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in the modern American history, Biden said. While workers are struggling, it’s true the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well, making an additional USD300 billion since the Covid-19 broke out, said the former vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-urges-donald-trump-to-support-nationwide-mask-mandate/story-cbdRzO8FsK2a35bAIEyofO.html
06-10-2020||World||Mike Pence, Kamala Harris all set for vice-presidential debate on Wednesday||Vice President Mike Pence and his Democratic challenger Senator Kamala Harris are all set for a debate in the Sal Lake City of Utah on Wednesday. This will be for the first time in the American history that an Indian origin person will be taking up the podium for a vice presidential debate. Political analysts believe that an aggressive Harris, 55, will easily prevail over Pence, 61, during the only vice-presidential debate and help her running mate Joe Biden, 77, to widen his lead over Trump, 74. Biden, in the last few days, has widened his lead over Trump by double digit. However, the Trump Campaign believes that Pence could come out with a stellar performance during the debate. The debate gains added significance, given the Covid-19 infecting Trump, triggering speculations that Pence may be taking over the reigns of the country temporarily. Also, many believe that Harris will be the real force in a Biden administration. Both Pence and Harris has said that they are well prepared for the debate, which would be moderated by journalist Susan Page, Washington Bureau Chief, USA Today. According to media reports, plexiglass will be installed between Pence and Harris on the debate stage. “The debates are a crucial part of making our democracy work and I am honored to participate,” Page said in a statement. The debate will be divided into nine segments of approximately 10 minutes each, said the Commission on Presidential Debate. The moderator will ask an opening question after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic, it said. “We’re looking very much forward to the vice-presidential debate,” Pence told reporters at the Andrews Joint Air Force Base here. “The stakes in this election have never been higher, the choice has never been clearer, and I look forward to the opportunity to take our case to the American people for four more years for President Donald Trump in the White House,” he said. Pence spoke over the phone with Trump before boarding Air Force Two. “I spoke to the President a little while back and he sounded great. As the American people learned just a little while ago, President Trump is going home tonight. So, we’re headed to Utah for the vice presidential debate,” Pence said. According to his aides, Pence has some debate preparations. Harris is already in Utah. On Sunday Harris toured This Is The Place Monument, the location marking the end of the 1,300-mile trek to Utah by the early Mormons. Harris was led by former Utah State Senator Scott Howell on the tour of the monument, which was erected in 1847 and also honors the Native Americans, Mountain Men and Spanish Catholic priests who explored the land before the settlement was established. “Vice-presidential debates can often be afterthoughts in a presidential race. But with President Trump in the hospital, Mike Pence and Kamala Harris will now face an unusual amount of scrutiny and a tricky balancing act,” The New York Times wrote. Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said it would be a real mistake to underestimate the skills of Pence. Buttigieg is apparently helping Harris in debate preparations. “He was very effective in 2016. And also in his debates, if you look in 2012, when he was running for governor, it would be a real mistake to underestimate. Largely because he doesn’t seem to have any qualms about defending what many of us would consider indefensible, even if it flies in the face of his own professed values,” he told Indianapolis Monthly in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-kamala-harris-all-set-for-vice-presidential-debate-on-wednesday/story-sNOBaLzITx9L7wyK4wHMtJ.html
06-10-2020||World||Donald Trump returns to White House after 4-day stay at hospital||US President Donald Trump returned to the White House Monday night after spending four days at a military hospital where he was treated for coronavirus.Trump, 77, looked healthy. Showing his fitness, Trump in an unusual decision climbed up the South Portico stairs, instead of the elevators, to go to his residence. He waived at reporters.The president, after taking off his mask, stood up in the portico facing South Lawns for a few minutes and saluted Marine One.Earlier, he was discharged from the Walter Reed National Medical Center after doctors treating him found that he was fit enough to go back home.“Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!! The Fake News only shows the Fake Polls,” Trump said in a tweet moments before leaving Walter Reed National Medical Center in Bethesda, a Maryland suburb of Washington DC.His former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president was strong and upbeat. “He’s a fighter and will not quit battling this virus or surrender to the liberal mob and forces out to destroy our country,” Sanders said in a tweet.Before boarding Marine One at Walter Reed, Trump told reporters that he was feeling good.White House physician Dr Sean Conley told reporters at the Walter Reed National Military Center, Trump has exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria and has received another dose of remdesivir drug in his treatment of Covid-19.“Over the past 24 hours, the president has continued to improve. He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria. He has received another dose of remdesivir you’re here today, and then we plan to get him home,” he said. “It’s been more than 72 hours since his last fever. Oxygen levels, including ambulatory saturations and his work of breathing or all normal though. He may not entirely be out of the woods, yet the team and I agree that all our evaluations and most importantly, his clinical status support the president’s safe return home, where he’ll be surrounded by world-class medical care 24 seven,” Dr Conley said.Dr Sean Dooley, a pulmonary critical care physician, told reporters that the president continues to do very well.His vital signs this morning, temperature was 98.1, his blood pressure 134 and 78 and respiratory rate 17 per minute. His heart rate was 68 beats per minute and his last Oxo hemoglobin saturation was 97 per cent on room air, he said.He currently does not endorse any respiratory complaints, the physician said.According to Dr Brian Garibaldi, director of Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit, on Sunday evening, the president received his third dose of remdesivir and he tolerated that infusion without difficulty.His kidney and liver function continued to be normal, he said.“Our plan is to give the fourth dose of remdesivir this evening, before he goes back to the White House, and we’ve made arrangements to deliver the fifth and final dose of his treatment course at the White House tomorrow evening,” Garibaldi added.“He continues on dexamethazone and again. The plan for today is to continue to be up and out of bed, eat, and drink and work as he is able,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-leaves-hospital-to-return-to-white-house/story-4ny26vIEC3LvMetVpxEnXM.html

Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!”“The President has continued to improve,” Sean Conley, the president’s physician told reporters, “He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria and (will) receive another dose of Remdesivir here today. And then we plan to get him home.”“He is back,” he added.The team planned to discharge him later after administering the fourth dose of Remdesivir, the anti-viral drug that is known to cut recovery time for Covid-19 patients. They did not say if he will continue to also get Dexamethasone, a steroid he was given earlier to prevent oxygen levels from dropping.Asked how safe was it for the president to return to the White House when he was still not out of the 7 to 10 days period, Conley said the team was being “cautiously optimistic, and on guard, because we’re in a bit of uncharted territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course”.“So, we’re looking to this weekend. If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief.”The medical team had said Sunday that they had expected to discharge the president on Monday because had been doing well. Trump was airlifted to the Walter Reed Medical Hospital Center on Friday after he showed symptoms of severe Covid-19, high fever and a rapid drop in blood oxygen levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-feel-better-than-i-did-20-years-ago-says-donald-trump-to-leave-hospital-later-in-the-day/story-1VMdB89z5TfNflpCRh0xfL.html

Their success story was hailed in a report by FICCI, consultant Grant Thornton and the Indian high commission in February, titled ‘India in the UK: The Diaspora Effect’.A consortium of Zuber Issa and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital will take a majority stake in Asda, a spokesperson for the brothers and the equity firm said. Walmart, which bought Asda in 1999 for £6.7 billion, will retain a minority stake in the chain.The brothers said: “We believe that our experience with EG Group, including our expertise around convenience and brand partnerships and our successful partnership with TDR Capital, can help to accelerate and execute that growth strategy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-billionaire-brothers-from-uk-buy-retail-giant-asda/story-WymAnGg92dg1KQz6cfO2JL.html
06-10-2020||World||Labour MP of UK’s ‘Little India’ faces criminal charge for harassment||Labour MP Claudia Webbe, whose candidature in Leicester East – better known as ‘Little India’ – in the December 2019 election generated much resentment in the party, was on Monday charged with harassment against a woman and now faces a trial.Webbe, reputed to be close to former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, was nominated for the seat represented since 1987 by Keith Vaz. Claims of Indian-origin candidates such as Sundip Meghani were ignored in favour of Webbe, who went on to win in the Labour stronghold with a smaller margin.Jenny Hopkins of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: “The CPS has today decided that Claudia Webbe, MP for Leicester East, should be charged with an offence of harassment against one female”.“The CPS made the decision after receiving a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police”.“Criminal proceedings against Ms Webbe are now active and she has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings,” she added.The identity of the woman who was allegedly harassed by Webbe was not disclosed.Webbe, who was suspended by Labour after the CPS statement, said: “I am innocent of any wrongdoing and look forward to proving this in court. I will be vigorously defending myself against these claims.”Meghani, who resigned from Labour in August after 20 years in the party, was among several Indian-origin candidates who were ignored by Labour in the 2019 election, including Navin Shah and Kailash Chand. It was another point of ennui for the Indian community that was already upset with the party’s pro-interventionist resolution on Jammu and Kashmir.Labour Friends of India, a prominent lobby group within the party, had expressed its dismay over candidate selection and warned the leadership under Corbyn not to take the support of the 1.5 million-strong Indian community for granted.“We express regret that the Labour party has selected just one candidate of Indian heritage in 39 safe seats, and no Indian heritage candidate in 100 target seats…Despite shortlisting or selecting candidates in areas with a large Indian community such as Leicester, Ealing, Ilford, West Bromwich and Derby, no Indian-heritage candidates were selected”, the group had said.“There is a risk this failure to increase representation of Indians in parliament could hit Labour further…The Labour party must ensure it is never seen to take the support of the Indian community for granted”, it added.Keir Starmer, who replaced Corbyn as the party leader earlier this year, has promised a new leadership style that draws a line under the conflicts triggered during his predecessor’s tenure. He has since made pro-India and pro-Indian community overtures since taking over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-mp-of-uk-s-little-india-faces-criminal-charge-for-harassment/story-iHN3FU2lw9EHObD6AC7kQO.html
06-10-2020||World||Manali Desai first Indian-origin woman to head a Cambridge dept||Sociologist Manali Desai has been appointed head of the department of sociology at the University of Cambridge, making her not only the first Indian-origin woman to head a department in the 811-year-old university but also the first woman of colour to hold such a role. Desai, who calls herself a “hybrid child of three different cultures”, said she was born in the US but moved early to India and studied in Modern School, Delhi. She later moved to London and completed her last two years of school there. She then moved to the US and studied Economics at the University of Michigan and completed a PhD in Sociology at the University of California Los Angeles. She previously taught in the US and at the London School of Economics before joining Cambridge in 2013. The department said: “Manali Desai takes up the chair in Sociology this year, and in doing so becomes the first woman of colour, to our knowledge, to lead a Cambridge department in the University’s 811-year history”. Much of her research has focused on Indian politics and social movements, including the transformation of identities and interests during the long transition from the colonial to post-colonial periods. Her books include a focus on India-linked themes such as gender and violence, state formation and radical democracy. Desai was awarded the 2019 Pilkington Teaching Prize, in recognition of her commitment to and impact on teaching at Cambridge. A fellow of Newnham College, she is among several Indian-origin scholars who have taught in Cambridge over the centuries. Desai said on being appointed to the new role: “We are living through a period of ferment and we are at a crucial juncture when fundamental questions about our very existence are at stake. The discipline of sociology has always tackled the big questions, be it climate change, war, poverty, and intersectional social inequalities. “We have witnessed dramatic transformations and ruptures in recent years, with the global pandemic and movements for social change such as Black Lives Matter coming on the heels of austerity and the rise of global populism, to name a few”. “Sociology gives us the tools to be able to investigate and understand the world around us and so I think the department is a good place to be during periods of such upheaval,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/manali-desai-first-indian-origin-woman-to-head-a-cambridge-dept/story-qXBXkcjBQ99LzlHJKHtujN.html
06-10-2020||World||UK crime officials seize £300,000 from Indian-origin couple||Britain’s crime prevention officials and Scotland Yard have recovered from an Indian-origin couple more than £300,000 (around 2.8 crore rupees) in cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said on Tuesday that searches of a house belonging to husband and wife Sailesh and Harkit Singara in Edgware in north-west London revealed a total of more than £200,000, around half of it neatly stacked on a bed. Another £100,000 was found in a suitcase on the floor. The total amount seized was £306,805.Nearby, officers found a further £100,000 in a bag which was in the possession of Sailesh Mandalia, a business associate of Singara. Believing the money to be the proceeds of crime, investigators applied for a forfeiture order, which is a civil process intended to recover illicit cash where there has been no proven criminal offence.Mandalia and the couple, who own two money service companies, appealed against the forfeiture, asserting that the cash was intended for legitimate business accounts, and that poor accounting over several years was responsible for any confusion.But on September 10, the Southwark Crown Court dismissed their appeal, instructing the three respondents to pay costs of a combined £4,350, the NCA said.Detective chief inspector Tony O’Sullivan said: “While the three individuals are not accused, and have not been convicted of any crime in relation to these events, the £300,000 recovered will now go into the public purse where it can positively impact on communities.”“Money is at the heart of organised crime, and it is vital that those in possession of huge sums of cash can account for it legitimately”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-crime-officials-seize-300-000-from-indian-origin-couple/story-Qg8zVCfG5h72tiCTN1BjvN.html

What’s out there, how can we widen the net, how do these books seem when compared to one another, how do they fare when re-read? These are questions judges always ask themselves, and each other”.The 2020 winner will be announced on November 17 in an event broadcast from London’s Roundhouse in collaboration with BBC Arts.

06-10-2020||World||Indian-origin politician dropped from London mayor candidate list for anti-semitism||Britain’s Liberal Democrats have dropped Geeta Sidhu-Robb as one of their candidates for London mayor and suspended her from the party after a video emerged of her making anti-semitic remarks during the 1997 general election.The lawyer and businesswoman, who has roots in Punjab, was the Conservative candidate in Blackburn, Lancashire in the 1997 election. Her opponent was senior Labour leader Jack Straw.Footage from that election campaign, revealed by PoliticsHome website, shows Sidhu-Robb saying she planned to inform voters about Straw’s faith, adding, “how is a Muslim going to vote for someone who is Jewish?” She is then seen going around in a car in Blackburn, appealing to voters on a loudspeaker in Urdu.“Don’t vote for a Jew, Jack Straw is a Jew,” she is seen as saying about her rival candidate, who held various cabinet positions in the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments, including as foreign secretary.Straw is a Christian, but has some Jewish ancestry. The Blackburn constituency has a large Muslim minority, around 25% of the population.The video sparked an investigation by Liberal Democrats, the third largest party in UK after Labour and Conservatives. A Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: “Geeta Sidhu-Robb has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats and will not be on the ballot paper to be the Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London”.Sidhu-Robb apologised after the footage emerged. “I am deeply ashamed of the ignorant and abusive language I used on one occasion in the 1997 General Election campaign. As shown in the footage, I instantly regretted my appalling behaviour, which I continue to do,” she tweeted. “Those words are entirely inconsistent with my views and values, and though there are no excuses for my actions, there is some context; that is, that I was under a great deal of strain and retaliated to the racial abuse I was receiving in Blackburn ‘like for like’.”“Two wrongs never make a right. I made a mistake and I take responsibility for my abhorrent actions 23 years ago, they were never repeated. I urge you to judge me on who I am today, a campaigner committed to eradicating inequality and discrimination in all its forms,” she added.The London mayoral election was due in May, but has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Sidhu-Robb was shortlisted for the mayoral candidacy alongside Liberal Democrats councillor Luisa Porrit, with the contest due to run until October 13. The party, which formed a coalition government with the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2010 to 2015, is finalising its candidate after Siobhan Benita, who was to contest against mayor Sadiq Khan, withdrew recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-politician-dropped-from-london-mayor-candidate-list-for-anti-semitism/story-vmscOCiUTW2FyKFxWdCigL.html
