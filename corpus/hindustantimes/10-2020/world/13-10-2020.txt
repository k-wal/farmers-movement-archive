The former vice-president leads by 10.4 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.More than 10 million Americans have already voted through mail or early voting in person according to a University of Florida study tracking the polls.Trailing in polls, the president returned to the campaign trail with an hour-long speech in Sanford, Florida, in which he sought to set at rest doubts about his recovery from the illness that has killed more 215,000 Americans and infected nearly 8 million.“I don’t have to be locked up in my basement and I wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway,” Trump said, replaying a version of an attack line he has used to belittle Biden’s careful approach to campaigning, which, in fact, is tailored to ensure the safety of the nominee, surrogates and supporters.“Now they say I’m immune. I just feel so powerful,” Trump went on to say, pushing a claim that is not grounded in science. There is no evidence to support an infected person develops any kind of immunity to being reinfected. “I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and the... I’ll just give you a big, fat kiss.”A report in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal published on Tuesday said a man in Reno, Nevada was infected twice — first in April, when he had mild symptoms, and then again in May, this time it was more severe.Biden continued to attack Trump for his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic, in two speeches in Toledo and Cincinnati in Ohio, portraying him as a president who was not upfront with the American about the gravity of the epidemic and “is only worried about the stock market, because he refuses to follow science”.He added: “His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, is unconscionable.”The two candidates hit another bunch of battleground states on Tuesday. Biden will be in Florida and Trump in Pennsylvania, a state being deemed as a “tipping point” in the 2020 race for the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-insists-he-s-immune-to-covid-as-he-resumes-campaign/story-bHDH7QIPyGTeiKhjEXSoWL.html
13-10-2020||World||White House moves forward on three arms sales to Taiwan: Report||The White House is moving forward with three sales of advanced weaponry to Taiwan, sending in recent days a notification of the deals to Congress for approval, five sources said on Monday, while China threatened retaliation.The move in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. election, first reported by Reuters, is likely to anger China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province that it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Reuters broke the news in September that as many as seven major weapons systems were making their way through the U.S. export process as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China.Leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees were notified that three of the planned weapons sales had been approved by the U.S. State Department which oversees foreign military sales, said the sources, who are familiar with the situation but declined to be identified.The informal notifications were for a truck-based rocket launcher made by Lockheed Martin Corp called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), long-range air-to-ground missiles made by Boeing Co called SLAM-ER, and external sensor pods for F-16 jets that allow the real-time transmission of imagery and data from the aircraft back to ground stations.Notifications for the sale of other weapons systems, including large, sophisticated aerial drones, land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles and underwater mines, to deter amphibious landings, have yet to reach Capitol Hill, but these were expected soon, the sources said.A State Department spokesman said: “As a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan severely damaged China’s sovereignty and security interests, urging Washington to clearly recognize the harm they caused and immediately cancel them. “China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,” Zhao told reporters in Beijing, without elaborating.CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR TAIWANThe U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees have the right to review, and block, weapons sales under an informal review process before the State Department sends its formal notification to the legislative branch.Lawmakers, who are generally wary of what they perceive as Chinese aggression and supportive of Taiwan, were not expected to object to the Taiwan sales. Taiwan’s defense ministry said it would comment only when there was formal notification of any arms sale. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the government had not yet been formally notified.“China continues to use military provocation to undermine cross-strait and regional stability, highlighting the importance of Taiwan’s strengthening of self-defense capabilities,” Ou said.News that new arms sales were moving forward came after senior U.S. officials last week repeated calls for Taiwan to spend more on its own defense and to carry out military reforms to make clear to China the risks of attempting to invade.It comes at a time when China has significantly stepped up military activity near Taiwan and as U.S.-China relations have plunged to the lowest point in decades as the U.S. election nears. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have both sought to appear tough in their approach to Beijing.Speaking on Wednesday, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, warned against any attempt to retake Taiwan by force, saying amphibious landings were notoriously difficult and there was a lot of ambiguity about how the United States would respond. The United States is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but it has not made clear whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack, something that would likely lead to a much broader conflict with Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-moves-forward-on-three-arms-sales-to-taiwan-report/story-XVg7FivksJ4qPhXX087a3J.html

China will see its economy expand by 1.9 percent.Even amid the improved news, countries like India, Spain and Italy will see double digit declines, while Britain just misses that threshold with a 9.8 percent contraction, the IMF said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-gdp-to-drop-4-4-in-2020-rise-5-2-2021-imf/story-d8GFzBCLbKTy5YEPDVqUCN.html
13-10-2020||World||UK seeks non-white volunteers for Covid-19 vaccine trials||The Boris Johnson government on Tuesday reiterated its call to people of Indian, Asian, Afro-Caribbean and other racial origins to volunteer for ongoing vaccine trials, including those by the University of Oxford–AstraZeneca.The non-white community has been disproportionately affected by coronavirus pandemic, prompting the government to launch an inquiry. Currently the community is under-represented in six vaccine clinical trials taking place across the UK. Officials said that of the 270,000 people who had signed up to the NHS Vaccine Registry (launched in July), only 11,000 volunteers are from Asian and British Asian backgrounds, and just 1,200 are Black, African, Caribbean or Black British. Thousands of people from different ages and backgrounds are urgently needed to help speed up their development and ensure they work effectively for the whole population, the officials added.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: “Coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of their background, age or race. To ensure we can find a safe and effective vaccine that works for everyone, we all need to get involved”.“That’s why we are urging more people to support our incredible scientists and join the 270,000 people who have already signed-up so we can speed up efforts to find a vaccine to defeat this virus once and for all.” he added.Maheshi Ramasamy, consultant in Infectious Diseases and Acute General Medicine and principal investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group, added: “We know that people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are disproportionately affected by Covid in terms of severe disease and mortality.”“So when we do have a vaccine that we roll out to the general population, it’s really important that we can demonstrate to people from these communities that we have evidence that the vaccine works.”The UK government set up a Vaccine Taskforce in May to ensure speedy access to clinically effective and safe vaccines, while working with partners to support international access.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-non-white-volunteers-for-covid-19-vaccine-trials/story-LFMUYkECUYGYQrrWmMW8fP.html
13-10-2020||World||India building border infra, deploying military root cause of tension: China||India’s decision to develop infrastructure and deployment of troops along the border with China are the root causes of tension, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday, adding that Beijing is against New Delhi building military facilities close to the disputed boundary. “For some time, the Indian side has been ramping up infrastructure development along the border and stepping up military deployment that is the root cause for the tensions between the two sides,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.“We urge the Indian side to earnestly implement our consensus and refrain from actions that might escalate the situation and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border,” Zhao said at the regular ministry press conference. Also read:  Pushback to Xi Jinping to reflect in US approach to ‘One China’ policy | AnalysisZhao was responding to a question on India building all-weather bridges in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh that would give access to the disputed boundary. India’s strengthening of its infrastructure in border areas along the line of actual control (LAC) comes amid the worst border tension with China in decades in eastern Ladakh, where border troops from the two countries have been locked in a faceoff since May.Several rounds of diplomatic and military-level talks have failed to resolve the situation and disengage troops.Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated 44 bridges built by the army’s Border Roads Organisation (BRO), among the 102 bridges that it is building.An Indian official told the Hindustan Times in New Delhi that 30 of the 44 bridges commissioned are on the route to the LAC from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.Zhao reiterated Beijing’s views on both the Indian regions. “First, I want to make it clear that China does not recognise the Ladakh Union Territory illegally set up by the Indian side and Arunachal Pradesh,” Zhao said.“We stand against the development of infrastructure facilities aimed at military contention along the border area. Based on the two sides’ consensus, neither should take actions along the border that might escalate the situation that is to avoid undermining the two sides’ efforts to ease the situation,” Zhao added.While China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of “south Tibet”, it had reacted strongly after India divested the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir of the special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and decided in August 2019 to bifurcate it into Union territories – J&K and Ladakh. “China has always opposed India’s inclusion of Chinese territory in India’s administrative jurisdiction in the western part of the Sino-Indian border. This position is firm, consistent and has never changed,” the foreign ministry had said in a statement.China continues to hold a grudge over the change of Ladakh’s status despite the explanation given by India that the change would not impact the LAC.During his visit to Beijing last year, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that there was no implication of the change “for either the external boundaries of India or the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. India was not raising any additional territorial claims.”“The legislative measures were aimed at promoting better governance and socio-economic development,” he had said, referring to J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-building-border-infra-deploying-military-root-cause-of-tension-china/story-HJlhvB3dUAsTYB8IdDO7cK.html
13-10-2020||World||Covid-19 reinfection casts doubt on virus immunity: Study||Covid-19 patients may experience more severe symptoms the second time they are infected, according to research released Tuesday confirming it is possible to catch the potentially deadly disease more than once.A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal charts the first confirmed case of Covid-19 reinfection in the United States -- the country worst hit by the pandemic -- and indicates that exposure to the virus may not guarantee future immunity.The patient, a 25-year-old Nevada man, was infected with two distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, within a 48-day time frame. The second infection was more severe than the first, resulting in the patient being hospitalised with oxygen support.The paper noted four other cases of reinfection confirmed globally, with one patient each in Belgium, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Ecuador. Experts said the prospect of reinfection could have a profound impact on how the world battles through the pandemic.In particular, it could influence the hunt for a vaccine -- the currently Holy Grail of pharmaceutical research. “The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity, especially in the absence of an effective vaccine,” said Mark Pandori, for the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory and lead study author. “We need more research to understand how long immunity may last for people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and why some of these second infections, while rare, are presenting as more severe.”- Waning immunity? -Vaccines work by triggering the body’s natural immune response to a certain pathogen, arming it with antibodies it to fight off future waves of infection.But it is not at all clear how long Covid-19 antibodies last. For some diseases, such as measles, infection confers lifelong immunity. For other pathogens, immunity may be fleeting at best. The authors said the US patient could have been exposed to a very high dose of the virus the second time around, triggering a more acute reaction. Alternatively, it may have been a more virulent strain of the virus. Another hypothesis is a mechanism known as antibody dependent enhancement -- that is, when antibodies actually make subsequent infections worse, such as with dengue fever.The researchers pointed out that reinfection of any kind remains rare, with only a handful of confirmed cases out of tens of millions of Covid-19 infections globally.However, since many cases are asymptomatic and therefore unlikely to have tested positive initially, it may be impossible to know if a given Covid-19 case is the first or second infection.In a linked comment to The Lancet paper, Akiko Iwasaka, a professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University, said the findings could impact public health measures.“As more cases of reinfection surface, the scientific community will have the opportunity to understand better the correlates of protection and how frequently natural infections with SARS-CoV-2 induce that level of immunity,” she said.“This information is key to understanding which vaccines are capable of crossing that threshold to confer individual and herd immunity,” added Iwasaka, who was not involved in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-reinfection-casts-doubt-on-virus-immunity-study/story-7VZkl8v7cUQ9BFp8ESr3HL.html
13-10-2020||World||Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating ceasefire||Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Tuesday of violating a humanitarian ceasefire agreed three days ago to quell fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh that has claimed hundreds of lives in the past two weeks. Ethnic Armenian officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said their total military death toll was 542, up 17 from Monday when reports of fresh fighting drew appeals from Russia and European Union members to respect the truce.Azerbaijan said 42 Azeri civilians had been killed and 206 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed military casualties.Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but governed and populated by ethnic Armenians.Saturday’s Russian-brokered ceasefire was aimed at allowing ethnic Armenian forces and Azerbaijan to swap prisoners and bodies of those killed in the deadliest fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh in more than 25 years.On Tuesday, the truce appeared to buckle further as Azerbaijan’s defence ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy, Terter and Aghdam, “grossly violating the humanitarian truce”.A Reuters television crew in Terter said the city centre was being shelled.“Azeri armed forces are not violating the humanitarian ceasefire,” defence ministry spokesman Vagif Dargiahly said.Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan denied the accusation. He said the Azeri side had resumed operations after an overnight lull, “supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions”.Reuters could not independently verify those report of artillery fire.The conflict is being watched abroad because it is close to Azeri gas and oil pipelines to Europe, and Turkey and Russia risk being dragged in. Russia has a defence pact with Armenia, while Turkey is allied with Azerbaijan. Turkey is not yet involved in the mediation which has for years been led by France, Russia and the United States. Ankara backs Azerbaijan’s offensive to “retake its occupied lands”.

13-10-2020||World||How long can I expect a Covid-19 illness to last?||How long can I expect a Covid-19 illness to last? It depends. Most coronavirus patients have mild to moderate illness and recover quickly. Older, sicker patients tend to take longer to recover. That includes those who are obese, or have high blood pressure and other chronic diseases.The World Health Organisation says recovery typically takes two to six weeks. One US study found that around 20 per cent of non-hospitalised individuals ages 18 to 34 still had symptoms at least two weeks after becoming ill. The same was true for nearly half of people age 50 and older.Among those sick enough to be hospitalized, a study in Italy found 87 per cent were still experiencing symptoms two months after getting sick. Lingering symptoms included fatigue and shortness of breath.Dr Khalilah Gates, a Chicago lung specialist, said many of her hospitalized Covid-19 patients still have coughing episodes, breathing difficulties and fatigue three to four months after infection.She said it’s hard to predict exactly when Covid-19 patients will return to feeling well.“The unsettling part of all this is we don’t have all the answers,” said Gates, an assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.It’s also hard to predict which patients will develop complications after their initial illness subsides.Covid-19 can affect nearly every organ, and long-term complications can include heart inflammation, decreased kidney function, fuzzy thinking, anxiety and depression.It is unclear whether the virus itself or the inflammation it can cause leads to these lingering problems, said Dr Jay Varkey, an Emory University infectious diseases specialist.“Once you get over the acute illness, it’s not necessarily over,” he said.

13-10-2020||World||Italy targets bars, restaurants, parties in new virus curbs||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a series of new curbs on nightlife, social events and amateur sports as the coronavirus pandemic intensifies throughout the country, albeit at a slower pace than in other major European nations.Conte signed a decree that focuses especially on bars and restaurants, as the government seeks to avert a new national lockdown that the economy, ravaged by one of the strictest and longest in the continent earlier this year, could ill afford.The measures include closing bars and restaurants by midnight and banning people from gathering outside them from 9 p.m., according to the decree seen by Bloomberg News. Bars with no table service must also close by 9 p.m.The curbs come amid concern that groups of young revelers are responsible for spreading contagion, as the average age of the infected has dropped. The initial European epicenter of the pandemic, Italy has seen new virus cases spike in recent weeks as the administration seeks to restart an economy that the government forecasts will contract by 9% this year.New infections numbered 4,619 on Monday, compared with 5,456 the day before, as daily tests dropped over the weekend. Pressure on hospitals is growing but patients in intensive care units are still about a tenth of the peak of more than 4,000 in early April.Receptions for events such as weddings and baptisms will be limited to a maximum of 30 people. Despite pressure by Health Minister Roberto Speranza, who told Rai television Sunday that 75% of infections occur between family members and friends, the decree stopped short of banning private parties. Instead it recommends a maximum of six people from different households taking part.At the urging of government medical advisers, amateur sports including five-a-side soccer and basketball are banned. The decree recommends businesses resort more to remote working.People who test positive for the virus will see their quarantine time cut to 10 days from 14. One negative test result after that period -- as opposed to the current two or three for symptomatic patients -- will suffice to allow a patient to exit quarantine. Earlier this month, the government again made wearing face masks outdoors compulsory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-targets-bars-restaurants-parties-in-new-virus-curbs/story-B6K2sNwcTDYmrSO56zyk0N.html

13-10-2020||World||Amazon workers in Germany strike on Prime Day||A German trade union called on workers at seven Amazon warehouses to go on strike on Tuesday to coincide with the global “Prime Day” promotion event that was postponed due to operational challenges from the coronavirus pandemic.Verdi said it was organising the two-day strike as part of a long-running battle with Amazon in Germany over better pay and conditions, noting that a coronavirus bonus introduced for workers in Germany in March had been scrapped again in May.An Amazon spokesman said the majority of employees were continuing to work as normal despite the strike call. He said the company offered “excellent salaries”, with benefits and working conditions comparable with other important employers.Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany since 2013, most recently in June in protest over safety after some staff at logistics centres tested positive for the coronavirus.Germany is Amazon’s biggest market after the United States.Prime Day, typically held in July to boost summer sales, is now a kickoff to what will be an earlier holiday shopping season. The member-only discounts are a key way Amazon markets Prime, a fast-shipping and media-streaming service that incentivises subscribers to do more shopping on Amazon.A report by news site Reveal said the week around last year’s Prime Day was the most dangerous for injuries at Amazon’s fulfillment centers, prompting criticism by a prominent union.

13-10-2020||World||Pushback to Xi Jinping to reflect in US approach to ‘One China’ policy | Analysis||Two of the biggest takeaways from the October 6, Quad security dialogue were that US confrontation with China over Taiwan has the potential of serious escalation and that Washington blames Beijing for not only the global pandemic but also for the economic hit on the American economy on the eve of Presidential elections.While India is legitimately worried about the on-going military stand-off with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in East Ladakh, the three other Quad powers were far more concerned about China’s bellicose moves on Taiwan. With US Navy super carriers and destroyers patrolling the South China Sea, there is serious military friction over Beijing’s bullying of Taiwan.Indo-US interlocution and diplomatic feedback from the Indo-Pacific indicates that Beijing’s “One China” mantra may come under question if US President Donald Trump returns to power, although the Biden campaign has signaled that it too will take the hard line on China. The legislation introduced in Capitol Hill over Tibet and Xinjiang, and the military moves over Taiwan and South China Sea are clear indicators that the “One China” policy could be called out by Washington — although some experts believe that the Trump administration is also applying the squeeze on China in the hope that a potential international incident could help the incumbent President in an election where he is trailing his opponent.Also Read: China has itself to blame for strong QUAD | AnalysisWhile China wants the world to recognise “One China” policy as a matter of its right, it evidently has no respect for sovereignty of others including India, Japan (Senkaku Islands) and Russia (Vladivostok). China does not recognise Ladakh but wants India to recognise its occupation of Tibet, Xinjiang and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) construction in Occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. And of course, it can always be sanctimonious over Jammu and Kashmir, more so when politically desperate Valley politicians are apparently asking Beijing to intercede on their behalf.ALSO WATCH | Cornering China: India, USA, Japan, Australia hold Quad meet amid LAC tension China watchers in New Delhi believe that the PLA aggression in Ladakh is directly linked to the security of the CPEC in PoK and Northern Areas. The PLA has made out a case that the new Ladakh map published after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019 indicates that India will put pressure on CPEC in Gilgit-Baltistan. This is also the reason that Beijing convinced Pakistan to declare Gilgit-Baltistan as the fifth province — even though this compromised Rawalpindi’s decades-old Kashmir agenda.At a subterranean level, Beijing has involved both Nepal and Pakistan for abrogating the Buddhist cultural plank from India by highlighting the place of birth of Prince Siddharth (in Nepal) and the prominent Gandhara school that flourished (in Pakistan) before Islam swept through the Af-Pak region. So what if Siddharth became Gautama Buddha in Bodh Gaya in the heart of Bihar.The world of Buddhism will be further complicated by China in the coming years over the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama. While the exiled leader continues to be popular with a Buddhist temple dedicated to him being built in Tuva in Russian Siberia, Bejing’s Sinicization of Tibet will put very serious pressure on the very institution of Dalai Lama itself in coming years.However, Beijing is least bothered about global statements. Its expansion plans have picked up steam after a weak global response to Beijing’s introduction of security laws in Hong Kong and the near-absolute silence of ASEAN countries over events in Taiwan and the South China Sea due to the massive economic clout of the middle kingdom. Beijing has refused to be part of any arms control negotiations despite rapidly growing nuclear arsenal and delivery platforms. The PLA’s cyber offensive capabilities now match the best in the world but it has no intentions of joining the proposed US-Russia cyber talks.The time has come to call out China for the global bully it is before it becomes the hegemon it wants to be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-could-amp-up-pressure-on-beijing-bring-one-china-policy-under-a-strain-analysis/story-pwRBQVnxPAFkzmc4fWiXyO.html
13-10-2020||World||Covid-19 infections near 38 million-mark: Latest updates from across the world||Over 37.7 million people across the world have been infected with coronavirus disease, with the United States being on top of the list followed by India and Brazil.According to Worldometer, the US has over eight million cases of Covid-19 and 2,20,011 deaths as on October 13. India has 7.17 million infections and nearly 110,000 deaths, according to Union health ministry, and Brazil has over five million Covid-19 cases and 1,50,709 deaths.Even as most countries are easing lockdown restrictions and reopening their economies, the virus is far from being defeated and its vaccine still not out. However, World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that a Covid-19 vaccine will be ready for registration by the end of 2020 at the earliest.Here are the latest Covid-19 updates from across the world:• The British government on Monday unveiled a three-tier plan to tackle the spread of the disease. The country was divided into three tiers of Covid-19 risk by the government with the objective to “simplify and standardise” a confusing patchwork of local rules. “The goal of the new system was to save lives without ‘shuttering our lives and our society’ through a new national lockdown,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.• Britain can very soon begin carrying out studies that would intentionally infect healthy people with Covid-19 to help researchers in coming up with a vaccine. Thousands of volunteers from across the country have shown willingness to be a part of the study. “I think the potential successes of the trials outweigh that small risk to myself,” Greer, a 20-year-old student who wishes to volunteer, said.• Meanwhile, the WHO has warned against the idea that herd immunity might be a realistic strategy to stop the pandemic, dismissing such proposals as “simply unethical,” according to news agency Associated Press.• Adding to the list of advanced stage trials of Covid-19 vaccines halted, Johnson & Johnson paused its study on Monday, citing an “unexplained illness” of a participant. The company’s physicians and a safety monitoring panel would try to determine the reason behind the illness, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. Trials of AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s vaccine candidate were also halted last month. They have resumed in almost all countries now.• According to billionaire Bill Gates, life will become normal only after the second generation of Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. Normalcy can return “when we have, not the first generation of vaccines, but one that is super-effective,” he told NBC.• Union health minister of India Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said that India is likely to have a vaccine against the coronavirus disease by early next year. “We’re expecting that early next year we should have vaccine in the country from maybe more than one source. Our expert groups are formulating strategies to plan on how to roll out the distribution of the vaccine in the country,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.• WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan also said that a vaccine against the disease will be ready for registration by the end of 2020 or early next year at the earliest.• About 40 vaccine candidates are now in some stage of clinical trials, and 10 of them are in late-stage phase three trials, which will tell us about both the efficacy and the safety, Swaminathan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infections-near-38-million-mark-latest-updates-from-across-the-world/story-n5RFoyywJsNe3LNt8HKUMJ.html
13-10-2020||World||Europe recording more daily Covid-19 cases than India, shows data||Europe is witnessing a resurgence in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The continent was able to control the spread of the disease, but is now reporting more daily cases than the United States, Brazil or India.After falling during the summer, coronavirus cases are rising in the United Kingdom as winter approaches, with northwest and northeast England seeing the steepest increases. Liverpool has one of the country’s most severe outbreaks, with about 600 cases per 1,00,000 people, even more than the hard-hit European cities of Madrid and Brussels.The British government has carved England into three tiers of coronavirus risk in a bid to slow a resurgent outbreak, putting the northern city of Liverpool into the highest-risk category and shutting its pubs, gyms and betting shops.Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a three-tier lockdown plan, which he said designed to “simplify and standardise” a confusing patchwork of local rules. Johnson said hospitals are now filling up with more Covid-19 patients than in March, when he ordered a national lockdown.The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,875. In other countries like Czech Republic, government has put new measures in place to curb the fast spread of Covid-19 cases. Bars, restaurants and clubs have been ordered to close from Wednesday and schools shifted to distance learning.The Czech Republic is experiencing the strongest surge in Europe when adjusted for population as the number of infections detected since the outbreak began has soared to nearly 1,20,000, from around 25,000 at the beginning of September.Hospitals in the country are starting to feel that strain as the number of patients have doubled since the start of October to over 2,000.The surge in new virus cases continued in the Netherlands, with a record 6,854 cases, confirmed in the 24 hours until Monday morning, news agency ANP reported, citing the country’s health agency. More than 41,000 cases were reported in the past seven days. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to announce stricter measures on Tuesday.In France, the number of people being treated in intensive care units for Covid-19 exceeded 1,500 on Monday for the first time since May 27, authorities said, raising fears of local lockdowns being imposed across the country.Till October 12, Europe has recorded more than 6.4 million cases of the coronavirus disease. The same day, it recorded 87,100 new Covid-19 cases, according to World Health Organisation (WHO). Last Thursday, Europe had surpassed 1,00,000 daily reported Covid-19 cases for the first time.India, meanwhile, continues to witness a decline in the number of daily cases of the coronavirus disease. On Tuesday, the country recorded 55,342 new infections, the lowest in nearly two months, according to figures released by the ministry of health and family welfare. On Monday (October 12), India’ daily caseload was 66,732.In the morning, the ministry had said that India’s average daily Covid-19 cases have been declining for the past five weeks.The United States recorded 53,055 cases of the coronavirus disease on October 12, according to WHO, while Brazil’s daily caseload stood at 26,749.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-recording-more-daily-covid-19-cases-than-india-shows-data/story-B4USMs3nrRV3yATY3vf1qK.html
13-10-2020||World||UK moves closer to infect healthy people with Covid-19 to aid vaccine efforts||Alex Greer says he’d rather put himself directly in the path of the coronavirus than get blindsided by the disease after an evening at the pub or with friends. It’s a scenario that could soon become a reality.Britain is moving closer to carrying out studies that would intentionally infect healthy people with the virus to help researchers in their quest for Covid-19 vaccines, and thousands of volunteers like Greer, a chemistry student at Durham University in northeast England, are ready to go. Open Orphan Plc, parent of human challenge trial specialist hVivo, has said it’s in talks with potential customers including the UK to conduct tests of Covid shots.Such studies may help speed development of vaccines and give scientists new insights into a disease that has spread to more than 37 million people globally, but would expose participants to a threat for which there’s no cure. Numerous questions about the virus -- which volunteers would likely have sprayed into their noses -- remain unanswered. Even young people could face dangers.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “I can’t lie and say it doesn’t cross my mind,” said Greer, 20. “The long-term consequences of Covid aren’t fully researched yet and that does need to be taken into account. But I think the potential successes of the trials outweigh that small risk to myself.”Despite recent strides in treating Covid-19, experts disagree on whether challenge trials are justifiable. One uncertainty is why some young and otherwise healthy people end up with complications months after experiencing mild symptoms, according to Seema Shah, a bioethicist at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and Northwestern University.Crossing a Line“This would really cross a line that people have drawn in terms of when it’s ethically acceptable to do challenge studies,” she said. “In the past, it’s been about diseases that we know a lot more about. We’re still learning so much about Covid-19.”Companies such as AstraZeneca Plc -- the University of Oxford’s partner in an experimental coronavirus vaccine -- suggested earlier this year that declining infection rates could make it harder to do conventional tests that wait for people to catch the virus naturally in the wider community. Yet Covid continues spreading, allowing a number of projects to sprint into the final stage of clinical trials.Front-runners Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca say they have no plans to do challenge studies. Other vaccine makers like Johnson & Johnson are eyeing them cautiously. The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, partner of biotech company Moderna Inc., has started manufacturing a strain of the virus that could be used for challenge studies and is investigating technical and ethical considerations.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We will only go in this direction if the ethical, the medical and the safety parameters are clear,” said Thomas Lingelbach, chief executive officer of Valneva SE, a French company working on another experimental Covid shot.Comparing EfficacyThe idea is gaining momentum. 1DaySooner, a group that advocates on behalf of people who want to join challenge studies, says it has attracted more than 38,000 volunteers. UK studies would likely be the first such tests in the world for Covid-19.“I’m sure it will happen,” said Robin Shattock, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London. “The difficulty is to know what it actually will achieve and whether it will make anything quicker.”Various forms of human challenge studies have been used for centuries, but proper practices and guidance for ethics and safety were only adopted about 50 years ago. The approach was key to vaccine development for diseases such as cholera, malaria and typhoid.No deaths have been recorded from challenge trials in recent decades, research shows, and studies have been performed safely in tens of thousands of consenting volunteers. Unlike Covid-19, however, many of the diseases targeted by these trials had well established treatments.Challenge studies could play an important role as scientists look to build on the first generation of Covid inoculations, according to Northwestern’s Shah. They might offer a way to compare efficacy, allowing the best prospects to advance in larger studies, and tackle questions such as the persistence of vaccine-induced immunity.National SupportUK support, along with therapies like Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir for patients who get sick, would provide a boost for the campaign. Eli Lilly & Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. last week asked U.S. regulators for emergency-use authorizations for their antibody treatments, and many other companies are advancing with potential weapons as well.“If the UK can be involved in human challenge trials, we’ll be leading in this area of science,” said Jennifer Wright, a 29-year-old volunteer who’s pursuing her PhD in physics at the University of Glasgow. “It should be the countries with the most money who lead these kinds of efforts, because we are the ones who presumably won’t suffer as much.”The issue is heating up as the virus advances and governments push for a way out of worsening economic damage to travel, tourism, retail and many other industries. The risks would be minimized as much as possible by selecting younger people who don’t have underlying health conditions, and keeping volunteers under constant observation, according to proponents.“There’s pretty clear evidence across the world it’s young people who are least susceptible to severe disease,” said Adrian Hill, director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute. “Everyone would agree that it would be nice to have something more than remdesivir, but it’s not even clear if you would need remdesivir.”Such studies in the U.S. wouldn’t replace large final-stage trials, according to the NIAID. Data from ongoing conventional trials will be available toward the end of 2020 and will be used to assess future challenge studies “should they be needed and deemed safe and ethical to employ,” the agency said in an email.Any UK plan would still need to overcome hurdles including approval from regulators and an independent ethics committee.“Given the state we are in with respect to the epidemic and the urgent need for multiple efficacious vaccines, I think there remains a very compelling case for proceeding,” said Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.The main question is whether the studies would clearly “make a big difference,” said Northwestern’s Shah. “I just don’t know yet whether there’s a solid rationale for moving forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-moves-closer-to-infect-healthy-people-with-covid-19-to-aid-vaccine-efforts/story-nfWQNs4GGcRtAN8EzjPtEM.html
13-10-2020||World||Malaysia’s Anwar meets king in bid to form new government||Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim met the nation’s king on Tuesday in a bid to form a new government after claiming he had secured a majority in Parliament.Anwar said he would present the monarch with “strong and convincing” documentary evidence of the support he has from lawmakers, which would allow him to unseat Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.But he did not speak to reporters gathered at the gate after spending about an hour at the palace, and instead his party said he will hold a hold a news conference “regarding an important announcement post-audience with His Majesty.”Muhyiddin, who took power in March after securing enough support in Parliament to unseat Anwar’s reformist alliance, has dismissed Anwar’s claim to a majority. Muhyiddin currently boasts a slim two-seat majority and has been grappling to maintain support amid infighting in his coalition.Allies in Muhyiddin’s ruling coalition have denied supporting Anwar, and branded Anwar a “desperado” for seeking to wrest power as the country struggles with the coronavirus.The audience with the king was slated three weeks ago, but postponed as the king was hospitalized. Anwar has been tight-lipped and said he would only reveal details after meeting the king.“I frankly do not think it will be a smooth and easy ride for Anwar. For one, even if the king is convinced of Anwar’s command of parliamentary majority, the king still has the alternative constitutional option of dissolving the parliament,” said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.Oh, a Malaysian, said support for Anwar could also have waned as Muhyiddin’s camp may have lured back defectors in the past three weeks.Before leaving home Tuesday morning, Anwar tweeted a picture of himself and his wife. “Hopefully it will be a smooth affair today,” he wrote.Anwar’s Alliance of Hope was elected in 2018 but collapsed after Muhyiddin withdrew his party and tied up with opposition parties to form a Malay-centric government in March. Then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned in protest, saying he wouldn’t work with parties accused of corruption that he ousted in the 2018 polls.If Anwar succeeds, it will mark a dramatic comeback after his roller-coaster political journey since the 1990s.Once a high flyer in the ruling party, Anwar was convicted of homosexual sodomy and corruption after a power struggle with Mahathir in 1998. He was imprisoned for a second time for sodomy in 2014.Anwar and his supporters have long denied the sodomy allegations, saying they were concocted to destroy his political career.Rather than give up, Anwar ended his feud with Mahathir from his prison cell to forge a the Alliance of Hope, which in the 2018 polls defeated the coalition that had led Malaysia for 61 years.Mahathir became premier a second time. Anwar was freed with a royal pardon days after the polls and was Mahathir’s designated successor before their alliance fell apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-s-anwar-meets-king-in-bid-to-form-new-government/story-xlDwJV0uos5xTgOVpy5m9M.html
13-10-2020||World||Pfizer modifies protocol for virus vaccine study to include more young participants||Drugmaker Pfizer has again modified the protocol for its late-stage study of its vaccine against the new coronavirus, this time to include more young participants.The company said on Monday that it’s received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to include adolescents aged 12 through 15 in its global Covid-19 vaccine study.New York-based Pfizer originally planned for 30,000 participants, but in September expanded that to 44,000 people. That increase was made to boost diversity in the trial population, specifically by including 16- and 17-year-old teens, as well as stable patients with some common chronic infections: hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.Pfizer’s trial also includes significant numbers of Hispanic, Black, Asian and Native American participants, plus many people aged 56 through 85. The diversity is aimed at providing information on how safe and effective the experimental vaccine is in people of different ages and backgrounds.

13-10-2020||World||Alvin Cole killing: No reason to fire officer who fired fatal shot, says police chief||The police chief of a Milwaukee suburb that has seen protests and unrest since an officer was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a Black teenager in February said Monday that he sees no reason why the officer should be fired.Joseph Mensah, who is also Black, fatally shot 17-year-old Alvin Cole on Feb. 2 outside the Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa. Cole was the third person Mensah shot and killed since joining the police force five years ago.Milwaukee County’s district attorney announced last week that like the first two fatal shootings, Mensah would not be charged in Cole’s death. In his report, he noted that officers said Cole pointed a gun at them and refused to drop it, and that Mensah could successfully argue he fired in self-defense.Although Mensah won’t face charges, the Wauwatosa Police and Fire Commission is considering firing him. The commission asked an independent investigator, former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic, to look into a complaint filed by the family of one of the men Mensah killed.In a report provided to The Associated Press by Cole’s family’s attorney, Biskupic recommended that Mensah be fired because he felt the risk was too great that Mensah would fatally shoot someone else, which would create “an extraordinary, unwarranted and unnecessary risk” to the city and police department.After five nights of protests and sporadic unrest, police Chief Barry Weber said during an online news conference Monday that he disagrees with Biskupic’s recommendations because Mensah was found to have acted legally when he used deadly force in all three shooting deaths.“I’ve never heard of any police officer ever being disciplined for something they may or may not do in the future,” Weber said, noting that the decision is ultimately up to the commission to decide.“Joseph Mensah’s been cleared by the district attorney in three different cases. There’s been no reason to this point, and none that I can see, (for why) he should be removed from the force,” the chief said.Kimberley Motley, the Cole family’s attorney, rejected Weber’s position, again calling Mensah “unfit” and renewing her call that he and the chief be fired.“I think that position of the chief is another reason why he needs to be terminated as well,” Motley said, adding: “Joseph Mensah is not credible and neither is Chief Weber.”Mayor Dennis McBride, who also spoke at the news conference, openly questioned in the past whether Mensah should remain on the force. But on Monday, he declined to say where he now stands, explaining that he didn’t want to put additional pressure on the police and fire commissioners.“I’m not a police officer, I’m not a psychologist. I’m a mayor, I’m a lawyer. Those things don’t qualify me to judge (the) fitness of police officers,” McBride said.Mensah’s attorney, Jonathan Cermele, did not immediately return a call for comment.The decision to not charge Mensah in Cole’s death sparked five nights of protests in Wauwatosa, including a gathering Sunday that was much more peaceful than protests last week in which demonstrators clashed with police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them.Cole was the third person Mensah has killed on the job since he joined the force in 2015. He shot Antonio Gonzales in 2015 after police said Gonzales refused to drop a sword. A year later, Mensah shot Jay Anderson Jr. in a car parked in a park after hours. Mensah said he saw a gun on the passenger seat and thought Anderson was reaching for it. He was cleared of wrongdoing in each case.The protests in Wauwatosa are just the latest in a series of demonstrations against police racism and brutality that have erupted across the country since George Floyd’s death. Floyd, who was Black, died in May after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes despite Floyd’s pleas for air.___Associated Press writer Doug Glass contributed from Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alvin-cole-killing-no-reason-to-fire-officer-who-fired-fatal-shot-says-police-chief/story-ZMZqV2MG3qMeD9ugTV13CK.html

Gretchen Whitmer will appear in federal court Tuesday for a hearing on whether they should be detained before trial.U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Berens will oversee the bail and detention proceeding in Grand Rapids for Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta — all Michigan residents. A sixth man, Barry Croft, was being held in Delaware.The FBI made arrests last week after using confidential sources, undercover agents and clandestine recordings to foil the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Some defendants had conducted coordinated surveillance of the Democratic governor’s vacation home in northern Michigan in August and September, according to a criminal complaint.The men were trying to retaliate against Whitmer due to her “uncontrolled power” amid the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said. They said four of the men had planned to meet last week to pay for explosives and exchange tactical gear.Whitmer, who was considered as Joe Biden’s running mate and is nearly halfway through a four-year term, has been widely praised for her response to the virus outbreak but also sharply criticized by Republican lawmakers and people in conservative areas of the state. The Capitol has been the site of many rallies, including ones with gun-toting protesters calling for her ouster.Whitmer put major restrictions on personal movement and the economy, although many of those limits have been lifted since spring.Fox, who was described as one of the leaders, was living in the basement of a vacuum shop in Grand Rapids. The owner said Fox was opposed to wearing a mask during the pandemic and kept firearms and ammunition at the store.The defendants face up to life in prison if convicted.Seven others linked to a paramilitary group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged in state court for allegedly seeking to storm the Michigan Capitol and providing material support for terrorist acts by seeking a “civil war.”The investigation is ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-5-accused-to-face-hearings/story-ZojS2GdgQnlwg1CCCdxtiL.html

The participant’s “unexplained illness” is being investigated by the company and a statement was issued in this regard on Monday.Accidents and other so-called adverse events “are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies,” the company said in the statement, adding that its physicians and a safety monitoring panel would try to determine the reason behind the illness, reported news agency Associated Press.While few stoppages of this nature are made public in typical drug trials, Covid-19 vaccine trials have very high stakes as worldwide infection cases have crossed 37 million. Over 1 million people have lost their lives due to the virus.This is the second such instance in which trials for a late-stage study have been halted. AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s vaccine testing is on hold in the US as officials examine whether an illness in its trial poses a safety risk. In other places, however, trials have resumed.WATCH | Covid update: Trump says he’s immune; new inhaler vaccine; India new flights This trial was stopped when a woman developed severe neurological symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis, a rare inflammation of the spinal cord, the company said.Health news site STAT was the fist to report the pause of J&J’s vaccine candidate trial.

The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states where they are in lockdown,” he said at a rally in Sanford, Florida.Trump was referring to remarks by WHO envoy David Nabarro, who was quoted in recent media reports as saying that restrictive measures like the lockdowns should only be treated as a last resort. He also said that lockdowns have severely impacted countries that rely on tourism.US president said that China, which has 1.4 billion people is paying USD 39 million per year to WHO in contrast to the US that is paying about USD 500 million.“I took us out of the WHO because they were wrong about everything. Although, they corrected themselves--they say I was right about the lockdowns. (I asked) Why are we paying USD 500 million a year and China which has 1.4 billion people is paying USD 39 million per year -- they couldn’t explain so I took us out,” he said.Trump further attacked the World Health Organisation saying that they are being dominated by Beijing. “China dominates them and I said it doesn’t work that way anymore. They will take us back in so fast with less money,” he said.Trump had this July pulled out his country from the WHO after he criticised the body for covering up the outbreak of Covid-19, which first emerged in China last year. The US has also backed out of a joint global effort led by the WHO to develop, manufacture and distribute a vaccine to cure coronavirus.Meanwhile, earlier on Twitter, he urged New York and other Democrat governors to open up from the lockdown.“The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up, New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-china-dominated-who-says-was-right-on-not-imposing-covid-lockdowns/story-PPeX2yLpQQFLqmbbW9nfEL.html
13-10-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson shuts pubs in parts of England with new Covid-19 curbs||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a tiered system of further restrictions on parts of England on Monday, including shutting pubs, to curb an acceleration in Covid-19 cases, though anger was rising at the cost of the curtailment of freedoms.Johnson announced a new three-tiered system in an attempt to standardise a patchwork of often complicated and confusing restrictions imposed across England. Lawmakers will vote on the move on Tuesday.The lockdowns will include shutting pubs and bars and banning wedding receptions in areas placed in the “very high” alert level from Wednesday. The other alert levels in the new system are “medium” and “high”. So far, Merseyside in northwest England - which includes the city of Liverpool - is the only area classified at the “very high” level. Gyms, leisure centres, casinos, betting shops and adult gaming centres there will also close, Johnson said. Also Read: Covid: Britain’s hospitality industry sets legal challenge to lockdown curbs“We must act to save lives,” Johnson told parliament, adding that he did not want another national lockdown and that he understood the frustrations of those chafing at the “repressions of liberty”. “If we let the virus rip, then the bleak mathematics dictate that we would suffer not only an intolerable death toll from Covid, but we would put such a huge strain on our NHS (National Health Service) with an uncontrolled second spike that our doctors and nurses would simply be unable to devote themselves to other treatments.”“NARROW PATH”Health officials say the freshest data showed infections were rising across the north of England and in some more southerly areas too, while the virus was creeping up age bands towards the elderly from those aged 16-29 years.Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, said the standard restrictions that would apply to very high risk areas would not be enough to control the outbreak there, and urged local authorities to go further.“The base will not be sufficient ... but there are additional things that can be done within that guidance,” he said.Schools, restaurants and most workplaces will remain open even in the “very high” risk areas.Manchester intensive care consultant Jane Eddleston said 30% of critical care beds were taken up with Covid-19 patients and this was starting to affect healthcare for others. Also Read: UK unveils 3-level lockdown plan; Liverpool at highest risk“This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and massive human and indeed economic cost of an uncontained epidemic,” Johnson said.The three-tiered system applies only to England as devolved authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have responsibility for their own health arrangements.Britain’s large hospitality sector says it is being brought to its knees by the restrictions.Karen Strickland, landlady of The Grapes pub in Liverpool, said their income was already down by 70% with the current enforced countrywide closing time of 10 p.m., and the government’s support scheme help was not enough. “It’s absolutely horrendous,” she said.Under the new restrictions, pubs that serve meals will be allowed to stay open, though they will only be able to serve alcohol as part of such a meal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-shuts-pubs-in-parts-of-england-with-new-covid-19-curbs/story-jztUyvgiYjFbpCzExj9tDM.html

He also said that the second generation vaccine should also be widely available. “Only then all the problems created by Covid-19 can be solved,” he added.Gates’ comments come as the world is racing towards finding a vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which has affected millions across the globe.AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine is one of the most advanced candidates in the race against the novel coronavirus.The British drugmaker has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.Developed by the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, the vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate.Pfizer has, meanwhile, again modified the protocol for its late-stage study of its vaccine, this time to include more young participants.The company said on Monday that it’s received permission from the Food and Drug Administration in the United States to include adolescents aged 12 through 15 in its global Covid-19 vaccine study.New York-based Pfizer originally planned for 30,000 participants, but in September expanded that to 44,000 people. Pfizer’s trial also includes significant numbers of Hispanic, Black, Asian and Native American participants, plus many people aged 56 through 85.Last month, in an email interview to Hindustan Times, Gates had spoken about vaccine development and the protection it will provide. “It’s too soon to make predictions about how long protection might last. At this point, we don’t have enough data on the duration of antibody and T-cell response to the disease itself, let alone to the various vaccine candidates. Many of the vaccine trials underway should start to report efficacy data in the next few months, which will start to provide answers to these critical questions,” Gates had said.“The good news is that there is a large portfolio of vaccines in testing, each with a different approach. This gives the greatest possible chance to develop effective vaccines,” he had further said.Read the full interview hereOn October 6, he had said that rich countries could be back to close to normal by late 2021 if a Covid-19 vaccine works, is ready soon and distributed properly at scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/normalcy-only-when-second-generation-of-covid-19-vaccine-is-out-bill-gates/story-j96EWApnUeW827lfiEORZJ.html

The quilt that had been given to the museum for safekeeping was found a few blocks away and will be assessed for damage, Tymchuk said.“As we clean up broken glass, scrub paint, and make plans to ensure safety in our building, we also, as always, welcome critique of our work,” Tymchuk wrote. “We would be grateful to have constructive feedback from all those who are willing and able to aid OHS in fulfilling our vision of an Oregon story that is meaningful to all Oregonians.”Three people were arrested by police who said in a statement that multiple businesses were damaged, including a restaurant that had at least two bullets fired through its front windows.In New Mexico, protesters on Monday tore down a historical monument as part of demonstrations in the state and in neighboring Arizona meant to mark Indigenous Peoples Day. Protesters used a rope and chain to topple an obelisk in Santa Fe long a point of contention for its references to the “heroes” who died in battle with “savage Indians.”The monuments are the latest statues to come down in a wave of removed monuments and protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/columbus-day-protesters-knock-down-roosevelt-lincoln-statues-in-portland/story-1sKAe4PMlJ6I6cNp6RylIL.html

She further referred to Khan as a “handpicked” person, she said that he did not care about the people.“The handpicked one is only concerned with himself and always wants to silence his opponents,” she said. “The handpicked one does not concern himself with the masses.”She called the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) as the “need of the hour” adding that it had been established because as a result of pressure from the masses against the measures of those in power.Maryam further said that there was no division within the party and added that the party president Shahbaz Sharif “had a different approach” which has been the case for a while.“Shahbaz Sharif is like a father to me, I do not see him any different than my father... There is no rift within the PML-N, the entire party stands behind Nawaz Sharif,” she said.She added, “Shahbaz went to jail because he did not leave his brother alone... The Sharifs have always been on pone page and will continue to remain so. Those who have tried to cause a rift between the Sharif brothers have always tasted failure.”According to Geo News, the party vice president rejected allegations about her father, Nawaz Sharif. “Mian sahab’s narrative is exactly the same as Quaid-e-Azam’s narrative,” she said.“Asking the questions that Mian sahab has asked does not amount to treason.” With regard to returning to Pakistan, she added that he would return once doctors allow him.

13-10-2020||World||Need to revive spirit of bipartisanship in US: Joe Biden||There is an urgent need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in the US, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said as he blamed the policies of President Donald Trump for dividing Americans. Addressing a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is a battle ground State, Biden said America needed a leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communication and bring them back together. “We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country,” the former vice president said on Monday. Biden’s campaign is very restrictive due to the strict enforcement of social distancing measures because of coronavirus pandemic. “I know that sounds bizarre in light of where we are. A spirit of being able to work with one another. It’s time to unite America, and we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear, science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division. Democracy requires consensus. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president,” Biden,77, asserted. He said that more than 214,000 Americans had died so far due to Covid-19 because of the policies of Trump. “He told Bob Woodward he didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panicked. Trump is the one who panicked. Reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis as well has been unconscionable,” he said. “The longer Donald Trump is president the more reckless he gets. Dr Fauci, most respected person in this area in the country referred to the president’s announcement event for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden as a super spreader event. Publicly criticising it. How is the president responding? He’s running a national ad here in Cincinnati and all across the country quoting Dr. Fauci out of context,” he said. As a consequence of overwhelming lying, misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Trump, how many empty chairs are going to be around dinner table tonight because of their negligence? Biden asked. He, however, said that there was a silver lining. “Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity like America has done unlike any other country after every crisis, we’ve always come out of the crisis stronger than we were before we went in. That’s uniqueness of who we are. We now have an opportunity to build back and build back better. To give everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. Begin to reward work not just wealth,” Biden said. “For example, for communities of colour here in Cincinnati and all across the country the question is how do we break the cycle? Where in good times they lag in bad times they get hit first and hardest and in recovery they’re the last and toughest to bounce back - the answer is justice. Justice. Criminal justice, police reforms,” he said. Biden said the US was strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for “our families and small businesses” that too often bare the brunt of looting and burning, which are never justified. He said America needed a leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communication and bring them back together and to heal and to hope. “As president that’s precisely what I will do. That’s a president’s job. It just goes beyond the issue of police community relations. Goes about being able to compete and build wealth. “It’s about jobs. Good-paying jobs. Financial stability. Families of colour building wealth and being able to pass it down like my Irish Catholic folks were able to do in Scranton coming up from nothing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-to-revive-spirit-of-bipartisanship-in-us-joe-biden/story-1S8OIABkMkL7l3sYGVHtFK.html

13-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Donald Trump boasts at Florida campaign rally of feeling ‘so powerful’||President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail on Monday night, boasting at a rally in Florida that he felt “so powerful” after his recovery from Covid-19 that he wanted to walk into the audience and “kiss everyone.”“I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support,” Trump said at the outdoor rally at the Orlando Sanford International Airport, where there was little social distancing though some spectators wore masks. “Twenty-two days from now we’re going to win this state, we’re going to win four more years at the White House.”The crowd at one point broke into a chant of “we love you” as Trump renewed his attacks on his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.“Now they say I’m immune. I feel so powerful. I’ll walk into that audience. I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and the -- everybody,” Trump said.Hours earlier, his doctor said Trump had tested negative for Covid-19 on consecutive days. In a memo released by the White House, Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said the tests, along with guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, informed the conclusion that Trump “is not infectious to others.”Trump’s trip to Florida was part of an effort to reverse his slide in polls in the key swing state. Biden is leading Trump in Florida by 3.7 percentage points in a RealClearPolitics average of nine polls taken since late last month -- a reversal of fortune for the president in a state he narrowly won in 2016.The Florida event, along with three others planned this week, threaten to advance the spread of the coronavirus, Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, warned in an interview on CNN earlier Monday.The virus hit the Sunshine State especially hard and has contributed to the president’s declining popularity. His decision to resume large-scale rallies risks reinforcing perceptions that he’s been cavalier about a disease that has killed 215,000 Americans and sent the economy into recession.Trump sought to energize the crowd by highlighting the partisan battle over his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.“A lot of people said I was elected because of the Supreme Court,” Trump said Monday night. “but if it is true, it is more true now than it was four years ago.”The president and his campaign aides believe Barrett’s confirmation hearings can be a turning point with just three weeks until Election Day, activating conservative and religious voters who care deeply about the composition of the high court.The focus on Barrett also seeks to increase pressure on Biden to endorse or reject a plan favored by liberals to pack the high court with additional justices if he and his party recapture the White House and control of the Senate. Biden has declined to answer questions on expanding the number of justices.But rallies were a crucial element of Trump’s upset victory in 2016, and polls suggest the president would need to capture similar magic in the final weeks of this year’s campaign if he hopes to be re-elected.Biden holds a 54%-42% lead nationally among likely voters, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday. Trump’s diagnosis further cemented voters’ unease about his handling of the pandemic.Two-thirds of registered voters say the president failed to take appropriate precautions against the virus, 62% distrust his comments about the disease, and 73% say they’re worried that they or an immediate family member will contract Covid-19.Biden and other Democrats have been hammering Trump over his decision to resume rallies, where there is typically little effort among the audience to socially distance. Biden said in a statement before the event that Trump brought to Florida “reckless behavior, divisive rhetoric and fear mongering.”The president’s team is banking on the Barrett nomination to move the race back onto more favorable terrain.“This is a big deal, not just for the court, not just for the country, but also for the campaign politically, it’s given a real shot in the arm to our grassroots efforts,” said Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien.But the pervasive impact of coronavirus was looming over the opening day of Barrett’s confirmation hearing on Monday, underscoring the challenge at hand. Coverage of the opening day focused on the appearance of Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican who attended the proceedings despite testing positive for coronavirus earlier this month.Lee was one of 11 people -- including fellow Judiciary Committee members Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- known to have contracted the virus after attending a White House event celebrating Barrett’s nomination.Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican locked in a tight re-election battle, chaired the hearing days after refusing to submit to a coronavirus test before a debate with his Democratic opponent. And 87-year-old Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley has also refused to get tested despite interactions with other committee members who contracted the disease. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris appeared at the hearing virtually, citing concerns over the infection risk.Recovery as Political Asset?Trump has even pitched his recovery from the virus as a political asset, claiming that, unlike Biden, he was now “immune” to the deadly disease. The president’s repetition of that claim on Twitter prompted the social media network to add a disclaimer to his post.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that it has “limited information about reinfections with the virus that causes Covid-19.” It said there were no confirmed reports of reinfection within three months of initial infection, suggesting that recovery from the novel coronavirus may be like other similar diseases that offer some level of immunity.Before he began speaking in Florida on Monday night, Trump tossed masks into the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-donald-trump-boasts-at-florida-campaign-rally-of-feeling-so-powerful/story-nLGPgNcoDj36Pb2dyh02wM.html
13-10-2020||World||US plows ahead with mail-in voting despite ballot errors||Tens of thousands of ballots in Ohio and New York with the wrong candidate or voter names. Votes thrown in the trash in Pennsylvania and scores of lawsuits over the counts.Three weeks before the US presidential vote, the immense surge in demand for mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus is testing the country’s ability to pull off a credible election.President Donald Trump says voting by mail is ripe for fraud and has promised to challenge ballot counts.“Out of control. A Rigged Election!!!” Trump tweeted on Friday after news that ballots with the wrong candidates were sent to 50,000 residents of Columbus, Ohio, a key state Trump needs to win for reelection.But election analysts say that, despite those headline cases, so far the process is going well. “There’s going to be execution errors along the way,” said Kevin Kosar, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.“The good news is, these mistakes are happening, but they are being caught early,” he said.Primary horror stories Nearly 75 million mail-in ballots have been sent or requested so far this year, more than double the 33 million in 2016, according to the US Elections Project of the University of Florida on Monday.But errors and delays in getting the ballots printed and mailed, cases of mishandled ballots like in Pennsylvania, and reports of people receiving more than one ballot have stoked attacks on the concept at large.Horror stories from the primaries earlier this year, particularly in New York and Wisconsin, support the concerns. In both states tens of thousands of people either did not get their mail ballots or received them too late to vote. The postal service did not put postmarks on thousands of ballots to show they had been mailed on time. Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote At Home Institute, said a few cases have blown up in the press and social media, but “are not widespread.”“It’s 2020 and everybody is highly sensitive,” she said.The Ohio and New York ballot problems were simple printing and envelop insertion errors that could have been avoided with better management.“Is everything going to be perfect all the time? No. There never has been a perfect election,” McReynolds said.“If we got two issues in two counties out of 8,000 jurisdictions, then the bigger story is it’s working effectively in the majority of places.”McReynolds, former head of elections in Denver, Colorado who helped set up the state’s universal by-mail voting system, said everyone is focused this year on mailed ballots.But in-person voting has its own problems, she argued, especially machine breakdowns and long lines, like those seen in Georgia on Monday, a particular issue given the Covid-19 pandemic.“I believe that there are actually more problems in in-person voting,” she said.Lawsuits Still, there will be problems on the November 3 election day. McReynolds said three key battleground states that could decide the winner -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- haven’t given themselves enough time to open, verify, and then count millions of mailed ballots.Kosar says what worries him is the possibly hundreds of lawsuits being pursued over how mailed ballots will be counted, as well as other process issues.Republicans especially have tried to limit the impact of mail-in voting, as surveys show Democrats are much more likely that Republicans to mail their ballot rather than vote in person. In Pennsylvania they battled for a court ruling to throw out ballots if the voter uses the wrong envelope.In South Carolina Republican attorneys won a ruling requiring envelopes for ballots to be signed by witnesses as well as the voter.The issue of rejected ballots could be crucial. The 2000 presidential battle between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore was decided by a 537 vote margin in Florida, and hinged on the Supreme Court blocking a broad recount that could have restored thousands of rejected ballots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plows-ahead-with-mail-in-voting-despite-ballot-errors/story-RCRK5WGg49hf5wEF2nNdcI.html
13-10-2020||World||Microsoft attempts takedown of global criminal botnet||Microsoft announced legal action Monday seeking to disrupt a major cybercrime digital network that uses more than 1 million zombie computers to loot bank accounts and spread ransomware, which experts consider a major threat to the US presidential election.The operation to knock offline command-and-control servers for a global botnet that uses an infrastructure known as Trickbot to infect computers with malware was initiated with an order that Microsoft obtained in Virginia federal court on Oct. 6. Microsoft argued that the crime network is abusing its trademark.“It is very hard to tell how effective it will be but we are confident it will have a very long-lasting effect,” said Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research at ESET, one of several cybersecurity firms that partnered with Microsoft to map the command-and-control servers. “We’re sure that they are going to notice and it will be hard for them to get back to the state that the botnet was in.”Cybersecurity experts said that Microsoft’s use of a US court order to persuade internet providers to take down the botnet servers is laudable. But they add that it’s not apt to be successful because too many won’t comply and because Trickbot’s operators have a decentralized fall-back system and employ encrypted routing.Paul Vixie of Farsight Security said via email “experience tells me it won’t scale — there are too many IP’s behind uncooperative national borders.” And the cybersecurity firm Intel 471 reported no significant hit on Trickbot operations Monday and predicted ”little medium- to long-term impact” in a report shared with The Associated Press.But ransomware expert Brett Callow of the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft said that a temporary Trickbot disruption could, at least during the election, limit attacks and prevent the activation of ransomware on systems already infected.The announcement follows a Washington Post report Friday of a major — but ultimately unsuccessful — effort by the US military’s Cyber Command to dismantle Trickbot beginning last month with direct attacks rather than asking providers to deny hosting to domains used by command-and-control servers.A US policy called “persistent engagement” authorizes US cyberwarriors to engage hostile hackers in cyberspace and disrupt their operations with code, something Cybercom did against Russian misinformation jockeys during US midterm elections in 2018.Created in 2016 and used by a loose consortium of Russian-speaking cybercriminals, Trickbot is a digital superstructure for sowing malware in the computers of unwitting individuals and websites. In recent months, its operators have been increasingly renting it out to other criminals who have used it to sow ransomware, which encrypts data on target networks, crippling them until the victims pay up.One of the biggest reported victims of a ransomware variety sowed by Trickbot called Ryuk was the hospital chain Universal Health Services, which said all 250 of its US facilities were hobbled in an attack last month that forced doctors and nurses to resort to paper and pencil.US Department of Homeland Security officials list ransomware as a major threat to the Nov. 3 presidential election. They fear an attack could freeze up state or local voter registration systems, disrupting voting, or knock out result-reporting websites.While cybersecurity experts say the operators of Trickbot and affiliated digital crime syndicates are Russian speakers mostly based in eastern Europe, they caution that they are motivated by profit, not politics. They do, however, operate with impunity with no Kremlin interference as long as their targets are abroad.“In today’s world, Trickbot is a type of a plague,” said Alex Holden, founder of Milwaukee-based Hold Security, which tracks its activity closely on the dark web, “and a government that ignores a global plague is more than complacent.”Trickbot is “malware-as-a-service,” its modular architecture lets it be used as a delivery mechanism for a wide array of criminal activity. It began mostly as a so-called banking Trojan that attempts to steal credentials from online bank account so criminals can fraudulently transfer cash.But recently, researchers have noted a rise in Trickbot’s use in ransomware attacks targeting everything from municipal and state governments to school districts and hospitals. Ryuk and another type of ransomware called Conti — also distributed via Trickbot — dominated attacks on the US public sector in September, said Callow of Emsisoft.Holden said the reported Cybercom disruption — involving efforts to confuse its configuration through code injections — succeeded in temporarily breaking down communications between command-and-control servers and most of the bots.“But that’s hardly a decisive victory,” he said, adding that the botnet rebounded with new victims and ransomware.The disruption — in two waves that began Sept. 22 — was first reported by cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs.The AP could not immediately confirm the reported Cybercom involvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-attempts-takedown-of-global-criminal-botnet/story-1eUvwafIJXpEaZlsTMmHbP.html
13-10-2020||World||Donald Trump tests negative for coronavirus, isn’t infectious, says doctor||Donald Trump tested negative on consecutive days for Covid-19 and isn’t infectious, his doctor said Monday as the president traveled to Florida for his first campaign rally since he was hospitalized for the virus.In a memo released by the White House, Sean Conley said the tests, along with guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, informed the conclusion that Trump doesn’t risk infecting others.Conley did not say on which days Trump tested negative and the White House declined to comment when asked. Trump was tested using an antigen test, according to the doctor’s memo, which are considered to be less accurate than molecular tests.Also Read: US Election 2020: Nice if decision to scrap presidential debate reversed, says White HouseTrump has come under criticism from his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, and others for what they call a cavalier attitude about the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 215,000 people in the USThe president on Saturday made his first public appearance since testing positive, delivering a campaign-style speech before hundreds of people gathered closely together on the South Lawn of the White House. Conley had said in a memo Saturday night that Trump was no longer considered a transmission risk, but did not say whether the president had tested negative at the time.In a call with supporters Sunday evening, Trump said he had “tested totally negative.”Trump has forged ahead with plans to hold large events even though a number of top White House officials, senators and others in the president’s circle tested positive for the virus after a crowded Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony -- where he announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court.Monday night’s rally, along with three others planned this week, threaten to advance the spread of the coronavirus, warned Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, in an interview on CNN earlier Monday.“Look at it purely in the context of public health,” Fauci said. “We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that. We’ve seen that when you have situations of congregant settings where there are a lot of people without masks, the data speak for themselves.”Also Read: The mystery of India’s low coronavirus death rateTrump, who boarded Air Force One without wearing a mask, has asserted that his infection and subsequent recovery have made him “immune.” Fauci said it’s “likely” Trump is shielded from contracting the virus again for a certain period of time, but added there have been cases of people becoming re-infected.“As the better part of caution, I think that would be appropriate to do that,” Fauci said when asked if he would recommend Trump and others wear masks and limit exposure to others even after they are no longer contagious.Conley said Trump had tested negative on a rapid test made by Abbott Laboratories, which are commonly used in the White House but are not as sensitive as molecular screenings, including PCR tests. The Food and Drug Administration’s website says the antigen tests “are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection compared to molecular tests.”Yet Conley cited clinical and laboratory data and other tests “indicate a lack of detectable viral replication.” He wrote that “it’s important to note” that the Covid-19 test wasn’t used “in isolation for the determination of the president’s current negative status.”The White House has faced pressure to release more information about the president’s condition. For example, Conley’s memo did not say when Trump last tested negative before he tested positive on Oct. 1, a key piece of information that can help determine whom he might have exposed.The White House has cited patient privacy protections in declining to reveal the date of Trump’s last negative test.Conley also did not say whether Trump is still taking medications. A bandage could be seen on one of the president’s hands at Joint Base Andrews before he departed for Florida.The report on Trump’s negative test came one week after he was released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-isn-t-infectious-says-doctor/story-7xYPrnWVUWJgjUvuEAE50L.html
13-10-2020||World||Rushing a Covid-19 vaccine is a terrible idea. Here’s why||The coronavirus pandemic has upended lives and disrupted the global economy. The sooner we can get a vaccine, the sooner we have a chance at returning to normal. That doesn’t mean we should needlessly rush it.Vaccine development and approval normally takes several years, but it has been squeezed into a period of less than year. In Donald Trump’s America, that’s not soon enough -- but there is a way to speed things up even further. The Food and Drug Administration, as the gatekeeper for any new medicine coming to market, can hasten the regulatory process in the event of an urgent need and award approval before a trial is complete. Trump wants Covid-19 vaccine developers to take this path.Companies from AstraZeneca Plc to Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. (working with BioNTech SE) are all in hot pursuit of a vaccine, with Pfizer among the likeliest to file for early approval, perhaps as soon as this month. The difference, though, between seeking approval based on interim data and final analysis is only a matter of a few weeks or at most a couple of months. With all that’s riding on the success of a vaccine, it’s worth waiting for a full set of results. There are good scientific reasons for doing so and risks in not. Let’s take Pfizer’s case as a way to show why:Vaccine Effectiveness: Pfizer’s trial, like most, can be hailed a success for early approval if cough and fever are reduced in people on the vaccine compared with those on placebo; it doesn’t need to show that it can reduce severe disease. Pfizer would only get that kind of data over the full course of a trial. While it’s possible that if milder symptoms are reduced, more severe ones would be as well, ending early means that regulators will have to take this on faith. It would be worthwhile to see at least a few severe cases emerge in the trial to assess whether the vaccine genuinely prevents more concerning illness and to rule out the possibility of a rare side effect. A Crucial Cohort: Older adults are among the populations most vulnerable to Covid-19 and will receive many doses of any approved vaccine. It’s not uncommon for vaccines to be less effective in old people because their immune systems don’t work as well. Stopping a trial early means there will likely be very limited data on whether a particularly crucial vaccine clears the bar in an essential group. Only 43% of Pfizer’s subjects are 56 or older. Far fewer are likely to be over 70, where the risks rise exponentially. The average age of infection has fallen substantially over the course of the pandemic because older adults tend to be more careful, which could cut further into the amount of information available. The same issue applies to the about 10% of younger patients who develop more severe disease. At-Risk Underrepresentation: A similar and even more acute issue involves ethnic minorities and African Americans, which account for a higher percentage of severe cases of Covid-19. While Pfizer has expanded its trial to 44,000 from 30,000 to increase the number of participants from these populations, it has only just done this. It is unlikely that the drugmaker will have enough data for its vaccine in these populations if it decides to file for regulatory approval before the full trial has completed. Only 27% of patients in its U.S. centers, which account for the vast majority of its trial sites, are from diverse backgrounds.Limited Resources: If the protection from a vaccine that’s approved early – whether made by Pfizer or anyone else – fades over time or proves to be less impressive than those that follow, the end result would be the depletion of valuable raw materials that could have been devoted to better options. Approval is just one step in getting a vaccine to people across the planet. Vast resources, from human and financial capital to glass vials and rubber stoppers, may be used up on a sub-optimal vaccine, hurting the rollout of more effective treatments and even crucial non-Covid vaccination efforts.Public Trust: Skepticism about vaccines already abounds among certain parts of the general public; others are concerned that rushing one for Covid-19 may end up cutting corners or increasing risks. If a vaccine that was approved early turns out to be sub-optimal, these attitudes could harden. At worst, a bad outcome could shake confidence in vaccinations as a whole, putting the hard-won success of eradicating or diminishing so many infectious diseases at risk.Lost Opportunities: An early approval without much data on long-term safety and broad effectiveness – still possible even with the FDA’s recently revealed guidance that requires a median of two months of follow-up in a trial’s participants – may hamper the development of other vaccines. Fewer people will want to enter a trial that could give them a placebo if there’s an authorized shot. That’s particularly concerning because several potentially promising vaccines -- including “ultramodern” vaccines such as those from Arcturus and Imperial College London, as well as efforts from Novavax Inc. and a partnership between GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Sanofi that use tried-and-true technology – have yet to start late-stage trials.Like everyone else on the planet, I want to get back to normal as soon as possible, and a vaccine will help get us there. But I only want a vaccine that has been through all the rigors of a full-sized trial. Yes, vaccine front-runners like Pfizer have the right to file for early approval if they are eligible to do so. But a little patience would help deliver much more information and give other vaccine hopefuls a chance to prove their worth as well. We would all be better off for it. (This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

13-10-2020||World||Donald Trump ready for first rally after contracting coronavirus||Just a week after his release from the hospital, President Donald Trump is returning to the campaign trail Monday for the first time since contracting the coronavirus as he tries to stage a late comeback in the election’s final stretch.Trump, facing a stubborn deficit in national and battleground state polling, will be headlining a rally in Sanford, Florida — the first stop in a busy week that will include events in Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina and Wisconsin.The robust schedule underscores the work Trump needs to do as he tries to win over voters just three weeks before Election Day. And it comes amid still-unanswered questions about the impact so much travel so soon could have on the 74-year-old president’s health. The progression of Covid-19 is often unpredictable, and there can be long-term complications.But Trump, eager to return to campaigning, has proclaimed himself cured and says he is now “immune” to the virus — claims that are impossible to prove given limitations in what scientists know about the coronavirus.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said Monday on CNN that those who recover from Covid-19 are likely to be immune for a limited period of time, but there are cases emerging of people getting reinfected weeks or months later.Fauci, speaking as Trump was prepared to depart the White House for Florida, questioned the wisdom of holding such an event. He noted that test positivity rates are climbing in parts of the Sun Belt.“We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that,” Fauci said.In a memo released over the weekend, Trump’s doctor, Navy Cmdr. Sean Conley, said the president met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation. He said that by “currently recognized standards,” he was no longer considered a transmission risk.But some medical experts have voiced skepticism that Trump could be declared contagion-free so soon. And it was unclear what — if any — added precautions and safety measures the campaign planned to take to prevent the trip from further spreading a virus that has already infected so many of the president’s closest aides and allies, including his campaign manager and the head of the Republican Party.Florida is seen as critical to Trump’s reelection chances. Trump narrowly beat his 2016 rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, in the state by just over 112,000 votes. Some recent polls have suggested a close race in the state, while others have put Democrat Joe Biden ahead.Trump’s decision to so quickly return to the campaign trail drew criticism from Biden and other Democrats.“President Trump comes to Sanford today bringing nothing but reckless behavior, divisive rhetoric, and fear mongering,” Biden said in a statement. “But, equally dangerous is what he fails to bring: no plan to get this virus that has taken the lives of over 15,000 Floridians under control.”Florida state Rep. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat who is running for state Senate and who recently recovered from his own Covid-19 infection, said in a conference call with reporters that Trump should not be coming to Florida.“It’s reckless and irresponsible,” Jones said.Florida lawyer Dan Uhfelder, who has dressed as the Grim Reaper on beaches to highlight the coronavirus threat, filed a lawsuit Monday trying to stop Trump from holding his Sanford rally. It seeks to have the event classified as a public nuisance.Trump, for his part, is eager to show the world that he is no longer sidelined by a virus that he has consistently played down and that has killed 215,000 people across the nation.Since his release from a military hospital after three days of around-the-clock care that included access to experimental antibody treatments unavailable to the public, Trump has used his personal experience to try to convince the public that he was right all along.He has repeatedly told Americans who contract the virus that they’re “going to get better really fast,” although hundreds of people in the US die of the virus every day.Trump held his first public event since his diagnosis on Saturday, addressing a crowd of hundreds of people on the South Lawn from a White House balcony. Appearing without a mask and with bandages still visible on his hands, likely from intravenous injections, Trump spoke for just 18 minutes — far less than his usual campaign rallies, which can last upwards of 90 minutes.He told the crowd the virus is “disappearing,” even as cases have been on the rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-ready-for-first-rally-since-contracting-coronavirus/story-V31vy07tvEOPYYVzQWJYQI.html
13-10-2020||World||UK unveils 3-level lockdown plan; Liverpool at highest risk||The British government carved England into three tiers of coronavirus risk on Monday in a bid to slow a resurgent outbreak, putting the northern city of Liverpool into the highest risk category and shutting its pubs, gyms and betting shops.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the three-tier national system was designed to “simplify and standardize” a confusing patchwork of local rules, as the country faces a “crucial phase” in which hospitals are now filling up with more Covid-19 patients than in March, when he ordered a national lockdown.“These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet, and we must act now,” he said.Shops, schools and universities would remain open in all areas. Johnson told lawmakers that the goal of the new system was to save lives and prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed without “shuttering our lives and our society” through a new national lockdown.But pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses pushed back, with some industry leaders threatening a legal challenge against the rules and arguing that they are not to blame for rising infections.After falling during the summer, coronavirus cases are rising in the UK as winter approaches, with northwest and northeast England seeing the steepest increases. Liverpool has one of the country’s most severe outbreaks, with about 600 cases per 100,000 people, even more than the hard-hit European cities of Madrid and Brussels.Under the new measures, areas in England are classified at medium, high or very high risk, and placed under restrictions of varying severity.Areas in the lowest tier will follow existing national restrictions, including a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants and a ban on more than six people gathering. In areas at high risk, members of different households are barred from meeting indoors.The “very high” risk tier will face restrictions including closing pubs — apart from those that serve meals — and, if local authorities want, other venues such as gyms and casinos.Liverpool was the only area put into the top category Monday, but Johnson said authorities were still talking with other local leaders across the north of England.Pubs, gyms, leisure centers, betting shops and casinos in Liverpool will close beginning Wednesday.Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said local authorities supported tougher restrictions as long as they were accompanied by improved test-and-trace measures to suppress clusters of infections — something he said the government had agreed to.“As well as protecting lives and doing things to tackle the virus, we also need to protect livelihoods, so we argued really strongly for a stronger financial package,” said Anderson, a member of the opposition Labour Party. “Unfortunately, that wasn’t listened to.”The government has announced a support package to pay two-thirds of the salaries of employees of companies that are told to close, but many in the pub and restaurant sector say that is not enough to save already struggling businesses.Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said he doubted the new measures would go far enough to “get control of this virus, to protect jobs or retain public trust.”The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,875. Health officials say Britain is at a tipping point in the outbreak, with strong action needed to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed at a time when they are already at their busiest with flu and other winter illnesses.Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service in England, said there are currently more people hospitalized with the virus than there were when the country went into its national lockdown in March.He said three temporary Covid-19 hospitals in northern England that were mothballed when the outbreak receded over the summer are being readied to admit patients once again in the coming weeks.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said Monday that while northern England has the highest infection rates, cases are on the rise across the country. Infections have risen most rapidly among older teenagers and young adults, who generally suffer mild symptoms, but are spreading to older and more at-risk groups.“This is a nationwide phenomenon now,” Van-Tam said.Bar and restaurant owners say the government has not shared any evidence backing up the claim that they are the major transmission sources of the virus.Manchester City Council leader Richard Leese said data from the city’s public health officials “seems to demonstrate that there is not a particular connection between bars and restaurants and the transmission of COVID.”But Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said “most of the outbreaks are happening within and between households, and then after that, it’s in the retail and hospitality sector.”He said the new measures would take several weeks to drive down the number of hospitalizations and deaths — if they were strong enough to make a difference at all.“The outbreak is a bit like a super-tanker,” Semple told the BBC. “You put the brakes on, but it takes a long time before you see the effect.”The measures announced Monday apply to England. The rest of the UK is under similar, and sometimes tougher, restrictions. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have been closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-unveils-3-level-lockdown-plan-liverpool-at-highest-risk/story-lBsqUDmTyk6kuniaZoKjhP.html
13-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un breaks down in rare apology to North Koreans||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un became visibly emotional during a speech at a military parade over the weekend as he thanked troops for their sacrifices and apologised to citizens for failing to improve their lives.At a speech on Saturday during celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party, Kim thanked thousands of gathered troops for responding to recent damaging storms, and for helping to prevent a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country.In video footage edited and released by the state television station, Kim appeared tearful and at one point seemed to choke up.Kim said he was grateful that not a single North Korean had been infected with the virus, a claim that the US and South Korean officials have previously cast doubts on.The impact of anti-coronavirus measures, international sanctions, and several typhoons combined to prevent the government from following through on promises to improve citizens’ lives, Kim said.“My efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life,” he said. “Our people, however, have always believed and absolutely trusted me, and supported my choice and determination, whatever it is.”North Korea’s economy, already severely restricted by international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, took a further hit as the country shut down nearly all border traffic in an effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.The United Nations has said that as much as 40% of the population faces food shortages, which may have been exacerbated by severe summer floods and typhoons.In a scene common to many such events in North Korea, most people in the audience also had tears streaming down their faces.As he addressed an unprecedented night-time military parade, Kim wished the neighbouring South Korea would “hold hands” again after the coronavirus pandemic is over. It was a mixed signal, as the North Korean leader also unveiled a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and new multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), as well as fast, manoeuvrable short-range missiles that would be ideal for striking targets in the South.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-breaks-down-in-rare-apology-to-north-koreans/story-7qHcWjUe9hAoB1v7ruXDPL.html
13-10-2020||World||Donald Trump vs Joe Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more||Amid the tumult of the 2020 presidential campaign, one dynamic has remained constant: The Nov. 3 election offers voters a choice between substantially different policy paths.President Donald Trump, like many fellow Republicans, holds out tax reductions and regulatory cuts as economic imperatives and frames himself as a conservative champion in the culture wars. The president has offered few details about how he would pull the levers of government in a second term. His most consistent argument focuses on stopping Democratic opponent Joe Biden and his party from pushing US policy leftward.Biden, for his part, is not the socialist caricature depicted by Trump. But he is every bit a center-left Democrat who frames the federal government as the force to combat the coronavirus, rebuild the economy and address centuries of institutional racism and systemic inequalities. The former vice president and US senator also offers his deal-making past as evidence he can do it again from the Oval Office.A look at where the rivals stand on key issues:ECONOMY, TAXESLow unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump’s calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market has clawed its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the pandemic began exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-2009 Great Recession.Trump has predicted that the US economy will rebound in the third and fourth quarters of this year and is set to take off like a “rocket ship” in 2021. He promises that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics will soon be available, allowing life to get back to normal. His push for a payroll tax cut over the summer was thwarted by stiff bipartisan opposition. But winning a second term — and a mandate from voters — could help him resurrect the idea.First and foremost, Biden argues that the economy cannot fully recover until Covid-19 is contained. For the long-term recovery, he pitches sweeping federal action to avoid an extended recession and to address longstanding wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans.His biggest-ticket plans include a $2 trillion, four-year push to eliminate carbon pollution in the US energy grid by 2035 and a new government health insurance plan open to all working-age Americans (with generous subsidies). He proposes new spending on education, infrastructure and small businesses, along with raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.Biden would cover some but not all of the new costs by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. He wants a corporate income tax rate of 28% (lower than before but higher than now) and broad income and payroll tax hikes for individuals with more than $400,000 of annual taxable income. All that would generate an estimated $4 trillion or more over 10 years.Biden frames immigration as an economic matter as well. He wants to expand legal immigration slots and offer a citizenship path for about 11 million residents who are in the country illegally but who, Biden notes, are already economic contributors as workers and consumers.EDUCATIONTrump has pushed for schools to fully reopen for in-person learning and announced that the federal government will begin distributing millions of rapid coronavirus tests to states. He urged governors to use them to reopen schools for students in kindergarten through 12th grade.Trump has also used his call for schools to fully reopen as an opportunity to spotlight his support for charter schools and school choice. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime proponent of charter schools and school voucher programs, has suggested that families be allowed to take federal money allotted to school districts that don’t open and spend it on private schools that do open. For most of Trump’s first term, his administration sought major increases to federal charter school grant aid. Congress responded with relatively small increases.With higher education, Trump has repeatedly complained that campuses are beset by “radical left indoctrination.” He has threatened to defund universities and said he would ask the Treasury Department to reexamine the tax-exempt status and federal funding of unspecified schools.Biden wants schools to get more federal aid for pandemic-related costs through the same federal law used after national disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.Beyond COVID, Biden wants the federal government to partner with states to make public higher education tuition-free for any student in a household earning up to $125,000 annually. The assistance would extend to everyone attending two-year schools, regardless of income. He also proposes sharply increasing aid for historically Black colleges. His overall education plans carry a 10-year price tag of about $850 billion.He calls for universal access to prekindergarten programs for 3- and 4-year-olds; tripling Title I spending for schools with higher concentrations of students from low-income households; more support for non-classroom positions like on-campus social workers; federal infrastructure spending for public school buildings; and covering schools’ costs to comply with federal disability laws. Biden also opposes taxpayer money being routed to for-profit charter school businesses, and he’s pledged that his secretary of education will have classroom teaching experience.HEALTH CAREAs a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would “immediately” replace President Barack Obama’s health care law with a plan of his own that would provide “insurance for everybody.” Americans are still waiting for his plan.Trump recently returned to health care amid disapproval of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and growing uncertainty about the future of the Affordable Care Act, which his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn. He is reiterating his 4-year-old promises for quality health care at affordable prices, lower prescription drug costs, more consumer choice and greater transparency.He also announced executive orders calling for an end to surprise medical bills and declaring it the policy of the US government to protect people with preexisting conditions, even if Obamacare is struck down. However, protections for preexisting conditions are already the law, and Trump would have to go to Congress to cement a new policy through legislation. In the first presidential debate, Trump also held out the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate to have health insurance as significant progress, while ignoring questions about his lack of a comprehensive plan.Biden wants to expand Obama’s law to provide more generous coverage to a greater number of people and add a “Medicare-like public option” that would compete with private insurers and be available to working-age Americans. Biden estimates that would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 law, and progressives, who want a single-payer system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.Biden also has sought to turn the current Supreme Court vacancy into a health care matter, noting that the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a key vote in upholding the 2010 health care law, while Trump’s nominee, federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett, has criticized the court’s reasoning in that decision.CORONAVIRUSOver the course of the summer, Trump went from acknowledging that the pandemic may “get worse before it gets better” to declaring that the U.S. is “rounding the corner” on the crisis. Then he tested positive for the virus himself.The pandemic remains the biggest obstacle for his reelection hopes, and his bout with the virus just weeks before Election Day only brightened the spotlight on the issue.Roughly 7 in 10 Americans think the nation is on the wrong track, and just 39% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the crisis that has killed more than 207,000 people in the US, according to a recent poll The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Congress approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in March and April, and Democrats and the White House have been at loggerheads over another significant round of funding, with Trump sending mixed messages on what he wants.Trump has largely placed responsibility with governors for leading the response.Biden draws some of his sharpest contrasts with Trump on the pandemic, arguing that the presidency and federal government exist for such crises and that Trump has been an abject failure responsible for tens of thousands of preventable deaths.Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments. He’s also promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, a wartime law a president can use to direct certain private-sector activity. Additionally, Biden promises to elevate the government’s scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the U.S. rejoin the World Health Organization. He’s also willing to use executive power for a national mask mandate, but whether that is enforceable is questionable.ABORTIONYears before his run for the White House, Trump described himself as a strong abortion rights proponent. But since coming to Washington, he has been cheered by anti-abortion groups for his administration’s efforts to restrict access to the procedure.As a candidate and as president, Trump has consistently expressed his opposition to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide and said the issue should be decided by states.He has expressed support for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits Medicaid from being used to pay for abortions in most circumstances, and he’s sought to restrict access to two drugs that are used to induce abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancies.In his Republican National Convention speech in August, Trump declared that “children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.” Nominating Barrett, a 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, has the anti-abortion movement hopeful that the high court — should she win confirmation — will tilt decisively to the right and pave the way for the court to eventually overturn the Roe case.Biden has declined to offer his own list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, but he’s said repeatedly that he supports Roe v. Wade’s finding that the Constitution establishes a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy. He’s endorsed calls for Congress to codify that right, a move that would keep abortion legal statutorily even if the court struck down the constitutional protections.A practicing Catholic, Biden talked publicly for years of his personal struggle over abortion as a moral issue. He cited that as a reason he supported the Hyde Amendment ban on federal taxpayer funding for abortion services. But he reversed that position early in his 2020 campaign after coming under pressure from women’s groups and Democratic activists. Biden said he wasn’t bowing to pressure but instead argued that Republican legislatures around the country had restricted abortion access to the point that the Hyde Amendment had become an untenable barrier for poor or working-class women to access a constitutional right.TRADETrump views the signing of two major trade deals — an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and Phase 1 of a China agreement — as signature achievements of his presidency. US and China signed Phase 1 in January, less than two months before the pandemic put an enormous strain on US-China relations. Trump says Phase 1 led to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in US agricultural products, energy and other American products. In return, the US canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones, toys and laptop computers. The US also cut in half, to 7.5%, the tariff rate levied on $120 billion in other China imports.Phase 2 of the deal is expected to focus on some tougher issues between the countries, including Trump’s wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the “China virus,” it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade. Trump recently said he’s currently “not interested” in talking to China.Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of “fair trade” abroad — a twist on decades of “free trade” talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic firms (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term.He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms’ research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals. He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world’s other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the US, is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president.FOREIGN POLICYDuring his first term, Trump built his foreign policy around the mantra of “America First.”But in the final lap before Election Day, Trump has been offering himself as an international peacemaker for nudging the Gulf monarchies of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to sign agreements with Israel opening business and diplomatic relations. Trump says other Arab nations are on the cusp of opening formal relations with Israel.He also counts as major achievements building more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) of his promised wall along the US-Mexico border, cajoling more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense spending and reducing the US military footprint in Afghanistan and other hot spots. He also announced his intended withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Trump can officially withdraw the US from the Paris agreement — it sets the goal of holding global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — as an example of an agreement that “disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.” The deal, which was signed by Obama, stipulates that no nation can leave until four years after it signed on. For the US, that’s Nov. 4 — one day after the US election.The president has also made clear his desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than the timeline laid out in the Feb. 29 peace agreement with the Taliban, which set the path for US troops to leave the country in 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. There are currently about 4,500 US troops in Afghanistan, and Trump has said he wants them all to be withdrawn by the end of the year.Trump also counts his engagement with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as a monumental achievement. The president has not been able to prod Kim to give up his nation’s nuclear program, but he has met Kim three times — something Trump critics say has only legitimized the authoritarian leader.Biden says he would begin “the day after the election” rebuilding relationships with allies ruffled by Trump’s approach, which Biden mocks as “America alone.” Biden’s top priority is reestablishing the foundations of NATO, the post-World War II alliance of Western powers that Biden said is necessary to counter Russia’s aggressive, expansionist aims in eastern Europe and Asia.Biden also says he would immediately confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country’s interference in US elections. Biden pledges to “end forever wars” but clarifies that US special forces — as opposed to large-scale ground missions — remain a vital part of world stability. He calls for rebuilding a decimated US diplomatic corps, rejoining the Paris climate accord and pushing China and other large economies to reduce carbon pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-vs-joe-biden-where-they-stand-on-health-economy-more/story-RXYsSVMZzMN3JAsQpUoPOK.html
13-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett vows to interpret laws ‘as they are written’||Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett declared Monday that Americans “deserve an independent Supreme Court that interprets our Constitution and laws as they are written,” encapsulating her conservative approach to the law that has Republicans excited about the prospect of her taking the place of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before Election Day.Barrett spoke about her judicial philosophy, her experience and her large family at the end of the first day of her fast-tracked confirmation hearings that Senate Democrats are using to try and brand her a threat to Americans’ health care during the coronavirus pandemic.After sitting in silence through nearly four hours of opening statements from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the 48-year-old federal appeals court judge laid out her approach to the bench, which she has likened to that of her conservative mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia.“Courts have a vital responsibility to the rule of rule of law, which is critical to a free society. But courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” Barrett said in a statement she delivered after removing the protective mask she wore most of the day.“The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try,.”She told senators that she is “forever grateful” for Ginsburg’s trailblazing path as a woman on the court.Yet Sen. Kamala Harris, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, said the court is “often the last refuge for equal justice” and a Barrett nomination puts in jeopardy everything Ginsburg fought to protect.Testifying from her office because of the pandemic, Harris said that not only health care but voting rights, workers’ rights, abortion rights and the very idea of justice are at stake.Republicans called Barrett a thoughtful judge with impeccable credentials.Barring a dramatic development, Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm her to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. If she is confirmed quickly, she could be on the court when it hears the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, a week after the election.One after another, Democrats sought to tie her nomination to the upcoming court case.“Health care coverage for millions of Americans is at stake with this nomination,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s senior Democrat.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said the nomination is a “judicial torpedo aimed” at the law’s protection for people with pre-existing health conditions among its provisions. The Trump administration wants the court to strike down the entire law popularly known as “Obamacare” on Nov. 10. Barrett has criticized the court’s two earlier major rulings supporting the law.Among Republicans, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, dismissed warnings Barrett will undo the Obama-era healthcare law as “outrageous.”Trump himself seemed to be watching, tweeting several times about the hearing. In one message, he tweeted that he’d have a “FAR BETTER” health care plan, with lower costs and protections for pre-existing conditions. But he has not, as yet, discussed an actual health care plan.Republicans also warned against making Barrett’s Catholicism an issue in the confirmation debate, especially in regard to her stance on abortion, with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri lambasting what he called a “pattern and practice of religious bigotry” by Democrats. However, Democratic senators made clear in advance of the hearing that they didn’t plan to question the judge on the specifics of her religious faith.Democratic presidential nominee Biden, also a practicing Catholic, told reporters ahead of a campaign trip to Ohio that he doesn’t think “there’s any question about her faith.”Barrett’s religious views and past leadership role in a Catholic faith community pose a challenge for Democrats as they try to probe her judicial approach to abortion, gay marriage and other social issues without veering into inappropriate questions of her faith.The Senate Judiciary Committee, meeting on a federal holiday, kicked off four days of statements and testimony in an environment that has been altered by the coronavirus pandemic. Some senators were taking part remotely, and the hearing room itself was arranged with health concerns in mind.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., opened the hearing acknowledging “the COVID problem in America is real.” But he said, “We do have a country that needs to move forward safely.”Graham acknowledged the obvious: “This is going to be a long, contentious week.”Protesters rallied outside the Senate buildings with the hearing room largely closed to the public. Capitol Police said 22 people were arrested and charged on suspicion of crowding, obstructing or other violations.Republicans are moving at a breakneck pace to seat Barrett before the Nov. 3 election to secure Trump’s pick, which would put her on the bench for any election-related challenges.Democrats are trying in vain to delay the fast-track confirmation by raising fresh concerns about the safety of meeting during the pandemic after two GOP senators on the panel tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, one of those who tested positive, was in the hearing room Monday after his spokesman said he was symptom-free. The other affected senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, was participating remotely, though he too is symptom-free, his spokesman said. Both tested positive 10 days ago.Trump chose Barrett after the death last month of Ginsburg, a liberal icon. It’s the opportunity to entrench a conservative majority on the court for years to come with his third justice.Outside groups are pushing Democrats to make a strong case against what they call an illegitimate confirmation, when people are already voting in some states, saying the winner of the presidency should make the pick. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential contest.The country is getting an extended look at Barrett this week in hearings like none other during the heated election environment and the pandemic limiting public access.Faith and family punctuated her testimony, and she said she would bring “a few new perspectives” as the first mother of school-age children on the nine-member court.Barrett said she uses her children as a test when deciding cases, asking herself how she would view the decision if one of her seven children were the party she was ruling against.“Even though I would not like the result, would I understand that the decision was fairly reasoned and grounded in the law?” she said.The hearing followed a White House event announcing her nomination just over two weeks ago, in which most of the audience did not wear masks. The event has been labeled a “superspreader” for the coronavirus.More than two dozen people linked to the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event, including the two GOP senators, have contracted COVID-19 since then. Barrett and her family went maskless at the event. She and her husband, Jesse, tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, two administration officials have said.Democrats already were enraged that Republicans are moving so quickly having refused to consider President Barack Obama nominee after Scalia’s death in February 2016, well before that year’s election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-vows-to-interpret-laws-as-they-are-written/story-JPmq5l7QGnLcocwk4bv0YI.html
13-10-2020||World||UN warns against pursuing herd immunity to stop coronavirus, says ‘allowing dangerous virus to run free simply unethical’||The head of the World Health Organization warned against the idea that herd immunity might be a realistic strategy to stop the pandemic, dismissing such proposals as “simply unethical.”At a media briefing on Monday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said health officials typically aim to achieve herd immunity by vaccination. Tedros noted that to obtain herd immunity from a highly infectious disease such as measles, for example, about 95% of the population must be immunized.“Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it,” he said. Some researchers have argued that allowing Covid-19 to spread in populations that are not obviously vulnerable will help build up herd immunity and is a more realistic way to stop the pandemic, instead of the restrictive lockdowns that have proved economically devastating.“Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak,” Tedros said.Tedros said that too little was known about immunity to Covid-19 to know if herd immunity is even achievable.“We have some clues, but we don’t have the complete picture,” he said, noting that WHO had documented instances of people becoming reinfected with coronavirus after recovering from an initial bout of the virus. Tedros said that while most people appear to develop some kind of immune response, it’s unclear how long that lasts or how robust that protection is — and that different people have varying responses.“Allowing a dangerous virus that we don’t fully understand to run free is simply unethical,” he said.WHO estimates less than 10% of the population has any immunity to the coronavirus, meaning the vast majority of the world remains susceptible.Tedros also noted countries had reported record-high daily figures of Covid-19 to the UN health agency for the last four days, citing surges in Europe and the Americas in particular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-against-pursuing-herd-immunity-to-stop-coronavirus-says-allowing-dangerous-virus-to-run-free-simply-unethical/story-P20aQKnsIhcH88A0AIdYHL.html
