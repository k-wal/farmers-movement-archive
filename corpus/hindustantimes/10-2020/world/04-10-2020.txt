04-10-2020||World||Trump could return to White House on Monday, say doctors||US President Donald Trump could be discharged as early as Monday from a military hospital where he is undergoing treatment after contracting the coronavirus, his physicians said on Sunday, hours after he released a video saying “I’ll be back soon.”But the doctors also revealed on Sunday a previously unreported episode of his blood oxygen levels dropping below normal, adding to the confusing updates from the White House on his health. Trump had the first episode on Friday, with high fever, which had prompted his physician and medical experts to shift him to the Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. But the medical team did not mention it at their Saturday briefing and had sought to present a rosy picture of the president doing well and being in high spirits. It came out through a leak to reporters by a senior official.Dr Brian Garibaldi, a Johns Hopkins doctor who is part of the medical team, told reporters on Sunday the president felt good and has been up and around. “If he continues to look and feel as well as he does today, our hope is that we can plan for a discharge as early as tomorrow to the White House where he can continue his treatment course.” The president was given a second dose of the anti-viral drug remdesivir on Saturday and was started off on dexamethasone, a steroid used to prevent drop in blood oxygen levels.But the team insisted the president was doing well overall. In his video message, Trump said that although the “real test” lies ahead, he hoped to resume and finish his re-election campaign.“I have to get all the way back because we still have to make America great again.” The White House later released pictures of the president working at his medical suite at the hospital to continue to reinforce the optimistic projection.Sean Conley, Trump’s physician who is facing criticism over what was seen as inaccurate updates, defended himself saying, “I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president...has had... and didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction. And in doing so, you know, came off that we’re trying to hide something, it wasn’t necessarily true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-could-return-to-white-house-on-monday-say-doctors/story-F9UlcdACEdbKU51imEm0KP.html
04-10-2020||World||UK government says it will reform ‘broken’ asylum system||Britain’s interior minister vowed Sunday to stop people entering the country clandestinely and to fix what she called a “broken” asylum system, echoing commitments that have been made and broken by UK governments for years.Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government would bring in new laws so it could “stop those who come here illegally making endless legal claims to remain” and “expedite the removal of those who have no claim for protection.”Patel said in a speech to a virtual Conservative Party conference that the changes would be “the biggest overhaul of our asylum system in decades.”She said Britain would continue to “provide safe haven to those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny.”Patel’s hardline rhetoric was designed to appeal to voters concerned at a surge in the number of people crossing the English Channel from France in small boats. Thousands have made the journey this year, most over the summer.Opposition Labour Party immigration spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Conservatives were “devoid of compassion and competence” on immigration.Migrants have long used northern France as a launching point to reach Britain by stowing away in trucks or on ferries. Many appear to have turned to small boats organized by smugglers during the coronavirus pandemic because virus restrictions have reduced vehicle traffic between France and Britain.Patel’s speech follows reports in recent weeks that the government considered ideas including building a wave machine in the Channel to deter boats and processing asylum-seekers on Ascension Island, a remote volcanic island more than 4,000 miles (6,435 kilometers) from the UK.The government dismissed some of the more far-fetched claims, but Patel said she would “explore all practical measures and options to deter illegal migration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-says-it-will-reform-broken-asylum-system/story-3AOAQkwyxdsD8VPVi6uJZI.html
04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump continues to improve during coronavirus treatment: Doctors||President Donald Trump’s blood oxygen level dropped suddenly on Saturday, but he “has continued to improve,” the White House physician said Sunday, suggesting that Trump could be discharged from the hospital as early as Monday.Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley sought to clarify contradictory statements and confusion about the president’s condition on the steps of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where Trump was being treated for Covid-19.Conley said the president had a “high fever” and a blood oxygen level below 94% on Friday and again on Saturday. The level currently stands at 98%, Trump’s medical team said.“The president has continued to improve,” Conley said.Trump offered his own assessment of his status the night before in a video from his hospital suite, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to “be back soon.” And he was back on social media early Sunday morning, sharing a video of flag-waving supporters, most not wearing masks, gathered outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment, with the president’s health and the nation’s leadership on the line. Moreover, the president’s health represents a national security issue of paramount importance not only to the functions of the U.S. government but also to countries around the world, friendly and otherwise.Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, pulled his attack ads off the air during Trump’s hospitalization, and on Sunday, he dispatched senior aides to deliver a largely friendly message.“We are sincerely hoping that the president makes a very quick recovery, and we can see him back out on the campaign trail very soon,” Biden adviser Symone Sanders said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”She added: “This is a glaring reminder that the virus is real.”Biden was at home in Wilmington, Delaware, on Sunday with no plans for in-person campaigning or other public appearances. Having already tested negative, he is expected to release the results of a new coronavirus test later in the day, and the campaign has pledged to disclose those results and all other future test results for the 77-year-old candidate.On Saturday, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, “We’re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.” In an update Saturday night, Trump’s chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was “not yet out of the woods.”Meanwhile, Trump’s handling of the pandemic and his own health faced new scrutiny.Trump’s medical care is far superior to the average American’s, with around-the-clock attention and experimental treatments. In the hospital video, he defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events during a pandemic.“I had no choice,” said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. “I had to be out front. ... I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. ... As a leader, you have to confront problems.”Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide and killed more than 209,000 people in the U.S.First lady Melania Trump remained at the White House to recover from her own bout with the virus.Trump’s administration has been less than transparent with the public throughout the pandemic, both about the president’s health and the virus’s spread inside the White House. The first word that a close aide to Trump had been infected came from the media, not the White House. And aides have repeatedly declined to share basic health information, including a full accounting of the president’s symptoms, what tests he’s undertaken and the results.Conley declined to say when Trump had last been tested before he was confirmed to have COVID-19 late Thursday. He initially suggested that Trump was 72 hours into the diagnosis — which would mean that he was confirmed infected Wednesday. Conley later clarified that Trump was administered an accurate test for the virus on Thursday afternoon.The White House has said Trump was expected to stay at the hospital for “a few days” and would continue to work from its presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties.On Saturday, Conley said Trump’s blood oxygen level was 96%, which is in the normal range. The two experimental drugs he has received, given through an IV, have shown some promise against COVID-19.He noted that in many cases, COVID-19 can become more dangerous as the body responds. “The first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10, are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness,” he said.At the same time, the White House has been working to trace a flurry of new infections of close Trump aides and allies. Attention is focused in particular on the Sept. 26 White House event introducing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.That day, Trump gathered more than 150 people in the Rose Garden, where they mingled, hugged and shook hands — overwhelmingly without masks. There were also several indoor receptions, where Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett, her family, senators and others spent time in the close quarters of the White House, photographs show.Among those who attended and have now tested positive: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. The president’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, have also tested positive, though they were not at the event. Another prominent Republican who has tested positive: Sen. Ron Johnson. R-Wis.___Colvin reported from Washington. Peoples reported from New York.

04-10-2020||World||Biden leads Trump in polls; respondents say prez could’ve avoided infection||Most Americans believe President Donald Trump could have avoided Covid-19 infection if he had handled the pandemic better, and there is no indication yet of an outpouring of support for him, according to a new poll by Reuters/Ipsos released on Sunday.The poll also showed that Trump’s Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden had expanded his lead over him by 10 points. Biden widened his lead by 14 points in a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll also. That poll was released on Sunday but conducted in the days between the first presidential debate and Trump’s hospitalisation. While three-fourths of the respondents said in the poll that the debate made no difference, 25% said they were more likely to vote for Biden now.In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Friday and Saturday, 51% of registered voters supported Biden, and 41% backed Trump. The poll showed that 65% respondents, 9 in 10 Democrats and 5 in 10 Republicans, held Trump responsible for getting infected. According to them, “if President Trump had taken coronavirus more seriously, he probably would not have been infected.”In the WSJ and NBC’s poll, Biden leads the president 53% to 39%, which is the highest support the former vice-president has enjoyed in polls conducted by them in months. It also showed the president’s support slip under 40% for the first time, and that negative views of him had increased.The poll found the debate moved the needle on Trump more than any other single significant factor such as his impeachment by the House of Representatives and acquittal by the Senate.Biden leads Trump up by 8.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls and by 7.9 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-leads-trump-in-polls-respondents-say-prez-could-ve-avoided-infection/story-nslymV2afjeoAmnMedmCzL.html

He has completed a second dose of Remdesivir, and his kidney and liver functions were normal, his medical team added.Earlier in the day, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had revealed that the condition of the President was more critical than officials had made public. According to reports on Friday, Trump was experiencing “mild symptoms” and continuing to work.“I can tell you this the biggest thing we see is with no fever now, and with him doing really well with his oxygen saturation levels,” Meadows said during an interview with Fox News broadcast.First Lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive for the coronavirus along with her husband on Thursday evening, was recuperating at the White House where she remained “well with only a mild cough and headache”.A number of US President’s aides and advisors were also tested positive for the virus. Kellyanne Conway, a former adviser to Trump, Bill Stepien, head of the Trump re-election campaign, and Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who helped Trump prepare for the first presidential debate against Democratic rival Joe Biden were tested positive one after the other.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-experienced-2-episodes-of-blood-oxygen-drop-has-had-no-fever-since-friday-hospital/story-VLaVrGOq3PWnfIiZZzRkMK.html

Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi said over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged.Rescuers on Sunday were also providing emergency assistance, including food and water, to residents living in isolated villages.The missing include two French firefighters whose vehicle was carried away by a torrent when a road collapsed south of the village of Saint-Martin-Vesubie. Authorities fear more victims as many families couldn’t reach out to relatives due to cellphone service being down.French Prime Minister Jean Castex, who flew over the area in a helicopter, expressed “grave concern” over the toll of the flooding.About 10,500 homes were left without electricity on Sunday, French energy company Enedis said.In Italy, the body of one person reported missing on Saturday — a French citizen of Italian origin — was found in the Roia River, the ANSA and LaPresse news agencies reported. The second one washed up closer to where the Roia empties into the Mediterranean along Italy’s border with France.An Italian firefighter was killed on Saturday during a rescue operation in the mountainous northern region of Val d’Aosta. A search team also found a body in the Piedmont region’s Vercelli province, where a man had been swept away by floodwaters.Italian firefighters also rescued 25 people trapped on the French side of a high mountain pass due to the flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-italy-search-for-missing-victims-after-deadly-floods/story-YjEnPZv0wJnPCiNv61oOMK.html
04-10-2020||World||Azerbaijan’s No. 2 city targeted in fighting with Armenia||The fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces continued on Sunday over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, with Azerbaijan’s second-largest city coming under attack.Azerbaijani officials said Sunday that Armenian forces attacked Ganja, the country’s second largest city. Hikmet Hajiyev, an aide to the Azerbaijani president, tweeted a video depicting damaged buildings, and called it the result of “Armenia’s massive missile attacks against dense residential areas” in Ganja.It wasn’t immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the video. Hajiyev said in another tweet that attacks on Ganja and other areas in Azerbaijan were launched “from territory of Armenia.”Armenia’s Defense Ministry said that “no fire of any kind is being opened from the territory of Armenia in Azerbaijan’s direction.” But Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, confirmed on Facebook he ordered “rocket attacks to neutralize military objects” in Ganja. His spokesman, Vahram Poghosyan, said the territory’s army destroyed a military airport in Ganja, a claim Azerbaijani officials denied.The attack on the city killed one civilian and left four others wounded, the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry tweeted. Harutyunyan said he ordered his forces to stop the attacks on Ganja to avoid civilian casualties. Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader added that “proportionate and crushing” strikes targeting the opponent’s forces would continue, if Azerbaijan fails “to draw appropriate lessons.”The fighting, which broke out on Sept. 27 and has continued for eight straight days, is the biggest escalation in years in the decades-long dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. The region lies within Azerbaijan, but is controlled by local ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia. Both sides said the hostilities have spread beyond the breakaway territory and accused each other of attacking areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh.Ganja, with a population of more than 330,000, is located roughly 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) north of Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital.“Opening fire on the territory of Azerbaijan from the territory of Armenia is clearly provocative and expands the zone of hostilities,” Azerbaijani Defense Minister Zakir Hasanov said in a statement Sunday.As the fighting resumed Sunday morning, Armenian officials accused Azerbaijan of carrying out strikes on Stepanakert and targeting the civilian population there. Nagorno-Karabakh’s leader Harutyunyan said that in response, his forces would target “military facilities permanently located in major cities of Azerbaijan.”In a statement issued later on Sunday, Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry rejected accusations of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.Nagorno-Karabakh officials have said nearly 200 servicemen on their side have died so far. Azerbaijani authorities haven’t given details on their military casualties, but said 22 civilians were killed and 74 others were wounded.Nagorno-Karabakh was a designated autonomous region within Azerbaijan during the Soviet era. It claimed independence from Azerbaijan in 1991, about three months before the Soviet Union’s collapse. A full-scale war that broke out in 1992 killed an estimated 30,000 people.By the time the war ended in 1994, Armenian forces not only held Nagorno-Karabakh itself but substantial areas outside the territory’s formal borders, including Madagiz, the village Azerbaijan claimed to have taken on Saturday along with several others.This week’s fighting has prompted calls for a cease-fire from around the world. On Thursday, leaders of Russia, France and the United States — co-chairs of the so-called Minsk Group, which was set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1992 to resolve the conflict — issued a joint statement calling for an immediate cease-fire and “resuming substantive negotiations ... under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs.”Azerbaijani President Ilkham Aliyev said that Armenia’s withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh is the sole condition to end the fighting.Armenian officials allege that Turkey is involved in the conflict and is sending fighters from Syria to the region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said earlier this week that “a cease-fire can be established only if Turkey is removed from the South Caucasus.”Ankara has denied sending arms or foreign fighters, while publicly siding with Azerbaijan in the dispute.On Sunday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry condemned the attack on Ganja, saying it was proof of Armenia’s disregard for the law. Ankara accused Armenia of attacking civilian residential areas, and claimed that Armenia could commit crimes against humanity.“Armenia is the biggest barrier to peace and stability in the region,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijan-s-no-2-city-targeted-in-fighting-with-armenia/story-KA0SJTmceezLHQUjjhuXyH.html
04-10-2020||World||Azerbaijan says Armenia attacks city, threatens retaliation||Azerbaijan said on Sunday that Armenian forces had fired rockets at its second city of Ganja, killing one civilian and wounding four, and threatened to retaliate by destroying military targets inside Armenia.The developments marked a sharp escalation of the war in the South Caucasus that broke out one week ago.Until now, the main fighting has been between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, but it now threatens to spill over into a direct war with Armenia itself.“Azerbaijan will destroy military targets directly inside Armenia from which shelling of its population centres is taking place,” presidential aide Hikmet Hajiyev said.He said there were also civilian casualties in another Azeri region, Beylagan, which borders Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia denied it had directed fire “of any kind” towards Azerbaijan. The leader of Nagorno-Karabakh said his forces had targeted a military airbase in Ganja but later stopped firing in order to avoid civilian casualties.The conflict threatens to drag in other regional powers as Azerbaijan is supported by Turkey, while Armenia has a defence pact with Russia.Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said: “The attacks of Armenia targeting the civilians in Ganja...are a new manifestation of Armenia’s unlawful attitude. We condemn these attacks.”FIGHTING SPREADSAzerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said on Twitter his forces had captured the town of Jabrail and several villages in what, if confirmed, would be a significant advance on the southern edge of Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyandismissed the claim as “yet another fabrication”. Independent verification was not possible.Nagorno-Karabakh reported deaths and casualties among civilians in Stepanakert and Shushi as a result of Azeri shelling.The fighting that broke out one week ago between Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces has intensified in the past two days and spread far beyond the breakaway Karabakh region.Ganja, with a population of 335,000, is about 100 km (60 miles) north of the Karabakh capital Stepanakert and 80 km from the Armenian city of Vardenis.Azerbaijan has previously accused Armenia of firing into its territory from Vardenis, and Yerevan has denied it. Armenia says two civilians were killed in and near Vardenis last week by cross-border fire from Azerbaijan.Armenia says Azerbaijan has used the airport in Ganja as a base for its warplanes to carry out bombing raids on Nagorno-Karabakh.Nagorno-Karabakh leader Arayik Harutyunyan said his forces would target Azeri cities.“Permanent military units located in the large cities of Azerbaijan from now on become the targets of the defence army,” he said.HEAVY CASUALTIESCasualties from the past week’s fighting have run into the hundreds, although precise figures are impossible to obtain.Armenia said the Karabakh cities of Stepanakert and Martakert were under attack by Azerbaijan’s air force and from long-range missiles. Each side accused the other of targeting civilians.Ignoring appeals from Russia, the United States, France and the EU to call a ceasefire, the opposing sides have stepped up hostilities over the weekend, with an accompanying rise in aggressive rhetoric.Armenia said on Saturday it would use “all necessary means” to protect ethnic Armenians from attack by Azerbaijan, and its prime minster compared the struggle with a 20th century war against Ottoman Turkey.Azerbaijan said on Saturday its forces had captured a string of villages. Armenia acknowledged that ethnic Armenian fighters were under pressure in some places and said the situation on the ground was fluctuating.The clashes are the worst since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed. They have raised international concern about stability in the South Caucasus, where pipelines carry Azeri oil and gas to world markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijan-says-armenia-attacks-city-threatens-retaliation/story-XOly3a9eh6ep4aIkPgzkUM.html

He had a fever, and his oxygen level had dropped rapidly. Yet in typical style, this president was up and walking around.”White House officials including Meadows said on Friday that Trump was experiencing “mild symptoms” and continuing to work. He told Fox News however, that doctors from Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins recommended that Trump go to the hospital.“He’s made unbelievable improvements from yesterday morning when I know a number of us, the doctor and I, were very concerned,” Meadows said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-condition-had-been-worse-than-revealed-white-house/story-ScWXIWfkVkKKcLFdc6ImTP.html
04-10-2020||World||I was too fat, says UK PM Boris Johnson, as Covid cases surge||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday admitted he was “too fat” when he contracted the coronavirus in March and exhorted Britons to use the restrictions imposed by the pandemic to lose weight, as new cases continued to surge across the UK.The pandemic should be a “teachable moment” for the country, Johnson told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show ahead of the Conservative party’s annual conference, being held virtually this year.The UK recorded the highest daily rise of cases at 12,872 and 49 deaths by Saturday evening, but officials said a technical issue was responsible, having included infections not recorded earlier for the September 24-October 1 period.The opposition Labour kept up pressure on the government’s handling of the pandemic. Party leader Keir Starmer said: “I think they’ve lost control of the virus. And I don’t want to see death rates go up. Nobody does. But this is serial incompetence.”In the BBC interview, Johnson, who recovered from the virus after three days in the intensive care unit, dismissed as “drivel” claims that he was still suffering from the effects of coronavirus, known as “long Covid.”“It is balderdash and nonsense. I can tell you I’m fitter than several butchers’ dogs.”His government, Johnson said, was trying to achieve a balance between saving lives and protecting the economy, but cautioned that daily life would not return to normal until Christmas, perhaps even beyond.He said: “On the one hand we have the imperative to save life, it is a moral imperative to save life if we possibly can. On the other hand we have to keep our economy moving and our society going. That is the balance that we are trying to strike”.“If you ask me ‘do I think things can be significantly different by Christmas?’ Yes I do, and we’re working flat-out to achieve that. But be in no doubt that it is still very possible that there are bumpy, bumpy months ahead. This could be a very tough winter for all of us - we’ve got to face that fact”, he added.Alex Norris, shadow health minister, criticised the interview: “Boris Johnson had the chance to map out a serious strategy to improve public confidence in the government’s handling of this crisis. Instead he waffled and ducked every question. His serial incompetence is holding Britain back”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-too-fat-says-uk-pm-boris-johnson-as-covid-cases-surge/story-P4vbvxjsp4dpLqJ7pxXa2N.html
04-10-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson defends coronavirus strategy as infections soar||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday despite weeks of rising infections, but warned that the country faced a “bumpy” winter ahead.Britain has Europe’s highest coronavirus death toll, at more than 42,400, and Johnson’s Conservative government is facing criticism from all sides. Opponents say tougher social restrictions are needed to suppress a second wave of Covid-19 that is already sweeping the country. But many in Johnson’s right-of-center party argue that restrictions must be eased to save the battered economy.Johnson told the BBC the government had to strike a difficult balance and he couldn’t “take a course that could expose us to tens of thousands more deaths in very short order.”“It is a moral imperative to save lives ... but on the other hand, we have to keep our economy moving. That is the balance that we are trying to strike,” he said.Britain went into a national lockdown in March, with most businesses closed and all but essential travel barred. Restrictions began to be lifted in June as the pandemic tide receded. But like other European countries, daily new coronavirus infections began to rise again when pubs and restaurants reopened, children went back to school and students returned to university.The UK is now under national restrictions on socializing, including a 10 pm curfew for bars and restaurants, and groups limited to six, with areas of high infection facing stricter local measures, which Johnson and other ministers have sometimes struggled to explain clearly. Critics say months of mixed messages and changes of advice on everything from wearing masks to whether or not to work from home has left people confused and exhausted.A national test-and-trace program to find people who have been exposed to the virus has also had persistent problems, and is failing to reach more than a quarter of infected people’s contacts.Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, accused the government of “serial incompetence.”“The prime minister is governing in hindsight,” Starmer told the Observer newspaper. “So he charges forward, not recognizing the problem, has a car crash, looks in the rear mirror and says: ‘What’s all that about?’”Britain recorded 12,872 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, by far the highest daily total since the outbreak began, although the figure includes a backlog of previously unreported cases. The daily number can’t directly be compared to UK’s peak in April because many more tests are being performed now.The number of hospitalizations and deaths in Britain is also rising, but remains far below the U.K.’s springtime peak. Another 49 Covid-19 deaths were reported on Saturday, compared to almost 1,000 a day at the height of the outbreak.Johnson acknowledged that many people feel “fatigue” after months of restrictions and expressed hope that progress on vaccines and testing would “change the scientific equation” in the next few months, allowing a return to normality.But he warned “it’s going to continue to be bumpy through to Christmas. It may even be bumpy beyond.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-defends-coronavirus-strategy-as-infections-soar/story-AxPkG1X1PJQ7k7wMpr4dPN.html
04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump tempted fate long before Rose Garden coronavirus cluster||Ever since March, when much of the country went into lockdown to contain the coronavirus, Donald Trump has tempted fate -- ignoring his own administration’s advice on avoiding the virus, yet managing to avoid it all the same.There was a June rally inside a Tulsa arena, and a convention speech to 2,500 people on the South Lawn of the White House in August. Then came de facto political rallies, which gave way to full outdoor rallies, which gave way to indoor ones. All gathered Trump supporters, largely maskless, tightly packed together, and yet the president -- a habitual germophobe even before the pandemic -- always emerged unscathed.Also read: Trump campaign launches ‘Operation MAGA’ to keep momentum at ‘full speed’But they all paled next to last weekend’s celebratory introduction of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, where roughly 150 guests sat shoulder-to-shoulder in the White House Rose Garden. Senators and other Republican luminaries worked the crowd, shaking hands, hugging and air-kissing, leaning in for conversation. There were indoor gatherings, too. And barely a mask in sight.The triumphant event has turned into a public health nightmare. At least eight people who attended have since tested positive, including Trump himself, his wife, two Republican senators, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and the president of Notre Dame University, though it isn’t known where they contracted the virus.In the aftermath, the White House said it is performing contract tracing, but several attendees told Bloomberg News that they haven’t been contacted. Some guests are quarantining while others are not, in apparent contradiction of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.“If you had to invent a way to transmit this virus, that’s the environment you would invent,” said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “The only higher risk environment I can think of is the air in an ICU that is caring for lots of Covid patients.”The response mirrors Trump’s inconsistent approach to the pandemic: only selectively, and rarely, following the advice of his own health professionals. Trump, in a statement from Walter Reed hospital on Saturday, chalked up his diagnosis to fate and his desire to be seen leading the country.“I had no choice because I just didn’t want to stay in the White House,” he said. “I had to be out front, and this is America, this is the United States.”Trump has made downplaying the risk of the virus and getting the country back to work a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. Now voters will judge how that approach has paid off for both the country and Trump personally, just a month before Election Day.“We have a situation now where multiple people in the White House have Covid, as precautions were not being taken,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who is a former health commissioner of Baltimore.Also read: Donald Trump faces credibility crisis over Covid-19 health scare. Here’s whyTrump has often cited ubiquitous coronavirus testing within the White House as an excuse to not wear a mask. But testing is about detection, not prevention, Wen said.It’s not known how, when or from whom Trump contracted the coronavirus. He conducted nearly a full week of public events and fundraisers after Saturday’s Rose Garden ceremony, including one on Thursday at his golf course in New Jersey after learning a close aide, Hope Hicks, had contracted the virus.He was flown by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday after testing positive for the virus and exhibiting symptoms. His staff say he’ll spend at least three days there.The Barrett introduction has drawn criticism for what appears to be a flouting of CDC protocols. Images of the event show a relaxed crowd mingling freely -- some with masks, but many without.There was a giddy feel to the occasion, as guests gave fist bumps, posed for group pictures and shared hugs before and after Trump’s announcement. During his remarks, guests sat close together.“I was not happy there were a lot of people not wearing masks,” despite signs asking attendees to do so, said John Malcolm, a legal scholar with the Heritage Foundation who attended the event.Malcolm, who serves as director of the Meese Center for Legal & Judicial Studies, said he took a Covid test on Tuesday, which was negative. Malcolm said he has yet to hear from any White House officials following up on the spread of the virus at the event -- though he added he didn’t think that was necessary.“At this point anybody who attended the event is certainly on notice they ought to consider getting tested,” Malcolm said in a phone interview.Temperature checksWhite House guests were subject to temperature checks on their way in -- though the screening is not foolproof, since some infected individuals may not have symptoms and others do not develop fever. And most attendees only participated in the outdoors event, where the risk of spread through aerosolized droplets is believed to be reduced.No one was “being cavalier about Covid,” said Cleta Mitchell, a political law attorney and partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Foley & Lardner.“Most of the people in the audience, including me, were outdoors the entire time,” Mitchell said by email. “Temperatures were taken as we went through the entry points and masks were required. Once outside, masks were optional -- but we were outside.”But the outdoor event was bookended by gatherings inside the White House, attended by at least some of the participants later found to be infected. Some who attended these indoor events were tested, but it’s not clear how many. Barrett and her family visited with Trump, the first lady and other White House staff in the Oval Office before the Rose Garden celebration.And while the virus is generally spread less easily outside, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people stay six feet apart from people they don’t live with and wear masks in those situations. The CDC also cautions that a mask is “not a substitute for social distancing.” Both recommendations were widely disregarded.New Jersey eventConcerns have also been stoked by Trump’s Thursday afternoon roundtable with supporters and a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. He would test positive hours later.Organizers of the event sent a letter notifying attendees of the president and first lady’s positive test results. Health officials in the state have also begun attempting to reach participants. Likewise, organizers of the presidential debate in Cleveland on Tuesday have followed up with attendees.There are no signs the White House itself is mounting its own comprehensive contact-tracing effort, the practice of piecing together chains of potential exposures and identifying individuals who may have come into contact with infected people.Representatives of several people who were at other events with Trump in the past week, including Minnesota House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, said they have not been formally notified of their potential exposure nor contacted by investigators seeking to learn about their actions in recent days.The high-profile nature of these cases makes it likely people at recent events with Trump are already aware of their potential exposure. Contract-tracing efforts are often conducted by local health authorities as a way to help identify second- and third-order contacts that may have been near someone with an initial exposure -- from acquaintances to store clerks.Contract tracingTrump’s physician, Sean Conley, said Saturday the White House Medical Unit was conducting contact tracing in conjunction with the CDC and local and state heath departments. LaToya Foster, a spokeswoman for the mayor of Washington, said the White House would do any contact tracing.After his infection was made public early Friday, the White House scrambled to more closely follow some guidelines -- senior aides suddenly began wearing masks, for one. But others were still dismissed, such as quarantine recommendations for those who’ve come in contact with a confirmed case.On Friday, Trump’s campaign announced it would scrap all planned events involving the president, though some could be virtual. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany -- who wore a mask outside, but also came to work on Friday despite being exposed to both Trump and Hicks -- said officials were looking at ways for Trump to continue to speak to the American people.Trump’s campaign initiated a reset on Saturday, launching “Operation MAGA” in a bid to keep things moving in the absence of both Trump and campaign manager Bill Stepien, who also has the disease.Trump now faces the prospect of scrapping his signature rallies, a staple of both of his campaigns. Meanwhile, voting has already begun across much of the U.S., with polls showing Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden nationally and in key swing states.In different times, voters have rallied around wounded presidents, as they did with Ronald Reagan after he survived an assassination attempt in 1981, or cheered on leaders in times of national crisis, as they did for George W. Bush after the September 11 terror attacks.Trump’s own insistence on ignoring public health measures many Americans observed every day, like masks and social distancing, could diminish that reservoir of sympathy. His presidency has been so polarizing that there’s little clear precedent for how his illness might affect American sentiment. Polls already show Americans strongly disapprove of his handling of the pandemic.“Presidents in trouble always experience a temporary bump in the numbers, said Craig Shirley, a presidential historian and biographer of Ronald Reagan. “It’s just the basic decency of the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tempted-fate-long-before-rose-garden-coronavirus-cluster/story-pF0uJBTAjTvGKV3qIaaEyJ.html

The missile strike killed one civilian and injured four others in a densely populated area of the city and did not hit an air base, the Azeri government in Baku said.Nagorno-Karabakh said it attacked the military airport in Ganca in retaliation for Azerbaijan’s bombing of Stepanakert, the enclave’s biggest city. Arayik Harutyunyan, the disputed territory’s president, warned that its forces are now targeting military sites in large cities of Azerbaijan.Azeri Defense Minister Zakir Hasanov described the attack as an “open provocation” by Armenia that “expands the theater of conflict.”Harutyunyan, the enclave’s leader, was injured in a retaliatory precision strike on his bunker, Aliyev’s foreign policy aide Hikmet Hajiyev said. The Nagorno-Karabakh leader’s spokesman denied he suffered any injuries. It wasn’t possible to confirm the information independently.Azerbaijan’s Aliyev, backed by Turkey, has vowed to continue the military campaign until Armenian forces leave Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts that Azerbaijan lost in a war after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. The violence that began a week ago is more intense and widespread than at any time since Russia brokered a 1994 cease-fire to halt that war, which killed about 30,000 people and displaced more than a million.The latest confrontation adds to tensions between Russia and Turkey over proxy conflicts in Syria and Libya. Russia has an army base in Armenia, and the two nations have a mutual-defense pact, though it doesn’t cover Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia and Azerbaijan on Saturday set seemingly impossible terms for agreeing to cease-fire calls from the U.S., France and Russia.German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday spoke to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and expressed concern about the clashes and increasing number of victims, a German government spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. Merkel stressed that all sides must immediately stop fighting and start negotiations, according to the statement.Pashinyan called on the German government to take a clear stance, in an interview with Bild magazine. Asked if Berlin should publicly declare who started the current hostilities over Nagorno-Karabakh, he replied: “Yes. And Germany should evaluate the involvement of terrorists and mercenaries recruited in Syria in this conflict in the region by Turkey.”Azeri forces captured eight villages in the northeast and southeast of Nagorno-Karabkh, after earlier taking control of seven other small localities, the defense ministry in Baku said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-escalate-as-armenian-backed-forces-say-they-hit-base-in-azeri-city/story-xbykzYiwzGCXgZKU4KCZeN.html

He’s got the best possible care... He just needs, I mean, the most important thing to do is to follow his doctors’ advice, he’s got superb medical advice,” Johnson said during an interview on BBC television.Johnson tested positive for Covid-19 in late March and was hospitalised for a week, including three nights in intensive care.

04-10-2020||World||Covid-19 positive Donald Trump ‘not yet out of the woods’, says White House||US President Donald Trump posted a video Saturday from the hospital where he is battling Covid-19, saying he was improving and would be “back soon” -- but acknowledged that the crucial coming days would be “the real test.”“I came here, wasn’t feeling so well. I feel much better now,” Trump, 74, said from his business suite at the Walter Reed military medical center near Washington.“We’re working hard to get me all the way back... I think I’ll be back soon and I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started.”Appearing relaxed in an open-collar shirt and blue suit jacket, Trump acknowledged there was uncertainty about the course of the disease, which can hit recovering patients hard with no warning.“I’m starting to feel good. You don’t know over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test, so we’ll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days.”Trump’s wife also tested positive but he said her symptoms were not as bad as his own.“Melania is really handling it very nicely. As you’ve probably read, she’s slightly younger than me, just a little tiny bit,” he joked about the 50-year-old first lady.Late Saturday, White House doctor Sean Conley said Trump was “not yet out of the woods,” but that the medical team is “cautiously optimistic.”White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump’s condition had them worried on Friday, but that he had since improved.“Yesterday morning, we were real concerned... he had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly,” Meadows told Fox News late Saturday.Meadows said there was never a risk Trump would have to hand over power to Vice President Mike Pence, after a day of conflicting reports and confusion over the leader’s actual fitness.“He’s made unbelievable improvements from yesterday morning, when I know a number of us, the doctor and I, were very concerned,” Meadows said.His comments echoed remarks by Conley, who said Trump had “made substantial progress since diagnosis, and remained “fever-free and off supplemental oxygen.”Trump had completed a second dose of therapeutic drug remdesivir and had spent “most of the afternoon conducting business,” Conley added.Conley was evasive when asked earlier whether the president had received supplementary oxygen at any point since falling ill, only confirming that he hadn’t received any at the hospital or on Thursday -- the day of his positive test.Several US media outlets said Trump was on oxygen at the White House on Friday before being admitted to Walter Reed.- ‘White House cluster -Conley added to the confusion by suggesting that Trump had been diagnosed on Wednesday -- not on Thursday, per the official account -- but he later said he had misspoken. Soon after Trump arrived at the hospital, Conley said in a memo the president was starting a course of remdesivir and had received an eight-gram dose of an experimental antibody cocktail.Neither Trump’s doctors nor the White House explained why the president was taking unproven drugs if his progress was satisfactory.Trump’s optimism over his recovery prospects has been tempered by news that more people close to the president have tested positive for the coronavirus.They included campaign advisor Chris Christie, who was among several aides that helped Trump prepare for the first presidential debate who have since announced positive tests.Christie and a number of senators and Trump aides are also among a growing list from the president’s orbit to have tested positive after attending an event in the White House Rose Garden last weekend.The so-called “White House cluster” includes the president’s wife Melania, close confidante Hope Hicks, former White House top aide Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager Bill Stepien and Republican senators Thom Tillis and Mike Lee.Another close aide, Nicholas Luna, one of the “body men” who accompanies the president round the clock, had also tested positive, CNN reported.Heightening the sense of crisis at the heart of power in America, a third Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced on Saturday that he had tested positive.- ‘False sense of comfort’ -Public health experts have expressed alarm at the outbreak linked to the September 26 celebration of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court.“They relied too much on diagnostic testing. We know that these tests have a very high false negative rate,” said Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists.“By simply relying on these diagnostics to determine who gets to come in and out of the White House, and by not requiring other protections, like social distancing and masks, they created a false sense of comfort for the White House.”Democrats have called for Barrett’s Senate confirmation hearings to be postponed after several Republican senators tested positive, but judiciary committee chair Senator Lindsey Graham said they would go ahead.Trump -- who is well behind his 77-year-old Democratic election rival Joe Biden in the polls -- has been forced to freeze or rework much of his campaign ahead of a potentially messy vote on November 3.Biden has made Trump’s frequent downplaying of the Covid-19 crisis and mixed messaging on mask-wearing a central campaign theme.The former vice president, who stood on a stage with Trump for 90 minutes during their ill-tempered first debate Tuesday, announced that he and his wife Jill tested negative Friday.Biden reminded voters during the debate that he has pushed consistently for a serious approach to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 208,000 Americans, unlike his opponent who has mocked the Democrat for his rigorous use of masks.bur-acb/bfm/mtp/tomTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-positive-donald-trump-not-yet-out-of-the-woods-says-white-house/story-1H57CAw8NWknzB1DQVqTrO.html
04-10-2020||World||Pope Francis rejects ‘trickle down theory, says market capitalism has failed in pandemic||Pope Francis says the coronavirus pandemic has proven that the “magic theories” of market capitalism have failed and that the world needs a new type of politics that promotes dialogue and solidarity and rejects war at all costs.Francis on Sunday laid out his vision for a post-COVID world by uniting the core elements of his social teachings into a new encyclical, “Fratelli Tutti” (Brothers All), which was released on the feast day of his namesake, the peace-loving St. Francis of Assisi.The document draws its inspiration from the teachings of St. Francis and the pope’s previous preaching on the injustices of the global economy and its destruction of the planet and pairs them with his call for greater human fraternity and solidarity to address those issues.In it, Francis rejected even the Catholic Church’s own doctrine justifying war as a means of legitimate defense, saying it had been too broadly applied over the centuries and was no longer viable.“It is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a ‘just war,’” Francis wrote in the most controversial new element of the encyclical.Francis had started writing the encyclical, the third of his pontificate, before the coronavirus struck and upended everything from the global economy to every day life. He said the pandemic, however, had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the pandemic.“Aside from the differing ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident,” Francis wrote. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.”He cited the grave loss of millions of jobs as a result of the pandemic as evidence of the need for politicians to listen to popular movements, unions and marginalized groups and to craft more just social and economic policies.“The fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not everything can be resolved by market freedom,” he wrote. “It is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at ‘promoting an economy that favours productive diversity and business creativity’ and makes it possible for jobs to be created, and not cut.”He denounced populist politics that seek to demonize and isolate, and called for a “culture of encounter” that promotes dialogue, solidarity and a sincere effort at working for the common good.As an outgrowth of that, Francis repeated his criticism of the “perverse” global economic system, which he said consistently keeps the poor on the margins while enriching the few. Francis rejected the concept of an absolute right to property for individuals, stressing instead the “social purpose” and common good that must come from sharing Earth’s resources.Francis once again rejected “trickle-down” economic theory as he did in the first major mission statement of his papacy, the 2013 Evangelii Gaudium, (The Joy of the Gospel), saying it simply doesn’t achieve what it claims to.“Neo-liberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to magic theories of ‘spillover’ or ‘trickle’ — without using the name — as the only solution to societal problems,” he wrote. “There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged ‘spillover’ does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society.”The title of the encyclical had sparked controversy in the English-speaking world, with critics noting that a straight translation of the word “fratelli” (brothers) excludes women. The Vatican has insisted that the plural form of the word “fratelli” is gender-inclusive and that the document by its very nature is inclusive of women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-rejects-trickle-down-theory-says-market-capitalism-has-failed-in-pandemic/story-7WXnWw69QdjQfOJY6zKLMO.html
04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump faces credibility crisis over Covid-19 health scare. Here’s why||One month from Election Day, President Donald Trump is facing a credibility crisis as yawning as his health crisis, at a moment when he needs the public’s trust the most.The president’s coronavirus infection, as well as the illnesses of several aides and allies, has imperiled the highest levels of the US government. The White House’s efforts Saturday to project calm backfired in stunning fashion, resulting in a blizzard of confusing and contradictory information about the health and well-being of the commander in chief.It’s a moment months in the making, the collision of Trump’s repeated defiance of his own administration’s guidelines for staying safe during the pandemic and his well-known disregard for facts. The result: deep uncertainty for Americans over who and what to believe about the health of the nation’s leader at a perilous moment in US history.“This is bigger than Donald Trump. It’s about the institution of the presidency,” said Robert Gibbs, who served as President Barack Obama’s first White House press secretary.For any president, credibility in a crisis is paramount — the ability to rally Americans of every political persuasion around a commonly accepted understanding of the situation. For a president on the brink of an election, particularly one held in as tumultuous a year as 2020, it could be the difference between serving one term or two.Yet Trump has squandered widespread credibility from the very start of his presidency, spending his first full day in office disputing official tallies of the crowd size at his inauguration and asking Americans to disregard photographic evidence showing that he drew fewer people to the National Mall in Washington than his predecessor.The episode set the tone for the rest of his administration, with Trump creating alternate realities around issues big and small, amplified by the help of friendly media outlets. He frequently touts records and milestones that don’t exist. He spreads baseless rumors about his political opponents, including declaring without evidence that Joe Biden, his Democratic rival in the 2020 presidential campaign, might be on drugs in their debate.Yet Trump’s credibility has come under even greater scrutiny during the pandemic, the single biggest test of his presidency. He’s repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus in public, despite telling journalist Bob Woodward privately in February that Covid-19 was more deadly than the flu. He’s floated unverified and harmful treatments, including suggesting Americans could inoculate themselves by injecting bleach.In April, just weeks after the pandemic took hold in the US, only 23% of Americans said they had high levels of trust in the information the president was providing the public about the virus, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.As Election Day draws near, Trump has increasingly flouted public health guidelines and many of the scientists advising his administration, eager to make the case to voters that the worst of the pandemic that upended nearly every aspect of American life is behind them.For weeks, Trump has been traveling across the country holding large rallies and hosting events at the White House without social distancing or requiring guests to wear masks. That includes a crowded ceremony in the Rose Garden last weekend to announce the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Several attendees, including two US senators and first lady Melania Trump, have since announced they have tested positive for coronavirus.They, and the president himself, are now among the more than 7 million Americans who have been infected. More than 205,000 Americans have died.It’s not clear how Trump became infected. He announced on Twitter at 1 am Friday that he and Mrs. Trump had tested positive for the virus; the following afternoon, he was transported via the presidential helicopter to a military hospital just outside of Washington. The only details the White House provided were that the hospitalization was precautionary and that Trump’s symptoms were mild.On Saturday, the White House tried to fill in the details with a televised briefing by Trump’s physician, who painted a sunny picture of the president’s situation, emphasizing that he was still working, walking on his own and not laboring to breath. But Dr. Sean Conley notably refused to provide some specific details, including repeatedly sidestepping questions about whether the president had at any point required oxygen.Shortly after, and off camera, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows gave journalists a more troubling depiction. The president’s situation had been “very concerning,” and though his health was improving, Meadows said the next 48 hours would be critical. A person familiar with the president’s treatment also confirmed that he had required supplemental oxygen Friday morning.The conflicting information sparked an outcry, even among some Trump allies who privately wondered how the president’s team could have been so unprepared for the first major disclosures about his condition. The White House tried to quell the frustrations on Saturday night, releasing a four-minute video of Trump saying his condition was improving and that he was looking forward to resuming campaign activities soon.But to those who have grown weary of Trump’s record on transparency and the truth, there was little hope that the coming days would bring a greater level of clarity.“These are the patterns of this presidency, and for Trump, the patterns of a lifetime,” said Peter Wehner, a Republican who served in President George W. Bush’s administrations and a Trump critic. “There’s no reason to believe he or his inner circle are going to change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-credibility-crisis-over-covid-19-health-scare-here-s-why/story-jat4RXScPUiTrvONKrumWL.html
04-10-2020||World||Pilgrims return to Mecca as Saudi eases coronavirus restrictions||A very small, limited number of people donning the white terrycloth garment symbolic of the Muslim pilgrimage circled Islam’s holiest site in Mecca on Sunday after Saudi Arabia lifted coronavirus restrictions that had been in place for months.The kingdom had taken the rare step of suspending the smaller “umrah” pilgrimage that draws millions year-round from across the world in early March as the coronavirus morphed into a global pandemic and prompted countries to impose lockdowns and curfews to slow down transmission.But as nations begin to ease those restrictions, the Saudi government on Sunday started allowing a maximum of 6,000 pilgrims a day to enter the sprawling Grand Mosque in Mecca. Only Saudi citizens and residents will be permitted to enter the mosque during this first phase of reopening, and each person has up to three hours to complete the pilgrimage.The Grand Mosque, which is being sterilized and cleaned multiple times a day, houses the cube-shaped Kaaba that observant Muslims pray toward five times a day.Before visitors can enter the mosque to pray or perform the umrah, they have to apply and reserve a specific time and date through an online application to avoid crowding and maintain social distancing. Visitors can also select via the app their means of transportation and meeting points.State TV showed on Sunday what appeared to be fewer than 50 people circling the Kaaba at the same time and walking several meters (feet) apart. Typically, the mosque would be packed with worshippers from around the world crowded shoulder-to-shoulder at all times of the day and night.The second phase for loosening restrictions at the Grand Mosque comes into effect on Oct. 18, allowing a maximum of 15,000 pilgrims and 40,000 for prayer from among residents and citizens based on allocated times via the app.Muslim travelers from outside Saudi Arabia could be allowed to perform the umrah pilgrimage as early as Nov. 1, the Interior Ministry has said. Saudi Arabia recently began easing some restrictions on international flights for the first time since March.The kingdom held a dramatically downsized, symbolic hajj pilgrimage in July due to concerns that it could easily have become a global super-spreader event for the virus. Pilgrims were selected after applying through an online portal and all were residents or citizens of Saudi Arabia. Rather than the more than 2 million pilgrims the kingdom hosts for the annual event, as little as 1,000 took part after being tested for the virus and quarantined.Despite taking early and sweeping measures to contain the virus, Saudi Arabia has recorded nearly 336,000 cases, including 4,850 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilgrims-return-to-mecca-as-saudi-eases-coronavirus-restrictions/story-7Aim2nkAhUzVs3NN2SGWNM.html
04-10-2020||World||Researchers develop new Covid-19 test that doesn’t use scarce reagents||Scientists have developed a new method of testing for Covid-19 that doesn’t make use of key reagents but still delivers an accurate result, an advance that may lead to an inexpensive diagnosis technique in developing countries where chemical supplies are in short supply. The method, described in the journal PLOS Biology, omits the step in the widely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test where the scarce reagents are needed, but has an accuracy of 92 per cent, missing only the lowest viral loads. The researchers, including those from the University of Washington in the US, tested the new method using 215 Covid-19 samples that RT-PCR tests had shown were positive, with a range of viral loads, and 30 that were negative. They said it correctly identified 92 per cent of the positive samples and 100 per cent of the negatives. While the positive samples the new test failed to catch had very low levels of the virus, the scientists said ultra-sensitive tests that identify individuals with even the smallest viral loads may not be needed to slow the spread of the disease. “It was a very positive result,” said Jason Botten senior author of the study from the University of Vermont in the US. “You can go for the perfect test, or you can use the one that’s going to pick up the great majority of people and stop transmission,” Botten said. While standard PCR tests have three steps, the version developed by the researchers has only two, the study noted. “In step 1 of the RT-PCR test, you take the swab with the nasal sample, clip the end and place it in a vial of liquid, or medium. Any virus on the swab will transfer from the swab into the medium,” Botten said. “In step 2, you take a small sample of the virus-containing medium and use chemical reagents, the ones that are often in short supply, to extract the viral RNA. In step 3, you use other chemicals to greatly amplify any viral genetic material that might be there. If virus was present, you’ll get a positive signal,” he explained. In the new method, Botten said, a sample of the medium that held the nasal swab is taken directly to the third, amplification step, removing the need for scarce RNA extraction reagents as well as significantly reducing the time, labour and costs required to extract viral RNA from the medium in step 2. According to the researchers, the test is ideally suited to screening programs, in both developed and developing countries, since it is “inexpensive, takes much less processing time, and reliably identifies those who are likely to spread the disease.” Its low cost and efficiency could extend testing capacity to groups not currently being tested, including the asymptomatic, nursing home residents, essential workers and school children, Botten added. He said the standard RT-PCR test could be reserved for groups, like health care workers, where close to 100 per cent accuracy is essential.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-develop-new-covid-19-test-that-doesn-t-use-scarce-reagents/story-9Rw5iTQ8WLSvBQ7PAgTZ4I.html

Xi made the remarks in an exchange of congratulatory messages with his Bangladesh counterpart, Mohammad Abdul Hamid, on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the bilateral diplomatic relationship on Sunday. In his message, Xi hailed the steady and long-term friendship saying he is ready to work with Hamid to better align development strategies with Bangladesh, step up cooperation under the framework of the BRI and push forward the China-Bangladesh strategic, cooperative partnership to a new level, official media reported. With over USD 26 billion Chinese investments and USD 38 billion dollars funding commitments, Bangladesh is one of the largest recipients of China’s massive infrastructure project. China has also offered zero-tariff treatment to 97 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports by adding 5,161 more items to the existing list of 3,095 duty-free products. The BRI seeks to build rail, maritime and road links from Asia to Europe and Africa in a revival of ancient Silk Road trading routes. The issues related to BRI, earlier known as One Belt One Road (OBOR), has been a major bone of contention between India and China as one portion of the corridor passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Besides Pakistan, where China initiated over USD 60 billion as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China has stepped up its huge infrastructure investments in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives rising concerns of its growing influence in India’s immediate neighbourhood. The BRI is President Xi’s top priority initiative, which aims firm up China’s global influence. The initiative has, however, attracted allegations, especially from the US, of debt-diplomacy after Sri Lanka handed over its Hambantota Port to a state-run Chinese firm in 2017 for a 99 years’ lease in a debt swap amounting to USD 1.2 billion. Malaysia has also deferred several projects under the BRI, citing cost revaluation. Xi, in his message to Hamid, also said the two countries had worked jointly to fight against Covid-19. Earlier, China had sent medical team to Bangladesh to share its experience of handling coronavirus, which had emerged first in Wuhan in December last year. Bangladesh also is among over a dozen countries where the final phase of clinical trials of Chinese vaccine is being conducted. In his message, Hamid said the Bangladesh-China relationship is developing rapidly and has covered cooperation in key areas, to which Dhaka attached great importance, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. He expressed his deep appreciation for China’s continuous support for Bangladesh in its socio-economic development progress, adding that he believes the close and friendly relationship between the two countries will continue to deepen in the future. Also on Sunday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang exchanged congratulatory messages with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Li said in his message that China is willing to deepen practical cooperation with Bangladesh in various fields and promote the steady and sustainable development of the China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of cooperation to better benefit the two countries and their people. For her part, Hasina said the strategic partnership of cooperation between Bangladesh and China has been developed from the two countries’ time-tested friendship and cooperation. The strengthened Bangladesh-China cooperation has unleashed enormous potential in maintaining peace, security and stability in the region and even around the world, Hasina said according to Xinhua News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-pitches-for-closer-ties-with-bangladesh-calls-for-joint-promotion-of-belt-road-initiative/story-dzPUORtMJx0vHcQQLYwYPJ.html
04-10-2020||World||Saudi Arabia resumes umrah in 4 phases. What you need to know||Saudi Arabia has allowed its citizens and other pilgrims to perform the annual umrah pilgrimage from Sunday, after a seven-month break due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).In March, the Saudi government decided to suspend the umrah pilgrimage over the fear of growing coronavirus infections. In July, it only allowed 1,000 pilgrims residing in the country for the pilgrimage due to the pandemic.Saudi Arabia hosts around 2.5 million pilgrims annually across the globe for Haj. So far, Saudi Arabia has recorded around 336,000 Covid-19 cases while 321,000 coronavirus disease patients have been recovered. There have been 4,850 deaths in the country.Here is all about the umrah pilgrimage:* Umrah is a year-round pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. It is a voluntary pilgrimage, unlike haj which is compulsory for every Muslim who is physically capable and can afford it.* Umrah is a shorter version of the annual haj pilgrimage which allows Muslims to seek refuge in Allah, ask for mercy and pray for their needs.* The Saudi Arabia government has decided to allow the pilgrimage in four phases considering the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.* Only 6,000 citizens and residents already within the kingdom will be allowed to take part each day, which is only 30% of the total capacity, in the first phase starting Sunday. They will be able to perform the ritual of circling the sacred Kaaba, a cubic structure inside the Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray.* The second phase will start from October 18 and will allow 15,000 pilgrims from the country.* In the third phase from November 1, pilgrims from inside and outside the kingdom will be allowed to perform umrah at 100% capacity with necessary precautionary measures. Saudi Arabia will only allow pilgrims from countries which are free from Covid-19 danger by the time.* During the fourth phase, the government will allow 100% of the total capacity of the pilgrimage from inside and outside Saudi Arabia to perform umrah. The decision on this phase will be taken when the competent authority decides that the risks of the pandemic are over.* Saudi Arabia’s ministry of hajj and umrah will launch an application with the aim to regulate the entry of pilgrims and implement health standards and controls approved by the ministry of health and competent authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-resumes-umrah-in-4-phases-what-you-need-to-know/story-BfFZykUdrk3E0T9C9mShXK.html

Unlike India where extremists are in Govt, people of Pak never allowed extremists to lead or mainstream politics,” Chaudhry tweeted.Pakistani Muslim League (N) chief and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal were among the attendees of a virtual meeting of PDM during which Rehman was elevated as head of the alliance aimed to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan.The PDM had announced at its All Parties Conference in September that it plans to launch its protest campaign from Quetta, Balochistan in October. The choice of Quetta may have to do with the popularity that Fazlur Rehman’s party enjoys there. Analysts also say that the party’s street power is immense.In 2019, JUI supporters held a sit-in at Islamabad for several weeks which was called off after army intervention and assurances. The PDM also plans a similar sit-in if its demands are not met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamist-party-chief-s-elevation-as-joint-oppn-movement-s-leader-raises-eyebrows-in-pakistan/story-z2fCkZ9KI9GJyzrV8PDovI.html
04-10-2020||World||Eye on China, Canada formulates new Indo-Pacific policy||Canada is formulating a fresh Indo-Pacific policy that will not only reflect its recent rift with China but may be more in consonance with the objectives of India in the region.The indication of this potential switch came as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to his newly-appointed Japanese counterpart Suga Yoshihide. A readout of the conversation used language that has become central to that applied by the Quad nations- India, Japan, Australia and the United States - as it said they wanted the two nations to “promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”That free-and-open formulation, known as FOIP, has been used as shorthand for containment of an increasingly aggressive China in the region. That symbolic phrasing comes as Canada is looking at issuing a new Indo-Pacific policy in the weeks ahead. According to a report in the Toronto Star recently, Global Affairs Canada has been working on the revised policy since November last year. The daily, National Post, stated Canada is “getting set to launch a new tougher approach to dealing with Beijing” and has been in the making since the appointment of François-Philippe Champagne as Foreign Minister in 2019.Indian officials did not comment on this matter but pointed to an increase in official communication between New Delhi and Ottawa in recent times, including discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trudeau.The Trudeau administration may also be acting to reflect public mood in Canada, which has turned largely against China. According to a poll in late June from the Angus Reid Institute (ARI), 81% of respondents “feel that they should boycott goods made in China to send a message”, while 91% considered the state of affairs between the two nations “serious”. Similarly, 93% felt that “China cannot be trusted to uphold human rights.”Significantly, a Canadian warship sailed from the South China Sea into the Taiwan Strait this week in a move that could rile Beijing as China has become more belligerent in the area.Relations between Ottawa and Beijing have nosedived since the arrest of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei in Vancouver in late 2018. Meng Wanzhou continues to face trial that could lead to her extradition to the US. In retaliation, China arrested two Canadians, including a former diplomat, actions the Canadian government described as “hostage diplomacy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-on-china-canada-formulates-new-indo-pacific-policy/story-r84Wr4uqJcBN5QM2StDBxK.html
04-10-2020||World||Egypt reveals 59 ancient coffins found near Saqqara pyramids||Egypt’s tourism and antiquities minster said on Saturday archaeologists have unearthed dozens of ancient coffins in a vast necropolis south of Cairo.Khalid el-Anany said at least 59 sealed sarcophagi, with mummies inside most of them, were found that had been buried in three wells more than 2,600 years ago.“I consider this is the beginning of a big discovery,” el-Anany said, adding that there is an unknown number of coffins that have yet to be unearthed in the same area.He spoke at a news conference at the famed Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara where the coffins were found. The sarcophagi have been displayed and one of them was opened before reporters to show the mummy inside. Several foreign diplomats attended the announcement ceremony.The Saqqara plateau hosts at least 11 pyramids, including the Step Pyramid, along with hundreds of tombs of ancient officials and other sites that range from the 1st Dynasty (2920 B.C.-2770 B.C.) to the Coptic period (395-642).Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said initial studies show that the decorated coffins were made for priests, top officials and elites from the Pharaonic Late Period (664-525 B.C.).He said archaeologists also found a total of 28 statuettes of Ptah-Soker the main god of the Saqqara necropolis, and a beautifully carved 35 cm tall bronze statuette of god Nefertum, inlaid with precious stones. The name of its owner, Priest Badi-Amun, is written on its base, he said.Egyptian antiquities officials had announced the discovery of the first batch coffins last month, when archaeologists found 13 of the containers in a newly discovered 11 meter-deep (36 feet) well.The Saqqara site is part of the necropolis of Egypt’s ancient capital of Memphis that includes the famed Giza Pyramids, as well as smaller pyramids at Abu Sir, Dahshur and Abu Ruwaysh. The ruins of Memphis were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1970s.El-Anany said the Saqqara coffins would join 30 ancient wooden coffins that were discovered in October in the southern city of Luxor, and will be showcased at the new Grand Egyptian Museum, which Egypt is building near the Giza Pyramids.The Saqqara discovery is the latest in a series of archeological finds that Egypt has sought to publicize in an effort to revive its key tourism sector, which was badly hit by the turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising. The sector was also dealt a further blow this year by the global coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-reveals-59-ancient-coffins-found-near-saqqara-pyramids/story-D8sBMH656Xq55BUom2AQ2N.html
04-10-2020||World||Trump campaign launches ‘Operation MAGA’ to keep momentum at ‘full speed’||With Donald Trump in the hospital, his campaign has launched ‘Operation MAGA’, which it describes as “a full marshalling of top-level surrogates, campaign coalitions and Trump supporters” to rally behind the president until he can return to the trail.‘Operation MAGA’, which is the acronym for ‘Make America Great Again’, will see Vice President Mike Pence and members of the First Family making in-person campaign appearances in key battleground states.President Trump is currently undergoing treatment for coronavirus at Walter Reed Medical Centre in Bethesda. Trump, 74, and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, a development that upended the Republican leader’s election campaign just weeks before the presidential polls on November 3.“Vice President Mike Pence, the First Family, our coalitions and our grassroots supporters will be out in full force to show the real enthusiasm behind the president’s re-election and to show we’re working as hard as he always does,” Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien, who also tested positive for the virus on Friday, said in the press release on Saturday. “Operation MAGA is a full marshalling of top-level surrogates, campaign coalitions and Trump supporters to rally behind the president and carry the campaign forward until he returns to the trail,” he said, announcing the launch of the initiative. Trump’s election rallies in recent weeks had been attracting thousands of his supporters who came to listen to him ignoring the cautions of health care professionals like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. “Operation MAGA will fire up the entire MAGA universe to keep President Trump’s campaign at full speed until our Commander-in-Chief returns to the campaign trail,” Stepien said. Pence will make in-person campaign appearances in key states, as will First Family members Donald J Trump Jr, Eric Trump and his wife Lara. The campaign will host virtual events until the vice presidential debate on October 7, when the in-person events will commence, the Trump campaign said. Pence will begin a swing through key states following Wednesday’s vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. He will travel to Arizona, before voting early in Indiana and heading to other events. Members of the First Family will host live events in battleground states beginning after Wednesday as well. The campaign will also deploy its coalitions, including Women for Trump, Black Voices for Trump, Latinos for Trump and others for events in key states. All the previously announced campaign events involving Trump’s participation have either been moved to virtual formats or are being temporarily postponed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-launches-operation-maga-to-keep-momentum-at-full-speed/story-9B4zlsYHqr1C0zVa7yxjKO.html
04-10-2020||World||Mecca to reopen today after 7-month pause for coronavirus||Saudi Arabia will reopen the Muslim holy places for the year-round umrah pilgrimage on Sunday with extensive health precautions, seven months after coronavirus disease (Covid-19) prompted its suspension.The umrah usually attracts millions of Muslims from across the world each year.It will be revived in three stages, with the initial phase seeing just 6,000 citizens and residents already within the kingdom allowed to take part each day.“In the first stage, the umrah will be performed meticulously and within a specified period of time,” Hajj Minister Mohammad Benten told state television last week, according to news agency Agence-France-Presse.Benten said pilgrims will be divided into groups to ensure social distancing within the Grand Mosque in Mecca.Worshippers will on Sunday be able to perform the ritual of circling the sacred Kaaba -- a cubic structure inside the Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray -- along socially distanced paths.On October 18, the number of pilgrims will be increased to 15,000 per day, with a maximum of 40,000 people allowed to perform prayers at the mosque.Visitors from abroad will be permitted from November 1 when the capacity will be increased to 20,000 pilgrims, with 60,000 people allowed to enter the mosque.The decision to resume the pilgrimage was in response to the aspirations of Muslims home and abroad to perform the ritual and visit the holy sites, the interior ministry had said last month.The ministry added that the umrah would be allowed to return to full capacity once the threat of the coronavirus pandemic has subsided.Until then, the health ministry will vet countries from which pilgrims are allowed to enter based on the health risks.Those wishing to perform the umrah must apply through two mobile applications-- one to register they are free from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and another from which they can obtain a permit.

04-10-2020||World||Donald Trump presses for stimulus deal, saying ‘get it done’||President Donald Trump pressed for a deal on another round of pandemic aid to jolt the U.S. economic recovery, saying the country “wants and needs” fiscal stimulus.With Trump receiving treatment at Walter Reed military hospital outside Washington after testing positive for the coronavirus, his tweet on Saturday departed from his health to focus on weeks of partisan deadlock over another stimulus bill.US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that negotiations with the White House will press ahead and Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis might change the tenor of the talks by underscoring the seriousness of the pandemic.The two sides remain far apart on how much of a boost to provide and what it should target. Democrats in the House on Thursday passed a $2.2 trillion package -- down from the $3.4 trillion plan they passed in May -- as their latest offer. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has proposed a plan of about $1.6 trillion.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday that the talks have “speeded up in the last few days,” though he didn’t make a prediction about the eventual outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-presses-for-stimulus-deal-saying-get-it-done/story-1RNRRjDj9FtEAHGf60WZzI.html
04-10-2020||World||Of presidents and health, history replete with secrecy, lies||Throughout American history, an uncomfortable truth has been evident: Presidents have lied about their health.In some cases, the issues were minor, in others quite grave. And sometimes it took decades for the public to learn the truth.Now President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with the Covid-19 disease. The White House initially said he had “mild symptoms.” By Friday evening, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre. After a rosy press conference by the president’s medical team, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Saturday that Trump had gone through a “very concerning” period Friday and that the next 48 hours would be critical in terms of his care.Pandemics have cursed the presidencies of both Trump and Woodrow Wilson. Each played down the viruses that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. Both presidents got sick — and each had to decide how much to tell the public.Also Read: Donald Trump ‘not yet out of the woods,’ doctor says, but is ‘cautiously optimistic’Like many administrations before, Wilson’s White House tried to keep his sickness secret.He was at talks in Paris on ending World War I when he fell ill in April 1919. His symptoms were so severe and surfaced so suddenly that his personal physician, Cary Grayson, thought he had been poisoned. After a fitful night caring for Wilson, Grayson wrote a letter back to Washington to inform the White House that the president was very sick.Flash forward 100 years. In a tweet at 12:54 am Friday, Trump told the world that he and first lady Melania Trump had contracted Covid-19.The White House initially shared few details about his condition. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said he was taken to Walter Reed many hours later “out of an abundance of caution.” However sick he was or wasn’t, his Covid-19 was startling since Trump had been declaring almost daily that the nation had turned the corner on the disease, which has killed 208,000 people in the US.Also Read: Next 48 hours ‘critical’ for Donald Trump in fight against Covid-19, says official Trump has said he has played down the pandemic so as not to create panic, but there were political reasons for doing so. Seeking another four years in office, Trump did not want the US economy to tank before the November 3 election.“The Wilson administration, for a very different reason, completely downplayed the pandemic,” said John Barry, an adjunct professor in public health at Tulane University whose book “The Great Influenza” chronicles the 1918-19 pandemic that sickened Wilson and killed 675,000 Americans. William Howell, professor of American politics at the University of Chicago, wonders how transparent the White House will be about Trump’s case of Covid-19.“He has all kinds of incentives to signal strength and to get back into the mix. He’s going to want to,” Howell said, but added: “This is a president who’s been less than straightforward over the course of his presidency about all manner of factual issues. And so, is he to be believed is a good cause of real concern.” History is replete with examples of how presidents have kept the American public in the dark about their ailments and medical conditions.President Grover Cleveland, fearing poor health would be a political weakness, underwent secret oral surgery late at night in a private yacht in Long Island Sound. The cancerous lesion taken from his mouth was displayed in 2000 in an exhibit by the College of Physicians, a Philadelphia-based medical society.President Lyndon B Johnson secretly underwent surgery for removal of a skin lesion on his hand in 1967.After leading the nation through a decade of war and depression, Franklin D Roosevelt was diagnosed early in 1944 as suffering from high blood pressure, hypertensive heart disease, cardiac failure and acute bronchitis.The problems also betrayed an underlying arteriosclerosis - hardening of the arteries. Roosevelt was put on a low-salt diet and ordered to cut down on smoking. But with an election coming on, Roosevelt and the White House staff issued a statement saying the problem was far less serious.“The stories that he’s in bad health are understandable enough around election time, but they are not true,” his doctor told a reporter. Historians now believe his doctors concealed all the facts from their patient and the public.Roosevelt won reelection. Only months later, on April 12, 1945, he died of a stroke.According to historian Robert Dallek, President John F Kennedy suffered more pain and illness than most people knew and took as many as eight medications a day, including painkillers, stimulants, sleeping pills and hormones to keep him alive. As president, Kennedy was known for having a bad back, and since his death, biographers have pieced together details of other illnesses, including persistent digestive problems and Addison’s disease, a life-threatening lack of adrenal function. Kennedy went to great lengths to conceal his ailments, even denying to reporters that he had Addison’s disease.President Dwight D Eisenhower had a serious heart attack in 1955, while vacationing in Colorado. He was hospitalised for six weeks. Instead of advising Eisenhower not to run for a second term, his doctor recommended that more time in office would aid his recovery.In 1841, William Henry Harrison became ill with what doctors thought was pneumonia caused by cold weather during his inauguration, where he rode horseback sans topcoat. The White House did not tell the public that Harrison was sick. Harrison died just nine days after becoming ill and only one month after taking the oath of office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/of-presidents-and-health-history-replete-with-secrecy-lies/story-LCSgILwibz8bxpRJjGQIsJ.html
04-10-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson says he won’t be ‘blown off course’ by Covid-19 pandemic||Boris Johnson pledged to “unleash Britain’s potential” next year as he tries to regain momentum and calm unrest in the Conservative Party over his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The UK prime minister ordered his cabinet to bring forward fresh ideas for a Queen’s Speech marking the beginning of the next session of Parliament, expected in the spring. The agenda will include plans to spend money on schools and hospitals, crack down on serious violence, and bring in tougher sentences for animal cruelty, Johnson’s office said in a statement.“We were elected to get Brexit done and unleash Britain’s potential,” a spokesman for Johnson said in the statement. “The prime minister has been clear that we will not be blown off course in our plans to build back better and that’s just what our next Queen’s Speech will do.”The government’s announcement Sunday is timed to coincide with the second day of the annual Tory conference, which is taking place online this year because of Covid-19 -- robbing ministers of face-to-face meetings with members and the chance to quell dissent. The premier has faced criticism over lockdown measures and problems in the virus testing system, while some polls show his party trailing to Labour for the first time in several months.Tensions were further inflamed last week when Johnson apologized for getting his own Covid-19 rules wrong. The government has been trying to strike a balance between trying to contain the pandemic and keeping as much of the economy running as possible.Resurgent VirusBut coronavirus cases have surged in recent weeks and Johnson’s chief scientific officer has warned the pandemic is not under control. The UK reported 12,872 new cases in the latest daily data on Saturday -- almost double the number from Friday -- though the Department of Health said due to a technical error, cases not counted in previous days were added to the total.On Saturday at the Tory conference, ministers tried to shift the focus onto the government’s plans for Britain’s economic recovery. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab promised the UK would “bounce back stronger” but an overnight report in the Sunday Times suggested several hurdles remain -- Cineworld is drawing up plans to close all its sites in the UK, a move that would put as many as 5,500 jobs at risk.International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said new trade agreements will give companies suffering from “depressed domestic demand” a “bigger slice of the international pie.”Truss also said the government must prevent “predatory” company takeover bids from abroad “that don’t necessarily have Britain’s best interests at heart,” especially at a time when firms are undervalued during the pandemic -- though she declined to give an example.Airport SwabsChief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay said the government would not return to austerity as the country recovers from the pandemic, and said he expected an announcement in the coming days on Covid-19 testing at airports -- a key demand from the travel industry to try to boost flagging demand.House of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has written to cabinet ministers asking for “bold and ambitious bills.” The government must “make the most of the opportunities which will arise” when Britain leaves the European Union fully at the end of the year, he said in the government’s statement.Johnson’s office also confirmed the next Queen’s Speech will include a bill to repeal the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which would hand the power to choose the date of the next general election back to prime ministers, rather than Parliament. Johnson blames the act for the Brexit paralysis of 2019.On Sunday, Home Secretary Priti Patel will announce an overhaul of what she’ll call the country’s “fundamentally broken” asylum system.Patel will use a speech at the Tory conference to set out a “firm and fair” immigration approach, according to her office, after it emerged last week that ministers are examining whether to process asylum seekers in offshore holding centers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-says-he-won-t-be-blown-off-course-by-covid-19-pandemic/story-zEnTiVZ8OU5PqKGzPmM6PJ.html
04-10-2020||World||J&J CEO Gorsky says Covid shows need for global health security||There are lessons to be learned from the US government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky, who has steered the health-care behemoth as it pursues a vaccine to combat the disease.President Donald Trump contracting Covid-19 “demonstrates that we’re all vulnerable and we still all need to be very vigilant and diligent in the action we’re taking to prevent this virus from spreading any further,” Gorsky said on Friday in an interview on The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations on Bloomberg Television.When asked by Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder Rubenstein if the White House and U.S. health agencies should have approached the pandemic differently, Gorsky said, “almost all of us have underestimated the dramatic impact of this outbreak.”“But there are lessons to be learned,” Gorsky said. “Going forward, we’re going to understand much better that if we don’t have global public health security, we don’t have national security, we don’t have economic security and we will not have security of society.”The U.S. government needs to shift away from “a maniacal focus on efficiency and effectiveness in certain cases to one more of resiliency and sustainability, particularly for these kinds of situations,” Gorsky added.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson joined the short list of vaccine makers that have moved an experimental coronavirus shot into late-stage human studies in the U.S. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company has since begun dosing up to 60,000 volunteers, marking the first big trial of an Covid-19 inoculation that may work after just one shot.Gorsky said the 60,000-person objective was determined in conjunction with U.S. regulators in hopes that it would serve as “robust a clinical development program as possible” that would produce “the confidence we need to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our approach.”Other front-runners such as Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and AstraZeneca Plc in conjunction with the University of Oxford, are further along in late-stage trials targeting tens of thousands of healthy participants. Pfizer has said it could determine whether its shot is safe and effective based on preliminary data before the end of October, while Moderna is aiming for the end of November. Their studies, which launched earlier in the summer, are seeking to enroll fewer patients than J&J’s.Urgent QuestionGorsky, who has been leading the 150,000-person health-care conglomerate remotely by Zoom, joked that he’s asked “almost every 15 minutes” when a vaccine will be available.“We would expect by late this year, early next year, we should be in a position to begin reviews with regulatory authorities to see if our vaccine is in fact safe, effective, and something that could be considered for an emergency use authorization,” Gorsky said, reaffirming J&J’s previously-stated timeline.An emergency use authorization would likely allow a limited supply of shots to go to specific at-risk populations, like health-care and essential workers. More broadly, Americans should expect to have access to a Covid-19 vaccine in late 2020 or early 2021, Gorsky said, noting that depend on the results of the late-stage studies from various vaccine candidates.The pursuit of a vaccine has become a political topic, with some observers concerned that Trump’s eagerness to see a vaccine authorized before the election could run counter to the science.“This is an incredibly important time for the pharmaceutical industry,” Gorsky. “It’s absolutely critical during a time when unfortunately, everything becomes politicized, that we rely on data, we rely on science, we rely on well-established regulatory guidelines to guide all of our decisions on the development and actual utilization of these vaccines.”Gorsky, a graduate of U.S. Military Academy at West Point, has been at the helm of J&J for eight years. When asked by Rubenstein if he would consider taking on a role in the public sector, such as Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Health and Human Services, the 60-year-old Gorsky said: “I would always consider how to can you continue to serve other stakeholders, how can you continue to serve others, but I think I’ve got the best job in the world most days.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/j-j-ceo-gorsky-says-covid-shows-need-for-global-health-security/story-PKuS3MclX0K8BMVwfwtVFL.html

This will now be discussed further.”Earlier on Wednesday, Merkel had criticised China over recent developments in Hong Kong and other “dreadful and often horrible” human rights issues.Merkel had made the remarks on Wednesday while addressing the Bundestag, the German Parliament.“Looking at the development challenges for China, these targets really are ambitious and they should provide an inspiration for us in Europe as well, to live up to our promises,” she had said.Union special summit is where all heads of government have gathered to discuss China as a top item of the agenda, underlining Europe’s deepening sense of unease amid the US-China rivalry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-warns-china-to-open-up-or-risk-losing-access-to-eu-market-report/story-LAbZalvZvXwGKYiwDGKJlO.html

04-10-2020||World||Trump says he was not well, ready for ‘real test’ ahead||US President Donald Trump said in a new video released on Saturday that he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he was admitted to a military hospital after contracting Covid-19, but he felt “much better” and hoped to be back soon to complete this re-election campaign.Trump acknowledged, however, that the “real test” lies ahead, over the coming days. A top Trump administration official said the next 48 hours will be “critical in terms of his care,” adding, “we’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said in a new statement that Trump continued to do well, remained fever-free, needed no supplemental oxygen, worked in the afternoon and moved about the medial suite without difficulty. “While not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic,” he added.The president was put on supplemental oxygen on Friday after his oxygen levels dropped, which in part prompted the decision to airlift him to the Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, in the adjoining state of Maryland.Trump sought to portray his hospitalisation as a courageous decision. “I had no choice because I just didn’t want to stay in the White House,” Trump said in the video. “I was given that alternative. Stay in the White House, lock yourself in, don’t ever leave, do’t even go to the Oval Office. Just stay upstairs and enjoy it. Don’t see people, don’t talk to people and just be done with it.“I can’t do that, I had to be out front,” he added. “We have to confront problems. As a leader, you have to confront problems, there’s never been a great leader that would have done that.”Trump spoke of his administration’s efforts to help develop therapeutics and vaccines and mentioned he was on one of the therapeutics already. He received a single-dose shot of a cocktail of antibodies before his hospitalisation and has since started off on a five-day course of remdesivir.The president sounded eager to return to the campaign trail and said he hoped to be “back soon” and looked forward to “finishing up the campaign, the way it was started and the way we’ve been doing the kind of numbers that we’ve been doing”.Trump, in fact, was trailing his Democratic rival Joe Biden by a wide margin in national polls ahead of the November 3 presidential elections. He has failed to narrow the gap despite his best efforts to portray Biden as mentally unsuitable for the job, weak on law and order, and a “Trojan Horse” for the Democratic party’s progressives.With the president in hospital for now, his campaign on Saturday launched “Operation MAGA (short for Make American Great Again, the campaign slogan)”, a plan to carrying on without him. Vice-President Mike Pence will take the lead in in-person election events, but only after October 7, when he debates Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival.“Operation MAGA will fire up the entire MAGA universe to keep President Trump’s campaign at full speed until our Commander-in-Chief returns to the campaign trail,” Bill Stepien, Trump 2020 campaign manager, said in a statement. Stepien himself has tested positive and is working remotely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-was-not-well-ready-for-real-test-ahead/story-8VM3LcWZxfGOWs8ohIoDfJ.html

Congratulations to Maulana Fazlur Rehman Sb for being elected president of PDM. We hope the forum will continue with its struggle against the hybrid regime and for the strengthening of democracy with the same clarity as during its inception at All Parties Conference (APC),” Dawar tweeted.The leaders of 11 Pakistani opposition parties, prominent among which were the PPP, PML-N, Awami National Party, and JUI, at the conclusion of the APC on September 20 announced the formation of a joint platform, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).The PDM proposes to launch a mass protest campaign comprising public gatherings, political rallies, no-confidence motions, en masse resignations from assemblies and, finally, a long march in January that will culminate in a sit-in in Islamabad until their demands are met.As opposition parties in Pakistan have formed a new united front with an aim of restoring “genuine and undiluted” democracy in the country, a European think tank said the opposition parties will need to “stick together” if they really intend to “loosen the stranglehold that the military establishment has had over governance and indeed the economy”.“In the backdrop of these positive indications, the opposition will need to stick together if it really intends to loosen the stranglehold that the military establishment has had over governance and indeed the economy, of the country ever since its inception in 1947,” the European Foundation of South Asian Studies (EFSAS), said in a commentary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-fazlur-rehman-appointed-chief-for-newly-formed-pdm-alliance/story-cXtV0c0FsoOmwppY3f4cmO.html
04-10-2020||World||Covid-19 spreads on panel handling US Supreme Court nomination||Two Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising questions about the timing of Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett and whether additional senators may have been exposed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared the confirmation process was going “full steam ahead.”North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Utah Sen. Mike Lee both said Friday that they had tested positive for the virus. Both had attended a ceremony for Barrett at the White House on Sept. 25 with President Donald Trump, who announced Friday that he had tested positive and was later hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.Lee, who did not wear a mask at the White House event, said he had “symptoms consistent with longtime allergies.” Tillis, who did wear a mask during the public portion of the event, said he had no symptoms. Both said they would quarantine for 10 days — ending just before Barrett’s confirmation hearings begin on Oct. 12.The positive tests come as Senate Republicans are pushing to quickly confirm Barrett in the few weeks they have before the Nov. 3 election. There is little cushion in the schedule set out by Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and McConnell, who want to put a third Trump nominee on the court immediately in case they lose any of their power in the election.Democrats, many of whom have been critical of Barrett, seized on the virus announcements to call for a delay in the hearings.“We now have two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who have tested positive for COVID, and there may be more,” tweeted Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “I wish my colleagues well. It is irresponsible and dangerous to move forward with a hearing, and there is absolutely no good reason to do so.”Several other members of the Judiciary panel attended the White House ceremony, including Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo. Blackburn said she tested negative after the event. Crapo said he “recently” had a negative test and a spokeswoman said he would be getting another one as soon as it could be arranged. A spokeswoman for Hawley said he was being tested Saturday, and the senator tweeted later that his coronavirus test came back negative.Sasse tested negative, but said in a statement that he would work remotely from his home state and undergo further testing due to his “close interaction with multiple infected individuals,” his office said. He said he planned to to return to Washington in time for the confirmation hearing.Graham was not at the White House on Saturday but sees Trump frequently. He said Friday that he had taken a test after interacting with Lee and it was negative. A spokeswoman for another GOP member of the committee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said Saturday that he had also interacted with Lee and had also tested negative. Still, Cruz’s office said he is remaining at home until the hearings out of an abundance of caution.Confirmation hearings for Barrett, who would replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, are scheduled to last for four days. McConnell on Saturday announced that he would seek to delay floor action for the next two weeks but that the hearings would proceed. At an event in Kentucky on Friday, he said he thought remote hearings could work if some senators couldn’t attend.Graham also suggested the possibility of remote hearings, saying on Twitter that “any senator who wants to participate virtually will be allowed to do so.” In a statement Saturday, Graham said there would be “no change” in the hearings even if Senate floor votes were delayed. It is not unusual for committees to meet when there is no action on the floor.Senators cannot vote virtually, however, so Republicans would need a full slate of committee members to approve the nomination shortly after the hearings and all of their senators on the floor for a final confirmation vote, which they hope will happen the last week of October.After interacting with Sen. Lee, in consultation with the attending physician, Sen. Cruz is remaining at home out of an abundance of caution. He feels healthy, hasn’t exhibited any COVID-19 symptoms, and has tested negative. In accordance with medical advice he will return to the Senate for the Supreme Court nomination hearings.”Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., also announced Saturday that he tested positive for the virus and would not return until he was cleared by his doctor. He is not on the Judiciary panel, but his presence would likely be needed for a floor vote.Tillis is in a competitive reelection race against Democrat Cal Cunningham, and the two debated Thursday evening. On Twitter, Cunningham said he wished Tillis a quick recovery and said he would also get tested.Barrett, who was with Trump and many others on Saturday and met with Lee, Tillis and other members of the Judiciary panel this week, tested negative, the White House said Friday. It was confirmed that she had a mild case of COVID earlier this year and has now recovered.Trump, who has consistently downplayed the virus and often discouraged the use of masks, was flown to Walter Reed on Friday evening after experiencing symptoms.The president tweeted Saturday that he was “feeling well,” though White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the next 48 hours would be critical in terms of his care.___Associated Press writers Matthew Daly in Washington and Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spreads-on-panel-handling-us-supreme-court-nomination/story-aGFrtHhXdZJ9m5BU46GeeL.html

France’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 606,625.Forty-nine more people have died over the past 24 hours due to complications from the infection, raising the country’s Covid-19 death toll to 32,198, the agency said.The previous record of 16,096 new cases on a single day was set on September 24.Tougher social distancing measures have been introduced in several French cities over recent weeks, including Marseille and Lyon, in an attempt to curb the country’s second wave of Covid-19.On Thursday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran warned that additional measures, such as the closure of bars, could also be imposed in Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-france-breaks-single-day-record-with-16-972-new-cases/story-ygsHxeXle0bccN4zF38k8N.html
04-10-2020||World||Next 48 hours ‘critical’ for Donald Trump in fight against Covid-19: Official||President Donald Trump went through a “very concerning” period Friday and faces a “critical” next two days in his fight against Covid-19 at a military hospital, his chief of staff said Saturday — in contrast to a rosier assessment moments earlier by Trump doctors, who took pains not to reveal the president had received supplemental oxygen at the White House before his hospital admission.Trump offered his own assessment Saturday evening in a video from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to “be back soon.”Also Read: ‘A leader has to confront these challenges’, says Trump in new videoHours earlier, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, “We’re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.”The changing, and at times contradictory, accounts created a credibility crisis for the White House at a crucial moment, with the president’s health and the nation’s leadership on the line. With Trump expected to remain hospitalized several more days and the presidential election looming, his condition is being anxiously watched by Americans.Moreover, the president’s health represents a national security issue of paramount importance not only to the functions of the US government but to countries around the world, friendly and otherwise.Also Read: Confusion, uncertainty as US President Donald Trump undergoes Covid-19 treatmentSaturday’s briefing by Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley and other doctors raised more questions than it answered. Conley repeatedly refused to say whether the president ever needed supplemental oxygen, despite repeated questioning, and declined to share key details including how high a fever Trump had been running before it came back down to a normal range. Conley also revealed that Trump had begun exhibiting “clinical indications” of Covid-19 on Thursday afternoon, earlier than previously known.Conley spent much of the briefing dodging reporters’ questions, as he was pressed for details.“Thursday no oxygen. None at this moment. And yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,” Conley said.Also Read: Covid-19 positive Donald Trump at military hospital; new cases among allies emergeBut according to a person familiar with Trump’s condition, Trump was administered oxygen at the White House on Friday morning, well before he was transported to the military hospital by helicopter that evening. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press only on condition of anonymity,Conley said that Trump’s symptoms, including a mild cough, nasal congestion and fatigue “are now resolving and improving,” and said the president had been fever-free for 24 hours. But Trump also is taking aspirin, which lowers body temperature and could mask or mitigate that symptom.“He’s in exceptionally good spirits,” said another doctor, Sean Dooley, who said Trump’s heart, kidney, and liver functions were normal and that he was not having trouble breathing or walking around.In the hospital video, Trump defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events in the midst of a pandemic.“I had no choice,” said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. “I had to be out front ... I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. ... As a leader, you have to confront problems.”Trump also thanked his medical team and hailed the state-of-the-art treatments he was receiving, comparing them to “miracles coming down from God.” Trump’s medical care is far superior to the average American’s, with around-the-clock attention and experimental treatments.Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide and killed more than 200,000 people in the U.S.Meadows himself had insisted Friday morning that Trump had only “mild symptoms” as the White House tried to project an image of normalcy. It was unclear whether Trump already had received oxygen when Meadows spoke.“President Trump remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms and has been working throughout the day,” press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said late in the day on Friday. She said Trump had only been sent to Walter Reed as a precaution.Trump’s administration has been less than transparent with the public throughout the pandemic, both about the president’s health and the virus’ spread inside the White House. The first word that a close aide to Trump had been infected came from the media, not the White House. And aides have repeatedly declined to share basic health information, including a full accounting of the president’s symptoms, what tests he’s undertaken and the results.In a memo released late Friday, Conley did report that Trump had been treated at the hospital with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, after sharing that he’d taking another experimental drug at the White House.Conley declined to say when Trump had last been tested before he was confirmed to have COVID-19 late Thursday. He initially suggested that Trump was 72 hours into the diagnosis — which would mean that he was confirmed infected Wednesday. Conley later clarified that Trump was administered an accurate test for the virus on Thursday afternoon, after White House aide Hope Hicks was confirmed to be positive and Trump exhibited “clinical indications” of the virus.The White House has said Trump was expected to stay at the hospital for “a few days” and would continue to work from its presidential suite, which is equipped to allow him to keep up his official duties. In addition to accessibility to tests and equipment, the decision to move to the hospital on Friday was made, at least in part, with the understanding that hurrying there later could send a worrying signal if he took a turn for the worse.On Saturday, Conley said Trump’s blood oxygen level was 96%, which is in the normal range. The two experimental drugs he has received, given through an IV, have shown some promise against COVID-19. On Friday, he was given a single dose of a drug Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. is testing to supply antibodies to help his immune system fight the virus.Friday night, he began a five-day course of remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug currently used for moderately and severely ill patients. The drugs work in different ways — the antibodies help the immune system rid the body of virus and remdesivir curbs the virus’ ability to multiply.“We’re maximizing all aspects of his care,” attacking the virus in multiple ways, Conley said. “I didn’t want to hold anything back if there was any possibility it would add value to his care.”He noted that in many cases, Covid-19 can become more dangerous as the body responds. “The first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10, are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness,” he said.At the same time, the White House has been working to trace a flurry of new infections of close Trump aides and allies. Attention is focused in particular on last Saturday’s White House event introducing Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. That day, Trump gathered more than 150 people in the Rose Garden, where they mingled, hugged and shook hands — overwhelmingly without masks. There were also several indoor receptions, where Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, her family, senators and others spent time in the close quarters of the White House, photographs show.Among those who attended and have now tested positive: former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers — Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. The president’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and the head of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, have also tested positive, though they were not at the event.Despite its failure to protect the president and senior staff from infection, the White House has given no indication that it intends to make any major protocol changes, such as mandating that everyone wears a mask.Meadows, the chief of staff, accompanied the president to the hospital aboard Marine One, the kind of small, enclosed space where experts say the virus easily spreads. Those aboard did wear masks.While Vice President Mike Pence is currently off the campaign trail preparing for the coming week’s vice presidential debate, he and his staff are operating under a “business as usual” approach. He’s still planning to travel to Arizona on Thursday, Indiana on Friday and Florida on Saturday for events instead of isolating himself after potential exposure and to protect himself from contracting the virus anywhere else.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/next-48-hours-critical-for-donald-trump-in-fight-against-covid-19-official/story-X2d49c5NMvVnGEsRcjLEpO.html

We are so proud of it.”The Trump campaign on Friday said that all campaign rallies have been put on hold as the President and the first Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday. He also said that the First Lady is doing well and handling the situation ‘very nicely’. Speaking of Melania Trump he said, “The First Lady is doing well. Melania asked me to say something... the respect she has for our country and love that she has for our country. We are both doing well.”‘She is slightly younger than me. Just a little tiny bit...

That included Kellyanne Conway, a former adviser to Trump, Bill Stepien, head of the Trump re-election campaign, and Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who helped Trump prepare for the first presidential debate against Democratic rival Joe Biden.But conflicting updates on Trump’s health triggered both confusion and concern. “At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made,” Conley said at Walter Reed, accompanied by the team of specialists and nurses looking after the American president. “Thursday, he had a mild cough and some nasal congestion and fatigue, all of which are now resolving and improving.”Shaw Dooley, a lead specialist on the team, said the US president was “in exceptionally good spirits” and had said: “I feel like I could walk out of here today.”A source familiar with the US president’s condition drew a slightly less optimistic picture of the situation. “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care,” the source told a White House pool of reporters in a background update, adding, “We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”Trump has been put on a five-day course of remdesivir at the hospital. He has also been administered a single 8-gram dose of a cocktail of antibodies against the coronavirus, which is an experimental drug that hasn’t yet been approved for use. Apart from that, he was given zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin. Trump was shifted to Walter Reed on Friday “out of an abundance of caution”, the White House had said earlier in the day.There has been some confusion over the timeline of events. Conley had seemed to be suggesting that Trump had tested positive for Covid-19 72 hours ago, which was Wednesday, the day after the first presidential debate. But then he addressed an election rally in Duluth, Minnesota that day and then attended a fundraiser at his golf resort in New Jersey on Thursday.The US president had announced on Friday morning that he and Melania had the virus. Later, Conley clarified that he had said 72 hours by mistake and the US president had tested positive on Thursday evening.Though Trump is off the campaign trail, his campaign is not, signalling the urgency of the situation with Election Day just a month away. “Do you regret repeatedly attacking President Trump in a Michigan speech on the same day he was diagnosed with Covid-19?” the Trump campaign posted as the “question of the day” for Biden on Saturday.But the campaign left out Biden’s concluding remarks: “I want to say god bless you, may god protect the first family and every family that is dealing with this virus, and may god protect our troops.” The Biden campaign has also pulled down its negative ads on Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/confusion-uncertainty-as-us-president-donald-trump-undergoes-covid-19-treatment-in-hospital/story-XcBGsZTsGIw0Gm3CMu9RBI.html

The main target of Khan’s ire is former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who the current PM claims is “following the agenda of India by maligning the armed forces of the country”.In an all-party conference in September, Sharif had launched a scathing attack on Khan, whom he termed a “selected PM”, and on “the people who placed Imran Khan in power” - a reference to the army high command.Sharif said the army leadership had created a “state above a state” in Pakistan and recounted numerous occasions when as PM his government had been undermined by the military.Khan has said that his government is working out a legal strategy to bring Sharif back from the UK. Notably, Pakistan has no extradition treaty with Britain. These efforts have repeatedly hit a wall. A local news channel reported that the Pakistan High Commission has made five attempts to have non-bailable warrants served on Sharif. But the British government said it doesn’t want to get involved in the tussle.Shahzad Akbar, adviser to the PM on interior and accountability, had said that he had written letters to British authorities seeking Sharif’s repatriation, adding that a formal application had also been sent for his extradition. The adviser was of the view that though there was no extradition treaty between Pakistan and the UK, people who are wanted could be handed over to each other under special arrangements.Also, Khan has launched his own attack, telling the media that Sharif and India wanted to weaken Pakistan. Criticising Sharif’s comments targeting the army, Khan claimed that this was being done to appease India. “Nawaz Sharif is toeing India’s narrative,” said PM Khan.Khan said that those who were enemies of the armed forces were enemies of Pakistan, calling on the whole nation to stay united. He said the government will defend its institutions and asked his party officials to defend the army and other state institutions on television talk shows.In a related development, the country’s broadcast media regulator PEMRA has prohibited TV news channels from broadcasting interviews and public addresses by “proclaimed offenders and absconders”. The controversial order will prevent TV channels from airing interviews and speeches by Sharif.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-calls-on-party-members-to-foil-opposition-alliance-s-moves/story-ZrMQURngFIyLQ7jTuYcKtO.html
