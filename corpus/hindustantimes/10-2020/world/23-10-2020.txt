He said that while 21 out of 27 action items now stand cleared, the remaining six are rated as partially complete.Instead of the current action plan, discussions remained focused on how Pakistan can be facilitated “for our upcoming 2nd evaluation, due mid next year,” Azhar tweeted.Local media quoted a statement by FATF saying it “takes note of the significant progress made on a number of action plan items and to date, Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has now largely addressed 21 of the 27 action items.” But it said that “As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021”.The statement added that Pakistan needed to “address its strategic deficiencies”. The deficiencies include demonstrating that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity, which target designated persons and entities, and those who act on the behalf or direction of the designated persons or entities. It also includes demonstrating that terror financing prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-doesn-t-get-off-fatf-greylist-told-it-needs-to-do-more-against-terror/story-TSp3NTTv0rVCmYj9uBeWCJ.htmlAlso included is the need for demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf. This means preventing the raising and moving of funds, including in relation to non-profit organisations, identifying and freezing assets and prohibiting access to funds and financial services.It also includes demonstrating enforcement against violation of terror financing sanctions, including in relation to NPOs, of administrative and criminal penalties and provincial and federal authorities cooperating on enforcement cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impressive-progress-claims-pak-minister-after-fatf-s-blunt-warning-on-terror-financing/story-L4IiiMpDTH6W653hFZvQTJ.html

As I said it in February and I’m repeating it today: This is not a drill.”Tedros said too many countries were now seeing an exponential increase in infections, “and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close or above capacity -- and we’re still only in October”.He said countries should take action to limit the spread of the virus quickly. Improving testing, tracing of contacts of those infected and isolation of those at risk of spreading the virus would enable countries to avoid mandatory lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-who-chief-tedros-says-countries-on-dangerous-track/story-nAxwOQ9VdLSQMLmqIUI3WI.html
23-10-2020||World||US suicide rate fell last year after decade of steady rise||The US suicide rate fell slightly last year, the first annual decline in more than a decade, according to new government data.It’s a small decrease and the data is preliminary, but the decline is “really exciting,” said Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.The fall may be partly due to years of suicide prevention efforts, like increasing mental health screenings, she said. Other factors, like the pre-pandemic economy, might also have played a role, she added.Experts aren’t sure how the coronavirus will influence this year’s suicide numbers, though American mortality overall is looking far bleaker.Suicides had been on the rise since 2005. In 2018, the national suicide rate hit its highest level since 1941 — 14.2 per 100,000 people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted new death rate data this week showing that for 2019, it dropped to 13.9.Drug overdoses rose in 2019, and deaths from falls were up, too. But death rates for the nation’s two biggest killers — heart disease and cancer — were down, as were death rates for flu, chronic lung disease and Alzheimer’s disease. The firearm death rate was flat, probably because the small decline in suicides was offset by a slight uptick in gun homicides.When all that is factored together, the U.S. life expectancy calculation for 2019 should stay the same as it was in 2018 or maybe even increase slightly, said Robert Anderson, who oversees death data for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.“I think 2019 will turn out to be a pretty good year for mortality, relatively speaking,” Anderson said. “2020 will not.” There have been at least 300,000 more deaths this year than expected, the CDC said this week in a separate report. About two-thirds of those are being attributed directly to Covid-19, but many of the others are believed to be related to the pandemic.It’s not yet clear whether suicides are up this year.The pandemic sparked a wave of business closures, some temporary and some permanent. Millions of people were forced to stay at home, many of them alone. Surveys suggest more Americans are reporting depression, anxiety and drug and alcohol use. Adding to that dangerous mix, firearm purchases rose 85% in March, when the virus was first surging.“There are clear forces pressing suicide risk factors in a negative direction,” Moutier said, but that’s doesn’t mean suicide rates will automatically rise.There are some “silver linings” to the pandemic, she added. One is increasing acceptance that mental health distress is normal, and that it’s OK to seek counseling. Another is increasing availability of telemedicine.Anderson noted many Covid-19 deaths have been in the same set of late-middle-aged white people who are considered at high risk for suicide.“It’s possible that the rise in Covid-19 is sort pushing down the suicide rate,” he suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-suicide-rate-fell-last-year-after-decade-of-steady-rise/story-ZTe0mdrqlbIrgCO1aWnXnO.html
23-10-2020||World||US faces half a million Covid-19 deaths by end-February: Study||More than a half million people in the United States could die from Covid-19 by the end of February next year, but around 130,000 of those lives could be saved if everybody were to wear masks, according to estimates from a modelling study.The estimates, from a study by researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, show that with few effective Covid-19 treatment options and no vaccines yet available, the US faces “a continued Covid-19 public health challenge through the winter.” “We are heading into a very substantial fall/winter surge,” said IHME director Chris Murray, who co-led the research.He said the projections, as well as the real-life current evidence of rising infection rates and deaths, showed there is no basis to “the idea that the pandemic is going away,” adding: “We do not believe that is true.”US President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 221,000 Americans so far, has become the top election issue for him and Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Polls have shown that Americans trust Biden more than Trump to handle the crisis.The IHME study forecast that large, populous states such as California, Texas and Florida will likely face particularly high levels of illness, deaths and demands on hospital resources.“We expect the surge to steadily grow across different states and at the national level, and to continue to increase as we head towards high levels of daily deaths in late December and in January,” Murray said.The modelling study, which mapped out various scenarios and their projected impact on the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States, found that universal mask-wearing could have a major impact on deaths rates, potentially saving 130,000 lives.Current mask use in the United States varies widely. While some states, like New York, set strict rules on when to wear masks, others have no requirements. The issue has become political, in which some supporters have taken their cues from Trump, who is often seen without a mask and has repeatedly questioned their usefulness.“Expanding mask use is one of the easy wins for the United States ... and can save many lives,” Murray said.He added that, just as right now in parts of Europe and in some local areas of high transmission in the US, many US states would need to re-introduce social distancing measures to curb the winter surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-faces-half-a-million-covid-19-deaths-by-end-february-study/story-ZNJ9LLRU2hanULjHFN2F8N.html
23-10-2020||World||Sudan to normalise ties with Israel, announces President Donald Trump days before US elections||Sudan on Friday agreed to be the latest Arab nation to recognize Israel in a diplomatic coup announced by President Donald Trump days before US elections.The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed an accord at the White House last month to normalise relations with Israel but Sudan carries added symbolism as an Arab nation that has been at war with Israel.Trump announced the agreement by Sudan’s year-old civilian-backed government moments after he formally moved to end the nation’s designation of a state sponsor of terrorism, which was a major goal for Khartoum.Reporters were escorted into the Oval Office where Trump was on speakerphone with Sudan’s leadership and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close ally of the embattled Republican president.“This truly changes the region. It changes the lives of our peoples for the better and allows us to focus on the task of building our nations, building our future,” Netanyahu was heard telling Trump.Trump said that more Arab states are also looking to recognize Israel including regional power Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s two holiest cities.“We have at least five more that want to come in and we’ll have many more than that soon,” Trump said in a room packed with aides, few of them wearing masks despite the Covid-19 pandemic.Until last month, the only Arab nations to recognize Israel were Jordan and Egypt -- neighbors of the Jewish state that had made peace after US mediation.- Economic boon for Sudan -Both the United States and Israel committed to boosting trade with Sudan, an impoverished, conflict-ridden nation that had faced years of criticism over its violent internal campaigns until the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir last year.In a three-way statement, Sudan and Israel said delegations would met “in the coming weeks to negotiate agreements of cooperation” including in agriculture issues, aviation and migration.“The leaders agreed to the normalization of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,” it said, without setting a date.As part of the deal to get off the terror blacklist, the White House said that Sudan’s transitional government had deposited $335 million to compensate survivors and family members of anti-US attacks that took place when Bashir’s regime welcomed Al-Qaeda.Sudan’s civilian prime minister, Abdulla Hamdok, thanked Trump over the terror designation without mentioning recognition of Israel -- a step he had earlier said he was not empowered to take.“This decision will open wide the door to Sudan’s deserved return to the international community and the international financial and banking sector, as well as to regional and international investment,” Hamdok’s office said in a statement that did not mention ties with Israel.But Sudanese TV later said Sudan had in fact agreed to end the state of war with Israel and normalize ties.Also on the telephone call was Sudan’s top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who met Netanyahu earlier this year in Uganda.- Historic step -Trump had announced his plan to delist Sudan on Monday through Twitter. But in the days before he formally took the move, Israel sent a delegation to Khartoum to discuss normalization.Trump, who is trailing in the polls ahead of the November 3 vote, has used his leverage over Sudan to press for recognition of Israel.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo voiced hope on Wednesday that Sudan would “promptly” recognize the Jewish state -- a major cause for Trump’s evangelical Christian base.Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates had long enjoyed quiet relations with Israel but a move by Sudan is especially significant in light of the nation’s history.Sudan played a small part in Arab-Israeli wars and, after Israel’s decisive victory in 1967, Khartoum was where the Arab League issued its famous “three no’s” -- no peace, no recognition and no negotiations with Israel.Sudan has been seeking for years to remove the designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, which severely impedes investment as few foreign businesses want to risk the wrath of US prosecution.With Trump’s formal move, Congress has 45 days in which it can pass a resolution to object to the delisting.Congress is not expected to block the delisting but it must also approve legislation to grant Sudan immunity from further claims.Until then, the $335 million will be held in an escrow account.The money includes compensation to survivors and family members of those killed in Al-Qaeda’s twin attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-to-normalize-ties-with-israel-announces-president-donald-trump-days-before-us-elections/story-R1DNWZdwPcYlyAoKKEutvK.html

The debate in Tennessee offered more substantive discussion of issues and was lighter on the types of sometimes intense personal clashes that dominated their first meeting in late September.Addressing reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump says his more straightforward performance “was a more popular way of doing it.” Trump says he wanted to play by the rules on Thursday although he liked his more aggressive tone in that first debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-donald-trump-says-final-debate-went-really-well/story-fk1cO1W5GMxGrbdW2HonXM.html

23-10-2020||World||Pakistan’s Covid-19 situation worsens, authorities say all parameters in the red||Authorities in Pakistan have said the coronavirus pandemic situation in the country has worsened with rising positivity rate, a spike in Covid-19 deaths and increasing hospital admissions, according to reports on Friday. Officials of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) made the comments two days after issuing a warning about the lockdown and calling for better compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to the coronavirus disease.According to Dawn, the forum said in a statement that the positivity ratio had risen for the fifth consecutive day -- average positivity rate is 40 per cent higher during the last four days -- and that Covid-19 deaths were also increasing.“It was also noted that Muzaffarabad, Hyderabad, Karachi and Gilgit-Baltistan have a higher positivity ratio along with other areas across the country,” Dawn said quoting the statement.The statement said hospital admissions are also on the increase particularly in Punjab and there is also an increase in the number of critical patients at hospitals. “The death ratio in Punjab was 1.6 on September 1 and has now gone up to six. Meanwhile, the province’s positivity ratio has increased from 0.92 to 1.33,” the statement said.An analysis of the fatality rate showed that Pakistan’s figure stood at 2.06% as compared to the global 2.72%. “[In Pakistan] Men account for 71pc of the total deaths. Of these, 76pc are over the age of 50,” NCOC said.According to data collected by Dawn.com, Punjab and Islamabad have reported more than 100 cases for the past four days. Punjab has also seen an increase in the number of deaths during the past few days.NCOC had warned on Wednesday that it would close down services across the country once again if people continued to flout SOPs issued to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. “NCOC is closely monitoring the situation. If there is no improvement in SOPs compliance observed, NCOC will have no choice but to revert to strict measures leading to re-closures of services,” NCOC had said in a statement that day.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan had said earlier in the week that he feared a second wave of Covid-19 in the coming months in cities where pollution levels are high. “I fear that in these two months — October and November [...] cities like Faisalabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Gujranwala where there is more pollution [...] there might be a second spike in coronavirus cases. The cases are rising gradually and we hope that they don’t increase quickly; we are monitoring it,” he told participants at an award ceremony.Pakistan has 324,744 cases of coronavirus disease and 6,692 people have succumbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-covid-19-situation-worsens-authorities-say-all-parameters-in-the-red/story-BveSaH4k5a4SGo2HaYVwEN.html

There is a communication blackout. How can we have talks in such an atmosphere?” He said that India needs to rethink its decision of removing the special status for Jammu and Kashmir.“Only then can we have talks,” he said adding that the Indian action has been rejected both by Pakistan and the people of Kashmir. “India’s stance on Kashmir has suffered because of its actions.”He told reporters that when Prime Minister Imran Khan assumed office, he had proposed talks but these were rejected by India. “Now given the situation in Kashmir, we cannot give talks priority.” India, he said, has to review its one-sided decisions.He also said India’s plans to “push Pakistan into the blacklist” of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will fail because of the steps the country had taken to meet the requirements of the global watchdog on money laundering and terrorist financing.His comments came as a plenery meeting of FATF on Friday voted to keep Pakistan in its ‘grey list’ of countries whose controls over terrorism financing are deemed inadequate.“I can say this with confidence, India will fail in its designs to push Pakistan into the blacklist,” Qureshi said, adding that the world had “acknowledged” that the government and parliament had taken “concrete steps” regarding the FATF’s action plan.Of the 27 points on which the FATF had asked Pakistan to take action, “I can say with conviction we have implemented 21,” the minister said. He added that progress had also been made on the remaining six points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-atmosphere-for-talks-with-india-says-pak-foreign-minister/story-hXiQtAkt8GUmjyiMrvyjWM.html
23-10-2020||World||US says no justification for Uighur ‘concentration camps’ in China||The deputy White House national security adviser on Friday denounced China’s treatment of Uighur Muslims, saying there was no justification for the country maintaining “concentration camps” within its borders.Matt Pottinger, who has been a leading figure in the development of President Donald Trump’s China policy, made the remark in Mandarin in an online address to the UK-based Policy Exchange think tank.“There is no credible justification I can find in Chinese philosophy, religion, or moral law for the concentration camps inside your borders,” Pottinger said in his speech, which he said was directed to the Chinese people.It represented a further ratcheting up of American rhetoric against China in the run-up to the Nov. 3 US presidential election, in which Trump, a Republican, has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, Pottinger’s boss, US national security adviser Robert O’Brien, said China was perpetrating “something close to” genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.Pottinger called on people in China “to research the truth about your government’s policy towards the Uighur people and other religious minorities.”He said they should ask themselves why The Economist newspaper had called China’s actions in Xinjiang “a crime against humanity.”The United States has denounced China’s treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses.It has not, though, so far termed Beijing’s actions genocide or crimes against humanity, designations that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang, and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.Pottinger said there was a growing consensus internationally about the need to take a more assertive stance with Beijing.He said that in a second term, Trump would continue working to diversify supply chains to avoid excessive reliance on one country - an apparent reference to China’s dominance of critical supplies laid bare at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.Pottinger spoke after China’s President Xi Jinping delivered a speech on the 70th anniversary of Chinese troops entering the Korean War to fight against US troops, in which he warned that China will never allow its sovereignty, security and development interests to be undermined.Xi did not directly refer to the present-day United States, with which relations have sunk to their lowest in decades over disputes ranging from trade and technology to human rights and the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-no-justification-for-uighur-concentration-camps-in-china/story-t3Pqe62PTXOSDYl0g99TTI.html

It also argues that it’s Ankara’s sovereign right to buy the system it wants.Erdogan also suggested a double standard, saying NATO member Greece was using its S-300 missile defense system. He asked: “Is America telling them anything?”Russia delivered the Russian defense system last year. Turkey had initially said the S-400 would be operational in April, but it has since delayed activating the system. Turkish media reported last week the military test-fired the Russian S-400 air defense system in the Black Sea province of Sinop.“This means that the gentlemen are disturbed especially because this is a weapon belonging to Russia,” Erdogan said. “We are determined, we will continue on our path.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-confirms-russian-s-400-tests-despite-us-objections/story-XaQBX8wpIpGC6D7ndZEihN.html
23-10-2020||World||20 Afghan army personnel killed in Taliban attack in Nimroz||At least 20 members of the Afghan National Army (ANA) were killed in a Taliban attack on their outpost in Khashrod district, Nimroz province, on Thursday said the district governor of Khashrod.According to Tolo News, the district governor said that six others were taken hostage by the Taliban. However, the official did not provide any details on the attack.There have been no comments made by the Defence Ministry, so far. The latest incident comes in wake of an increase in violence across the country despite the ongoing peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghanistan Government in Doha.On Thursday, the Ministry of Defence said that the Taliban terrorists have expanded their attacks to 24 provinces in the last 24 hours that include Takhar, Helmand, Uruzgan, Kunduz, Baghlan, Laghman, Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, Logar, Maidan Wardak, Kandahar, Zabul, Herat, Farah, Badghis, Faryab, Sar-e-Pul and Badakhshan provinces.The Defence Ministry said that on Wednesday night in Takhar province an Afghan Air Force strike killed “12 Taliban including several of their commanders,” as reported by Tolo News.It further reported that the airstrike was conducted in the “Hazara Qarluq” village of Baharak district, according to the statement adding that during a clash between “these Taliban” and the ANP on Monday, a “number of our police” were killed.At least four civilians were killed and 10 others were injured in a mortar attack in northern Faryab province on Thursday morning, local officials said.On Wednesday, the Taliban “destroyed” an electricity pylon that brings power to Herat province the office of Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) in Herat said. The incident took place in the Kalat-e-Ghazi village in Ghoryan district.The Takhar’s deputy police chief Raz Mohammad Doorandish and nearly 50 security force members were killed in clashes with the Taliban in the province on Tuesday night, the local officials said on Wednesday. “47 people (security forces members) were killed, and three or four others were wounded,” said Amir Mohammad Khaksar, an MP from Takhar, adding that “the casualties will increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-afghan-army-personnel-killed-in-taliban-attack-in-nimroz/story-BFzboBme1SQuFwNlXXI3vK.html
23-10-2020||World||FATF dashes Pak hopes of getting out of grey list, then a harsh rebuke||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the world’s top anti-terrorism monitoring group, on Friday voted to keep Pakistan on a grey list for the Imran Khan government’s failure to fully comply with a 27-point action plan handed to it, people familiar with the matter said.The global watchdog’s decision comes as a huge setback for PM Khan who had made efforts in the run-up to the virtual meeting of the FATF plenary to get his country off-the-hook including hiring a top lobbyist firm on Capitol Hill to push its narrative. The FATF, however, didn’t let Pakistan’s status change, mostly in view of Pakistan’s inability to substantially deliver on 6 of the 27 action points.The “grey list” comprises countries whose controls over terrorism financing are deemed inadequate.The FATF noted that Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has largely addressed 21 of the 27 action items. “As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021,” the watchdog said.A person familiar with the development said the watchdog had noted progress made by Pakistan to address the technical compliance deficiencies but rebuked Islamabad for slippages on other parameters and asked it to do more.India, which bears the brunt of Pakistan’s use of terrorism as an instrument of diplomacy, had set the tone ahead of Friday’s meeting, roasting Islamabad for continuing to be a safe haven for UN Security Council designated terrorists such as Jaish-e-Mohammed chief MasoodAzhar, Lashkar-e-Taiba operations commander Zakirur Rahman Lakhvi and Dawood Ibrahim.New Delhi had also counted 3,800 unprovoked ceasefire violations along the ceasefire line in an effort to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir, drop arms and smuggle weapons and narcotics across the international boundary using drones.Pakistan was placed on the watchdog’s grey list in June 2018 after red flags were raised over its consistent failure to act against terrorist groups and plug the gaping holes in its legal framework to punish them. It has since then periodically taken some steps to demonstrate that it is making efforts.But it has been criticised for rolling back the changes when it could. Like when it expanded the “proscribed persons data” in its Punjab province to include 7,600 names in 2018 to persuade FATF to not place Islamabad in the black list. This year, Castellum.AI, a US-based tech firm that tracks watch lists globally, noticed that Pakistan had quietly erased some 3,800 names from this list.PM Imran Khan’s inability to pull his country out of the grey list is also seen as a failure of its diplomacy since it needed the support of 12 countries to back up its narrative that Pakistan should be given a reprieve since it was on its way to fulfill its commitments to fight terror funding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-doesn-t-get-off-fatf-greylist-told-it-needs-to-do-more-against-terror/story-TSp3NTTv0rVCmYj9uBeWCJ.html
23-10-2020||World||Pak’s anti-corruption body slaps fresh graft case on Nawaz Sharif||Pakistan’s anti-corruption body has slapped a fresh corruption case on deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif, compounding the legal woes of the embattled Opposition leader who has frequently attacked the powerful military as well as the government. Sharif, the 70-year-old supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) who was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court on corruption charges, is currently in London for medical treatment. The National Accountability Bureau also approved cases against Sharif’s ex-personal secretary Fawad Hasan Fawad, former federal minister Ahsan Iqbal, former foreign secretary Aizaz Chaudhry and former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Aftab Sultan, Dawn newspaper reported. On Thursday, a total of 11 cases were approved at NAB’s Executive Board Meeting (EBM) presided over by its chairman, retired Justice Javed Iqbal. According to the NAB, a fresh case was approved against Sharif along with Chaudhry, Sultan and Fawad for “illegally” purchasing 73 high-security vehicles for the security of foreign dignitaries. They are accused of favouritism and illegal use of vehicles, causing a loss of over Rs 1,952 million to the national exchequer. The EBM also approved a case against Ahsan Iqbal and Mohammad Ahmed, contractor/owner of private firm Ahmed and Sons, for increasing the scope of the Sports City project in Narowal from Rs 30 million to Rs 3 billion by “abusing the authority”. They are accused of illegally providing the funds of the federal government to provincial government projects after the 18th Amendment by using personal influence, which inflicted huge losses on the national exchequer. The case against Iqbal was approved two days after he had said in a private TV talk show that the NAB had been investigating the Narowal Sports City case against him for the last two-and-a-half years but did not file a reference. Sharif is already facing several cases of corruption and misuse of authority which he has declared as a result of political vendetta by the current government led by Prime Minister Khan. The approval of fresh cases followed a recent speech by Prime Minister Khan that the Opposition would see a “different Imran Khan”, which was interpreted as a threat to arrest more opposition leaders and court cases. Apart from Sharif and his close aides, the NAB approved cases worth billions of rupees of alleged corruption against several officials and businessmen for causing losses to the country in different projects. Sharif criticised the military establishment in recent speeches at gatherings of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement. Days before the July 2018 general elections, Sharif was convicted in the Avenfield properties case and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His daughter Maryam was sentenced to seven years in prison for abetment and his son-in-law Captain (retd) Mohammad Safdar to one year.Also Read | Pakistan police briefly detain Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law In December 2018, anti-corruption court judge Arshad Malik convicted Sharif in Al-Azizia Steel Mills case and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Judge Malik was later dismissed from service over misconduct. The IHC later granted bail to Sharif, Maryam and Safdar. Sharif, after his conviction in the Al-Azizia case, was sent to jail but released for eight weeks on medical grounds. The bail-granting order lapsed while the former premier was in London. The IHC had in September fixed the appeals against conviction of Sharif in Al-Azizia and Avenfield cases. After hearing the pleas, the court rejected Sharif’s applications seeking hearing in absentia and issued his non-bailable arrest warrants. The court then issued his proclamation giving the former premier final opportunity to join the proceeding before confiscating his properties. Separately, an accountability court in Islamabad has already confiscated movable and immovable properties of Sharif because he absconded in the Toshakhana case, which is about alleged corruption in purchase of vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-s-anti-corruption-body-slaps-fresh-graft-case-on-nawaz-sharif/story-5JxGtCwBZVmB8WBsC8cMIP.html
23-10-2020||World||UK project detects Covid-19 traces in sewage||Traces of coronavirus have been detected in sewage in a UK government-led project, providing an early warning to health professionals for outbreaks in local areas or institutions across the country.The project’s results can provide local health professionals with a clearer picture of infection rates by identifying where there are high numbers, particularly for asymptomatic carriers and before people start showing symptoms, , officials said. The project has worked successfully in an area in south-west England, where sewage sampling data showed a spike in coronavirus material despite relatively low numbers of people seeking tests. The results alerted local health professionals and people warned of a spike.Testing has now been rolled out across more than 90 wastewater treatment sites in the UK, covering approximately 22% of the population in England, with plans to expand in the future, the officials added.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “This is a significant step forward in giving us a clearer idea of infection rates both nationally and locally, particularly in areas where there may be large numbers of people who aren’t showing any symptoms and therefore aren’t seeking tests.”In another project, officials said the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control identified coronavirus material in London sewage in February, before any cases were recorded in the area, providing further evidence of the effectiveness of wastewater monitoring to detect infection rates. High levels of virus material were detected in March and April followed by a considerable decrease in May and June, reflecting the impact of national lockdown measures on virus transmission.According to the World Health Organization, the likelihood of coronavirus being transmitted via sewage systems is extremely low or negligible, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-project-detects-covid-19-traces-in-sewage/story-Vn5kaL0h4OwumppeNG1w2K.html
23-10-2020||World||China not committed to curbing terrorism but using Pak as tool against India: Report||Pakistan appears to be counting on China to diplomatically shield Islamabad from accountability for its terror activities while Beijing’s desire is to use terrorism as a tool to counter India, according to Public Policy Researcher Michael Rubin.In an opinion piece for The Washington Examiner, Rubin said, “Beijing appears less committed to counterterrorism and more to a desire to use Pakistani terrorism as a tool to harass India with whom it is locked in a border clash in Ladakh.”“The reality of both great power competition and China’s efforts to undermine and replace the post-World War II liberal order is that they occur on a number of fronts. Increasingly, it appears the FATF is one of them. Rather than make substantial reforms, Pakistani officials appear to be counting on the fact that China will go to bat for them diplomatically and shield Pakistan from accountability,” he added.This statement comes ahead of the conclusion of the plenary meeting of FATF, which is expected to take a decision on Pakistan’s compliance of the action plan and whether it will remain in Grey List or Black List.The global money-laundering and terror-financing watchdog, is holding its plenary session from October 21 will decide the fate of Pakistan.Talking about the meeting (last month) between Chinese Envoy Yao Jing with Pakistan’s special adviser for finance, Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, Rubin said: “both the representatives reportedly talked far less about FATF commitments and more about the USD 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), whose success depends on Pakistan’s economic solvency and its escape from accountability to the FATF.”He further said China’s vote on Pakistan’s FATF status on Friday will show how Beijing subordinates the “liberal order” for its “narrow interests.”“...China’s action and the Friday vote on the question of Pakistan’s FATF status will be as much about countering terror finance as they are about whether China will use its membership in yet another international body to corrupt it beyond recognition, the goal being to subordinate the liberal order to Beijing’s narrow interests,” he said.Early this month, the FATF’s Asia Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering has kept Pakistan on “Enhanced Follow-up List” for its slow progress on the technical recommendations of the FATF to fight terror financing. Pakistan’s progress has remained unchanged -- non-compliant on four counts.The three-day plenary meeting will conclude on Friday. The country is in FATF’s grey-list since 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-not-committed-to-curbing-terrorism-but-using-pak-as-tool-against-india-report/story-JtD8ZlosyaR9krSTodIPUL.html
23-10-2020||World||Trump ‘pours fuel on racist fires’, says Biden as two presidential candidates spar over racism||Donald Trump is one of the “most racist presidents” in modern history, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said, as he tore into the current US President during the final presidential debate and accused him of pouring “fuel on every racist fire”.Biden and Trump clashed on race relations during the second presidential debate that was moderated by NBC’s Kristen Welker on Thursday night in Nashville, Tennessee.Former Vice President Biden termed Trump “one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history”, asserting that his Republican rival at his last debate did not condemn white supremacy and told an extremist group to “stand down and stand by.” Trump “pours fuel on every racist fire,” he added.The President portrayed himself as a champion of Black people and reiterated that he’s done more for Black Americans than anyPresident, except maybe former US President Abraham Lincoln.Trump accused Biden and former President Barack Obama of ignoring issues of racial justice.“You’ve done nothing but the crime bill which put tens of thousands of Black men in jail,” Trump told Biden.“I am the least racist person in this room,” Trump said, touting criminal justice reform and opportunity zone bills that he signed.Trump attacked Biden, over his support for a 1994 crime bill, saying the legislation “did such harm to the Black community.” Biden has called the law a mistake in the past, and he repeated that during the debate.“The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America,”Biden said.Trump said that Biden had four years as Vice President to combat racism but failed to do so.“You’re all talk and no action, Joe,” he said.Biden accused Trump of race baiting, saying that the president “has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.” Biden said during the presidential debate that he understood why people of colour fear that their children could be targeted by police because of the colour of their skin.“I never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over make sure she puts, for a traffic stop, put both hands on top of the wheel and don’t reach for the glove box because someone might shoot you,” he said.“But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or poor they are, has to teach their child when you’re walking down the street don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure you in fact if you get pulled over, yes, sir, no, sir, hands on top of the wheel, because you are in fact the victim whether you’re a person making USD 300,000 a year person or someone who’s on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America,” remarked Biden .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pours-fuel-on-racist-fires-says-biden-as-two-presidential-candidates-spar-over-racism/story-zAwNqJkAZzKQBs4CKZwHLM.html
23-10-2020||World||Donald Trump seizes on Joe Biden’s oil comment to warn swing state voters||President Donald Trump during Thursday’s debate seized on Joe Biden’s pledge of eventually replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, turning the Democratic nominee’s remarks into a warning for swing state voters that oil and gas jobs could be at risk.Biden’s comment came in response to a question from Trump during Thursday’s debate in Nashville about whether he would shut down the oil industry. The former vice president, in one of his starkest comments of the campaign on the issue, said “I would transition from the oil industry, yes.”“The oil industry pollutes significantly,” Biden said. “It has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.”That response carries risk for Biden heading into the final days of the race. For weeks, Biden has been wooing voters in Pennsylvania with assurances that his pledges to ban fracking are limited to federal land and would not amount to a wholesale destruction of the oil and gas sector. He plans to campaign there Saturday.Trump seized on Biden’s remark.“Basically what he is saying is he would destroy the oil industry,” Trump said. “Would you remember that Texas? Would you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma, Ohio?”Trump, meanwhile, sought to portray himself as an oil industry saviour, boasting about his efforts in the spring to broker a global crude output cut as the coronavirus pandemic collapsed fuel demand.“We saved our oil industry,” Trump boasted, and it’s “vibrant.”Trump was trying to recreate a moment in 2020 that he used to advantage in 2016, when Hillary Clinton said, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”Biden’s climate plan aims to remove greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. electricity generation by 2035 , a target that favours emission-free wind, solar, and nuclear power, while leaving little room for natural gas-fired power plants, unless they are outfitted with expensive carbon-capture technology.After the debate, Biden sought to downplay his on-stage comment, emphasizing that the fossil fuel industry wouldn’t “be gone” until 2050, and that oil workers are “not going to lose their jobs.” Instead, he stressed, his plan would mean “a lot more jobs are going to be created in other alternatives.”“But we’re not going to get rid of fossil fuels for a long time,” he told reporters as he prepared to depart Nashville.Two Democrats in toss-up races distanced themselves from the comments.Representative Kendra Horn, the incumbent in an Oklahoma swing district President Trump carried in 2016, and Xochitl Torres Small, who’s in a toss-up race in New Mexico, both took exception to what Biden said.“Here’s one of the places Biden and I disagree,” Horn wrote. “We must stand up for our oil and gas industry.”Environmentalists came to Biden’s defense.“We absolutely agree, we need a just and equitable managed decline of oil and gas production to achieve our climate goals,” said Rebecca Concepcion Apostol, national program director of Oil Change U.S. “We look forward to working with an eventual Biden administration to ensure we phase-out oil production in line with what the climate demands while centering the workers and communities impacted by that transition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-seizes-on-joe-biden-s-oil-comment-to-warn-swing-state-voters/story-LUKggad0VBKT9Yyuff5GeM.html
23-10-2020||World||Britain signs first major post-Brexit trade deal with Japan||Britain and Japan formally signed a trade agreement on Friday, marking the UK’s first big post-Brexit deal on trade, as it continues to struggle to agree on a deal with its closest trading partners in the European Union(EU). “How fitting it is to be in the land of the rising sun to welcome in the dawn of a new era of free trade,” British Trade Secretary Liz Truss told reporters after the signing ceremony in Tokyo. “This is the first new free trade deal to be agreed since the UK once again became an independent trading nation.”The signing comes after Truss and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi reached a broad agreement in September. Motegi pointed out that the signing came about in just four and a half months since the start of negotiations and said, “This is a manifestation of the determination of Japan and the United Kingdom to carry on vigorously promoting free trade”. Britain has said the deal meant 99% of its exports to Japan would be tariff free, and that it could increase trade by 15.2 billion pounds ($19.9 billion) in the long run, compared with 2018.The deal removes Britain’s tariffs on Japanese cars in stages to zero in 2026, which is the same as in the Japan-EU trade agreement.Motegi said after the signing that he had agreed with Truss to work together so that the deal will come into force on January 1, 2021. He also said Japan welcomes Britain’s interest in joining the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) free trade deal, and intends to provide necessary support.Japan is already a member of the CPTPP, which also links Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-signs-first-major-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-japan/story-lXxmA6OJPG0ZIy7se6vTrI.html

The club is located in the town of Palm Beach, which doesn’t have any early voting locations.Trump moved his residence to Florida a year ago from New York, citing his frustration with New York’s political leadership. He also hoped it would give him a boost in the critical battleground state. His path to another term in the White House is virtually non-existent without a repeat victory in Florida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-plans-to-vote-early-in-florida-on-saturday/story-bAe3PquOL23sYchSruUi7J.html
23-10-2020||World||Opposition fears of autocracy as Sri Lankan President gains more powers||Sri Lankan lawmakers approved amendments to the constitution that strengthened the powers of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and took away parliament’s role in making key appointments such as judges and the police chief.The new amendments were passed by parliament late on Thursday with a two-thirds majority after a raucous two-day debate.Rajapaksa, a former defence chief who oversaw the military defeat of Tamil separatists a decade ago, swept to power last November and has since consolidated control.In August, his party and its allies overwhelmingly won a parliamentary election on an election plank that included doing away with a previous constitutional amendment in 2015 that had put more power in the legislature’s hands.The government has argued that strengthening the president’s powers was required for better governance. Under the new law, Sri Lanka’s president will have the power to dissolve the 225-member legislature any time after it crosses the half-way mark of its five-year term.Opposition groups have criticised the amendments, and some wore red arm-bands in protest in parliament during the debate.Harsha de Silva, an opposition lawmaker from the capital city Colombo, said the Rajapaksa administration was pushing Sri Lanka in the direction of an autocracy. “I voted against (the bill) to protect democracy in Sri Lanka,” Silva said in a tweet.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based think-tank Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the amendments are meant to be temporary with a new constitution proposed within six months.But till a new constitution or further amendments are enacted, power will remain concentrated with Rajapaksa with limited checks and balances, he said.“It is extremely dangerous,” Saravanamuttu said.The influential Rajapaksa family has tightened its grip over Sri Lankan politics in recent years. After the August win, Gotabaya appointed his older brother Mahinda Rajapaksa - himself a former president - as prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opposition-fears-of-autocracy-as-sri-lankan-president-gains-more-powers/story-hJfcspUpgo0By5ZcLknb8M.html
23-10-2020||World||Joe Biden frames race as battle for character of US||Democrat Joe Biden is framing the election as a battle over the character of the nation, a reiteration of one of his major campaign themes.Speaking directly to the audience during Thursday night’s debate, Biden told them they’re familiar with both his and President Donald Trump’s character, their “reputations for honor” and “reputations for telling the truth.” He went on to declare that “our character is on the ballot.”His comments came in response to Trump’s declaration that he ran because Biden and President Barack Obama “did a poor job.”Trump responded that if his unfounded charges that Biden has received money from Russia and Ukraine are true, Biden himself is a “corrupt politician,” while Biden said the evidence for such allegations is a “Russian plant.”Trump immediately dismissed Biden’s charges, declaring, “You have to be kidding me. Here we go again with Russia.”Joe Biden and Donald Trump clashed on race relations, as the former Vice President called the current President “one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history.”Biden said Trump “pours fuel on every racist fire” and noted that at his last debate the president wouldn’t condemn white supremacy and told an extremist group to “stand down and stand by.”Trump portrayed himself as a champion of Black people. Repeating his standard line that no president other than Abraham Lincoln has done more for Black Americans, Trump accused Biden and former President Barack Obama of ignoring issues of racial justice.Trump told Biden: “You’ve done nothing but the crime bill which put tens of thousands of Black men in jail.”Biden said he’s been trying to change drug sentencing laws that disproportionately harmed African Americans and that the public knows his record.Trump, touting criminal justice reform and opportunity zone bills he signed, said: “I am the least racist person in this room.”Joe Biden invited the owners of a small Zimbabwean restaurant in North Carolina , Zweli and Leonardo Williams, to Thursday night’s debate to underscore the impact President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic has had on average Americans.The choice highlights the significance of North Carolina, a heavily contested battleground state that could help deliver Biden a win.President Donald Trump defended his administration’s separation of immigrant children who remain away from their families following detentions along the US-Mexico border.Trump said during Thursday’s debate that children are often brought across the border not by families but “by coyotes and lots of bad people.”The American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) told a judge this week that there were still 545 children separated from their parents from 2018.Trump said his administration had constructed more than 400 miles of his promised border barrier. He also said, “They built cages,” referring to Obama-era facilities depicted in media reports during the separations.Joe Biden disputed Trump’s answer, saying kids “were ripped from” their families in 2018.As he has done since the primary campaign, Biden defended the Obama administration’s immigration policy, admitting that it “took too long to get it right.”Former Vice President Joe Biden also said he would push for a $15 per hour minimum wage and rejects the idea that it would hurt small businesses.Biden said at Thursday’s debate: “There is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business.”President Donald Trump argued that the minimum wage should be left as an issue for the states to determine, “How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees.”The two candidates were asked about where they stand on raising the federal minimum wage as part of their final debate Thursday night. The minimum wage is now $7.25 an hour. Proponents of increasing it say the minimum wage has not kept up with inflation, making it harder for workers to make ends meet.Trump told moderator Kristen Welker on Thursday evening: “So far I respect very much the way you are handling this, I have to say.”The praise for Welker comes after Trump attacked her on Twitter over the weekend.She has “always been terrible and unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters,” he tweeted at the time.Trump has repeatedly fought with, belittled or denigrated members of the media during his tenure in office.That included CBS New correspondent Lesley Stahl, with whom the president bickered repeatedly during an interview for “60 Minutes,” which he abruptly cut off.Trump complained that the interview was unfair and released footage of it earlier Thursday.Former Vice President Joe Biden said any country that interferes in American elections will pay a price if he’s elected, saying, “They are interfering with American sovereignty.”The first debate between Trump and Biden deteriorated into bitter taunts and chaos after Trump repeatedly interrupted his opponent with angry and personal jabs.In an effort to curtail interruptions this time, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that Trump and Biden would each have his microphone cut off while his rival delivered an opening two-minute answer to each of six debate topics.Trump had been far more restrained during Thursday’s debate in Nashville, Tennessee.In a contrast to the first debate, the two presidential contenders went more than 15 minutes before interrupting each other at Thursday night’s debate. Helped by a rule that switched off the microphone for the candidate who was not talking, the two traded sharp barbs and critiques, but at least kept their voices lowered.Trump insisted he had done a good job with a worldwide pandemic and said the country needs to “learn to live with it.”Biden shot back: “People are learning to die with it.”Regardless, it was a markedly less bombastic opening than in the first debate, when Trump frequently interrupted and shouted over Biden. The president seemed fairly calm Thursday, talking about his own recent bout with the virus as an example of how the country can survive it. The candidates took coronavirus tests Thursday, and both campaigns said they came back negative.Hundreds of people were gathered on sidewalks outside the site of the final presidential debate to show their support for the candidates.Cars honked and slowed down Thursday evening to check out the scene just outside Belmont University’s campus in Nashville, Tennessee.Most of the attendees appeared to be wearing masks, though some proudly declared they would not while holding flags supporting President Donald Trump.Julie Ford, who lives in Greenbrier, Tennessee, says she hopes the candidates spend more time talking about what they would do over the next four years.She says, “I know what Donald Trump plans to do and I know what Joe Biden’s website plans to do.” But she says Biden “never gets questioned (on) what his future will look like.”She says she travelled to Cleveland for the first debate to show her support for Trump.The White House chief of staff said President Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus ahead of Thursday night’s second and final presidential debate.Mark Meadows said Trump was tested on-board Air Force One while en route to Nashville, Tennessee, and tested negative.Biden’s campaign said Thursday that he, too, was tested Thursday and tested negative.The test comes after Trump’s bout with the virus, which put him in the hospital for three nights.Both campaigns had been required to certify that their candidates and VIP guests have tested negative ahead of the debates. But Trump and the White House have repeatedly refused to say whether Trump actually was tested before participating in the first.Trump was diagnosed with the virus two days later.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he has tested negative for Covid-19 ahead of his debate with President Donald Trump.Last week during a town hall style interview on MSNBC, Trump did not specify when he was asked when he had been tested before the Sept. 29 debate. The White House announced two days later Trump had tested positive. Trump spent three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center before returning to the White House.The White House was asked Thursday morning whether Trump had been tested, as Biden was, in preparation for the debate. It has not released an update.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-frames-race-as-battle-for-character-of-us/story-fU7htNuJOpffQss1DC1X2I.html
23-10-2020||World||Joe Biden demands Trump reveal tax returns, asks what he’s hiding||President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden traded charges of secretly taking money from foreign interests, after the former vice president addressed head-on Trump’s efforts to portray him as corrupt.Biden, declaring he had never accepted a foreign payment, noted that Trump has never publicly released his tax returns. He pointed at the president and demanded: “What are you hiding?”Unlike their first debate, in which Trump repeatedly talked over Biden and the former vice president called his opponent a “clown” and told him to “shut up,” the candidates initially complied with rules of the debate that called for them to allow each other time to speak.Biden showed he had anticipated that Trump would try to advance allegations that the former vice president is corrupt. Before the debate, Trump’s campaign introduced a man to reporters travelling with the president, Tony Bobulinski, who claimed without evidence to have discussed a business venture in China with the former vice president and his son, Hunter.Biden raised the topic before Trump, accusing the president and his associates of promoting Russian disinformation in unsubstantiated allegations about his Hunter Biden’s business dealings.“We are in a situation where foreign countries are trying to interfere in the outcome of our election,” Biden said. “His buddy Rudy Giuliani, he’s being used as a Russian pawn.”Trump responded by falsely accusing Biden of accepting $3.5 million from Russia. A report by Senate Republicans in September alleged that Biden’s son, Hunter, received a payment of $3.5 million from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.“I have not taken a penny from any foreign source in my life,” Biden said. Pointing his finger at the president, he said: “You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding?”“The foreign countries are paying you a lot,” Biden said. “Russia’s paying out a lot. China’s paying you a lot. And your hotels and businesses all around the country, all around the world.”Trump responded that Russia was “paying you a lot of money” when it invaded Ukraine under the Obama administration “and they probably still are.” Bobulinski, who told reporters before the debate that he had spoken with Biden and his son about a Chinese business venture that didn’t get off the ground, “was damning,” Trump said.Bobulinksi’s alleged relationship with the Bidens could not be immediately verified, he didn’t provide substantiation for his claims, and he didn’t take questions from reporters.“Release your tax returns or stop talking about corruption,” Biden said.“I called my accountants. Under audit,” Trump responded. “I’m going to release them as soon as I can, I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is.”He continued: “I don’t make money from China, you do. I don’t make money from Ukraine, you do.”Neither men provided specific substantiation for their claims that the other had received foreign payments, though Biden cited New York Times reporting on information about Trump’s taxes the paper has obtained.Biden opened their final debate by blaming Trump for the deaths of more than 220,000 Americans in the coronavirus pandemic, saying the president doesn’t deserve re-election.“Anyone who’s responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America,” Biden said. “We’re about to go into a dark winter. A dark winter. And he has no clear plan.”Biden said he would encourage all Americans to wear masks, contrasting himself with Trump, who has seldom covered his face before or after contracting Covid-19 himself. Trump defended his response to the pandemic to begin the debate, saying that spikes in cases in states including Florida and Texas have come down, his administration has directed the production of ample medical supplies, and the country is “rounding the turn.”“I was in the hospital. I had it. I got better,” Trump said. “More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a world-wide problem. I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do.”Trump accused Biden of supporting further economic shutdowns that have crushed the US economy. “We can’t close up our nation or we’re not going to have a nation,” he said.Biden’s campaign had said he was ready for a confrontation at Thursday’s debate with Trump, as the incumbent had said he would attempt to steer the discussion to allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden. But in the opening minutes, the two candidates engaged in a traditional debate over the coronavirus pandemic without resorting to personal attacks.However, at rallies and in interviews before the debate, Trump has made clear that he intends to focus the forum on airing allegations that Hunter Biden engaged in corrupt practices in Ukraine and China, claims that the president says the media is ignoring.The 90-minute debate is one of the last potential turning points of the 2020 election. Political consultants from both parties called their first debate in September a disaster, after Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden and the former vice president called the president a “clown” and told him to “shut up.”Trump slid in public polls after the episode. More than 47 million Americans have already voted in the election, giving the president less opportunity to change perceptions in his final toe-to-toe match-up with Biden.Trump backed out of what was supposed to be their second debate after the commission changed it to a virtual format because of the president’s recovery from Covid-19.The topics for Thursday’s debate are: the coronavirus, “American families”, racial issues, climate change, national security and leadership, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates.Trump will need to tamp down his aggressive posture from the first encounter, which polls by broadcast networks showed repelled viewers, and make the case for a second term, a line of argument he has struggled with in the past.Biden, who is ahead by nearly 8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, has to avoid any debate defining gaffes that change the status quo. And he needs to minimize reactions to Trump’s provocations.As he left Wilmington for the debate site in Nashville, Biden said he hoped that the encounter wouldn’t be a repeat of the chaotic first debate in late September and that Trump would follow guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19.“Hopefully he’s going to play by the rules. Hopefully everybody’s been tested. Hopefully it’s all been worked out what the rules are. We’re looking forward to it,” Biden said.The debate, at Belmont University, will have one twist after Trump talked over Biden repeatedly during the last face-off, in Cleveland. Moderators will now mute the candidates while the other gives his initial two-minute response on each topic.After the second debate was cancelled, the two candidates instead held duelling televised town halls in different cities. The combined ratings for the two programs drew a fraction of the viewership that a debate normally attracts.The Trump team said earlier this week it believed the debate would focus on foreign policy, something that neither the commission nor moderator Kristen Welker of NBC had ever committed to publicly.The Trump campaign said it would force Biden to account for his nearly five decades of foreign policy positions. Trump has long downplayed the threat posed by the coronavirus and has only intensified that message since his recovery from the disease it causes.Biden has hammered Trump for what he considers a cavalier approach toward the pandemic that has killed more than 223,000 people in the U.S.The Trump campaign has indicated that he is especially eager to attack Biden on a recent report in the New York Post that purports to cite emails between Hunter Biden and leaders of the Ukrainian energy firm whose board he sat on.Unverified emails the paper published after obtaining them from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani show a Ukrainian businessman thanking Hunter Biden “for the opportunity” to meet Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time.The Biden campaign said a review of the vice president’s calendars shows no such meeting.It has also repeatedly stressed that policy positions taken by the U.S. government and key allies were not influenced by Hunter Biden’s work.Another purported email says that Hunter Biden was receiving $10 million annually from a Chinese billionaire for “introductions alone,” though it is unclear who was involved in the introductions.Trump has long sought to cast Biden as soft on China, believing it a winning message with voters even as his own record includes plenty of praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-demands-trump-reveal-tax-returns-asks-what-he-s-hiding/story-tRS5mT9ij2puFptLxRhkjI.html
23-10-2020||World||US prez debate: Mute button brings civility as Donald Trump, Joe Biden show restraint||The mute button, or at least the threat of it, worked well this time as US President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden showed restraint and civility during the last presidential debate, unlike their first encounter when they frequently spoke over each other, creating chaos at times. Far from their raucous first meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, that led organisers to introduce the mute button, the second and final 90-minute debate between Trump and Biden at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday night was less fury and more urgency. In the first presidential debate last month, Trump, 74, and Biden, 77, fiercely clashed over a number of issues, including the Covid-19 pandemic, racism, economy and climate, marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations. A media report termed the mute button a godsend, saying it also amplified the candidates’ differences. On Monday, the non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced new rules under which it will mute microphones for two minutes of the rival speakers so as to give them uninterrupted opening remarks during the final debate. The decision to mute microphones comes after a chaotic first presidential debate that saw the two candidates interrupting each other repeatedly. The final debate was moderated by NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker. Under the new rules, Trump and Biden each had two minutes of uninterrupted time to speak at the beginning of every 15-minute segment of the debate. Both campaigns had agreed to the two-minute, uninterrupted rule. The mute button was under a member of the production crew who works for the Commission on Presidential Debates. The person was responsible for turning off the microphone. A member of each of the Trump and Biden campaigns monitored the person who controlled the mute button backstage. As hoped by the commission officials, the button allowed for a more civilised exchange of views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-debate-mute-button-brings-civility-as-donald-trump-joe-biden-show-restraint/story-DO52dzQenPkNYd9AJ3ykOO.html
23-10-2020||World||US crude oil futures dip slightly after final presidential debate||US Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden’s clean energy plans put the spotlight on oil companies and stocks during Thursday’s final debate with President Donald Trump, even though crude oil futures fell very marginally after the statements.The last debate ahead of the Nov.3 contest saw a restrained Trump and Biden discuss a range of topics, including the economy, the coronavirus pandemic and climate change.Trump pounced on Biden’s comment that he “would transition from the oil industry”, asking voters in states where the oil industry is important to note his stance, while other Republicans also said Biden would kill millions of jobs.US crude oil futures dipped 0.17% to $40.58 a barrel, following a 1.5% gain in the previous session.After the debate, Biden told reporters he was referring to a plan to stop subsidizing fossil fuels, and there would be jobs created in other alternatives.“It does sound like a reiteration of existing policy,” said Rob Carnell, Asia research head at Dutch bank ING, since Biden’s pledge of net-zero-emissions by 2050 will require less reliance on oil and more reliance on renewables for energy.“But there is a little bit of denial, everywhere, that this is actually going to happen...it’s possible that the market reaction has been the dawning realisation that this is actually what it means.”The Dow Jones oil and gas index is down nearly 49% this year.US stock futures barely moved after the debate although the Japanese yen ticked up investors’ caution increased into the election.US S&P 500 E-minis were down 0.07% at 3,452 points at 0500 GMT.“Biden came through better than Trump in this debate and this should help to cement his lead over Trump and may just help him to cross the final line with a win,” said Vasu Menon, a senior strategist at OCBC Wealth Management in Singapore.The debate followed over a week of choppy trade on Wall Street, with investors worried about whether Congress and Trump will approve another fiscal stimulus package before the election.Despite a recent decline, the S&P 500 remains up over 3% since the first Trump-Biden debate on Sept. 29, with investors voicing growing comfort with a potential Biden victory as he increased his lead in polls.Many investors in recent months have held that a second term for Trump, who favors tax cuts and deregulation, would be good for the stock market.The S&P 500 is up more than 60% since Trump’s unexpected election victory on Nov. 8, 2016, beating the 42% gain in the first four years after Democratic President Barack Obama won in 2008.Investors view Biden as likely to raise taxes, especially if Democrats wrest control of the Senate from Republicans. However, a Biden presidency, coupled with a Democratic Senate, would likely mean a larger fiscal stimulus plan than what a Republican Senate would agree to, many investors believe.However, it is unclear how Wall Street would react to the election outcome. In the run-up to the 2016 election, investors widely predicted that a Trump victory would hurt stocks due to his unpredictability and trade-war threats against China and Mexico.With expectations that the increased use of mail-in ballots by voters concerned about the coronavirus could mean no immediate winner is announced, S&P 500 options show investors are bracing for volatility in November and December.With 12 days to go, some 47.5 million Americans have turned in ballots, roughly eight times the number of early votes cast at about same point before the 2016 presidential contest, according to data compiled by the US Elections Project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-crude-oil-futures-dip-slightly-after-final-presidential-debate/story-nUdpon5o1REF1qbeGCP1SM.html
23-10-2020||World||Donald Trump blames Speaker Nancy Pelosi for no new Covid relief bill||President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have blamed each other and each other’s political parties for the failure to provide a new round of coronavirus aid relief.Trump blamed Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even as Pelosi continues to negotiate a deal with Trump’s emissary, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The Republican president suggested Pelosi doesn’t want to do anything that would help him.Biden asked Trump why he isn’t talking to his “Republican friends” about a deal.Mitch McConnell, the Senate’s Republican leader, has told his fellow Republicans that he warned the White House against striking a trillion-dollar relief deal with Pelosi before the Nov 3 election.Biden raised his voice as he reminded viewers of Thursday’s presidential debate that the Democratic-controlled House passed a relief bill months ago. It was ignored by the GOP-led Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-blames-speaker-nancy-pelosi-for-no-new-covid-relief-bill/story-FpAT7QSN7SC5ESXNeme8wO.html
23-10-2020||World||Biden slams Trump friendship with ‘thug’ Kim||Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Thursday denounced President Donald Trump for befriending North Korea’s “thug” leader, likening his diplomacy to working with Hitler.In a sharp clash in their final presidential debate, Biden attacked Trump’s insistence that he has avoided war through his summits with Kim Jong Un.“He’s talked about his good buddy, who’s a thug,” Biden said of the young North Korean leader.“That’s like saying we had a good relationship with Hitler before he invaded Europe -- the rest of Europe. Come on.”But Biden indicated he was also willing to meet with Kim, saying his condition would be that Pyongyang works to make the Korean peninsula “a nuclear-free zone.”Trump said that former president Barack Obama had left him “a mess” on North Korea and had warned him of the risk of “nuclear war.”After the summits, “we have a very good relationship. And there’s no war,” said Trump, who also played down North Korea’s recent unveiling of a massive new long-range missile at a military parade.“He didn’t like Obama,” Trump said of Kim not meeting the former president. “He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.”Biden, who was vice president under Obama, hit back that Obama would not meet Kim because he was pushing stronger sanctions.“President Obama said we’re going to talk about denuclearization. We’re not going to legitimize you.”Trump first met in June 2018 with Kim in Singapore, the first-ever summit between the countries still technically at war, and later said that the two leaders “fell in love.”The two leaders have met two more times and North Korea has since held off on nuclear and missile tests but analysts say Pyongyang has kept advancing its weapons programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-slams-trump-friendship-with-thug-kim/story-5OczjrZFa5w5JdY8eD1sSO.html
23-10-2020||World||Israel launches airstrike on Gaza after Palestinian militants fire rockets||The Israeli military said Friday it launched overnight airstrikes in the Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants fired two rockets, with no reports of casualties or major damage on either side.The military said fighter jets and other aircraft struck a weapons manufacturing site and “underground infrastructure” belonging to the Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza.Late Thursday, Palestinian militants fired two rockets into Israel. One was intercepted by Israeli missile defenses while the other fell in an open area.Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and several skirmishes since the militant group seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel holds Hamas responsible for all attacks emanating from Gaza, including those claimed by other militant groups.Israel and Egypt have maintained a crippling blockade on the coastal territory, which is home to 2 million Palestinians, since Hamas seized power.Earlier this week, Israel announced the discovery of an unfinished tunnel dug by militants that had crossed into Israel before it was detected by underground sensors. It said the tunnel ran dozens of meters (yards) underground and was intended to facilitate attacks.Israel has uncovered around 20 such tunnels since the last war with Hamas, in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-launches-airstrike-on-gaza-after-palestinian-militants-fire-rockets/story-xPCaKR2GNKBl4Vww2XR87N.html
23-10-2020||World||Pakistan business school cancels online lecture of noted economist||A Pakistan-based business school was forced to cancel an online seminar with well-known economist Dr Atif Mian following pressure from extremist groups.Dr Mian, who belongs to the Ahmadiyya community, was slated to speak on “Why has economic growth fallen behind in Pakistan?” at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) in Karachi. However, the seminar was scrapped due to threats from extremists.“Dr Atif R. Mian’s lecture “Why has economic growth fallen behind in Pakistan?” scheduled on November 5, 2020 has been cancelled. Inconvenience is highly regretted,” IBA Karachi tweeted.Dr Mian also confirmed the news about his seminar.“Sorry to report that my zoom economics seminar at IBA Karachi has been cancelled due to threats that the university administration was facing from extremists. My very best wishes and prayers are with the students of IBA,” Mian tweeted.Back in September 2018, Atif Mian was asked to quit Imran Khan’s Economic Advisory Council within days of his appointment for being a member of the Ahmadiyya community, Dawn reported. So much for Imran Khan’s claims to protect minorities of Pakistan. He could do nothing about the smear campaign that was launched on social media seeking Mian’s removal over his Ahmadiyya faith.After Dr Mian’s announcement on IBA seminar, Wendy Gilmour, Canada’s high commissioner to Pakistan expressed regret over the development. “I am very sorry to hear this. An opportunity lost for the students and wider interested community,” Gilmour tweeted.This news comes after a UK-based All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for the Ahmadi Muslim Community had revealed details about the discrimination the Ahmadiyya community has been facing in Pakistan.In August the report titled “Suffocation of the Faithful - the persecution of Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan and the rise of International Extremism” said that persecution against the peace-loving community intensified following the partition of the Indian subcontinent and the formation of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-business-school-cancels-online-lecture-of-noted-economist/story-nFwNnzhWq8l1n7T8kgmkQN.html
23-10-2020||World||China warns Canada not to damage relations over Uyghur genocide issue||Beijing [China], October 23 (ANI): China has accused Canadian parliamentarians of spreading “lies and rumours,” over the issue of genocide against the Uyghur minority community in Xinjiang.“The sub-committee of the Canadian parliament neglects the fact of political stability, economic growth, ethnic solidarity and social harmony in Xinjiang. Its groundless statement is full of lies and disinformation. This is blatant interference in China’s internal affairs and reflects those Canadian individuals’ ignorance and prejudice,” said Chinese spokesperson Zhao Lijian while responding to Canada’s House of Commons subcommittee’s statement. This comes after a subcommittee of Canada’s Parliament called out China on genocide in Xinjiang province, The Globe and Mail reported. The committee also called for human rights-related sanctions.Responding to Canada’s subcommittee, Zhao said, “China has repeatedly made clear our stern position on Xinjiang. Xinjiang-related issues are not at all about human rights. The so-called genocide in Xinjiang is a rumour and a farce fabricated by some anti-China forces to slander China.”This follows after the Canadian committee used the term “concentration camps” to describe Chinese centres for forcible political indoctrination and skills training. It also mentioned documents with details on plans to subject women of child-bearing age to birth control in Xinjiang.“Witnesses were clear that the Government of China’s actions is a clear attempt to eradicate Uyghur culture and religion,” the committee wrote.Furthermore, the committee asked Canadian leadership to impose sanctions against Chinese officials for human-rights abuses.Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uyghurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45% of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination.Classified documents known as the China Cables, accessed last year by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, threw light on how the Chinese government uses technology to control Uyghur Muslims worldwide.However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training.The Chinese government has been admonished world-over for its repressive measures against the ethnic Uyghurs like mass detention, mass surveillance, restriction of religious and cultural identities, as well as other gross human rights abuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-canada-not-to-damage-relations-over-uyghur-genocide-issue/story-laVNWK1eejV184P1TTMF4J.html
23-10-2020||World||US: Russian hackers targeting state, local networks||US officials said that Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local governments in the United States in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers. The warning, less than two weeks before the election, amplified fears of the potential for tampering with the vote and undermining confidence in the results.The advisory from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency describes an onslaught of recent activity by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group against a broad range of networks, some of which were successfully compromised. The alert released Thursday functions as a reminder of Russia’s potent capabilities and ongoing interference in the election even as US officials publicly called out Iran on Wednesday night.The advisory does not identify by name or location those who were targeted, but officials say they have no information that any election or government operations have been affected or that the integrity of elections data has been compromised.“However, the actor may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence US policies and actions, or to delegitimize (state and local) government entities,” the advisory said.US officials have repeatedly said it would be extremely difficult for hackers to alter vote tallies in a meaningful way, but they have warned about other methods of interference that could disrupt the election, including cyberattacks on networks meant to impede the voting process. The interference could continue during or after the tallying of ballots if Russians produce spoofed websites or fake content meant to confuse voters about election results and lead them to doubt the legitimacy of the outcome.A broad concern, particularly at the local government level, has been that hackers could infiltrate a county network and then work their way over to election-related systems unless certain defenses, such as firewalls, are in place. This is especially true for smaller counties that don’t have as much money and IT support as their bigger counterparts to fund security upgrades.Officials have nonetheless sought to stress the integrity of the vote, with FBI Director Christopher Wray saying Wednesday, “You should be confident that your vote counts. Early, unverified claims to the contrary should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.”On Thursday, Chris Krebs, the head of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said officials don’t have reason to believe that hackers were looking for election infrastructure or election-related information, and aren’t aware of any activity “that would allow them to come anywhere near a vote.” He said the alert was issued in regard to the scanning of county networks for vulnerabilities, not specifically to the targeting of elections.“The election-related risk is the fact that they were in or touching an election system,” he said.The threat from the Kremlin was mentioned but not especially emphasized during a hastily called news conference on Wednesday night, when officials said Russia and Iran had obtained voting registration information — though such data is sometimes easily accessible. But most of the focus was on Iran, which officials linked to a series of menacing but fake emails that purported to be from a far-right group and were aimed at intimidating voters in multiple battleground states.John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, said the operation was aimed at harming President Donald Trump, though he didn’t elaborate on how.On Thursday, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against five Iranian entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for attempting to influence US elections.Despite Iran’s activities, Russia is widely regarded in the cybersecurity community as the bigger threat to the election. The US has said that Russia, which interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic email accounts and through a covert social media effort, is interfering again this year in part through a concerted effort to denigrate Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.US officials attribute the recent activity to a state-sponsored hacking group variously known as DragonFly and Energetic Bear in the cybersecurity community. The group appears to have been in operation since at least 2011 and is known to have engaged in cyberespionage on energy companies and power grid operators in the US and Europe, as well as on defense and aviation companies. Aviation networks are among the entities that officials say were recently targeted, according to Thursday’s advisory.According to the advisory, the hackers have obtained user and administrator credentials to enter the networks and moved laterally inside to locate what they felt would be “high-value” information to steal. In at least one breach, officials say, the hackers accessed documents related to network configurations and passwords, IT instructions and vendors and purchasing information.As of October 1, the advisory said, the hackers have exfiltrated data from at least two servers.John Hultquist, the director of threat intelligence at FireEye, said Energetic Bear moved to the top of his worry list when the cybersecurity firm observed it breaking into state and local governments in the US that administer elections, due to it having targeted election systems in 2019.Hultquist said he does not think Energetic Bear has the ability to directly affect the US vote but fears it could disrupt local and state government networks proximate to the systems that process votes.“The disruption may have little effect on the outcome. It may be entirely insignificant to the outcome — but it could be perceived as proof that the election outcome is in question,” he said. “Just by getting access to these systems they may be preying on fears of the insecurity of the election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russian-hackers-targeting-state-local-networks/story-nxqTHk6NLVRDE5tkYobFhK.html
23-10-2020||World||China’s actions in Xinjiang amount to genocide, says Canada parliament panel||A Canadian parliamentary panel has described the persecution of the Uighurs in Xinjiang as a “genocide”, asking the government to recognise it as such and to impose sanctions against Chinese officials responsible.The Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development said it was “profoundly disturbed” at what it heard in testimony from witnesses and “convinced of the need for a strong response.” Witnesses said “the government of China has been employing various strategies to persecute Muslim groups living in Xinjiang, including mass detentions, forced labour, pervasive state surveillance and population control. Witnesses were clear that the government of China’s actions are a clear attempt to eradicate Uighur culture and religion,” it said in a statement.The panel called upon the Canadian government to “condemn the government of China’s actions against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang” and “recognise that the acts being committed in Xinjiang against Uighurs constitute genocide and work within legal frameworks of international bodies to recognise that acts being committed against Uighurs constitute genocide.” The subcommittee was “deeply disturbed by the use and apparent efficiency” and “inhumane population control measures” in the area.This was “the largest mass detention of a minority community since the Holocaust,” it noted.Survivors of concentration camps said “detainees are abused psychologically, physically and sexually.”The subcommittee is chaired by Peter Fonseca, an MP belonging to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party caucus.It said that the panel was told that “women and girls are regularly subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of gender-based violence”. It also called for action from the government with regard to supply chains for goods that may have been manufactured in China through the use of forced labour in Xinjiang. The panel recommended that the government “investigate potentially problematic sources of consumer goods and to take a strong stand against the use of forced labour, particularly when it involves Canadian companies.”It also sought enhancement of import control mechanisms “to prevent products made with forced labour from entering the Canadian market” while also seeking imposition of “sanctions on entities and individuals that benefit from the use of forced labour.”It also pointed to the pervasive state surveillance of the minorities in Xinjiang and warned that the Canadian government should ensure Canadian technology companies were in no way linked to the monitoring. It said that Canada should “take the necessary steps and conduct a review to ensure Canadian individuals, companies and public bodies are not investing in technology companies involved in supporting or facilitating the abuse of fundamental human rights in China.”Canadian foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he was “deeply disturbed” by the subcommittee’s findings. According to the outlet CBC News, he said, “Canada takes the allegations of genocide very seriously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-actions-in-xinjiang-amount-to-genocide-says-canada-parliament-panel/story-BiIUqJ01ZHjpKz5jhFFYjM.html

Experts have said such fraud is rare.Those attacks by the president have shown signs of depressing Republican interest in voting by mail. Democrats have roughly doubled the number of returned mail-in ballots by Republicans in states that report voter registration data by party, according to the Elections Project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-47-million-ballots-cast-in-us-election-eclipsing-2016-early-turnout/story-7JznYQfZsQYX1VnnVA3DHP.html

Look at Russia, look at - India, it’s so filthy, the air is filthy,” the American president said, arguing his position on climate crisis. “The Paris accord I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars, and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there - they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our business.”The American president has made a similar argument in the past - saying India and China got a sweeter deal under the Paris Accord - but he has not used this kind of language before for India.The Republican president and his Democratic challenger locked horns for their second and final presidential debate on Friday morning, India time.

23-10-2020||World||China vows retaliation if US proceeds with Taiwan arms sale||China has vowed to retaliate if the US proceeds with the sale of advanced weaponry to Taiwan worth more than a billion dollars.The statement from China’s defense ministry gave no specifics, but the development marks a further deterioration in ties between Beijing and Washington that have hit their lowest ebb in decades.The statement issued late Thursday night demanded the cancellation of the sale and an end to all interactions between the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries in order to “avoid serious repercussions for relations between China and the U.S. and their armed forces and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.” Failure to do so would “compel the Chinese side to fight back resolutely,” the statement said.The State Department on Wednesday announced it had approved the sale of 135 precision land attack missiles, associated equipment and training to Taiwan to improve its defense capabilities. The package is worth just over a billion dollars, it said in a statement. The missiles are made by Boeing. China regards Taiwan as its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary and Washington maintains only unofficial relations with Taipei in deference to Beijing. However, U.S. law requires the government to ensure Taiwan can maintain a credible defense and recent years have seen an increase in both the quality and quantity of defensive arms sold to the island.Those come as China has increased military activity around Taiwan in what it calls a deliberate attempt to force political concessions from the pro-independence administration of President Tsai Ing-wen. The increase in Chinese incursions into Taiwanese airspace and military exercises seen as targeting U.S. and Taiwanese assets add to Beijing’s years-long campaign of exerting economic and diplomatic pressure on the island, which has left it with just 15 formal diplomatic allies.In a separate statement issued late Thursday, the Chinese Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office demanded Tsai’s Democratic People’s Party end its “plotting” with the U.S. to “refuse unification through arms.” “This can only seriously undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and bring down a terrible disaster on the Taiwanese people,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-vows-retaliation-if-us-proceeds-with-taiwan-arms-sale/story-H5sVM3Ewb4iWqB0som3PJL.html
23-10-2020||World||Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora holds protest in front of Pak Embassy in US||The Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora (GKPD) and several other community organisations held a car protest rally in front of the Embassy of Pakistan in the US on Thursday (local time), remembering Pakistan’s invasion of Kashmir in 1947.Scores of people were seen chanting slogans calling Pakistan to vacate the illegally occupied Kashmir. “Pakistan vacate occupied Kashmir. Kashmir is an integrated part of India,” one of the posters read.Another poster said, “The jihadist invasion of 1947 in Kashmir didn’t happen overnight, it was planned strategically by Pakistan.”Dr. Mohan Sapru, the rally organizer and Washington DC GKPD coordinator said,“While using masks and current practice of social distancing, the rally protesters have gathered to voice their anguish and strong condemnation of Pakistan’s 73-year long perpetual policy of cross-border terrorism and overt operations in Kashmir, which have especially targeted the minority communities like Kashmiri Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists.”He also said that cross-border aggression against peaceful Kashmir by Pakistan-trained and sponsored militia called Kabalis on October 22,1947 marked the birth of the Kashmir problem.“The brutality of cross-border Islamic terrorism has continued unabated and resulted in the genocide and forced exodus of indigenous Kashmiri Hindus during the dark period of 1989-1991. Whether heinous terrorist acts happen in Kashmir, or US or any other part of the world, at the end of the day, terrorism is a blot on the conscience of humanity and cannot be a legitimate means to settle disputes in a civilized world,” Sapru said. He further said that the agony and hardships of a few hundred Kashmiri Hindu families, who continued to live in the Kashmir valley, still remain largely unaddressed.The rally participant and community activist, Sidarth Ambardar, recalled Father George Shanks’s account of the murder of nuns by the invading Kabali militia in October 1947, and desecration of the Chatti Padhshahi Gurdwara. He said: “Pakistani invaders in 1947 terrorized, looted and killed the locals.”European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS), in a recent commentary, called October 22 as the “darkest day” in the history of Jammu and Kashmir when Operation Gulmarg was launched in a bid to seize the territory.According to a European think tank, the tribal invasion had left between 35,000 and 40,000 residents dead.“The planners and perpetrators of the tribal invasion were, and remain, without doubt, the foremost enemies of the Kashmiri people. The day the invasion began on October 22, 1947, has to be the darkest day in the history of Jammu and Kashmir,” the European think tank said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmiri-pandit-diaspora-holds-protest-in-front-of-pak-embassy-in-us/story-bby4V2iCH9k7sNl0OPSOBI.html
23-10-2020||World||Trump calls CBS biased, hateful, rude for ‘60 Minutes’ interview footage||The White House on Thursday released raw footage from an interview that US President Donald Trump did with “60 Minutes” reporter Lesley Stahl, breaking an agreement to keep material from the highly-anticipated clash private until an edited version could air this weekend.The footage shows Stahl, a veteran journalist who has interviewed Trump twice before, asking direct questions and refuting some of Trump’s answers on topics including healthcare and the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Look at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS,” Trump said in post on his Twitter profile on Thursday morning, with a link to his Facebook page, where he posted the nearly 38 minute interview.The Facebook post quickly gained attention, garnering more than 26,000 comments in less than two hours.The White House had kept a single-frame copy of the interview, in which only Trump is visible but Stahl can be heard asking questions. It shows Trump repeatedly asking Stahl and her employer, CBS News, to ask tough questions of Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the Nov. 3 election.CBS News, a division of ViacomCBS Inc
23-10-2020||World||Clashes, more than chaos, mark final Trump - Biden debate||After the first presidential debate was panned so widely that organizers introduced a mute button, Thursday’s second and final debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden was far more civil.Whether because of that button or the terrible reviews — especially for Trump — the candidates interrupted each other far less frequently, even as they clashed on issues ranging from the coronavirus to crime to global warming.While Trump and Biden responded to each other’s answers — shaking their heads disapprovingly or smiling, in the case of Biden — the two largely avoided speaking over one another. And neither man tried to speak at length while he was muted during opening questions.Trump, in particular, was on his best behavior, especially early on, and especially when it came to the moderator, whom he’d repeatedly attacked before the debate.“So far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this,” Trump said to NBC’s Kristen Welker when she gave him time to respond to Biden at one point.Because of the pandemic, only around 200 people were seated inside the debate hall in the massive college arena in Nashville. That included a representative of the Commission on Presidential Debates, who was tasked with ensuring each candidate had a two full minutes of uninterrupted time to deliver opening answers on six major topics, according to debate commission chair Frank Fahrenkopf.A member of each of the Trump and Biden campaigns monitored the person who controlled the mute button backstage, Fahrenkopf told The Associated Press, noting that the button would not be used beyond the first four minutes of each topic.The button was among a handful of changes implemented by the nonpartisan debate commission to help ensure a more orderly debate following the raucous and widely criticized opening debate 23 days ago. Coronavirus restrictions also remained in place, with attendees required to wear masks at all times and audience members distanced.Organizers had initially planned to separate the candidates with plexiglass barriers, but the barrier were removed hours before the debate began. A Trump campaign official said the decision was made after White House chief of staff Mark Meadows called Anthony Fauci, the nation’s highly respected top infectious diseases expert, during a walkthrough of the venue site.Meadows put Fauci on speakerphone and Fauci told those in the room that all a barrier would do was provide a false sense of security, the person said.Trump was diagnosed with Covid-19 two days after the last debate, and he and the White House have refused to say whether he abided by commission rules and tested negative for the virus before that debate.This time, Trump was given a test aboard Air Force One en route to Nashville Thursday and tested negative, according to Meadows. Biden’s campaign reported he also tested negative.The debate commission also tightened its rules on masks, with organizers saying that any audience member who refused to wear one would be removed. Last month, several members of the Trump family removed their masks once seated in the debate hall, but were allowed to stay. This time, first lady Melania Trump, appearing in public for the first time since her own coronavirus diagnosis, as well as other members of the Trump family were seen wearing masks at times.Before the debate began, Fahrenkopf repeated the instruction to the small audience.“If you won’t leave, you’ll be escorted,” he said.Fahrenkopf had said in an earlier interview that the safety measures would help reduce the risk of infection.“The Trump campaign’s attitude was that the president was not contagious anymore, but we’re going to go with our medical advisers,” he said.As a result, the president of Belmont University, where the event was held, called it “the safest place in America tonight.”The university, a picturesque institution of more than 8,200 students just a mile from Nashville’s Music Row, also hosted a town hall-style debate between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain in 2008.There was a far smaller audience this time around.Only around 200 people were allowed inside, a mix of invited guests of the campaigns and the debate commission, students, the commission’s production team, security, and health and safety personnel. Audience members were seated in accordance with social distancing recommendations; several empty seats separated each person or small group.All audience members and support staff were required to undergo coronavirus testing onsite and wore colored wristbands as evidence of their negative tests.Ahead of the event, dozens of protesters gathered just off campus beyond the security perimeter. One of them held a large white sign: “220,000 DEAD ... Trump FAILED US.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-more-than-chaos-mark-final-trump-biden-debate/story-1W1VBCcZEN6dQkXgX014qK.html
23-10-2020||World||‘Look at India, the air is filthy,’ says US President Donald Trump at final debate||US President Donald Trump on Thursday used the word “filthy” to describe pollution in India during an exchange on climate crisis as he clashed with Democratic rival Joe Biden on Covid-19, immigration, racism, healthcare and foreign policy in their second and final debate in the race for the White House.Though better behaved and disciplined than they were in their disastrous first debate on September 29, they also launched vicious attacks on each other over corruption, character and integrity in the second showdown on Friday morning, India time, at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.Watch | US Final Presidential Debate: When Donald Trump called India filthy Trump came into the debate as an underdog, trailing Biden by wide margins in national polls and in battleground states, desperately in need of changing the trajectory of the race with just 12 days left for polling to close, by which time a large number of Americans would have already cast their votes through early in-person and mail-in voting.Also Read: Donald Trump calls CBS biased, hateful, rude for ‘60 Minutes’ interview footage“Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia, look at, India, it’s so filthy, the air is filthy,” the president said in a segment on climate crisis. “The Paris accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars, and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses,” he said.The president has used this argument before — that India and China got a sweeter deal under the Paris Accord and that’s chiefly why he left the accord. That’s a baseless assertion and India has contested it, but he had not used this language before for India, China, or Russia.The New York Times’ fact-checkers labelled Trump’s assertion “misleading”: “Air pollution in China and India is indeed a serious issue — India is one of the most polluted countries in the world. But Mr Trump is essentially talking about the countries’ contributions to climate change, and on that score, his comments fail to capture the full picture.”Also Read: Donald Trump vs Joe Biden final presidential debate: Who said whatSouth Asians for Biden, a group backing the Democrat, criticised the president’s remarks, tweeting, “Tonight, Trump called India ‘filthy’. His rhetoric has proven time and time again that he has disdain for India, as well as for people who draw their heritage from South Asia. He will never respect the vibrancy, beauty, and diversity of our South Asian community.”A congressional aide who spoke on background found it a “bizarre comment from a president who is trying to court India as a key part of his national security strategy in the Indo-Pacific. And it was “oddly timed, especially when his secretary of state and defence are headed to India next week to meet with their Indian counterparts.”The aide was referring to the upcoming 2+2 ministerial dialogue for which secretaries of state and defence, Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper, were scheduled to reach New Delhi on Monday. They will meet their respective counterparts S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In the past, the US president had mockingly called India “tariff king” during trade talks, and underplayed its Covid-19 testing record to make his administration’s response look better in the face of mounting criticism of its handling of the worst public health crisis in more than 100 years.Also Read: Biden warns Trump has no plan to stop ‘dark winter’ of Covid-19 deathsThe first 30 minutes or so of the debate was indeed about the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 223,000 Americans and infected close to 8.5 million, and is now surging again in 75% of the country, raising the spectre of a “dark winter” as Biden put it at the debate.The former vice-president landed the first punch of the night, attacking the president’s response to the epidemic: “Anybody responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America.” He then challenged the president to start by taking responsibility for it.Trump, who has refused to take any responsibility for the poor handling of the pandemic or the consequent troubles and disruptions, said he did, but with a line that was soon reverberating around twitter-verse: “Excuse me, I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here, it’s China’s fault.”Also Read: Poor air quality is a danger to public health. Adopt a holistic approach | HT EditorialTrump also took every opportunity to draw Biden into a controversy swirling around conservative circles about the foreign business dealings of his son Hunter Biden, and accused Biden of earning millions from Russia and China.But the former vice-president had come prepared. He denied the allegations, questioned the veracity of the material Trump and his allies had used, and turned it all back on the president, slamming him on his “secret” bank account in China, and refusal to release his tax returns.Their exchanges on immigration, health care, racism, energy and climate change were vigorous with repeated back-and-forth. Towards the later part of the debate, Trump began hitting Biden on “being all talk” and not doing things he wants to do now when he was vice-president for eight years.Biden had come prepared with zingers and deployed them well. During a discussion on foreign policy, he brought up Hitler when criticising Trump’s eagerness to meet and strike up a good relationship with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. “We had a great relationship with Hitler before he invaded Europe,” he said.And he had a unifying message, which he used repeatedly to contrast Trump’s partisan attacks on Democratic cities and states over their Covid-19 cases and other troubles. He promised he will be a president for all of America and not Red America or Blue America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/look-at-india-the-air-is-filthy-says-us-president-donald-trump/story-7n28Cuq5R0HbEVBzeW3lAM.html
23-10-2020||World||The Palm Fountain: Dubai makes world record for largest fountain||The glitzy emirate of Dubai broke the record for the world’s largest fountain on Thursday, as the Gulf city seeks to boost its hard-hit tourism sector amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Palm Fountain, which covers an area of 14,366 square feet (1,335 square metres), is located at The Pointe shopping and dining district on Palm Jumeirah, a man-made palm-shaped island. Mask-clad people, in keeping with coronavirus safety measures, gathered on Thursday evening to watch a show of dancing jets of water, music and lights.“GWR is delighted to officially see The Palm Fountain breaking the title of the Largest fountain,” Shaddy Gaad, Senior Marketing Manager at Guinness World Records said in a statement.“This fountain is an example of another milestone in Dubai’s architectural achievements,” it said, adding that Guinness was declaring it “Officially Amazing”.Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, already holds a string of world record titles -- including the world’s tallest building, Burj Khalifa, and the fastest police car in service, a Bugatti Veyron. The city that attracts millions of tourists had already one of the largest fountains in the world near Burj Khalifa.The new fountain has over 3,000 LED lights, 7,500 nozzles and can shoot water up to 105 metres, according to Guinness.Last month, British artist Sacha Jafri broke the record for the largest art canvas measuring 1,595 square metres, also in Dubai, Guinness said.The 44-year-old contemporary artist has said he hoped to raise at least $30 million to fund health and education initiatives for children in impoverished parts of the world.Dubai, which has the most diversified economy in oil-rich Gulf region, has been badly hit by the coronavirus slowdown.Its GDP has contracted 3.5 percent in the first quarter, following two years of modest growth. Tourism has long been a mainstay of the emirate, which welcomed more than 16 million visitors last year.Before the pandemic crippled global travel, the aim was to reach 20 million this year.Dubai is now largely open for business and tourism, but infection rates have been rising in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-palm-fountain-dubai-makes-world-record-for-largest-fountain/story-Lt7ljLkX1p0WVUgpgPsofK.html
23-10-2020||World||Biden warns Trump has no plan to stop ‘dark winter’ of Covid-19 deaths||Joe Biden on Thursday assailed President Donald Trump as having no plan to stop a “dark winter” of coronavirus deaths as they sparred in their last head-to-head clash 12 days before the election.With more people dead in the United States than in any other country, Trump insisted that Covid-19 would soon go away through medical breakthroughs and pointed to his own recovery since his first debate.“220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this,” Biden said at the televised debate in Nashville, where the two candidates avoided shaking hands due to safety risks.“Anyone who’s responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America,” Biden said.“We’re about to go into a dark winter,” he said. “And he has no plan.”After a strikingly bitter first debate, the tone initially changed, with the debate organizers empowered to mute the candidates’ microphones.Trump hit back that there would be no “dark winter” -- and defended his push to reopen the United States as soon as possible.“We’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away,” Trump said.“We have a vaccine that’s coming, it’s ready, it’s going to be announced within weeks.”- Biden seeks to keep lead -Trying to hold on to his sizeable lead in the polls, Biden was keen to keep the debate focused on the Covid-19 pandemic.With cases rising rapidly around the country as winter approaches, a Quinnipiac University poll Thursday found that nearly six in 10 people think the coronavirus is out of control.Trump’s demeanor changed in the first moments of the debate, with the normally combative tycoon speaking of his son’s Covid diagnosis and not immediately going on attack.But Trump was soon dusting off smear tactics he used against Hillary Clinton four years ago.As he had signalled he would do before the debate, Trump raised murky accusations that Biden profited from corrupt business relationships involving his son Hunter during the years that he served as vice president under Barack Obama.“I think you owe an explanation to the American people,” Trump charged -- to which Biden responded that he had never received “a penny” from foreign sources in his life.Whether the showdown at Belmont University in the country music capital can really shift the election is itself up for debate.Some 45 million Americans are estimated to have joined an unprecedented wave of early voting and polls indicate that almost all voters have already firmly made up their minds. Biden is steadily ahead, with the Quinnipiac University national poll putting him up at 51 percent to Trump’s 41.But the sheer ferocity of an election that has seen a country at its most divided in decades made the debate anything but predictable.- Keeping order -The first 90-minute Trump-Biden debate on September 29 erupted into an almost non-stop flurry of interruptions, insults and near-shouting.A majority of the disruption came from Trump. At one point, Biden turned to the president and told him to “shut up.”A second debate planned for October 15 was cancelled after Trump came down with Covid-19 and declined to take part in a virtual debate.This time, moderator Kristen Welker, a White House correspondent for NBC News, was armed with a mute button to ensure that each man can speak uninterrupted during portions reserved for statements.But Trump showed his willingness to play hardball by inviting as a guest to the debate Tony Bobunlinski, who says he was a former business associate of Hunter Biden and believes Joe Biden profited from his son’s business in China.Biden has denied any wrongdoing and calls the reports about his son a last-ditch attempt to change the course of the election with dirty tricks.The Biden campaign in a statement noted that the former vice president -- unlike Trump -- has released his tax returns and pointed to a recent New York Times report that Trump has a secret bank account in China.“This is a desperate, pathetic farce executed by a flailing campaign with no rationale for putting our country through another four years of hell,” campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.Trump was impeached last year by the House of Representatives for abusing his office in pursuit of compromising dirt on Biden’s family. He is also accused of multiple sex crimes and has seen numerous key associates during his presidency go to prison or be indicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-trump-has-no-plan-to-stop-dark-winter-of-covid-19-deaths/story-jncS9iUCz7SLwEjmHIycKO.html

23-10-2020||World||Donald Trump campaign tapes voters at drop boxes, threatens lawsuit||The Trump campaign has been videotaping people as they deposit ballots in drop boxes in Philadelphia in what it says is an attempt to catch violations, surveillance that the battleground state’s Democratic attorney general suggested could amount to illegal intimidation.The campaign acknowledged the taping in a letter from a lawyer that complained it had caught voters on video illegally depositing multiple ballots. City elections officials responded they could not confirm the activity was inappropriate under Pennsylvania law.Linda Kerns, the lawyer for the Trump campaign — which has already sued to ban the use of drop boxes — wrote to city election officials last week to request that they end the use of “unmanned drop boxes.” The New York Times first reported the development Thursday.Philadelphia and many other heavily populated counties in Pennsylvania are using drop boxes to help collect an avalanche of mail ballots under a year-old law greatly expanding such voting.Kerns wrote that video taken by a campaign representative shows three people dropping off as many as three ballots in a limited time period Oct. 14.Pennsylvania law, in most cases, requires voters to deliver their own mail-in ballots, Kerns wrote, although it makes an exception for voters with disabilities.Kerns suggested the images amount to “blatant violations” of state election law and said the campaign would sue, unless the city’s election office “commits to remedy this problem immediately.”She asked for copies of city surveillance video at City Hall, for a list of voters who dropped ballots in the Philadelphia City Hall drop box on Oct. 14, and that the ballots be set aside “until an investigation can determine whether the ballots were personally delivered” by the voter.In a response, a city lawyer, Benjamin Field, wrote Monday to Kerns to reject her assumption that the law was violated. Third-party delivery is permitted in certain circumstances, he wrote.Though the city had forwarded the campaign’s information to the district attorney’s office, Field said, the elections office does not track whose ballots are dropped into particular drop boxes.In a statement, the office of District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, said it is committed to investigating “any and all” allegations of voter intimidation and harassment. The office of the state attorney general, Democrat Josh Shapiro, warned in a statement that videotaping voters at drop boxes could be construed as illegal voter intimidation.In any case, Shapiro’s office said, Trump’s campaign had provided similar photos and videos in a lawsuit in federal court in its effort to ban drop boxes. A judge threw out the case.In another development in President Donald Trump’s battle with Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden for Pennsylvania’s key 20 electoral votes, a lawsuit filed Thursday challenged a court-ordered extension of the deadline to receive mailed presidential ballots.Plaintiffs — including four registered voters from Somerset County and a Republican congressional candidate — asked a federal judge in Pittsburgh to block the deadline extension in the presidential battleground state from going into effect.The state Supreme Court last month ordered county election officials to receive and count mailed-in ballots that arrive up to three days after the Nov. 3 election, until Nov. 6, even if they don’t have a clear postmark, as long as there is no proof it was mailed after the polls closed.Thursday’s lawsuit came 12 days before the election and three days after the U.S. Supreme Court, divided 4-4, rejected a Republican plea making a slightly different argument than Thursday’s lawsuit.The new lawsuit said the court’s deadline extension and the lack of a postmark requirement “will allow for late and otherwise unlawful ballots to be counted.”That is unconstitutionally unfair to in-person voters and exceeded the court’s authority by exercising a power that is constitutionally vested in Congress and the Legislature, it said.With the plaintiffs seeking expedited consideration, the new argument could theoretically arrive at the U.S. Supreme Court after Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is sworn in, providing a tie-breaking vote before the election.Most states make Election Day the deadline, but more than 20 states have a post-Election Day deadline.Several lawsuits — including another filed against Philadelphia by Trump’s campaign — are currently being fought over how Pennsylvania’s election is being conducted. The wave of court cases has prompted concerns that the presidential vote count will be heavily litigated and dragged out for weeks.With about 2.9 million mail-in ballots requested so far, registered Democrats have requested about 1.1 million more mail-in ballots than Republicans, or 1.8 million to 700,000, according to state data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-campaign-tapes-voters-at-drop-boxes-threatens-lawsuit/story-79B9MNOYbpJHBn8n58peaI.html

23-10-2020||World||China, marking its first war with US, urges sacrifice at home||China is going all out in remembrance of its participation against the US in the Korean War, sending a message to Washington that it’s not intimidated by American military might.President Xi Jinping will participate in a ceremony on Friday in Beijing marking the 70th anniversary since its army took up fighting in a conflict China’s government describes as the “War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.” It remains the only time China has gone to war with the US, which was commanding United Nations forces in the 1950-1953 conflict.State media has prominently featured the runup to Friday’s event at the Great Hall of the People, including coverage of a visit by Xi earlier this week to a newly opened military museum exhibition. There, he urged the Chinese people to “carry on the fighting spirit and strengthen the fighting capabilities.”PLA Daily published a lengthy commentary that declared “red lines should never be crossed, bottom lines should never be trampled on.” Other publications ran similar articles that emphasized the need for sacrifice.Also Watch | Tectonic shift as India-US look to lock intelligence deal? The display comes as relations between the two world’s largest economies are at their lowest point in decades. From military tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea, to tit-for-tat retaliation against diplomats and journalists and spats over technology, China wants to be seen as standing up to what it calls US bullying.A rousing celebration of fighting to a standoff with the Americans -- which took place in the 1950s when China was much poorer -- helps shore up anti-US sentiment and a fighting spirit among Chinese public amid talk of a “new Cold War.”In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un sent floral baskets to a cemetery for Chinese soldiers killed in the war, where participants at a ceremony to mark the anniversary “paid silent tribute to the martyrs of the Chinese People’s Volunteers,” the state’s official Korean Central News Agency reported Friday.In October 1950, Chinese troops crossed the border into North Korea at the Yalu River to fight the US-led UN forces. Beijing says just under 200,000 Chinese died in the Korean War, while some US estimates have put that figure at 900,000. Since the conflict ended with an armistice agreement and not a peace treaty, the Chinese People’s Volunteers who fought on behalf of North Korea are still technically at war with U.S.-led UN forces who fought on behalf of South Korea.Chinese forces, poorly armed and equipped at the time, would often attack in overwhelming numbers, occasionally causing American machine guns to overheat and break down. That strategy led to enormous casualties on the Chinese side, Pulitzer Prize winning historian David Halberstam wrote in his book about the Korean War titled “The Coldest Winter.”Sensitivities around the war are running high in China, where earlier this month millions of people took to social media to criticize South Korean K-Pop music group BTS member Kim Nam-joon, known by his stage name RM, for neglecting to talk about China’s role when he mentioned the Korean War at an awards ceremony in New York.Another message widely promoted on Chinese social media underlined the death toll, saying: “197,653 -- the number of martyrs who died in the Korean War. We’ve never forgotten. Please remember this number!”Some Chinese online have drawn analogies between the Korean War and China’s current battle for self-sufficiency in technology. The Battle of Triangle Hill -- a drawn out clash during the war -- has been invoked in China’s modern-day tech fight with the US, used to symbolize its determination to make technological breakthroughs after the US hit Huawei Technologies Co. with regulatory restrictions.One film set for an Oct. 23 release touches on China’s contributions in the war and is called “The Sacrifice.” State broadcaster CCTV and provincial television channels have been airing a six-part documentary about the Korean conflict. There’s even an animated series about heroes of the war aimed at Chinese teenagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-marking-its-first-war-with-us-urges-sacrifice-at-home/story-d4U2DaWWRi5yBf7GznyO4K.html
23-10-2020||World||China seethes over US-Taiwan arms deal||China on Thursday threatened to make a “legitimate and necessary” retaliation over the US sale of $1.8 billion worth of arms to Taiwan as Beijing becomes more strident over its claims to the self-ruled island.The US state department said on Wednesday it has approved the sale of 135 air-to-ground missiles to Taiwan in a move Taipei’s defence ministry said would build its combat capabilities.“We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs,” defence minister Yen De-fa said.Self-ruled Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by China, whose leaders view the island as part of their territory. China’s foreign ministry on Thursday accused the US of violating agreements signed by Beijing and Washington in the 1970s establishing diplomatic relations between the two governments.The sale is “sending a very wrong signal to separatist forces advocating for Taiwan independence, and seriously damages China-US relations,” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said. China also promised retaliation after US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the previous day the state department was designating the US operations of six more China-based media companies as foreign missions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seethes-over-us-taiwan-arms-deal/story-HZ4OkG6BK7MqH3FGUqDI4H.html

23-10-2020||World||Facebook, Twitter CEOs ordered to testify by GOP senators||The GOP push against Facebook and Twitter accelerated Thursday after Republican senators threatened the CEOs of the social media companies with subpoenas to force them to address accusations of censorship in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign. With Democrats boycotting the hearing, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the legal orders if Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey did not agree to testify voluntarily. The committee wants to hear from them about “the suppression and/or censorship of two news articles from the New York Post,” according to the subpoena document. Senators also want information from the executives about their companies’ policies for moderating content “that may interfere” with federal elections. Representatives of Facebook and Twitter declined comment. The urgency ratcheted higher Thursday as US officials said Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local governments in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers. The revelation was certain to stoke fears that Americans’ confidence in the November 3 election results could be undermined. Russia backed President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign through hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign. Facebook became an unwitting conduit for misinformation and election disruption. Facebook and Twitter acted last week to limit the online dissemination and sharing of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post that targeted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The story, which other publications have not confirmed, cited unverified emails from Biden’s son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump’s allies. One email purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet the elder Biden, who was vice president at the time. Trump’s campaign seized on the report, though the account raised more questions than answers, including whether emails at the centre of the story were hacked or fabricated. The FBI is investigating whether the emails are part of a foreign influence operation. It was the first time in recent memory that the two social media platforms enforced rules against misinformation on a story from a mainstream media publication. With the election looming, Facebook and Twitter have scrambled to stem the tide of material seen as potentially inciting violence and spreading disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories. Facebook has expanded its restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. Trump has raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process. The companies also have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene in speech on their platforms. With Trump leading the way, conservatives have stepped up their claims that Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, are biased, charging without evidence Silicon Valley’s social media platforms are deliberately suppressing conservative views. The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation, on a bipartisan vote, recently authorized subpoenas for Zuckerberg, Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The three have agreed to testify for a hearing planned for next week. Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that they say can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized the CEOs for failing to police content, focusing on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the United States. In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists. From both political parties, the companies have come under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from state attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech. On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark antitrust case against Google, accusing it of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to boost profits. It was the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. Facebook, Amazon and Apple also have been targets of antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

23-10-2020||World||Joe Biden aides say he’s ready for Donald Trump debate attacks on Hunter||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s campaign said he’s ready for a confrontation at Thursday’s debate with President Donald Trump as the incumbent says he will attempt to steer the discussion to allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden.“Every time he does that all he’s doing is reinforcing what we’ve said all along: He’s acknowledging he has no case for a second term; he has no answers to the failures of the last four years and no plans or vision for the next four,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a telephone call with reporters.At rallies and in interviews before the debate, Trump has made clear that he intends to focus the forum on airing allegations that Hunter Biden engaged in corrupt practices in Ukraine and China -- claims that the president says the media is ignoring.“Of course, the president will be looking for opportunities to make clear to the American people just exactly what Joe Biden has done,” Richard Grenell, a longtime Trump adviser, said on a call with reporters.In a written statement, Trump campaign director Tim Murtaugh said “the only question left is if Joe Biden is compromised by the Communist Party of China.” One of Hunter Biden’s former business associates, Tony Bobulinski, will be a guest of Trump’s campaign at the debate, according to Fox News.The 90-minute debate will be one of the last potential turning points of the 2020 election, as Biden and Trump seek to improve their performances at 9 p.m. New York time after what political consultants from both parties say was a disastrous first meeting.The topics for Thursday’s debate are: the coronavirus, “American families,” racial issues, climate change, national security and leadership, according to the commission.Trump will need to tamp down his aggressive posture from the first encounter, which cost him some support, and make the case for a second term, a line of argument he has struggled with in the past.Biden, who is ahead by nearly 8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, has to avoid any debate-defining gaffes that change the status quo. And he needs to minimize reactions to Trump’s provocations.As he left Wilmington for the debate site in Nashville, Biden said he hoped that the encounter wouldn’t be a repeat of the chaotic first debate in late September and that Trump would follow guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19.“Hopefully he’s going to play by the rules. Hopefully everybody’s been tested. Hopefully it’s all been worked out what the rules are. We’re looking forward to it,” Biden said.The debate at Belmont University, will have one twist after Trump talked over Biden repeatedly during the last face-off, in Cleveland. Moderators will now mute the candidates while the other gives his initial two-minute response on each topic.Presidential campaigns usually have three general election debates but Thursday’s will be the second and final one.After Trump’s hospitalization for Covid-19 and with the next debate only 14 days after his positive test result, the commission decided to make the Oct. 15 forum virtual. Trump refused to participate and the two candidates instead held dueling televised town halls from different cities. The combined ratings for the two programs drew a fraction of the viewership that a debate normally attracts.“You have one more debate that’s been heightened because the second one didn’t occur. Debates matter,” said David Winston, a veteran Republican strategist.The Trump team said earlier this week it believed the debate would focus on foreign policy, something that neither the commission nor moderator Kristen Welker of NBC had ever committed to publicly.The Trump campaign said it would force Biden to account for his nearly five decades of foreign policy positions. Trump has long downplayed the threat posed by the virus and has only intensified that message since his recovery.Biden has hammered Trump for what he considers a cavalier approach toward the pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people in the US.The Trump campaign has indicated that he is especially eager to attack Biden on a recent report in the New York Post that purports to cite emails between Hunter Biden and leaders of the Ukrainian energy firm whose board he sat on.Unverified emails the paper published after obtaining them from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani show a Ukrainian businessman thanking Hunter Biden “for the opportunity” to meet Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time.The Biden campaign said a review of the vice president’s calendars shows no such meeting.It has also repeatedly stressed that policy positions taken by the US government and key allies were not influenced by Hunter Biden’s work.Another purported email says that Hunter Biden was receiving $10 million annually from a Chinese billionaire for “introductions alone,” though it is unclear who was involved in the introductions.Trump has long sought to cast Biden as soft on China, believing it a winning message with voters even as his own record includes plenty of praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-aides-say-he-s-ready-for-donald-trump-debate-attacks-on-hunter/story-DDIYSS9jkJZZ3kPQ1zmvGK.html
23-10-2020||World||Personally allowed Navalny to get treatment abroad, says Russian President Putin||Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected accusations of the Kremlin’s involvement in the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, saying Thursday that he personally allowed his political foe to be flown to Germany for treatment.Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator and Putin’s most visible and determined opponent, fell ill on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and was flown to Germany two days later. He is still recovering there.Tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that the poison used on Navalny was a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Navalny asserted that his poisoning only could have been ordered by spymasters who wouldn’t have made such decisions without Putin’s personal involvement.Making his first public comments on Navalny’s poisoning, Putin said he had asked Russian prosecutors to allow Navalny to be flown to Germany from Siberia, where he first was hospitalized.“If authorities wanted to poison (him), they would hardly have allowed him to be sent to Germany for treatment,” Putin said during a video call with international foreign policy experts.The Russian leader noted that when Navalny’s wife asked to allow his treatment abroad, he personally asked the prosecutors to waive the restrictions on his travel stemming from an ongoing criminal probe.“I asked the Prosecutor General’s office to allow that, and he left,” he said.Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, chafed at Putin’s arguments, tweeting that “in Russia, a human life doesn’t matter” and Putin decides at his whim “whether you live or die.”Putin expressed regret about Germany’s refusal to share samples it said proved Navalny was poisoned with a type of Novichok, the same class of Soviet-designed nerve agent that was used to poison former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain in 2018.The Russian hospital that first treated Navalny said it found no evidence he was poisoned. Russian authorities have said they conducted a preliminary investigation but argued that they needed proof of poisoning to launch a full-fledged criminal inquiry.“Give us the biological materials and the official conclusions that would allow us to investigate it, and give official and formal grounds for opening a criminal case,” Putin said. “They have given us nothing. And there is no explanation why.”The Russian president said he offered to send experts to Germany to conduct a joint investigation, but alleged that Germany and its allies have stonewalled the proposal.“Let’s conduct a joint probe,” Putin said. “We are ready to work with full vigor.”The Kremlin has reiterated that before Navalny’s transfer to Charite Hospital in Berlin, Russian labs and a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk found no sign of a poisoning. Moscow has called for Germany and the OPCW to provide its evidence, and bristled at Western leaders’ insistence that Russia answer questions about what happened to the politician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/personally-allowed-navalny-to-get-treatment-abroad-says-russian-president-putin/story-b1NUMeA9cJgvVG71X7Kp9K.html
23-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Gilead’s Remdesivir is first virus drug to get FDA approval||The US Food and Drug Administration approved Gilead Sciences Inc.’s antiviral therapy remdesivir on Thursday, making it the first drug to obtain formal clearance for treating the coronavirus.Regulators had granted an emergency-use authorization for remdesivir earlier this year, and since then the drug has become a widely used therapy in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It was given to President Donald Trump this month when he was diagnosed with the virus.The approval of remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, will allow Gilead to market the drug and talk about its benefits to doctors, nurses, and patients. That could help solidify its position as a go-to medicine for Covid-19 patients even as other drugs for the disease begin to reach the market.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Veklury is now the first and only approved Covid-19 treatment in the United States,” Gilead said in a statement. While the drug was in short supply initially, Gilead said that the medicine is now widely available in hospitals across the country as manufacturing capacity has rapidly expanded.The drug hasn’t been proven to reduce deaths from Covid-19. In a World Health Organization trial, the medicine failed to reduce fatalities, according to preliminary results that were posted on preprint servers last week.Gilead has criticized the WHO study. In a letter posted on the company’s website, Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said the findings don’t negate other results.Shares of Gilead gained 4.1% in trading after the close of regular market hours on Thursday. Analysts estimate that remdesivir will have sales of $2.17 billion this year, according to 13 surveyed by Bloomberg.The company said in June that it will charge US hospitals roughly $3,120 for most patients who need remdesivir.Read more: Gilead Chooses Middle Ground in Pricing of Coronavirus DrugThe approval is based on a US government-sponsored trial involving more than 1,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients that found that those who received the drug recovered about five days faster than those who got a placebo.The overall side-effect rate was similar to the placebo in the government study. The most common side effects are nausea and elevated liver enzymes, according to the product’s label.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-s-remdesivir-is-first-virus-drug-to-get-fda-approval/story-5UXtaxI1lW4kCeSfZdnfLN.html

23-10-2020||World||Ghislaine Maxwell denied recruiting girls for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in newly unsealed testimony||Under fierce questioning by lawyers for an accuser, Ghislaine Maxwell repeatedly denied during a 2016 deposition that she recruited girls for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to a transcript of the proceeding made public Thursday.Maxwell rejected claims that she recruited a woman to carry Epstein’s child, that she brought girls to Epstein’s home to give him massages or that she’d threatened others if they made Epstein’s secrets public. Through hundreds of pages of testimony, Maxwell pushed back against questioning by an opposing lawyer or simply wouldn’t answer questions.“Have you ever observed Mr. Epstein having a massage given by an individual, a female, who was under the age of 18?” Maxwell was asked in the deposition.“No,” Maxwell answered.“I never saw any inappropriate underage activities with Jeffrey ever,” she added.Though the deposition includes several pages of questions about men that Epstein knew and whether they were introduced to underage girls, the names have been redacted.The British socialite is being held in a Brooklyn, New York, lockup while she awaits trial next year on charges she trafficked girls as young as 14 for her former boyfriend to abuse. The U.S. also says she participated in some of the alleged assaults and lied during portions of her sworn testimony in depositions. She has denied wrongdoing.Civil LawsuitThe testimony released on Thursday came from a separate defamation lawsuit filed against Maxwell by one of her accusers, Virginia Giuffre. Over Maxwell’s strenuous objections, a federal judge in Manhattan this year ordered documents in that case to be made public, and an appeals court agreed on Monday.The transcripts from 2016 are the only substantive public record from Maxwell about what she said she did for Epstein, her onetime boyfriend and employer.Giuffre claimed in the lawsuit that Maxwell and Epstein made her a sex slave for the money manager when she was 16. Giuffre sued Maxwell in 2015 for calling her account “obvious lies.” The case was later settled for an undisclosed amount.“Just for the record, I have never at any time, at any place, in any moment, ever asked Virginia Roberts or whatever she is called now to have sex with anybody,” Maxwell testified in the deposition, citing Guiffre’s maiden name.The deposition occurred on April 22, 2016, and it’s likely that prosecutors will seek to present the testimony to jurors in Maxwell’s criminal trial. In the criminal case, prosecutors claim Maxwell lied nine times in the deposition when she denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, including his recruitment of girls and his interactions with them at his properties.Parts of the deposition offer detail into Epstein’s lifestyle.“Sometimes people in the privacy of a house and swimming pool, I have seen people from time to time take their top off,” Maxwell testified. “I have seen people from time to time do that. Very unusual. Naked people around the people at any frequent period of time, I have never seen.”Repeatedly, though, Maxwell called Giuffre’s claims “lies” and “stories” and denied many of her accuser’s allegations.Maxwell frequently challenged her questioner, including asking at one point, “Would you like to ask the question properly?” and responding to one query, “Moving on.” That prompted the lawyer questioning her to remind her that she wasn’t in charge of the proceeding.At one point, she told the questioner: “You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap me, I will not be trapped.”At another point, she said, “Perhaps you are not really familiar with what massage is.” The questioner responded, “I am, I don’t need a lecture on massage.”“I think you do,” she said.Maxwell, when asked if she sought any female to carry Epstein’s baby for him, said that’s “completely rubbish.”“I never asked anybody to carry a baby for me,” she said, adding that she didn’t “recall any baby conversations with Jeffrey.”She admitted that Epstein bought her a car and loaned her money to buy a townhouse, but said she didn’t remember details of other gifts. She said he was not paying her legal fees. The two met in 1991, she said.Maxwell was questioned about a Jan. 12, 2015, email from Epstein in which he suggested she offer “rewards” to Giuffre’s friends and family to contradict her story. “Absolutely not,” Maxwell responded when asked if she ever offered such a reward. She said she had “no idea” if Epstein ever offered a reward.‘Not Coordinating’“I was not coordinating with Jeffrey,” she said when asked if she was working with Epstein to malign Giuffre.Asked if she was a citizen of “any other land” besides the U.S. and U.K., Maxwell answered “TerraMar,” which a lawyer then said was a charity project that dealt with oceans.After the deposition, Giuffre’s lawyers wrote to the court saying that Maxwell had been so evasive that they needed to question her again. Noting that Maxwell claimed any sexual interactions were with adults, they asked that she be ordered to answer their questions once again.Portions of Maxwell’s depositions and other material tied to Epstein were made public in August 2019. A day later, Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell where he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges involving girls and women. Authorities later said he hanged himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-denied-recruiting-girls-in-newly-unsealed-testimony/story-pFDIKqGafA37gPxHd7CFyO.html
23-10-2020||World||Documents British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell fought to keep secret released by US court||British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell said under oath in 2016 that she had never witnessed “inappropriate underage activities” by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to a deposition released on Thursday that she had fought hard to keep secret.Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls as young as 14 to engage in illegal sexual acts in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement in any such scheme when she gave her deposition under oath.In the April 2016 deposition from a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre - who has said Epstein kept her as a “sex slave” with Maxwell’s assistance - she did not answer directly whether she believed Epstein sexually abused minors.Also Read: Ghislaine Maxwell denied recruiting girls for Jeffrey Epstein in newly unsealed testimonyShe said instead that the only allegations she knew came from Giuffre, whom she called a “liar.”Maxwell, daughter of the late British publisher Robert Maxwell, was asked questions about her relationship with Epstein, who employed her to help run his properties, and allegations by Giuffre, according to the transcript.“I never saw any inappropriate underage activities with Jeffrey ever,” she said.“I can’t testify to what Jeffrey did or didn’t do,” Maxwell said. She later added: “I can only testify to what I know and the fact that she (Giuffre) has lied about me from the beginning to the end and repeatedly causes me to question anything that she may feel.”Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Giuffre, said in a statement that the deposition’s release was “a long-time coming and a welcome step towards revealing the evidence of the scope and scale of the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking ring.”Giuffre and the Miami Herald newspaper had sought the unsealing.DENIES WRONGDOINGU.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan had directed that a transcript of Maxwell’s testimony and other documents be released.Epstein once counted U.S. President Donald Trump, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew as friends. They have not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.Giuffre has said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including Andrew when she was 17 years old. Andrew has denied the allegations.Maxwell testified that she flew on Epstein’s planes with Clinton but wouldn’t characterize the two men as friends or acquaintances and said she was never on one of Epstein’s private islands with Clinton.“One of (the) lies she told was that President Clinton was on the island where I was present. Absolutely 1000% that is a flat out total fabrication and lie,” Maxwell said in a deposition that lasted 9-1/2 hours.Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.While Maxwell repeatedly denied wrongdoing, she was asked several times whether any indecent activities were taking place in Epstein’s orbit. Her lawyers have said the fact the questions were asked could suggest to the public that Giuffre’s lawyers believed they might have had a basis to ask them, even if the conduct never happened.JAILED PENDING TRIALLawyers for Maxwell had argued that making the deposition public could imperil her ability to get a fair trial, because jurors might hold its contents against her. A trial is scheduled for July 2021.Maxwell was arrested on July 2 in Bradford, New Hampshire, where authorities said she was hiding on a property she bought in December in an all-cash transaction with her identity shielded. She is locked up in a Brooklyn jail after the judge in her criminal case called her an unacceptable flight risk.Maxwell told lawyers that she was employed by Epstein and hired assistants, architects, decorators, cooks, cleaners, gardeners, pool people and pilots as part of the upkeep of six homes, according to the transcript, which takes up 418 pages.“... a very small part of my job was from time to time to find adult professional massage therapists for Jeffrey,” the transcript said.Maxwell appeared evasive as a lawyer for Giuffre pressed her on whether she hired Giuffre to give Epstein an erotic massage.“Virginia Roberts held herself out as a masseuse and invited herself to come and give a massage,” Maxwell testified.The deposition and other documents were cleared for release after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Monday rejected Maxwell’s “meritless” arguments that her interests outweighed the presumption the public should see the materials.Many names in the transcript of the deposition were blacked out.Epstein killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 at a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges announced the previous month.He had previously escaped federal prosecution by pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state prostitution charges, an agreement now widely considered too lenient.Asked why she maintained contact with Epstein after his guilty plea, Maxwell responded that she was “a very loyal person and Jeffrey was very good to me when my father passed away and I believe that you need to be a good friend in people’s hour of need and that it was a very thoughtful, nice thing for me to do ...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/documents-british-socialite-ghislaine-maxwell-fought-to-keep-secret-released-by-us-court/story-fy6jWDm3xTyZ6x4UeogmLP.html
