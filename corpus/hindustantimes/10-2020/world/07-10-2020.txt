In this context, we consider that there is no other plausible explanation for Mr Navalny’s poisoning than a Russian involvement and responsibility,” Foreign Ministers Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas said in a joint statement. Diplomats had earlier told Reuters the two countries would propose sanctions on Russian GRU military intelligence officials when the EU’s 27 foreign ministers meet on Oct. 12. “Drawing the necessary conclusions from these facts, France and Germany will share with European partners proposals for additional sanctions,” the two ministers said.“Proposals will target individuals deemed responsible for this crime and breach of international norms, based on their official function, as well as an entity involved in the Novichok programme.”Blood samples taken from Navalny confirmed the presence of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Tuesday.EU foreign ministers are expected to give their political support on Monday, but the sanctions are not expected to be approved immediately as legal texts must be prepared and cleared by experts from the 27 EU states.Le Drian told a parliamentary committee in Paris on Wednesday: “We say with Germany that clarification by Russia is indispensable and if it doesn’t clarify then we will need to draw conclusions among Europeans. We are in sync with Germany.”He said Paris was not closing the door to dialogue with Moscow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-hardening-stance-france-germany-push-for-eu-sanctions-on-russians-over-navalny/story-A6RLxwUx5tXGGJlY6qAF9K.html
07-10-2020||World||Two British IS members charged for deaths of American hostages||Two Islamic State militants from Britain were brought to the United States on Wednesday to face charges in a gruesome campaign of torture, beheadings and other acts of violence against four Americans and others captured and held hostage in Syria, the Justice Department said.El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey are two of four men dubbed “the Beatles” by the hostages they held captive because of their British accents. They are expected to make their first appearance in the afternoon in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, where a federal grand jury issued an eight-count indictment that accuses them of being “leading participants in a brutal hostage-taking scheme” that resulted in the deaths of Western hostages, including American journalist James Foley.The charges are a milestone in a years-long effort by U.S. authorities to bring to justice members of the group known for beheadings and barbaric treatment of aid workers, journalists and other hostages in Syria. The men’s arrival in the U.S. sets the stage for arguably the most sensational terrorism trial since the 2014 criminal case against the suspected ringleader of a deadly attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.The case underscores the Justice Department’s commitment to prosecuting militants captured overseas, said Assistant Attorney General John Demers, who vowed that other extremists “will be pursued to the ends of the earth.”“If you have American blood in your veins or American blood on your hands, you will face American justice,” Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official, said at a news conference announcing the charges.Videos of the killings, released online in the form of Islamic State propaganda, stunned the U.S. government for their unflinching violence. The recordings routinely showed prisoners in orange jumpsuits on their knees beside a captor dressed in black whose native English drove home the global reach of a group that at its peak occupied vast swaths of Syria and Iraq.The defendants are charged in connection with the deaths of four American hostages — Foley, journalist Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller — as well as British and Japanese nationals who had been captured.The indictment describes Kotey and Elsheikh, both of whom prosecutors say radicalized in London and set off for Syria in 2012, as “leading participants in a brutal hostage-taking scheme targeting American and European citizens” from 2012 through 2015. It accuses them of working closely with a chief spokesman for IS who reported directly to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in a U.S. military airstrike last year.In July 2014, according to the indictment, Elsheikh described to a family member his participation in an Islamic State attack on the Syrian Army. He sent the family member photos of decapitated heads and said in a voice message, “There’s many heads, this is just a couple that I took a photo of.”While the 24-page indictment describes Kotey and Elsheikh as coordinators of ransom negotiations conducted by email, it does not spell out their specific roles in any of the executions and other deaths.U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia G. Zachary Terwilliger, whose office will prosecute the case, said under U.S. law Elsheikh and Kotey can “be held liable for the foreseeable acts of their co-conspirators.”Relatives of the four slain Americans praised the Justice Department for transferring the men to the U.S. for trial, saying, “Now our families can pursue accountability for these crimes against our children in a U.S. court.”Elsheikh and Kotey have been held since October 2019 in American military custody after being captured in Syria one year earlier by the U.S.-based Syrian Democratic Forces. The Justice Department has long wanted to put them on trial, but those efforts were complicated by wrangling over whether Britain, which does not have the death penalty, would share evidence that could be used in a death penalty prosecution.Attorney General William Barr broke the diplomatic standoff earlier this year when he promised the men would not face the death penalty. That prompted British authorities to share evidence that U.S. prosecutors deemed crucial for obtaining convictions.In interviews while in detention, the two men admitted they helped collect email addresses from Mueller that could be used to send out ransom demands. Mueller was killed in 2015 after 18 months in ISIS captivity.The State Department, and the new Justice Department indictment, described their conduct in terms not nearly so benign.The State Department declared Elsheikh and Kotey as specially designated global terrorists in 2017 and accused them of holding captive and beheading approximately two dozen hostages.Specifically, the State Department said Elsheikh “was said to have earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions while serving as an ISIS jailer.”Kotey, according to the State Department, acted as an Islamic State recruiter and “likely engaged in the group’s executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding.”In a statement, relatives of Mueller, Foley, Sotloff and Kassig said the transfer “will be the first step in the pursuit of justice for the alleged horrific human rights crimes against these four young Americans.”“We are hopeful that the U.S. government will finally be able to send the important message that if you harm Americans, you will never escape justice. And when you are caught, you will face the full power of American law,” the statement said.The other two Beatles included the most infamous member of the group, Mohammed Emwazi, known as “Jihadi John,” who was killed in a 2015 drone strike. Emwazi appeared and spoke in the video of Foley’s execution. The fourth member, Aine Lesley Davis, was sentenced to seven years in prison in Turkey in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-british-is-members-charged-for-deaths-of-american-hostages/story-6PlX5Q9AyMRyh75iTYmKfL.html
07-10-2020||World||Donald Trump’s health puts more focus on Pence, Harris showdown in VP debate||President Donald Trump’s battle with Covid-19 and Democratic challenger Joe Biden’s age provide an unusual backdrop to Wednesday’s vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.Pence and Harris are scheduled to take the stage at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City separated by plastic barriers for a 90-minute debate, a reminder of how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the race ahead of the Nov. 3 election.The Republican president announced last Friday that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus amid a White House outbreak and was hospitalized in Maryland for three days receiving a variety of treatments.Either Pence, 61, or Harris, 55, would be a heartbeat away from assuming the presidency, depending on the election’s outcome. How they handle themselves during the debate may be scrutinized even more closely than usual given Trump’s ill health and Biden’s age.Now 77, Biden would be 78 upon taking office in January, which would make him the oldest U.S. president in history. Trump is 74, making his Covid-19 particularly dangerous considering his age and other health issues. Trump already is the oldest president to seek re-election.Public opinion polls this year have indicated that some voters have reservations regarding the age of the presidential candidates.Biden is leading Trump in national polls, including an advantage of 12 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos survey of likely voters. Polls show the race to be closer in some of the election battleground states that could determine the winner.Harris is a U.S. senator from California picked by Biden in August as his running mate. Pence is a former U.S. congressman and Indiana governor who has steadfastly defended Trump during his tumultuous presidency.Their debate is unlikely to match the chaos of the first presidential debate last week in which Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden and the two traded insults. Pence, more even-tempered than Trump, and Harris, a former prosecutor known for sharp questioning during Senate hearings, are seen as polished communicators.‘A FORTRESS’The two campaigns have squabbled over installing barriers on stage between Pence and Harris to guard against coronavirus infection. On Wednesday, television images of the debate stage showed two plexiglass barriers, one adjoining each lectern. Pence and Harris also will be placed more than 12 feet (3.6 meters) apart on stage.Harris had requested plexiglass shielding. Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller on Monday mocked Harris, saying if she “wants to use a fortress around herself, have at it.” An aide to the vice president on Wednesday said Pence had agreed to the barriers to facilitate the debate.Both Pence and Harris tested negative for the coronavirus on Tuesday. Current U.S. government guidelines call for anyone exposed to a person with Covid-19 to quarantine for 14 days regardless of test results.In a statement, Harris spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said, “If the Trump administration’s war on masks has now become a war on safety shields, that tells you everything you need to know about why their COVID response is a failure.”The pandemic is likely to dominate the debate. Biden and Harris have made Trump’s handling of the public health crisis a central theme of their campaign, blaming Trump for downplaying the health risks and failing to endorse mask-wearing to combat the spread of the pathogen.Pence, who has headed up the administration’s coronavirus task force, can be expected to defend Trump’s response to the pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans and battered the U.S. economy even as other wealthy nations have managed to get it under better control.A Biden campaign official said Harris has prepared for Pence to attack her as too liberal, which would echo Trump’s assertion that the moderate Biden would advance a “radical left-wing” agenda if elected president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-health-puts-more-focus-on-pence-harris-showdown-in-vp-debate/story-QY0FGBXsnp8qbC0g0wezfK.html
07-10-2020||World||Italy makes face masks mandatory as coronavirus cases surge||Italy on Wednesday made it mandatory to wear face masks outdoors nationwide in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as new infections jumped to the highest daily tally since April.The decree was approved at a cabinet meeting after a steady increase in cases over the last two months. It will probably be effective from Thursday, a government source said.Several Italian regions including Lazio, around the capital Rome, had already made face masks mandatory.Data from the Health Ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since April 24.Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France, Spain and Britain. Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard-hit by COVID-19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after Britain, with 36,061 dying since the outbreak flared in February, according to official figures.Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the government managed to get the contagion under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast.However, daily Covid-related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy’s epidemic six months ago.Some 31 people died of the virus on Wednesday, the Health Ministry said, while April 24, the last day with more than 3,000 cases, saw 420 deaths.The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the Covid-19 state of emergency to Jan. 31.The state of emergency, originally due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-makes-face-masks-mandatory-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-mX0ESMOcNhhh3Tyvvhd4eN.html
07-10-2020||World||In about-face, Donald Trump seeks to salvage parts of coronavirus aid||The White House on Wednesday tried to salvage its favorite items lost in the rubble of COVID-19 relief talks that President Donald Trump blew up, with his administration pressing for $1,200 stimulus checks and a new wave of aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic.In a barrage of tweets, Trump pressed for passage of these chunks of assistance, an about-face from his abrupt and puzzling move on Tuesday afternoon to abandon talks with a longtime rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along.Trump’s tweets amounted to him demanding his way in negotiations that he himself had ended.He called on Congress to send him a “Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200)” — a reference to a preelection batch of direct payments to most Americans that had been a central piece of negotiations between Pelosi and the White House.“I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” Trump said on Twitter Tuesday evening. He also urged Congress to immediately approve $25 billion for airlines and $135 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses.The stock market fell precipitously after Trump pulled the plug on the talks but was recovering in morning trading Wednesday after he floated the idea of piecemeal aid.Trump’s decision to scuttle talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi came after the president was briefed on the landscape for the negotiations — and on the blowback that any Pelosi-Mnuchin deal probably would have received from his GOP allies in Congress.“It became very obvious over the last couple of days that a comprehensive bill was just going to get to a point where it didn’t have really much Republican support at all,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Wednesday on Fox News. “It was more of a Democrat-led bill, which would have been problematic, more so in the Senate than in the House.”Pelosi told reporters that “all the president wants is his name on a check” for direct aid payments.The unexpected turn could be a blow to Trump’s reelection prospects and comes as his administration and campaign are in turmoil. Trump is quarantining in the White House with a case of the coronavirus, and the latest batch of opinion polls shows him significantly behind Democrat Joe Biden with the election four weeks away.Trump’s withdrawal from the talks came immediately after he spoke with the GOP leaders in Congress, Many Republican senators had signaled they would not be willing to go along with any measure that topped $1 trillion, and GOP aides had been privately dismissive of the prospects for a deal. Any Pelosi-sponsored agreement of close to $2 trillion raised the potential of a GOP revolt if such a plan came to a vote.Pelosi and Mnuchin talked briefly on Wednesday morning about the chances for a stand-alone airline rescue, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted. Pelosi directed Mnuchin to a measure she had attempted to pass on Friday on short notice under fast-track procedures, but only after Democrats made a number of changes Republicans did not like.The talks have been troubled from their start in July and never appeared to close in on an agreement both sides could embrace.Pelosi had been demanding a host of Democratic wins on food aid, unemployment benefits, help for renters and homeowners, and aid to state and local governments. Republicans charged she was dragging the talks to deny Trump a political victory before the Nov. 3 election.Early rounds of virus aid passed by overwhelming margins as the economy went into lockdown in March. After that, Trump and many of his GOP allies focused on loosening social and economic restrictions as the key to recovery instead of more taxpayer-funded help.Still, the decision to halt negotiations now could be politically perilous. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the start of the pandemic exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession.The economy has recovered more quickly than most economists had expected, largely because of the aid Congress approved in a $2 trillion package in March. The $1,200 stimulus checks, supplemental $600 unemployment benefits each week, and aid to small businesses boosted household incomes and enabled many low-income Americans to pay bills and rent and maintain their overall spending, according to data from Opportunity Insights.But the recovery has slowed and certain sectors such as restaurants, hotels, theaters and airlines remain in bad shape, shedding jobs and risking permanent realignment. Without more stimulus, economists expect growth will slow significantly in the final three months of the year.“You’re going to see quite a significant drag on growth,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm. It “would really risk a double-dip recession.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-about-face-donald-trump-seeks-to-salvage-parts-of-coronavirus-aid/story-y9KRTqaLaGYFNgGTzovWMI.html

He added, “I’m ready to take that deal if I can get it -- it sounded awesome.” Stern’s previous five-year contracts have paid him $80 million to $100 million a year.Sirius shares were volatile in premarket trading Wednesday and gained after the open, rising as much as 5.9% to $5.89.Stern said he called his agent upon hearing reports of his potential new contract and “we were both kind of baffled by it.”“I am telling you with my hand over my heart, I don’t have anywhere near a deal,” Stern said.However, laughing with co-host Robin Quivers, Stern added, “I’m telling Sirius now, whatever I read, I want. I’ll take that, right now. I’m a bad negotiator. I’m like, ‘OK, I’ll take it, I’m in, let’s do it.’”Before moving on to talk about the late guitarist Eddie Van Halen, Stern said, “We’ll see what happens.

During the debate, Harris, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump’s handling of Covid-19 crisis and Pence, administration’s coronavirus task force head, are expected to present starkly different visions for a country confronting multiple crises.The debate, scheduled to be broadcast at 9 pm EDT (6:30 am IST on Thursday) and hosted at the University of Utah, is being considered as one of the most highly anticipated vice presidential debates in recent memory. It will be 90 minutes long and divided into nine 10-minute segments.Viewers can catch all the action live as all major networks will be broadcasting the debate. It will also be streaming live on social media platforms including YouTube.Here is what to expect from the vice presidential debate:Two versions of country’s Covid-19 battleThe Covid-19 pandemic is likely to dominate the proceedings as Pence is expected to defend the country’s fight led by Donald Trump during the debate. While Harris is expected to highlight the government’s failure in endorsing face masks and how Trump constantly downplayed the pandemic.The United States is still reeling under Covid-19, as many as 210,000 Americans have lost their lives to the deadly disease. The pandemic has also caused a massive economic crisis with millions of Americans filing for unemployment.‘Too liberal’ HarrisA Joe Biden campaign official said Harris has prepared for Pence to attack her as too liberal, echoing Trump’s assertion that the moderate Biden will advance a “radical left-wing” agenda if elected, news agency Reuters reported.Lesser dramaThough this debate may not match the sheer chaos that took place in the presidential debate when Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden and the two traded insults. It is expected to be fiery as Pence, who once hosted a radio show as a congressman, will debate with Harris who is a former prosecutor and is known for sharp questioning during Senate hearings.White supremacyAfter Biden’ nomination, Harris became the first Black woman to appear on a major party’s vice presidential ticket. As she faces off with Pence, who is white, Harris is expected grill Pence over Trump’s comments at the last debate where he declined to denounce white supremacy groups. During the first debate, the moderator asked whether Trump would condemn white supremacy. Trump responded saying, he mostly sees violence “from the left-wing.”Gender issuesTrump presidency has already been marred by criticism from various woman rights activists who accused the President of being sexist.

07-10-2020||World||Mexico’s Cancun braced for possibly ‘catastrophic’ Hurricane Delta||Mexicans formed long lines at supermarkets near Cancun on Tuesday to stock up in preparation for a hit overnight from powerful Hurricane Delta, which weakened slightly as it bore down on the Caribbean resort and its famous shoreline.Late on Tuesday, the Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (209 kph), down from 145 mph earlier in the evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.“In the Yucatan Peninsula, potentially catastrophic hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the warning area late tonight and early Wednesday,” the NHC said.Late on Tuesday, Delta was about 135 miles (217 km) east-southeast of the island of Cozumel off the coast.Expectations of tropical storm conditions led to evacuations of coastal areas in Cuba. Delta is forecast to weaken and linger over Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula before strengthening again in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil companies were bracing for impact on their installations and ports closed.Officials ordered evacuations of Cancun’s hotel zone and other coastal areas, and opened the city’s convention center as a shelter. Workers at the Avis car rental firm boarded up windows with wood under a light rain on Tuesday afternoon.The governor of Quintana Roo state urged residents near the shore to evacuate, while recommending health precautions in shelters due to the coronavirus pandemic.“We have to prevent Covid in these sites, we have to take all preventative measures to this effect,” Governor Carlos Joaquin said, noting that the hurricane could take 12 hours to pass through the state after touching down by 2 a.m.Joaquin recommended households stock up on food and water for two or three days, anticipating delays in restoring water and electricity.A hurricane watch was in place for an area stretching from the beach town of Tulum, west past Cancun, and including Cozumel, an island made famous by Jacques Cousteau for the quality of its reef scuba diving.PANIC BUYINGSince Monday, local residents have formed long lines at supermarkets and construction stores to load up on food and supplies to protect their homes, television images showed.Panic buying left some shelves empty of basic pantry goods, said Marian Castro, who lives in Cancun’s hotel zone and recalls the destruction wrought by Category 5 Hurricane Wilma in 2005. “I’m not scared, because after Hurricane Wilma ... destroyed my house, this time we’re more prepared,” she said, pointing out her anti-cyclone windows.Water levels could rise by as much as 9 feet (3 m) over normal tide levels near Delta’s landfall, accompanied by dangerous waves in the hurricane warning area.The Yucatan peninsula was hit on the weekend by Hurricane Gamma, a smaller storm that nonetheless damaged property and forced restaurants and attractions to close, including the famed Chichen Itza pyramids.The region at the heart of Mexico’s tourist industry has suffered various setbacks in recent years, most recently from the coronavirus pandemic.Before that, the coast known as the Riviera Maya was affected by swaths of Sargasso seaweed on its pristine beaches.Cuba’s western province of Pinar del Rio and the Island of Youth also hunkered down ahead of tropical storm conditions, with schools closed and coastal areas evacuated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-s-cancun-braced-for-possibly-catastrophic-hurricane-delta/story-abBqZ5tBb8n7WjRtL76f3L.html
07-10-2020||World||Patel calls for review of UK visa used by Indian companies||Britain’s home secretary Priti Patel has ordered a review of the intra-company transfer (ICT) visas mostly issued to Indian companies that transfer employees to UK offices for varying periods, ahead of a new points-based immigration regime that takes effect in January.Official figures show that the ICT visa is mostly issued to Indians, reflecting the growing number of Indian software and other companies setting up base or servicing clients from a UK base. In the year ending June 2020, 48% of Tier 2 visas were granted to Indian professionals.The ICT visa is part of the Tier 2 visa route. Overall, there was a 20% fall in Tier 2 visas granted, and officials said that almost all of the fall was accounted for by a decrease in grants of ICT visas, which decreased by 38% (21,227) to 33,971 in the year ending June 2020. Much of this decline is as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, they added.Commissioning the review, Patel asked the Migration Advisory Committee to advise the Home Office on the salary threshold for entry to the ICT route; what elements, if any, beyond base salary should count towards meeting the salary requirement; whether different arrangements should apply to the very highly paid; what skills threshold for the route should be the conditions of the route, in particular those where it differs from the main Tier 2 route.She wrote to MAC chair Brian Bell: “It is our intention that the ICT route should sit alongside the new skilled worker route in the new points-based immigration system that we are launching in January and that the terms of the ICT route should, initially, be the same as now.”The ICT route currently has a different (and higher) salary threshold compared to the main Tier 2 route and different requirements, and the absence of any relating to English language. It also contains a sub-category for graduate trainees. Indian stakeholders have been urging UK authorities to exclude ICT visa holders from paying the mandatory National Insurance contribution, since they do not stay long enough in the UK to be eligible for state pension. The NI contribution is paid along with income tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patel-calls-for-review-of-uk-visa-used-by-indian-companies/story-M39isKFf1oZ49FhoWUo2FP.html
07-10-2020||World||Gene editing technique gets two women the Nobel prize for chemistry||From the hundred and thousands of years it takes for natural selection to change the genetic makeup of an organism, the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize for Chemistry brought it down to just a few hours. The biochemist duo Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna were named for the prize for developing the revolutionary tool CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors in 2012. Adapted from the naturally occurring DNA-editing tool in the immune system of a bacteria, this “scissor” can be used to edit precise sections of the DNA. “There is enormous power in this genetic tool, which affects us all. It has not only revolutionised basic science, but also resulted in innovative crops and will lead to ground-breaking new medical treatments,” says Claes Gustafsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In the 111 occasions that the Nobel Prize for Chemistry has been awarded since 1901, this is the first time two women have shared it. Till now, only five women had received the award, including Marie Curie in 1911 and her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie in 1935. French microbiologist and biochemist Charpentier, currently the director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, was interested in the research of pathogenic bacteria, particularly one that causes life-threatening complications such as sepsis (blood infection) and soft tissue breakdown in humans called Streptococcus pyogenes. On the other hand, America biochemist Doudna was fascinated with Ribonucleic Acid or RNA that plays a in coding, decoding, regulating and expression of the genes. She was studying the exciting new role of RNA in regulating gene expression, when she stumbled upon CRISPR or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. CRISPR is essentially a sequence that is repeated over and over again between unique sequences in the genetic material of various bacteria. What Doudna found was that the CRISPR associated genes (Cas) were similar to proteins that specialise in unwinding and cutting up DNA. At the same time, Charpentier’s study of the S. pyogenes found another piece of the puzzle – a previously unknown small RNA molecule called tracrRNA that exists in large amounts in the bacterium. Careful analysis of the genetic codes reveals that it indeed it is a part of the bacteria’s repetitive CRISPR system. A collaboration between the two researchers led to the understanding that the Cas9 is the scissor that cuts off the DNA molecule whereas the CRISPR was necessary to recognise where the cuts have to be made. In their natural form, the scissors recognise DNA from viruses, but Charpentier and Doudna proved that by changing the CRISPR part of the scissors to match the code where the cuts are to be made, any DNA could be edited at exactly the right places. Since their discovery, it has become extremely easy for scientists to play with the DNA of organisms to study their effect on the physical form. Apart from basic research, it has also helped in developing crops that can withstand moulds, pests and drought. It is also being used in the field of medicine to find ways to cure cancer and other inherited diseases. Theoretically, the technology makes it possible to select certain traits in off-springs by editing their genomes. But, globally scientists agree that germline editing or editing of traits that can be passed on to the next generation is irresponsible without data on the safety of the procedure. However, a controversy blew in November 2018 up when a Chinese scientist He Jiankui edited the embroyo of twins to delete a gene that makes them susceptible to HIV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gene-editing-technique-gets-two-women-the-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/story-xJvlPu9z28LKUEEzxXnzwK.html
07-10-2020||World||Covid ‘jugaad’: Drive in to a big fat Indian wedding in UK||Thousands of Indian weddings have been postponed due to Covid-19 restrictions, but one couple and an enterprising planner conjured a novel, socially-distanced way to get hitched: it all happened in a drive-in park, with hundreds of guests remaining in cars and many more watching on Zoom.Saheli Mirpuri, a London-based planner, said on Wednesday that when Vinal Patel and Roma Popat got married in Braxted Park in Chelmsford, Essex, on October 2, it rained heavily, but that did not dampen the spirit of the occasion marked with the usual music and noise, aided by a DJ.The event skirted around current restrictions that only 15 people can gather, with guests – attired in designer ‘lehngas’ and ‘sherwanis’ – remaining in cars while the formal ceremony was showcased on a giant screen. Family and friends across the globe watched it on video.Mirpuri, whose family has links in India, said: “Thousands of weddings that usually take place in the summer have been postponed. It has been tough for the industry; billions of pounds have been lost. Guidelines are changing constantly. Many have postponed their big day to 2021”.“This wedding was a nice way to involve more than 15 people. The pre-wedding ‘sangeet’ and other events were held at the couple’s home. It was a risk and challenge for us to organise since it has never been done before; we didn’t know how it would work out,” she added.It took the London-born Mirpuri’s team two months to organise, after she and the couple realised the idea that started as a joke could work out. The guests in cars were provided with a hamper of snacks, hand-gel and plastic bags to put their rubbish in.On the day, the suitably attired Patel entered the park and travelled around in a decorated golf buggy driven by a venue staff member with a face mask. After the ceremony, the couple went round the park to greet the guests, who honked horns and flashed car lights.Mirpuri said: “I am really glad it worked out. We have now received several inquiries from couples. We have a blueprint now for a Covid-secure wedding. There are quite a few venues where similar weddings can be organised, using technology and following socially-distanced norms”.A spokesperson of Braxted Park added: “We are delighted to say…we were able to overcome these new restrictions in a safe and secure way by hosting our first ever (and we believe first for the UK) drive in wedding ceremony here at Braxted Park”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-jugaad-drive-in-to-a-big-fat-indian-wedding-in-uk/story-SOjQY6PuJTYPJdAfQqT7MJ.html

Authorities including U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will observe the process.International travel has barely revived from a total lockdown as national restrictions and quarantines continue to limit services and put people off flying. The CommonPass app could help form the basis of a standardized system to overcome those curbs, according to the WEF, after slow progress with airport testing and so-called travel corridors aimed at restarting flights.The WEF said it developed the app alongside the Commons Project Foundation, a non-profit public trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-app-aims-to-restart-flights-with-proof-of-disease-free-status/story-kSYrGbQE30lU7y0N1CXfkM.html

The apex court last week barred the government from releasing them.Faisal Siddiqi, the lawyer representing Pearl’s family, told the media that the government prosecutor, Fiaz Shah, told the judges he needed more time for paperwork to prepare for the case.The court accepted his argument and adjourned the hearing till October 21.In April, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh, who was convicted in the abduction and murder of Pearl in 2002, to seven years. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case – almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.Two days after the Sindh High Court overturned Sheikh’s conviction, the Sindh government invoked the Maintenance of Public Order to keep the four convicts in jail. The Sindh government filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court verdict. Pearl’s parents also filed an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment of the high court to release the accused.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the alleged links between the country’s powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-s-murder-accused-to-remain-in-jail-for-another-three-months-in-pakistan/story-Svd0EgCZP55ohxOTD4bs7J.html
07-10-2020||World||Israeli PM’s wife may have violated lockdown with haircut||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife may have violated the country’s coronavirus lockdown by inviting a hairdresser into the official residence last week to prepare her for a public service video advocating the wearing of masks.The incident, first reported by the Yediot Ahronot daily, was the latest in a string of lockdown violations by Israeli leaders and public figures — drawing widespread criticism that they are undermining public trust in the government.Yediot reported that Sara Netanyahu had a hairdresser visit on the eve of the festive Sukkot holiday. Hair salons and barber shops are closed as part of a nationwide lockdown imposed last month, and people have been ordered to remain within 1,000 meters (yards) of home except for essential activities.The Netanyahus have long been criticized for enjoying a lavish lifestyle out of the reach of most Israelis. In past cases, Sara Netanyahu was fined thousands of dollars for using public money for her own extravagant tastes and for allegedly abusive behavior toward her personal staff.An official statement released in response to the news report said Sara Netanyahu was strictly abiding by all the coronavirus regulations, including sheltering at home and enforcing the wearing of masks at the official residence.As a public figure making an informational video, she believed she was entitled to employ the services of the hairstylist, the statement said. It added that they both wore masks and gloves during the appointment and that she asked the stylist to refrain from making conversation.The newspaper said that while the prime minister is entitled to such services as a public servant, his wife is not. An ordinary Israeli would pay a 500-shekel ($150) fine for violating the restriction.The prime minister has been the target of mass demonstrations in recent months, with protesters calling on him to step down while he is on trial for corruption and criticizing his response to the coronavirus.Israelis have also expressed anger about a number of recent instances in which senior officials and their family members violated lockdown orders. Netanyahu and the figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin, have both acknowledged improperly hosting relatives during the Passover holiday last spring.A Cabinet minister from Netanyahu’s Likud Party, Gila Gamliel, sparked uproar this week when it was discovered that she improperly traveled to the northern city of Tiberias for the Yom Kippur holy day last week and contracted the coronavirus. Israeli media have said she also lied to contact tracing investigators about her whereabouts.In June 2019, a court ordered Sara Netanyahu to pay a fine of more than $15,000 for misusing state funds after she was accused of misusing some $100,000 in state money on lavish meals. In 2016, a court ruled that she had mistreated a housecleaner and awarded the man $42,000 in damages. Other employees have also accused her of abuse.The Netanyahus have rejected all the allegations against them. Both say they have been the target of a “witch hunt” by hostile media and law enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-s-wife-may-have-violated-lockdown-with-haircut/story-DKhUtiOBOGxXRkPrEb8iRM.html
07-10-2020||World||Hurricane Delta, moving towards Mexico, weakens to category 3 storm||Hurricane Delta weakened to a Category 3 storm just hours before hitting the coast of Mexico, but remains life threatening.Maximum sustained winds are near 115 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour) and the storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 8-12 feet along the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, the National Hurricane Center said on Wednesday. The hurricane is predicted to strengthen again to Category 4 as it moves over the Gulf of Mexico toward the U.S. in the coming days.“Little change in strength is expected before the center reaches the coast of the Yucatan peninsula during the next few hours,” the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. “Although some weakening is likely when Delta moves over the Yucatan peninsula, re-strengthening is forecast when the hurricane moves over the southern Gulf of Mexico Wednesday night and Thursday.”The hurricane is forecast to churn through the energy-producing region of the Gulf before likely hitting Louisiana, which has been struck twice already this year, on Saturday.Delta’s winds can snap trees, flatten houses and cause power outages lasting weeks.“Extremely dangerous storm surge and hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico,” said Dan Brown, a meteorologist with the center.Delta threatens to become the latest in a string of deadly natural disasters in 2020, a year that has been marked by a hyperactive hurricane season, devastating wildfires and a derecho that wreaked havoc across the U.S. Midwest. It will be the record 10th tropical storm or hurricane to hit the U.S. in a year. So many have formed that the hurricane center has used up all the names on its official list and has resorted to the Greek alphabet to designate systems.Delta’s winds grew from 70 mph to 110 mph in 24 hours, which is the fastest intensification for an October storm since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Colorado State University’s Klotzbach said in a Tweet.Cancun and the nearby island of Cozumel are poised to “get hit hard,” said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. Delta could cause $12 billion to $16 billion in damage and losses to Mexico and another $2 billion to the U.S. coast later this week, depending on its exact path, he said.Mexico has started to evacuate the hotel zone in Cancun and the island of Holbox as the Yucatan readies for the impact of Delta, Quintana Roo Governor Carlos Joaquin said in a tweet. Meanwhile, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tuesday he’s sending 5,000 members of Mexico’s armed forces to the Yucatan for prevention efforts.Hurricane Wilma forced 70,000 people to flee and left 300,000 homeless after it struck the Yucatan in October 2005, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information. The storm came ashore with winds of 130 mph near Playa del Carmen on Oct. 22.Oil and gas producers including Enbridge Inc., BHP Group and Royal Dutch Shell Plc were evacuating or preparing to evacuate workers from Gulf platforms ahead of Delta. Operators had shut about 29% of crude production and 8.6% of gas output, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. The hurricane is poised to clip the Cameron liquefied natural gas plant, which had just resumed exports after being shut in late-August.After Delta loses power over the Yucatan, it’s expected to return briefly to Category 4 strength in the Gulf as it moves toward Louisiana, which was struck by Hurricane Laura in August. Cool water and wind shear in the northern Gulf could weaken Delta, but it will likely make landfall again as a hurricane, said Rob Miller, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc.“There is an increasing likelihood of life-threatening storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds, especially along the coasts of Louisiana and Mississippi, beginning on Friday,” the hurricane center’s Brown said in an advisory.New Orleans urged residents to “gather food, water & medication for at least three days” in a text via its emergency alert system on Tuesday.Miller said he expects the storm to strike somewhere west of New Orleans, but storm surge, heavy rains and winds could reach as far east as the Florida Panhandle.“This region of the county is the magnet for hurricanes this year,” Miller said.The Atlantic has spawned 25 storms this year, the second most on record after 2005, when deadly Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans.(Updates with category downgrade.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-delta-moving-towards-mexico-weakens-to-category-3-storm/story-9hAhZbgnOtMj1TfgJxm4eL.html

Tsikhanouskaya went into exile in Lithuania after the Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus, which election officials claimed that Lukashenko won in a landslide. Opposition figures and some poll workers say the results were fraudulent and tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest.Late last month, Tsikhanouskaya met with French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been pushing for European mediation in the Belarus political crisis. The European Union said last month it does not recognize Lukashenko as president of Belarus.Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, has sought to crack down on protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-opposition-leader-to-meet-top-german-officials-day-after-meeting-chancellor-angela-merkel/story-jqpWovqTYouGUycE34WseL.html

Ha said the committee decided not to provide further details about Jo for his safety.Ha didn’t say how he obtained the information. It’s likely that he was debriefed about Jo by the National Intelligence Service, the country’s main spy agency, as committee members routinely meet NIS officers for discussions on North Korea.The NIS said it was checking reports about Jo’s arrival. South Korea’s foreign and unification ministries said they couldn’t confirm the reports.Before Jo, Thae Yong Ho, a former minister at the North Korean Embassy in London, was the most senior North Korean diplomat to defect to South Korea. He came to Seoul in 2016 and was elected to parliament this year. Thae said he had decided to defect because didn’t want his children to live “miserable” lives in North Korea and he was disappointed with Kim Jong Un.Thae issued a statement urging media outlets to refrain from exposing too much about Jo, citing worries about possible reprisal on his daughter left in North Korea.The motive for Jo’s departure from his Rome residence isn’t known. North Korea’s state media haven’t mentioned his possible defection.About 33,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the late 1990s to avoid political suppression and poverty in the North.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-north-korean-ambassador-to-italy-living-in-south-korea-claims-lawmaker/story-FLFoWSP5GELOM13TjLOIXN.html
07-10-2020||World||Post-Brexit UK to create freeports to court foreign investment||As the UK’s final exit from the European Union on December 31 draws near, the Boris Johnson government on Wednesday announced the creation of freeports that will offer tax reliefs, simplified customs procedures and duty suspension on goods.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said sea, air and rail ports in England will be invited to bid for freeport status before the end of this year, with the government aiming for the first of the new sites to be open for business in 2021.A firm can import goods into a freeport without paying tariffs, process them into a final good and then either pay a tariff on goods sold into the domestic market, or export the final goods without paying UK tariffs.Officials said the freeports are designed to attract major domestic and international investment, the hubs of enterprise will allow places to carry out business inside a country’s land border but where different customs rules apply. They have been successfully used in countries around the world to drive prosperity and boost trade.Sunak, said: “Our new freeports will create national hubs for trade, innovation and commerce, regenerating communities across the UK and supporting jobs.” “They will attract investment from around the world as we embrace new opportunities following our departure from the EU and will be a key driver for economic recovery as we build back better post coronavirus.”Besides freeports in England, the government plans to set up at least one freeport in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The government will also introduce a package of tax reliefs on investment by businesses within freeport tax sites, new measures to speed up planning processes to accelerate development in and around freeports.The freeports are to be selected through a fair, transparent and competitive process, and will be expected to collaborate closely with key partners across the public and private sectors. The bidding process for locations to become a freeport in England will open by the end of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-brexit-uk-to-create-freeports-to-court-foreign-investment/story-u1pssmDtVZEivaPDAzppWP.html

The White House, in a statement late on Tuesday night, said that the President is improving America’s work visa programmes to prioritise the highest-skilled workers and protect the American jobs and wages amidst the severe impact on the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic. The statement came hours after the Trump administration announced new restrictions on H-1B nonimmigrant visa programme which it said is aimed at protecting American workers, restoring integrity and to better guarantee that H-1B petitions are approved only for qualified beneficiaries and petitioners, a move which is likely to affect thousands of Indian professionals. The interim final rule announced by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday, less than four weeks ahead of the US presidential election, will narrow the definition of “specialty occupation” as Congress intended by closing the overbroad definition that allowed companies to game the system. The White House said that Trump is committed to making sure the American workers are not disadvantaged by foreign labour. “President Trump knows that H-1B visas should only be reserved for specialised talent that helps support a strong economy. For too long, this programme has been misused as an inexpensive labour programme, replacing American jobs in the process,” it said. “These critical reforms will improve the quality of the H-1B programme without changing the annual statutory cap for H-1B visas. The Trump administration is closing loopholes that have allowed employers in the United States to replace American workers with low-cost foreign labour,” the White House said. The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Such a decision by the Trump administration is likely to have an adverse impact on thousands of Indian IT professionals. Already a large number of Indians on the H-1B visas have lost their jobs and are headed back home during the coronavirus pandemic that has severely hit the US economy. The White House said that the Department of Homeland Security is tightening standards to require that foreign workers show specialised merit to establish their eligibility. It is also taking action to rein in “shadow,” third-party employers who use the H-1B programme to displace American workers and to reduce the validity period for H-1Bs used by these “shadow” employers, which will ensure more frequent vetting for compliance with H-1B programme requirements, the White House said. The Department of Homeland Security is codifying the existing authorities to conduct workforce inspections and clarifying that failure to fully cooperate with inspections may result in the denial or revocation of employer H-1B petitions, it said. “The Department of Labor is publishing a rule to appropriately identify the wage levels for H-1Bs and other foreign labour programmes, which will improve the quality of H-1B workers and better reflect wages paid to similarly employed workers in the United States,” the White House said. The rule will limit an employer’s ability to replace workers with cheap foreign labour and help ensure wages are not suppressed by the presence of low-cost foreign workers, it said. Asserting that Trump continues to stand up for the nation’s workers by taking action to preserve jobs for the American citizens, the White House said that earlier this year, the president signed an executive order to prevent federal dollars from being used to displace Americans with foreign workers or offshore labour. “To aid our nation’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the President placed a temporary pause on multiple categories of aliens from coming into the country for work. The Trump administration issued regulations that will, once in effect, remove the incentive to apply for asylum for the purpose of obtaining authorisation to work in the United States,” the White House said. Trump has worked tirelessly to reshore American supply chains, bring investments home from overseas and implement policies that promote buying and hiring American, it said. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin alleged that the “last-minute step is a ploy” to cover up for the President’s broken promise to stop H-1B abuse. “He never responded to my call at the start of his term to protect workers from H-1B abuses. Instead, his administration has granted tens of thousands of H-1B visas to outsourcing companies,” he said. Republican Congressman Lance Gooden supported the move. “The rule changes to H-1B visas are much needed reforms to a wildly abused programme. American workers who are struggling to get back on their feet will benefit from closing these loopholes,” Gooden said. Senator Marsha Blackburn thanked Trump for putting American workers first. “Refining the H-1B non-immigrant visa programme will protect US workers and restore integrity to the programme,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h-1b-visas-should-be-reserved-only-for-specialised-talent-to-support-strong-economy-white-house/story-tLxdtNelSoqBqRxHSlbxwO.html
07-10-2020||World||Australia expects Covid-19 vaccination is still a year away||Australia considered a rollout of a coronavirus vaccine no sooner than mid-2021 a best-case scenario in its pandemic planning that would save the economy tens of billions of dollars, the treasurer said on Wednesday.The Treasury and Health Departments developed economic modelling based on an assumption that a vaccine would be widely available in Australia toward the end of next year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.“These are very uncertain times and as a government, we have taken every step possible to give Australia the best possible chance of getting a vaccine,” Frydenberg told the National Press Club.Treasury modelling doesn’t contemplate a vaccine becoming available in Australia early next year. An early vaccine is regarded as one that is rolled out from July 1, providing certainty to households and businesses while promoting consumption and investment.This so-called upside scenario also assumes that international students would return to Australian universities late next year due to the vaccine. Hundreds of thousands of students from overseas have made the Australian universities sector one of the nation’s biggest earners of foreign currency.The scenario would boost Australian economic activity by 34 billion Australian dollars (USD 24 billion) above the current forecast in the June quarter of 2022. Economic growth would be 1.5 percentage points higher in the 2021-22 fiscal year than the 4.75 per cent currently forecast.Researchers are working on developing more than 170 potential Covid-19 vaccines. A June survey of 28 mostly US and Canadian vaccinology experts published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found most were pessimistic a vaccine would be available before mid-2021, but thought September or October was achievable.Frydenberg on Tuesday announced a raft of pandemic measures that would create a record Australian dollars 214 billion (USD 153 billion) deficit in the current fiscal year. Based on the assumption that a vaccine will become available closer to the end of 2021 than July, annual deficits are forecast to shrink in the next fiscal year and beyond.“We’re all hopeful ... that we will find a vaccine, and we have made that assumption based on the end of next year, but obviously as there are developments in the health and the global community, we’ll continue to update our position,” Frydenberg said on Wednesday.“There is a great deal of uncertainty in this pandemic,” he added.Australia has allowed for an earlier vaccine rollout with doses manufactured locally under deals struck with two pharmaceutical companies.If trials prove successful, the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca and the University of Queensland/CSL will provide more than 84.8 million vaccine doses for the Australian population, almost entirely manufactured in Melbourne, with early access to 3.8 million doses of the University of Oxford vaccine in January and February 2021.The government has committed to make any vaccine available for free to Australia’s population of 26 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-expects-covid-19-vaccination-is-still-a-year-away/story-KOtgoRUgTmTL1TN9MtdQqI.html
07-10-2020||World||US agency wants two months safety data before approving Covid-19 vaccine||The US Food and Drug Administration made public its guidance for issuing emergency approval for a Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday, making it clear it wants to see follow-up two months after trial volunteers have their second dose.It is therefore unlikely for President Donald Trump’s administration to have a vaccine on the market before the November 3 election, something the president frequently says is on the cards.“Data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile,” the document said.The two companies that are furthest along in their vaccine trials, Moderna and Pfizer, both began their final stages at the end of July, and both require two separate injections 28 days apart.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThat would mean that only the first few people who signed up for the trial would have completed the follow-up period by the end of October, and there would probably not be enough data to apply for emergency use.The vaccines will have to inoculate half of all patients against Covid-19. Additionally, there will need to be at least five cases of severe infection in the placebo group to prove the vaccine is effective.“FDA is committed to making the #Covid19 vaccine development process & our scientific evaluation as open & transparent as possible,” the agency’s head Stephen Hahn wrote on Twitter.The decision to issue the guidance comes amid a reported tug-of-war between the White House and the FDA.According to US media outlets, the White House viewed the two-month follow-up period as unnecessary and did not want the FDA to implement it.Trump expressed his disapproval on Twitter Tuesday night, writing: “New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job!”The news was welcomed by health experts who said it showed the agency was acting responsibly in the face of political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agency-wants-two-months-safety-data-before-approving-covid-19-vaccine/story-ycGczxN0qB72HiTpGiSNFI.html
07-10-2020||World||Sri Lanka widens curfew over Covid-19, those evading treatment to face legal action||Authorities in Sri Lanka on Wednesday widened a curfew and warned of legal action against those evading treatment for Covid-19 after reporting an escalating cluster centered around a garment factory in the capital’s suburbs.The number of confirmed cases has risen to 830 while more than 1,500 people have been asked to quarantine at their homes, health authorities said.The Indian Ocean island nation had just reported its first community infection in two months on Sunday. The majority of the infected people are co-workers of the first patient, who was diagnosed at a hospital at the weekend and is from the densely populated Western province that includes the capital, Colombo.Hundreds of people — both factory workers and residents — waited in lines Tuesday at makeshift medical centers to be tested for the coronavirus in the small town of Minuwangoda, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Colombo, where the factory is located.Some who had tested positive were refusing to go to state-run treatment centers even after the government provided them with transport, Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said.A statement from Wanniarachchi warned that legal action will be taken under quarantine regulations against those who evade treatment. Violators of the law could face a fine and imprisonment up to three months.Separately, the health ministry ordered a halt to public gatherings such as exhibitions, parties, conferences, indoor or outdoor events, carnivals, musical shows and processions.And police have widened the curfew in key suburbs of Colombo where many of the patients live. Previously, the government had closed schools, universities and imposed restrictions on public transport.Chief epidemiologist Dr. Sudath Samaraweera said the new cluster poses a greater risk of spreading the virus in the broader society compared to Sri Lanka’s previous clusters.The government had long touted it had prevented community spread of the virus in Sri Lanka because all previously known cases were connected to 31 clusters and of them, only two remain active.Samaraweera said the risk is high with the new cluster as workers used to work very closely and also go home every day and mingle with others in the society. “Therefore, if people do not support us, we will find it difficult to control this.”Some of the workers come from different parts of the country.

The Covid-19 pandemic is estimated to push an additional 88 million to 115 million people into extreme poverty this year, with the total rising to as many as 150 million by 2021, depending on the severity of the economic contraction, according to the Washington-based global lender. This would represent a regression to the rate of 9.2 per cent in 2017, according to the biennial Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report. Had the pandemic not convulsed the globe, the poverty rate would have been expected to drop to 7.9 per cent in 2020, it said. “The pandemic and global recession may cause over 1.4 per cent of the world’s population to fall into extreme poverty,” World Bank Group President David Malpass said. “In order to reverse this serious setback to development progress and poverty reduction, countries will need to prepare for a different economy post-Covid, by allowing capital, labour, skills and innovation to move into new businesses and sectors,” he said. Noting that the new poor will be in countries that already have high poverty rates, the report said that a number of middle-income countries will see significant numbers of people slip below the extreme poverty line. About 82 per cent of the total will be in middle-income countries, the report estimates. The convergence of the Covid-19 pandemic with the pressures of conflict and climate change will put the goal of ending poverty by 2030 beyond reach without swift, significant and substantial policy action, the World Bank said, adding that by 2030, the global poverty rate could be about seven per cent. In its report, the World Bank noted that the lack of recent data for India severely hinders the ability to monitor global poverty. Absence of recent data on India, one of the economies with the largest population of extreme poor, creates substantial uncertainty around the current estimates of global poverty, the Bank said. Observing that effective approaches have tapped the skills and dedication of community members, the World Bank said that in Mumbai, city officials were able to stem the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Dharavi, one of the city’s largest urban settlements, by mobilising community members and staff from private medical clinics for a strategy based on mass screening for fever and oxygen levels. In the space of three months, by July 2020, reported cases in the area had been cut to 20 per cent of their peak in May. To help poor families during the lockdown, foundations, non-governmental organisations and volunteers provided thousands of households with ration kits. Dharavi’s success stemmed from a combination of “customised solutions, community involvement and perseverance, it added. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 35 million people and killed more than 1 million across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 7.5 million cases and more than 2,10,000 deaths. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment.

Here’s what happened||White House senior adviser Stephen Miller is the latest in Donald Trump’s close circle to have tested Covid-19 positive on Tuesday. Before him, several senior officials have reported positive crushing the myth of invincibility surrounding the White House. United States President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for the infection on October 2. Three days later, President Trump returned to the White House while still being infectious. Trump’s recent post that Covid-19 is just a flu is yet another remark which has drawn flak with Facebook and Twitter taking requisite action. “Take a look at what happened this week at the White House ,” top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said in an interview with American University’s Kennedy Political Union, when asked what advice he had about how people could discuss preventive actions with relatives who believed the pandemic was a hoax. Trump on many occasions has been spotted without a mask or face covering and his approach to ‘get out there and not fear Covid-19’ has further raised questions about the President’s concern towards the pandemic.Also Watch l ‘Don’t let Covid dominate you’: Trump returns to White House, removes mask Also Read: Facebook, Twitter take action over Trump’s posts suggesting Covid-19 is ‘just like flu’A ceremony held for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett at the Rose Garden on September 26 is being speculated as a Covid-19 spreader after several top White House members got infected post this event.Here is a look at some of the White House members who have contracted Covid-19:1.

The Bundle and Bhuddo islands that lie on one side of the city have largely remained untouched, with little vegetation and almost no humans living on them. Over the years, hundreds of strays, often escaping the cull, have found refuge on the islands and are helped by local fishermen who bring food and water to them on a regular basis. “If these dogs were living in the city they would have been shot dead by the municipal authorities,” says one animal rights activist. It is believed that local fishermen brought the dogs to the island to save them from imminent death.Most stray dogs in Karachi are killed by special squads who offer them poisoned food or shoot them. Dogs are considered unclean so there is little resistance against this culling activity from the local population.Last month, in a meeting between Prime Minister Khan and some leading businessmen, a consortium was formed to invest in two mega development projects — Urban Development and Bundle Island Project (UDBSP) in Karachi and Ravi RiverFront Urban Development Project (RRFUDP).The plan is to build a housing and entertainment complex on these islands and construct a causeway to connect the city to them. Currently the only way to reach these islands is by boat.A ray of hope has emerged in the form of the provincial Sindh government which objects to the manner in which the islands have been taken away from it. After Islamabad issued an ordinance to establish an Island Development Authority, the provincial government lodged a protest.Sindh government spokesman Murtaza Wahab said any island in Pakistani territory comes under the domain of the provinces. “The federal government took an unconstitutional step after issuing the island ordinance,” he said and demanded the government to immediately withdraw the ordinance.The Sindh government has said it will go to court to stop any construction taking place on the islands. But shipping minister Ali Zaidi under whose domain falls this issue has said that the government “will go ahead, no matter what.” In the meantime all the dogs can do is watch and wait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/karachi-s-famous-dog-islands-under-threat-of-urban-development/story-480rBWC3x8Lp9AmW3EJgrM.html
07-10-2020||World||Canada’s Justin Trudeau govt survives confidence vote||The Justin Trudeau government in Canada has survived a confidence vote in parliament after garnering support from the New Democratic Party, while every other opposition group voted against it.In the House of Commons, 177 voted in favour of the Throne Speech, the policy programme of the government presented by the Governor General when the session commenced. That was 25 more than the 152 MPs who voted against the Liberal Party government.This will also mean that the possibility of a snap election in autumn has receded.Jagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP, instructed members of his caucus to support the government after it made a pair of concessions in the benefits package that will come into effect to counter the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Among these are a national sickness benefit that will be available to those who are not covered by their employers, and an increase in the weekly payment from the proposed $400 to $500 to those rendered unemployed or underemployed due to the coronavirus crisis under the Canada Recovery Benefit.After the count was announced, leader of the government in the House Pablo Rodriguez tweeted, “The House just voted in favour of the Speech from the Throne. We are moving forward with our plan to protect the health and safety of Canadians while creating good jobs.”The two largest opposition parties in the House, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, voted against the government. They were joined by the Green Party, which had usually sided with the Liberals in recent times. Newly elected Green leader Annamie Paul, who recently became the first Black permanent leader of a federal party, described the government’s schemes as “platitudes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-justin-trudeau-govt-survives-confidence-vote/story-yxiSSj9p367t6fATeTHvLJ.html
07-10-2020||World||Trump admin orders better pays, higher qualifications for H-1Bs||The Trump administration on Tuesday announced new rules that will significantly raise wages for foreign workers on H-1B and narrow the eligibility criteria to qualify for these high-skilled visas. Both measures were aimed at preventing this programme from being used to displace Americans.Indian professionals are the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 visas issued every year.“These regulations seem to be based on misinformation about the programme and runs counterproductive to their very objective of saving the American economy and jobs,” said Nasscom, a trade body of India’s IT businesses. “This is particularly relevant at a time when U.S. businesses continues to face a huge deficit of STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills.”The White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump wanted to improve work visa programmes to “prioritise the highest-skilled workers and protect American jobs and wages” and intended H-1B visas to “be reserved for specialised talent that helps support a strong economy”. The changes announced on Tuesday will be introduced as “interim final rules” and will go into effect separately, issued by separate federal agencies. The rule on higher wages, which goes into effect from Thursday, will be issued by the department of labour . It will be aimed at “strengthening wage protections, addressing abuses in these visa programmes, and ensuring American workers are not undercut by cheaper foreign labour”, said secretary of labour Eugene Scalia.US employers hiring foreign workers on H-1B and other work visas will be required to pay foreign workers prevailing wages or the actual wage paid to other employees with similar experience and qualifications. The labour department will publish profession-specific prevailing wages based on surveys.“The prevailing wage rates in these programmes thus play an integral role in protecting US workers from unfair competition posed by the entry of lower cost foreign labour into the US labour market,” said the department.Critics of the H-1B programme have long argued it has been used to displace American workers by outsourcing their jobs to companies that use foreign workers, who are cheaper. The department of homeland security’s interim final rule (IFR) changing the definition of “speciality occupation” is expected to become effective in 60 days. The department said the rule will narrow the definition of specialty occupation by “closing the over-broad definition that allowed companies to game the system”.A basic college degree will not be sufficient any longer to quality for an H-B under the new rule. An applicant for a job in electrical engineering, for instance, will be required to have a degree in electrical engineering, not computers.“We have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security. Put simply, economic security is homeland security. In response, we must do everything we can within the bounds of the law to make sure the American worker is put first,” said DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf.The new rule is expected to cut the number of H-1B petitions filed every year — around 200,000 — by a third, according to a senior DHS official.The department will also closely monitor third-party employers who hire H-1B workers and contract them out to work for US companies. The White House called them “shadow” employers. Their employees will be granted reduced validity H-1B visa, possibly a year at a time. The normal term is three years, extendable by another three.The DHS said it was skipping the usual notice-and-comment period as it rushes the rule to ensure that employing H-1B workers will not “worsen the economic crisis caused by Covid-19 and adversely affect wages and working conditions of similarly employed US workers.”But the H-1B programme has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration from 2017, when the president signed the Buy American, Hire American executive order intending to rid the programme of abuse and fraud.“The pandemic has given this administration a pretext to enact all sorts of damaging and extreme immigration restrictions—against refugees, relatives of US citizens, and highly skilled immigrants as well,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Obama White House and is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.The rules are expected to be challenged in courts on the grounds, among other things, the forgoing of the notice-and-comments period.President Trump has suspended all immigrant and non-immigrants visas — except for certain health professionals — to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs becoming available in an economy crippled by Covid-19 and related lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-orders-better-pays-higher-qualifications-for-h-1bs/story-OVxIMFH2hX4mVIJYnwrDkN.html

07-10-2020||World||Category 4 Hurricane Delta roars towards Mexico’s Cancun area||Hurricane Delta, a slightly weakened but still dangerous Category 4 storm, barrelled toward Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) for an expected landfall south of the Cancun resort before dawn Wednesday. Quintana Roo Gov. Carlos Joaquín said the state government had prepared, but warned residents and tourists that “it is a strong, powerful hurricane,” though he considered it a good sign that Delta had weakened a bit late Tuesday. He said the area hadn’t seen a storm like it since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Delta increased in strength by 80 mph in just 24 hours, more than doubling from a 60 mph storm at 2 p.m. EDT Monday to 140 mph at 2 p.m. EDT Tuesday. Its top winds peaked at 145 mph (230 kph) before weakening slightly late Tuesday as it closed in on Yucatan. Forecasters warned it was still an extremely dangerous storm despite that weakening, saying it threatened to bring a life-threatening storm surge that could raise water levels 9 to 13 feet (2.7 to 4 meters), along with large and dangerous waves and flash flooding inland. Delta was centered 135 miles (220 kilometers) from Cozumel late Tuesday and moving west-northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Thousands of Quintana Roo residents and tourists waited for the storm hunkered down in dozens of government shelters. Everyone was ordered off the streets by 7 p.m. Throughout Tuesday the evacuations of low lying areas, islands and the coastline expanded as Delta exploded over warm Caribbean waters into a major hurricane. Much of Cancun’s hotel zone was cleared out as guests were bused to inland shelters. In Cancun alone, the government opened 160 shelters. Some 300 guests and nearly 200 staff from the Fiesta Americana Condesa hotel were taken to the Technological Institute of Cancun campus. All wearing masks, they spread out on thin mattresses in a classroom building and tried to get comfortable as workers boarded the building’s windows in a light rain. Some played cards or watched videos on their phones, while others called relatives. “The hotel has done a good job of making sure that we were provided for and that we’re going to be safe here in this place, so we don’t have any concerns at all,” said Shawn Sims, a tourist from Dallas sheltering with his wife, Rashonda Cooper, and their sons, 7-year-old Liam and 4-year-old Easton. “This is my first (hurricane) experience, but I see that these guys have a plan and they know what they’re doing,” Sims said. State tourism officials said more than 40,000 tourists were in Quintana Roo, a fraction of what would normally be there. Delta’s damage comes on top of months of pandemic-induced lockdown that has devastated the state’s tourism industry. At the Cancun Convention Center, 400 tourists from hotels and rental properties bunked for the night. “We hope that in this place we are surely much safer,” Quintana Roo Tourism Secretary Marisol Vanegas said. “This is a structure that has withstood other hurricanes.” Delta was forecast to spend several hours lashing the Yucatan Peninsula before moving into the Gulf of Mexico and re-strengthening before a strike on the U.S. Gulf coast later in the week. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Delta was expected to make landfall there Friday night or Saturday morning and the entire state is in the storm’s possible path. State and local officials in coastal areas were shoring up levees, sandbagging and taking other protections measures, he said. Louisiana is still recovering from Hurricane Laura, which ravaged the southwestern region as it roared ashore as a Category 4 storm in August. More than 6,600 Laura evacuees remain in hotels around the state, mainly in New Orleans, because their homes are too heavily damaged to return. Mexico put the commander of its navy in charge of the federal response. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Tuesday that 5,000 federal troops and emergency personnel were being made available in Quintana Roo to aid in storm efforts. Local and state officials urged residents to move to shelters. Juan Carlos Avila arrived at the Technological Institute of Cancun shelter with his seven-months pregnant wife, Joselyn, and their 3-year-old-son, Alexander. He said the staff had made them comfortable and seemed well prepared. The family, which lives in Miami, had been in Cancun a week and already went through Tropical Storm Gamma, which soaked the area over the weekend. “We’ve practically lived in storms during our stay here in Cancun,” Avila said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/category-4-hurricane-delta-roars-towards-mexico-s-cancun-area/story-81YYrdZdlZMJgydecendnI.html
07-10-2020||World||US tightens rules for H-1B visas used by tech firms||President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday unveiled a tightening of rules for immigration visas used widely by technology firms, claiming the new system would be better for American workers.The Department of Homeland Security announced the new regulations for so-called H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, which allow up to 85,000 immigrants annually.The move marked a new step aimed at tightening immigration under the Trump administration, which sought to block the H-1B program in a move halted last week by a federal judge.Tuesday’s new regulations, details of which were not disclosed, would narrow the definition of “specialty occupation” which according to DHS “allowed companies to game the system.”The plan, to be implemented after a 60-day comment period, would also seek to require firms to make “real” offers to US residents before seeking to bring in foreigners and add new compliance mechanisms.The visa program has been widely used by Silicon Valley firms to bring in engineers and other skilled workers, many coming from India. Critics have said the program has depressed salaries in some professions. “We have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security,” acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement.“Put simply, economic security is homeland security. In response, we must do everything we can within the bounds of the law to make sure the American worker is put first.”Last week, US District Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction to block the government from ending the H-1B visa program, in a case brought by the US Chamber of Commerce and supported by technology trade groups.TechNet, a trade group which includes many Silicon Valley firms, denounced the new regulations, calling it an effort to circumvent the court order.“The administration is flouting the court’s ruling by issuing different rules to try to obtain the result it wants,” TechNet president Linda Moore said.“This new rule only harms America’s ability to recover from the pandemic during this critical time and has zero impact on increasing domestic American jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tightens-rules-for-h-1b-visas-used-by-tech-firms/story-gD8Z2xbTiFDzcvtZjrtBhP.html

07-10-2020||World||Covid: Trump administration to sharply limit skilled-worker visas amid job losses||The Trump administration announced plans Tuesday to sharply limit visas for skilled workers from overseas, a move officials said was a priority amid job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor officials said new rules for what’s known as the H1-B program will restrict who can obtain a work visa and will impose additional salary requirements on companies seeking to hire foreign workers.Acting Deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said about one-third of the people who have applied for H1-B visas in recent years would be denied under the new rules, which also will include limits on the number of specialty occupations available under the program.President Donald Trump in June issued an order temporarily suspending the H-1B program until the end of the year.The new rules reflect a broader effort by his administration to curb both legal and illegal immigration, an issue important to Trump’s base even if it’s less prominent in his campaign this year than in 2016.A new requirement that employers pay higher prevailing wages to foreign workers will take effect in the coming days, reflecting the need to help the job market recover from the coronavirus shutdown, said Deputy Secretary of Labor Patrick Pizzella.“With millions of Americans looking for work, as the economy continues its recovery, immediate action is needed to guard against the risk lower-cost foreign labor can pose to the well-being of US workers,” Pizzella said.The H-1B program was created under President George H.W. Bush to help companies fill specialized jobs as the tech sector began to boom and it was harder to find qualified workers. Many companies insist they still need the program to fill critical positions.Critics include labor advocates as well as people who seek limits on legal immigration. But supporters argue that H-1B holders fill critical needs and don’t necessarily take jobs from Americans, but rather help expand the economy and create more opportunity.Increasing the required wages will especially hurt startups and smaller enterprises that may be unable to meet the increased requirements, said Cornell University Law School professor Steve Yale-Loehr, an expert in immigration law. “Companies may decide to offshore jobs overseas, hurting US workers,” said Yale-Loehr.Cuccinelli and Pizzella said the program has been abused to allow companies to displace American workers with less expensive employees from overseas.“US workers are being ousted from good paying, middle-class jobs and replaced with non-US workers,” Pizzella said. “It has also caused US wages in some instances to stagnate. That is wrong.”Among the new rules are significant limits on “offsite” firms that bring in large numbers of H-1B visa holders and then provide those workers under contract to other companies for a fee, a loophole that has been the subject of fraud and other abuse.There would also be increased workplace inspections and additional oversight of the H-1B program, Cuccinelli said.The US can issue up to 85,000 H-1B visas per year in technology, life sciences, health care and other sectors. They are typically issued for an initial period of three years and can be renewed. People from India and China make up the majority of the estimated 500,000 H-1B visa holders in the US. Officials said the Department of Labor rules would take effect immediately after publication in the federal register later this week while those that fall under the Department of Homeland Security would be adopted after a public comment period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-trump-administration-to-sharply-limit-skilled-worker-visas-amid-job-losses/story-4RjQa2FUNPkaMdfhGmL89N.html
07-10-2020||World||Democrats ask if more material omitted from SC nominee Barrett’s response||Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are calling on the Justice Department to provide any missing materials from a questionnaire completed by Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.Barrett, who was nominated to the high court last month by President Donald Trump, signed a 2006 newspaper ad sponsored by an anti-abortion group in which she said she opposed “abortion on demand” and defended “the right to life from fertilization to the end of natural life.”The ad was not included in materials Barrett provided to the Judiciary Committee for her pending Supreme Court nomination, nor in 2017, when she was nominated to the job she holds as a Chicago-based federal appeals court judge.In a letter Tuesday signed by all 10 Democrats on the Judiciary panel, lawmakers asked the Justice Department to explain the omission and confirm whether any other materials have been left out from the Senate questionnaire. If so, the department should immediately provide the materials for committee review, the senators said.A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department has received the letter and is reviewing it.Democrats don’t have the votes to block Barrett’s nomination, but they are trying to slow it down as Republicans speed ahead with an aggressive timetable, starting with hearings next week, aimed at confirming her before the election. Trump backs moving ahead quickly and on Tuesday called off negotiations on further coronavirus relief, saying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should focus “full time” on confirming Barrett.The 2006 ad, an open letter signed by Barrett and others, “opposed women’s reproductive freedoms and explicitly called for overturning Roe v. Wade,’‘ the landmark Supreme Court decision on abortion, senators wrote. The ad also referred to “the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.’‘The ad, which had more than 1,200 names attached to it, appears to be the most direct expression of Barrett’s opposition to abortion and has intensified debate over whether she would vote to restrict, if not overturn, abortion rights if confirmed to the Supreme Court.Barrett’s failure to disclose the 2006 letter “leads to additional questions about other potentially missing materials,’‘ the Democratic senators wrote in the letter.It also raises concerns that the process of collecting materials responsive to the Senate questionnaire, “like the nomination process itself, has been rushed, for no legitimate reason,” the senators wrote. The letter was signed by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, and nine other Democrats.White House spokesperson Judd Deere said last week that Barrett, who is Catholic, has distinguished her personal views from her responsibilities as a judge. “As Judge Barrett said on the day she was nominated, ‘A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold,’ ” Deere said in an email.Meanwhile, an outside group advocating for conservative judges announced on Tuesday a 15-member team of pro bono legal professionals who will be conducting rapid response and other campaign-style support for Barrett’s confirmation.“The confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett is the opportunity of more than a lifetime to create the first true conservative majority on the Supreme Court in over 80 years,” said Mike Davis, a former chief counsel to Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who now heads the Article Three Project. He said the group is prepared to “do whatever it takes to push Judge Barrett’s nomination over the finish line by the end of October.”At a separate news conference Tuesday, several Senate Democrats said Barrett has a clear record of opposing abortion rights.“Judge Barrett has shown by her past writings and by passing the Trump test (for a Supreme Court nominee) that she would overturn Roe v. Wade,″ said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee.Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, another committee member, also attended the news conference, which focused on abortion rights and included advocacy groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-ask-if-more-material-omitted-from-sc-nominee-barrett-s-response/story-cf9037aw60NA3l3Z7JddUM.html
07-10-2020||World||Facebook, Instagram ban QAnon conspiracy-linked accounts ahead of US polls||Facebook on Tuesday announced a ban on all accounts linked to the QAnon conspiracy group, as the social network tries to clamp down on misinformation ahead of the heated US presidential election.The move against QAnon at Facebook and its image-sharing platform Instagram comes as the online giant tries to avoid being used to deceive or confuse voters, as was the case during the 2016 election that put US President Donald Trump in the White House.“We will remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content,” the internet titan said in a blog post.From an anonymous 2017 posting claiming bizarre child exploitation and political plots, the headless and bodiless movement has earned a place in Trump’s Twitter stream.The FBI last year said in a report that QAnon was one of several movements that could drive “both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts.”The ban on QAnon accounts steps up Facebook’s efforts to clamp down on misinformation campaigns sometimes endorsed by Trump, weeks ahead of the November 3 presidential election.“Facebook’s decision to ban QAnon from all its platforms is a much needed, if belated, step to purge dangerous conspiracy theories from the platform,” said Anti-Defamation league chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt.“We hope that this is a sincere effort to purge hate and antisemitism from their platform, and not another knee-jerk response to pressure from members of Congress and the public.”The moves made across Facebook and Instagram were against accounts tied to “offline anarchist groups that support violent acts amidst protests, US-based militia organizations and QAnon,” according to the blog post.The leading social network recently prohibited ads that praise, support or represent militarized social movements and QAnon.Facebook in August removed hundreds of groups tied to QAnon and imposed restrictions on nearly 2,000 more as part of a crackdown on stoking violence.Critics have charged that inflammatory content from QAnon was spreading on Facebook despite the platform’s proclaimed effort to contain it.Stoking flames Facebook said it tightened its prohibition on QAnon after noticing that, despite taking down posts directly promoting violence, QAnon supporter messages adapted to avoid restrictions.For example, QAnon used the platform to claim deadly wildfires raging on the West Coast were started by certain groups, which diverted attention of police and firefighters.“QAnon messaging changes very quickly and we see networks of supporters build an audience with one message and then quickly pivot to another,” Facebook said.The social network already bans content calling for violence and organizations that proclaim violent missions.The increasingly visible and vocal followers of QAnon promote a bewildering blend of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.Once on the fringes of the internet and focused on US politics, the movement has seen sharp growth on mainstream social media platforms this year.The movement centered on the unsubstantiated belief that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshippers has extended that this year to allege, without proof, that the coronavirus is a conspiracy by that group to control people using vaccines and 5G.Social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube have ramped up surveillance for QAnon content, as adherents attempt to bypass the new filters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-instagram-ban-qanon-conspiracy-linked-accounts-ahead-of-us-polls/story-ySfxWXgPenuAU2XanGc75O.html

07-10-2020||World||Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse: Report||The Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual predators for decades, preferring instead to safeguard its own reputation, and created a culture where abusers were able to hide, an independent report said Tuesday.The report, published by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, also found examples of clergymen being ordained despite a history of child sexual offenses.The inquiry heard that, from the 1940s to 2018, 390 people who were either members of the clergy or in positions of trust associated with the church had been convicted of sexual offences against children.The report found that, in many cases, the Church of England failed to take the abuse allegations seriously, and that perpetrators were “given more support than victims.”“Over many decades, the Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual abusers, instead facilitating a culture where perpetrators could hide and victims faced barriers to disclosure that many could not overcome,” the inquiry’s chairwoman, Alexis Jay, wrote.The report said sometimes sexual offenses were minimized. Citing the case of Reverend Ian Hughes, who was convicted in 2014 of downloading 8,000 indecent images of children, the report said that a fellow clergyman, Bishop Peter Foster, suggested to the inquiry that Hughes had been “misled into viewing child pornography” — even though more than 800 of the images were graded at the most serious level of abuse.The Church of England acknowledged Tuesday that progress has been too slow in supporting abuse victims and survivors, and said it was “completely committed” to improving this.“The report makes shocking reading and while apologies will never take away the effects of abuse on victims and survivors, we today want to express our shame about the events that have made those apologies necessary,” it said in a statement. “The whole Church must learn lessons from this inquiry.”The church announced last month that it had set up a large compensation fund for survivors of past abuse by members of the clergy.The report came after the inquiry held several public hearings in 2018 and 2019. The inquiry last year published a linked report focusing on disgraced bishop Peter Ball, who was imprisoned in 2015 for sexually abusing 18 young men over three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/church-of-england-failed-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-report/story-tjRvLqKtMLX0pOdCZg1n0K.html
