Trump has since repeatedly promised to hasten their approval, widen access and provide them to Americans for free.“We have engaged in a number of contracts for procurement of these monoclonal antibodies already,” said Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. The government is acquiring doses through its Strategic National Stockpile as they are manufactured, he said.Mango spoke during a briefing on the latest developments of Operation Warp Speed, the White House-led effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of coronavirus vaccines and treatments.Early data from Lilly’s single antibody and Regeneron’s antibody cocktail suggest both are effective in keeping people infected with the new coronavirus out of the hospital.“The interest in the monoclonal antibodies is quite high,” said Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA. Woodcock, who is serving as a part of Operation Warp Speed, has recused herself from taking part in the approval decisions related to coronavirus therapeutics.Biggest ChallengeHealth-care experts and industry executives have said that manufacturing poses the most significant challenge in getting antibody treatments to all who may need it. The process is costly and demand is likely to outstrip supply.Lilly said earlier this week it would have 100,000 doses of the single-antibody product its developing with Canadian biotech AbCellera Biologics Inc. available in October, and as many as 1 million doses available by year-end.The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical giant is also studying a cocktail of two antibodies, and expects to approach regulators for authorization in November and seek full approval in the second quarter of 2021. Supplies of the cocktail, which adds in a second antibody that Lilly licensed from Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., are much more limited, with only about 50,000 doses available this year.Regeneron said Wednesday it has enough doses for about 50,000 patients and expects to have enough doses available for 300,000 patients in the next few months. Warp Speed officials said the distribution plan will be similar to remdesivir, with the federal government allocating to states with the highest need.The greatest challenge ahead, Woodcock said, will be coordinating sites where patients can receive the antibody treatments, which must be administered intravenously by health-care professionals, unlike vaccines, which can be given from the more convenient confines of a pharmacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expects-1-million-doses-of-covid-antibody-before-2021/story-I03A7Nt6WpkirB8ji4UbYI.html

09-10-2020||World||Fearing Biden tax hikes, wealthy Americans rush to change estate plans||Wealthy Americans are scrambling to change their estate plans before year-end, worried that Democrat Joe Biden will win the U.S. presidential election and raise taxes, say financial advisers to the moneyed set.The biggest concern is that the White House and Congress could get swept up in a “Blue Wave” of Democratic wins that give Biden the power to propose and pass a sweeping set of tax reforms.Wealthy people are especially nervous that an exemption allowing individuals to leave up to $11.58 million to heirs, free of estate or gift taxes, could be cut before it expires in 2025.Democrats want to raise estate taxes to the “historical norm,” according to the party’s platform. That could mean slashing the exemption to $5.49 million, the figure in place before Republican President Donald Trump signed a sweeping tax bill that included benefits for corporations and wealthy Americans in 2017, advisers said.It is unclear how the election will go or what, if any, tax reform will pass. Tax code changes can also be complex and time consuming. But as Biden has climbed in the polls, rich people are rushing to set up trusts and revise existing ones before year-end to avoid 2021 tax consequences, advisers said.“The $11.58 million question is, ‘What is going to happen to the gift and estate tax exclusion?’“ said Toni Ann Kruse, a New York estates lawyer who counsels ultra-high net worth people. “We don’t know who will win the election or control the House or Senate - and all of those factors will play into what could happen.”Biden would also “return the estate tax to 2009 levels” to fund paid family and medical leave, according to his website. His plan also includes raising taxes on long-term capital gains, which is the profit earned by selling assets whose values have appreciated. Taxpayers with income above $1 million would pay a 39.6% income tax on the profit, instead of the current tiered approach that maxes out at 20% for individuals with $441,450 or more income.In a statement, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates reiterated the candidate’s intent to change tax law in ways that benefit less affluent people.“Joe Biden is running to rebuild the backbone of this nation - the American middle class - by ensuring that our economy rewards work and not just wealth,” he said.The uptick in requests for estate changes intensified in June when Biden pulled ahead of Trump in polling, advisers said. Several firms said they have been overwhelmed by requests since then, and expect business to pick up more toward the end of the year.Tax-related workflow is triple the norm at Miller Samuel Inc, a New York-based real estate appraisal firm, said Chief Executive Jonathan Miller.“We are flooded with requests for gift and estate tax appraisals right now,” he said.New York estate and tax planning lawyer Philip Michaels has added around 15 high net worth clients during the last several months who are revising estate plans.Rockefeller Capital Management, a financial advisory firm in New York, is holding virtual events for customers while working with legal and tax advisers to sort through nuances of possible legislation, said Joe Roberts, Senior Wealth Strategist.Clients are worried about a “quick turn and drastic departure” from the status quo, Roberts said.At the same time, some customers are worried about making decisions too early. That is because trusts created to use lifetime exemptions are not easily unwound.“It’s a lot of money to give away,” Indianapolis estate planning lawyer John Olivieri said of some of his clients. “People are struggling with, ‘Do I really want to give this away?’“||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-biden-tax-hikes-wealthy-americans-rush-to-change-estate-plans/story-4Juew09BKXQ8xeWh6BWY5M.html
09-10-2020||World||White House increases fiscal-stimulus offer to $1.8 trillion||The White House plans to offer a $1.8 trillion stimulus proposal in talks Friday between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as a top Republican expressed skepticism any deal could get through Congress before the election.After walking away from talks with Democrats earlier this week, President Donald Trump has reversed course and is now looking for a deal with the election three weeks away and polls showing him trailing Democrat Joe Biden.“The president has approved a revised package. He would like to do a deal,” Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday on Fox Business. “It will be relatively broad based but I can’t go through details.”Three people familiar with the matter said the White House is increasing its proposal to $1.8 trillion from the roughly $1.6 trillion Mnuchin previously brought into negotiations. Pelosi is proposing the $2.2 trillion package the House has already approved.Stocks jumped after Kudlow’s remarks, with the S&P 500 Index up 1% as of 12:25 p.m. They had tumbled on Tuesday, when Trump pulled his team from stimulus negotiations.McConnell SkepticalKudlow spoke a short time after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there’s probably not enough time before the election to bridge the “vast” differences on a new virus relief package.“I believe that we do need another rescue package, but the proximity to the elections and the differences of opinion about what is needed are pretty vast,” McConnell said at an event in his home state of Kentucky.Even if there is an agreement, it would take time to write legislative text, call lawmakers back to Washington and hold a debate and vote in Congress.And even then, Republicans may be as big an obstacle to Trump as Pelosi.McConnell has said that there are members of his GOP majority who think the government has already provided enough stimulus. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has also said his caucus members are skeptical of a large package. “We’d have to see what’s in it, but I think it’s difficult,” he said last month.In his remarks Friday, McConnell specifically highlighted the “narrowly targeted” GOP package of about a half-trillion dollars that Democrats blocked as insufficient last month.Pelosi AwaitsPelosi said she and Mnuchin will be exchanging responses to questions each side had in their earlier conversations when they talk again on Friday.“Part of it is about money, part is about policy,” she said on MSNBC. “We’ll see what they have to offer today.”Pelosi sent a letter to House Democrats Friday morning criticizing Trump for not taking the pandemic seriously enough.“The Administration does not share this priority of crushing the virus. The President does not have the capacity, leadership or plan for testing, tracing, and isolation that is needed,” Pelosi wrote. “Instead, Trump’s delay, denial, distortion of reality and disdain for science has exacted a deadly and preventable human toll.”The two sides are are divided on the issues of how much money to provide state and local governments, language restricting Trump’s ability to divert anti-virus health care spending and the level and length of supplemental unemployment benefits. Dozens of smaller issues such as funding for election security and the Postal Service also remain.The negotiations are proceeding against a frenzied backdrop, with the president recuperating from Covid-19 and the final stretch of the election campaign under way. Pelosi and Trump publicly questioned each other’s ability to perform their jobs on Thursday.The House speaker said Thursday there could be no action on a stand-alone bill to aid airlines or any other sector of the economy without an agreement with the White House and Republicans on a broader stimulus package.Pelosi said airline aid could move through Congress before a comprehensive deal is voted on -- but that would have to be advanced in the “context” of a broader bill. “I have made the case to my colleagues that this is a special case,” Pelosi said on Bloomberg TV.“There is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill,” she said. Pelosi has also said this week she is pressing for language that would limit Trump’s ability to divert virus testing and treatment funds to other projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-increases-fiscal-stimulus-offer-to-1-8-trillion/story-OKFqLgqkAXNlbnH8GUEpPI.html
09-10-2020||World||Dems move bill seeking removal of Trump’s powers on medical grounds||President Donald Trump plans to return to the campaign trail with a flurry of online and in-person events, including a rally in Florida on Saturday, even as Congressional Democrats introduced a bill providing for the removal of the president’s powers on medical grounds, starting with the next term.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a legislation on Friday to set up the ‘Commission on Presidential Capacity to Discharge the Powers and Duties of Office’ under US Constitution’s 25th amendment, which allows for the transfer of presidential powers to the vice-president in case of president’s death, removal, resignation or incapacitation. “This is not about President Donald Trump — he will face the judgment of the voters,” Pelosi said at a press conference at the Capitol.Trump hit back in a tweet, saying Pelosi is the one that needed to be put under observation.The president will start his return to campaigning with a “radio rally” on Friday on syndicated radio-host Rush Limbaugh’s show and then do his first on-camera interview since catching Covid-19 with Fox News, during which he will undergo a “medical evaluation” by the show’s medical contributor.Sean Conley, Trump’s physician, has cleared him for “safe return to public engagements” on Saturday, the 10th day after the president was diagnosed for Covid-19, saying Trump has “responded extremely well to treatment”. But the doctor has admitted before to projecting an “upbeat” picture of the president’s health.Citing the update from the doctor, Trump’s campaign asked the Commission on Presidential Debates to revert to in-person format for the second debate that is scheduled for October 15, which the body had declared would be held virtually. Trump had rejected the change on Thursday, demanding a delay in-person debates.Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger, had agreed to a virtual debate and also to a delayed in-person second debate. But has rejected Trump campaign’s demand for two delayed in-person debates, second of which was proposed for October 29, just four days short of November 3, Election Day.Trump, who is trailing Biden in opinion polls by a widening margin. Hampered by illness, he needs the debates to try and shore up his race. Biden has been accommodating, but made it clear he won’t be pushed around.President Trump has not been seen in public since his return to the White House on Monday, but he has shot and released video messages about his health, downplaying the severity of the epidemic while claiming he may be immune to the virus. He has also done phone interviews with Fox News anchors.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dems-move-bill-seeking-removal-of-trump-s-powers-on-medical-grounds/story-OwY6jwmtkzgu4V71QagbAL.html
09-10-2020||World||Cellphones in hand, ‘Army for Trump’ readies poll watching operation||Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes leading up to November’s election, part of an effort to find evidence to back up President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud.Across key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Florida and Wisconsin, Republican poll watchers will be searching for irregularities, especially with regard to mail-in ballots whose use is surging amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to more than 20 officials involved in the effort. They declined to say how many volunteers have signed up so far; the campaign earlier this year said its goal was to recruit 50,000 monitors nationwide.The mission, the officials said, is to capture photos and videos Republicans can use to support so-far unfounded claims that mail voting is riddled with chicanery, and to help their case if legal disputes erupt over the results of the Nov. 3 contest between Republican incumbent Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden.The campaign is already posting material of activity it claims is suspicious, including video of a Trump campaign observer being turned away from an early voting site in Philadelphia last month. The city says monitors are welcome in polling stations on Election Day but are not permitted in early voting facilities.Some voting-rights activists are concerned such encounters could escalate in a tense year that has seen armed militias face off against protestors in the nation’s streets.Poll watching by partisan observers is a normal feature in US elections that dates back to the 18th century and is subject to various state laws and local rules.Still, this year’s operation by the Trump campaign is highly unusual, voting rights advocates say, both in its focus on early voting and in its emphasis on finding evidence to support baseless assertions by the president and his supporters that Democrats plan to flood the system with phony mail ballots to steal the election.In a recruitment video posted on Twitter in September seeking volunteers for this “Army for Trump,” the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., made the unfounded claim that Democrats plan to “add millions of fraudulent ballots” to rig the results. Trump repeatedly has refused to commit to accepting the outcome of November’s election. During the Sept. 29 presidential debate, he exhorted his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully.”Mail ballot requests are tilting heavily to Democrats in battleground states, which likely means Biden will be in the lead before in-person voting begins on Election Day.In Florida, where Republicans have historically relied on mail ballots, nearly 2.5 million Democrats have requested them, compared with about 1.7 million Republicans. In Pennsylvania, more than 1.5 million Democrats have requested a mail-in ballot, nearly triple the requests from Republicans.Republicans said they plan to monitor every step of mail voting, including setting up cameras to show people dropping off multiple ballots at drop boxes. Some states permit third-parties to drop off ballots, but the practice is banned in others, including Pennsylvania.Pat Dion, head of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania’s Bucks County, a politically divided suburb near Philadelphia, predicted the process could get messy.“There’s going to be lots of watchers, lots of cameras and lots of attorneys all across the country. It’s going to be chaotic,” said Dion, who said he nevertheless supports the effort.Democrats and voting-rights advocates say Trump is trying to suppress the vote, not protect it.“It’s an attempt to scare eligible Americans into thinking they are in danger if they go to vote,” said Myrna Perez, voting rights and elections director for the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan voting rights group.Democrats say Trump’s team is also laying the groundwork for a challenge to mail ballots in the event he loses, possibly throwing the election to Congress or the courts to decide the outcome.Trump campaign spokeswoman Thea McDonald said in a statement that “President Trump’s volunteer poll watchers will be trained to ensure all rules are applied equally. And if fouls are called, the Trump Campaign will go to court to enforce the laws.”‘Make our Republican presence known’This is the first presidential election in nearly four decades that the Republican National Committee has been free to sponsor such “ballot security” operations without permission from a federal court. A 1982 consent decree restricted these activities after the party sent teams of gun-toting men to minority neighborhoods during a New Jersey election wearing uniforms saying “Ballot Security Task Force.”That consent decree expired in 2018 and a federal judge declined Democratic attempts to renew it.In Wisconsin, a state Trump won by less than a percentage point in 2016, volunteers will be posted in critically important counties around Milwaukee, Republican state party chairman Andrew Hitt told Reuters.Pennsylvania, too, is shaping up to be a hotbed of activity. Trump won it by just over 44,000 votes in 2016. He has almost no path to securing a second term if he doesn’t win its 20 Electoral College votes again in November. In Montgomery County, a formerly Republican bastion outside Philadelphia that is now reliably Democratic, the Republican Party is holding several virtual training sessions over the next two weeks for some 50 volunteers to monitor 11 proposed ballot drop boxes there, according to an email sent by the party to supporters and seen by Reuters. “It is critical that we make our Republican presence known, so voters know they cannot get away with fraud,” the email reads.On the western side of the state near Pittsburgh, Trump supporter Bob Howard has volunteered to watch election offices where voters will be dropping off absentee ballots.“We...need to make sure that all the rules are being followed, so people can trust the results,” the 70-year-old retiree said.Democrats, meanwhile, are launching their own voter-protection efforts. But theirs is a more traditional approach that includes registered poll watchers and an army of attorneys.In Pennsylvania, Biden’s campaign said it has launched the biggest such Democratic program there in history, with more than a thousand lawyers and volunteers. It would not provide details on whether its monitors will be deployed at drop boxes and other early voting locations alongside their Republican rivals.Lawsuits multiplying Election experts said the explosion of mail balloting is testing voting laws designed around in-person balloting. There is no rule book for monitors that try to enter early polling sites or challenge voters trying to drop off their ballots, said Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin & Marshall college in Pennsylvania.“It all comes down to county election officials, and what they agree can happen. All of this seems headed to a major court battle,” Madonna said.Confrontations have already emerged in Philadelphia, home to about 20% of Pennsylvania’s registered Democrats. Election administrators there defended their decision to turn away the Trump campaign operative who filmed himself attempting to enter an early voting site on Sept. 29.“To be clear: the satellite offices are not polling places and the Pennsylvania Election Code does not create a right for campaign representatives to ‘watch’ at these locations,” Andrew Richman, chief of staff to the city solicitor, said in a statement.The Trump campaign quickly filed a lawsuit seeking access for poll observers in early voting sites. That suit is pending.     In Northampton County in northeastern Pennsylvania, meanwhile, the Republican Party tried to get sheriff’s officers assigned to drop boxes to request identification from voters dropping off ballots, according to Frank DeVito, a Republican member of the Board of Elections.Pennsylvania law does not require voters to show an ID to vote. The Democratic-controlled board of elections denied that request.Undeterred, DeVito said volunteers will be watching those boxes closely.“We are telling them to take a folding chair, take video, take photos,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cellphones-in-hand-army-for-trump-readies-poll-watching-operation/story-Gk2Zyw8J6zl3M8EYPvTEcM.html
09-10-2020||World||Twitter imposes restrictions, more warning labels ahead of US election||Twitter Inc said on Friday it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the US election process or implementation of election results, including through violence, as the company also announced more labels and restrictions to slow the spread of misinformation.Twitter said in a blog post that, from next week, users will get a prompt pointing them to credible information before they can retweet content that has been labelled as misleading.It said it would add more warnings and restrictions on tweets with misleading information labels from US political figures like candidates and campaigns, as well as US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers or that get “significant engagement.”Twitter, which recently told Reuters that it was testing how to make its labelling more obvious and direct, said people will have to tap through warnings to see these tweets. Users can also only ‘quote tweet’ this content, as likes, retweets and replies will be turned off.Twitter says it has labelled thousands of misleading posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by President Trump.Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the November vote.Reuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud. On Thursday, Facebook Inc said it would ban calls for poll watching using “militarized language.”Twitter also announced temporary steps to slow people’s amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the U.S. election week, global users pressing ‘retweet’ will be directed first to the “quote tweet” button to encourage people to add their own commentary.It will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context, and will stop people seeing ‘liked by’ recommendations from people they do not know in their timeline.Twitter also said it would label tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-imposes-restrictions-more-warning-labels-ahead-of-us-election/story-glchR3xtm0JGygWWYGiroM.html
09-10-2020||World||Europe records 100,000 daily coronavirus cases for first time||Europe surpassed 100,000 daily reported COVID-19 cases for the first time on Thursday, after countries such as Russia and United Kingdom saw no respite in the mounting number of infections every day in the past five days.Cases throughout Europe have been steadily rising over the past week even as new infections in worst-affected countries such as India and Brazil have shown signs of slowing down. The epicentre of the outbreak in the European region has moved to the United Kingdom, Russia, Spain and France which have reported at least over 10,000 cases each in the last three days.Russia reported its highest daily coronavirus cases ever since the last record in May on Friday, prompting Moscow authorities to mull closing bars and nightclubs.The United Kingdom recorded more than 17,000 cases on Thursday with the country’s Health Minister Matt Hancock warning that the United Kingdom was at a “perilous moment”. Many parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have introduced tougher restrictions on social interaction to try to curb the growing spread of the disease.Britain has been reeling under a double whammy of coronavirus cases skyrocketing and an alarming case-to-fatality rate of 7%, among the highest in the world. More than six of every 10,000 people have died due to the virus in the country.The country’s fatality rate is in stark contrast to the United States at 2.8%, even though the United States has recorded more than four times the total number of deaths due to the virus compared to Britain.Europe currently has recorded over 16% of total global coronavirus cases and nearly 22% of deaths worldwide due to the virus. On Thursday, when daily reported cases breached the 100,000 mark, Eastern Europe was the worst affected region with over 33,600 daily reported cases. Among the 10 countries in the region, including Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic, eight posted record increases in cases in the past week.In Northern Europe, Britain was the sole country with a mammoth caseload. New infections in the country have risen more than 2.5 times since the beginning of October showing no signs of slowing down.Italy, in the southern region of Europe, recorded over 4,000 cases for the first time since April when the country was slammed by virus. The daily number of cases in the country has been consistently rising for three months.The country has the second-highest death toll in the continent, with 36,083 dying since the outbreak erupted in February.Spain’s government invoked a state of emergency on Friday to impose a partial lockdown on Madrid. With 850 COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people, the Madrid area has Europe’s highest infection rate.In Western Europe, France recorded new daily COVID-19 infections above the record 18,000 threshold for two days in a row on Thursday, with hospitals moving to an emergency mode and its biggest cities closing down establishments to curtail further spread of the virus.Belgium too enforced stricter controls on gatherings after new infections surged in the country. New coronavirus cases rose more than 2.6 times since the beginning of October. COVID-19 has already claimed over 10,000 lives in the country, which has a population of 11 million people.In Europe, daily cases averaged around 78,000 cases for since the beginning of October, compared with an average of 47,500 cases in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-records-100-000-daily-coronavirus-cases-for-first-time/story-uiRseaduqgzx6VtoDmZovK.html
09-10-2020||World||UK to continue picking up wage bill of shut companies: Sunak||Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Friday announced another extension and expansion of the job support scheme that was due to be wound down later this month, benefiting companies and millions of employees, after a surge in Covid-19 cases prompted new curbs across the UK. The treasury department has already borrowed billions of pounds to fund the scheme, along with others aimed at companies and the self-employed. The state will pay two-thirds of the wages of employees of companies forced to close due to the curbs up to maximum of £2,100 a month.As several unions and industry bodies welcomed the move, Sunak said: “Throughout the crisis the driving force of our economic policy has not changed. I have always said that we will do whatever is necessary to protect jobs and livelihoods as the situation evolves.”“The expansion of the Job Support Scheme will provide a safety net for businesses across the UK who are required to temporarily close their doors, giving them the right support at the right time.”As of Friday evening, 17,540 new Covid-19 cases were recorded across the UK, thrice the daily peak in April and May; there were 77 deaths in the last 24 hours, as hospitals reported rising admissions.In addition to scheme’s expansion, Sunak increased the cash grants to businesses in England shut in local lockdowns to support with fixed costs. These grants will be linked to rateable values, with up to £3,000 per month payable every two weeks, compared to up to £1,500 every three weeks that was available previously. “This could benefit hundreds of thousands of businesses, including restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, bowling alleys and many more”, officials said. The new package is considered more generous than the earlier one implemented since April.The announcement came soon after new official figures showed Britain’s economic recovery from the Covid recession was already slowing before the launch of new restrictions in the autumn. GDP rose by 2.1% in August, falling short of forecasts of a growth rate of 4.4%, despite a boom in consumer spending at hotels, pubs and restaurants fuelled by Sunak’s popular Eat Out to Help Out scheme in August.Caroline Fairbairn of the Confederation of British Industry said: “The steep rise in infections in some areas means new restrictions to curb numbers feel unavoidable. The chancellor’s more generous job support for those under strict restrictions should cushion the blow for the most affected and keep more people in work.”“But many firms, including pubs and restaurants, will still be hugely disappointed if they have to close their doors again after doing so much to keep customers and staff safe.”Frances O’Grady of the Trade Union Congress added: “This scheme will protect jobs in businesses forced to close by local restrictions, but ministers still need to do more to stop the devastation of mass unemployment”.“Firms which aren’t required to close but will still be hit by stricter local restrictions need a more generous short-time working scheme, and there needs to be extra help for self-employed people in local lockdown areas too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-continue-picking-up-wage-bill-of-shut-companies-sunak/story-mabawDoX9C6Jm0uQ28sUqM.html

09-10-2020||World||Daily English Covid cases double in a week as UK struggles with resurgent virus||The average daily number of Covid-19 cases in England has doubled in a week, a survey showed on Friday, as scientists warned that action was needed to avert a calamitous and unnecessary spike in deaths.New cases of Covid-19 in England were around 17,200 per day in the latest week to Oct. 1, compared to 8,400 per day in the previous week, an infection survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, while another population survey said daily infections could be as many as 45,000.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to tackle a second wave of Covid-19 with local measures in an effort to avoid another national lockdown. But the surveys, which feed into government decision-making, paint a bleak picture, and government scientists warned the epidemic was still growing despite a dip in the reproduction number. “We are back to choices faced in the March ... Don’t act slower than the speed of the epidemic,” Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust and member the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said in a tweet.The ONS said an estimated 224,400 people in England had Covid-19 in the latest week, or 1 in 240 people, a 92% increase in infections compared to the previous week.The ONS looks to estimate infection numbers in the community beyond those who have been tested, giving an estimate of prevalence that is unaffected by testing capacity. Another population study, run by Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori, showed that 1 in 170 people in England had the virus between Sept. 18 and Oct. 5, with 45,000 new infections each day. “Our robust findings paint a concerning picture of the growing epidemic across England,” said Paul Elliott, of Imperial’s School of Public Health.“While certain areas are worse affected, if left unabated then infection trends will follow nation-wide and could lead to high levels of unnecessary death and illness from the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daily-english-covid-cases-double-in-a-week-as-uk-struggles-with-resurgent-virus/story-mI4RurOAlHlAyOWc9S4JiN.html

09-10-2020||World||Pakistan bans TikTok over indecent, immoral content||Pakistan announced on Friday that it has banned TikTok after the country’s telecom regulator received complaints against immoral, indecent, obscene and vulgar content hosted on the Chinese-owned video sharing app.The Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) said a number of complaints from different segments of the society were lodged against the app. PTA earlier issued a final notice to TikTok and gave it “considerable time to respond and comply with” instructions for development of an effective mechanism for proactive moderation of “unlawful online content”.The move was met with surprise and criticism on social media. HU Khan, a TikToker, commented, “TikTok was the only way the poor had a voice in the social media revolution that until this platform had largely passed them by. Make no mistake this isn’t a ban on TikTok. It’s a classist ban on the poor & labour working class so they don’t find a collective conscience.”Bakhtawar Bhutto Zardari, daughter of former prime minister Benzir Bhutto tweeted: “Was both surprised & in awe of how much #tiktok picked up in the remotest of places across #Pakistan. Not only could people earn but freely criticise gov policies, rising prices, hypocrisy etc - banning tiktok to protect facade of Khan - reality is people are ready to overthrow!”The app, owned by China’s ByteDance, has been downloaded almost 39 million times in Pakistan and is the third-most downloaded app over the past year after WhatsApp and Facebook, local media reported citing analytics firm Sensor Tower.The short video app has a huge user base among young Pakistanis, with some attracting millions of followers.But it has come up against backlash in the ultra-conservative Islamic country, where in recent months several dating apps including Tinder and Grindr have also been banned and YouTube was threatened with shutdown.Pakistanis were unable to access the app on Friday evening.Arslan Khalid, a digital media adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan, has previously claimed the “exploitation, objectification & sexualisation of young girls on TikTok” was causing pain to parents.Earlier this week, Pakistani TikToker Jannat Mirza became the first in the country to reach 10 million followers, with lip-syncing and slow motion clips among her content.“TikTok is a major source of entertainment for lower and middle class Pakistanis, as well as illiterate citizens that includes half the population as it is video based and easy to use,” said Usama Khilji, a digital rights activist, who said the ban violates freedom of speech.Akhlaq Ahmed, who ran a TikTok account with friends from the remote town of Jhal Magsi in Balochistan province, said the news was like “losing someone from my family”.“The ban is unfair and unjustified... instead of banning the app the PTA should have called on TikTok to ban those users,” he said of the “immoral” content.Campaigners have long criticised the creeping censorship and control of Pakistan’s internet, printed and electronic media.PTA said it would review its decision if the app put in place mechanisms to moderate unlawful content.In a statement, TikTok said it was “hopeful to reach a conclusion that helps us serve the country’s vibrant and creative online community.”The app was blocked in Bangladesh last year as part of a clampdown on pornography, while Indonesia briefly blocked access over blasphemy concerns.It has also faced increasing controversy over how it collects and uses data although it has repeatedly denied sharing user information with Chinese authorities. The app is facing a possible ban in the US, after officials said it was a national security risk and President Donald Trump said he wanted it taken out of Chinese hands.India has already banned the app, along with dozens of other Chinese mobile platforms, following a border standoff with China.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bans-tiktok-over-indecent-immoral-content/story-ktv1vNrGejoHE8BihsS3DK.html

On that same day, some 756 people died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-tops-5-000-daily-coronavirus-cases-for-first-time-since-march/story-Si04pyLGmEeRwaAfU9F5bM.html

Trump will undergo a medical evaluation in a Fox News appearance Friday. And he said the Michigan governor was not appreciative enough of him after the FBI foiled a plot to kidnap her.There are 25 days until the election and 66 days until the Electoral College meets.Trump has “no interest” in a virtual debate against Biden over concerns the Democratic nominee might use a teleprompter, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday.“Joe Biden, he could barely keep up on the debate stage last time and now putting him in a forum where he has access to maybe teleprompters, who knows. The president certainly wouldn’t be there to hold him accountable,” McEnany said during a Fox News interview when asked if Trump would participate in a virtual debate.Trump’s campaign has repeatedly suggested Biden uses a teleprompter during virtual interviews and television appearances. The Commission on Presidential Debates announced earlier this week the Oct. 15 contest between Biden and Trump would no longer be held in person as a coronavirus safety precaution, after the president and several top aides became infected.Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the commission, told Fox News on Thursday there would be media stationed in both locations so that neither candidate could use a teleprompter to read answers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-continues-to-claim-that-biden-could-cheat-during-virtual-debate/story-ItscHoVsYU655qb5HoCBTM.html

In addition, X17 apologized to the family.“We apologize to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their son for the distress we have caused,” X17 said in a statement. “We were wrong to offer these photographs and commit to not doing so again.”The agency also agreed to pay a portion of the family’s legal fees, according to a Michael Kump, an attorney for the couple. “This is a successful outcome,” Kump said in a statement. “All families have a right, protected by law, to feel safe and secure at home.”Meghan, Harry and Archie now live in Los Angeles after the couple stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March to forge new careers. They moved out of Britain after growing hostility to the media’s intense coverage of their private life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-meghan-reach-settlement-over-photos-of-their-son-at-home/story-WOPL1Ij60Hpg5YkZO23HgO.html
09-10-2020||World||Museums sell Picasso and Warhol, embrace Black, Latino art to survive||The one-two punch of Covid-19 and the racial-justice movement has upended huge swathes of society -- work, school and health care. Below the radar, it’s also shaking the foundations of another set of US institutions -- museums -- forcing them to sell prized works and broaden the definition of great art.For generations, museums lived by a tightly scripted set of rules. They accepted tax-deductible donations and acquired artists seen as great -- mostly European and American, mostly white, mostly men. In deference to the sacredness of their task, they were permitted to sell a work only to buy another, not to keep on the lights or pay conservators.This past April, after museums from San Francisco to Maine shut their doors due to the pandemic, the Association of Art Museum Directors announced that for two years, works could be sold and the proceeds used for “direct care,” with each institution defining what that means.The impact has been profound. Museums are not only selling works long off the market but acquiring pieces by female, Black and Latino artists, and -- they hope -- gaining new visitors who will see themselves reflected in the hushed halls. In other words, they’re expanding the canon and hoping to turn this crisis into an opportunity.Masterpieces are pouring into the market. This week at Christie’s, Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York, sold its sole Jackson Pollock painting for $13 million and Springfield Museums in Massachusetts offloaded a Picasso for $4.4 million. Brooklyn Museum’s only Lucas Cranach is heading to the auction block next week while the Baltimore Museum of Art is shopping around its signature, monumental Last Supper by Andy Warhol for about $40 million.“This is really an unparalleled moment,” said Brent Benjamin, president of the museum directors association and director of the Saint Louis Art Museum. He said earlier financial crises, like the one in 2008, were hard, “but we’ve never seen anything like this.”Museums are slowly reopening but with reduced staff -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art eliminated 400 jobs during the pandemic -- and at lower capacity. They can’t hold fund-raising events in person or deepen relationships by organizing trips to international exhibitions and fairs. They’re selling to stay alive, and auction houses Sotheby’s and Christie’s are busy.Museums represent the distress in the art market while their rich patrons, for the most part, have been so far immune from forced sales. The works are extremely desirable because they’re fresh, historically significant and come from the most exalted of collections.“In the next two weeks, we’ll be making some significant announcements,” said Nina del Rio, Sotheby’s head of advisory and museum, private and corporate art services, who was granted the $65 million consignment from the Baltimore Museum of Art and smaller ones from Palm Springs Art Museum, San Diego Museum of Art and Art Institute of Chicago.Adam Levine, the new leader of the Toledo Museum of Art, says he consults often with del Rio. He is exploring if there are ways to extract liquidity from art without breaching public trust, he said. The museum got permission to use $200,000 this year in restricted funds for collection management and its staff is finalizing a plan to diversify its holdings.“Museums have amazing power,” Levine said. “When we put something on the wall, it becomes unimpeachably great.”It also becomes unimpeachably valuable, and museums are under pressure to give power and value to those who’ve been underrepresented. Levine’s first acquisition was Black artist Bisa Butler’s large-scale quilted portrait of Frederick Douglass, whose title alludes to his speech to abolish slavery.To be sure, museums have in the past sold works outside the rules and have occasionally been sanctioned for it. Most exhibit a tiny fraction of the art they own, with the rest in storage rarely if ever seeing light of day.Taking something off the wall can be precarious. Everson Museum’s sale of Pollock’s “Red Composition” drew sharp criticism. And Brooklyn Museum’s sale of the Cranach, among other works, raised eyebrows.“These aren’t easy decisions,” said Anne Pasternak, the Brooklyn Museum director. “The Cranach was an outlier in our collection and had need for restoration. Am I sad to let it go? Sure. Are there more important works in the museum collection? Yes.”She plans to sell at least $40 million worth of art in the next two years, starting with 12 pieces valued at $2.3 million to $3.6 million at Christie’s next week, and use the income to care for the 160,000 objects in the museum’s care. In Baltimore, the city’s encyclopedic museum is selling three signature works -- by Clyfford Still, Brice Marden and Warhol -- to raise $65 million.The sale of the Still especially stings some locals. A key Abstract Expressionist who spent the final decades of his life on a Maryland farm, Still gave his “157-G” painting to Baltimore as a gift. It’s estimated to sell for $12 million to $18 million and some funds are to be used to buy works by women and people of color.“The imperative to act and address decades of inaction around equality in the museum is enormously important,” said Christopher Bedford, museum director. He says the emphasis on diversity will “ensure that the story we are narrating is the full and true story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/museums-sell-picasso-and-warhol-embrace-black-latino-art-to-survive/story-WQU5D6IqGCjHT0q3IruWiL.html
09-10-2020||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak offers lockdown-hit companies more help to keep jobs||British finance minister Rishi Sunak announced his latest programme to stave off a surge in unemployment on Friday, offering extra help for businesses and workers who are forced to stop work during local coronavirus lockdowns.In a move likely to cost billions of pounds over the six-month duration of the new scheme, Sunak said the government will pay up to two-thirds of each employee’s salary, with a cap of 2,100 pounds ($2,724.33) a month, if they work for companies that are forced to close temporarily.The announcement represented an expansion of the government’s Job Support Scheme - which itself is the replacement of the broader furlough scheme that ends this month - for companies ordered to close and their workers.Sunak had previously resisted calls to increase the generosity of the government’s support schemes amid fast-rising job losses and his announcement on Friday is likely to herald the temporary closure of bars and other businesses.Scotland’s government has already ordered a 16-day closure of pubs in the country’s two biggest cities starting on Friday.As well as the new subsidies, he also announced more generous grants for lockdown-hit companies, offering up to 3,000 pounds per month payable every two weeks, compared with 1,500 every three weeks under the standard scheme.“I hope that this provides reassurance and a safety net for people and businesses in advance of what may be a difficult winter,” Sunak said.A Treasury source said the new wage support measures, which will last for six months from Nov. 1, were likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds a month.Under the scheme, employers will not be required to contribute towards wages and only asked to cover social security and pension contributions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-rishi-sunak-offers-lockdown-hit-companies-more-help-to-keep-jobs/story-GWPh2iFDGa7fPIPb43Hi8H.html

09-10-2020||World||‘Covid-19 broke out in various parts of the world, China happened to report it first’: Hua Chunying||By K J M Varma Beijing, Oct 9 (PTI) China on Friday claimed that the coronavirus broke out in the various parts of the world last year but it was the only one to have reported and acted first, refuting the widely-held view that the deadly contagion originated in Wuhan before turning out to be a pandemic. China, besides denying the US allegations that Covid-19 has emerged from a bio-lab in Wuhan, also rejected that it emanated from a wet market in the central Chinese city from bats or pangolins before infecting humans. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing that “the coronavirus is a new kind of virus as more and more facts emerge as reports reveal, we all know that the epidemic broke out in various places in the world at the end of last year, while China was the first to report the outbreak, identified the pathogen and shared the genome sequence with the world.” Hua’s comments came in response to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s allegations of a cover-up by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC). The coronavirus crisis was infinitely made worse by the Chinese Communist Party’s cover-up, Pompeo had said in Tokyo at the QUAD ministerial meeting of the US, India, Australia and Japan on Tuesday. The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement was made as the World Health Organisation (WHO) was gearing up to probe the origin of the deadly coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 36 million people and killed more than 1 million across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 7.6 million cases and more than 2,12,000 deaths. China has reported 90,736 cases and 4,739 deaths due to Covid-19. The WHO has given to Beijing a list of global experts to be sent to China to probe the origin of the coronavirus, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. The WHO is awaiting its approval. In May, the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the Geneva-based WHO’s decision-making body currently headed by India, passed a unanimous resolution to probe the origin of the virus. China also backed the resolution. In August, a two-member team from the WHO, which visited China, completed the groundwork for the probe into the animal source and reservoirs of the Covid-19 which first emerged in Wuhan in December last year. On Monday, WHO health emergencies programme executive director Mike Ryan told a special meeting of the organisation’s executive board that “a list of candidates has been submitted to the Chinese authorities for their consideration and for the next steps in order to deploy that team”. Hua, while refuting Pompeo’s charge of a cover-up, said that a high-level group of Chinese scientists first identified the person-to-person transmission due to coronavirus on January 19. After a thorough research and investigation, China made the decision at the earliest and closed Wuhan city to the outside world and placed most rigorous measures in isolating Wuhan city and Hubei province, Hua said. She said that the CPC Politburo discussed the virus outbreak on the first day of the Lunar New Year in January and convened a meeting on the outbreak of its 31 provinces and municipalities, and activated the level one emergency response. “On January 23 as China placed Wuhan on lockdown, there were only nine confirmed cases outside China and the US had only one. “On February 2, when the US closed its border to the Chinese citizens, the US only officially confirmed a dozen cases. Now the confirmed cases in the US exceeded 7.5 million and 2.10 lakh deaths,” she said. “How could the most powerful country on earth with the best medical resources on hand screw up the tests so badly. Why hasn’t the US discovered this virus at the earliest and why hasn’t it taken prompt measures to test as many people as possible to prevent and control the spread of this virus?” Hua asked. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for treating coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-broke-out-in-various-parts-of-the-world-china-happened-to-report-it-first-hua-chunying/story-QfZlkZMBpDidE3zMi3IhPM.html
09-10-2020||World||As cases rise in Spain, govt invokes state of emergency in Madrid||Spain’s Socialist-led government invoked a state of emergency on Friday to impose a partial lockdown for several million people in Madrid, one of Europe’s worst COVID-19 hotspots, after a court had struck down the measures. The move escalates a standoff between Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s government and the conservative-led Madrid regional chief who believes the curbs are illegal, excessive and disastrous for the local economy.Many of the 3.8 million people affected in the capital city and nine satellite towns were bemused and cars continued to pour out for a holiday weekend.“I feel bad because I don’t know how to act, what to do, if I’m doing things right or wrong, and I feel totally misruled by our politicians who are just not up to the job,” said 64-year-old retiree Jesus Doria.Following a Health Ministry order, Madrid authorities last week reluctantly barred all non-essential travel in and out of the city and other nearby towns. The region had 723 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the two weeks to Oct. 8, according to the World Health Organization, making it Europe’s second densest cluster after Andorra.‘What do we do now?’But instead of a blanket restriction, the Madrid region chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso wants tailored restrictions in different neighbourhoods according to local contagion levels.A Madrid court sided with her on Thursday, effectively suspending the restrictions until the government responded with its two-week emergency order. “We had an alternative plan we have been defending until the last moment, but it has not been possible, which is a pity. The state of emergency was totally avoidable,” Madrid region spokesman Ignacio Aguado told reporters.“As usual, it’s the citizens who face the consequences, they don’t know if they can go on vacation,” he added as Spaniards prepared for a long holiday weekend to mark Christopher Columbus’ arrival in the Americas on Oct. 12, 1492.It was unclear when the restrictions enforced by the state of emergency would come in. TV footage showed lines of cars on the main highways out of Madrid on Friday afternoon for what is usually one of the busiest weekends for domestic tourism.“I feel a little disconcerted and surprised and now everyone is saying, ‘I’m going away for the weekend, no I’m not, what do we do now?’,” said Esther, 45, in Madrid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-cases-rise-in-spain-govt-invokes-state-of-emergency-in-madrid/story-SgZVAPDMXSGlExCsPXvfHI.html
09-10-2020||World||Brexit talks: EU seeks more concessions from UK as deadline looms||European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier wants a few more concessions from Britain before entering the last intense phase of negotiations on a trade deal, an EU diplomat said on Friday, as an Oct. 15 deadline looms.The United Kingdom formally left the EU on Jan. 31, but more than fours years since voting 52%-48% for Brexit in a 2016 referendum, the two sides are haggling over a trade deal that would kick in when informal membership ends on Dec. 31.The two chief negotiators, Barnier and Britain’s David Frost, say they are inching towards a deal, though they have underscored that important gaps remain on fishing, level playing field issues and governance. Both sides have no-deal plans.Barnier, who left London on Friday just 12 hours after arriving, wants a few more concessions from Britain before entering the so called “tunnel” - the final stretch of highly secretive, make-or-break negotiations.“We need to get a little bit more from the UK side before he (Barnier) … is ready to enter the tunnel,” said a senior EU diplomat.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said some progress had been made but the two sides did not yet see eye to eye on all matters.“We’ve had useful discussions this week and progress has been made in some areas. However, there still remain differences on some important issues,” the spokesman said.Johnson has set a deadline of the Oct. 15 EU summit for a deal, and while his top Brexit advisers say that additional work on a text would have to follow, they have warned the EU that they will not do a deal at any price.As he grapples with a swiftly accelerating second wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Johnson will ultimately have to make the final call on whether to accept a narrow trade deal or go for a more tumultuous no-deal that could be blamed on the EU.He has repeatedly said that his preference is for a deal but that Britain could make a success of a no-deal scenario, which would throw $900 billion in annual bilateral trade into uncertainty and could snarl the border, turning the southeastern county of Kent into a vast truck park.DEAL TIME?After Johnson’s bid to undercut the 2020 Brexit divorce treaty, there are fears that London is employing what one European diplomat said was Madman Theory - a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon’s attempt to convince Moscow that he was irrational during the Cold War.“You always need to do contingency planning, I mean the end of the year is approaching rapidly and we still don’t know whether there’s going to be a deal or not,” said the EU diplomat.“Companies need to prepare, but also in addition they need to prepare for a no deal. But that does not mean that we feel that a deal is impossible - I think it’s still very well possible.”One emotive trouble spot is fishing.The EU wants to secure consistent rights to fish in British waters, an important issue for France where coastal fishing communities are politically influential. Britain wants a deal more like that of non-EU member Norway, under which quotas are set each year.“I do not believe that … this (fisheries stand-off) will be a major impediment to an EU-UK agreement,” the EU diplomat said.“What I see now is that the UK is, you know, trying to say ‘OK, you know, this is really valuable, it’s a matter of sovereignty’ - but they see it as a lever to gain market access to the European Union. I think that’s the game that we’re seeing right now.” (Reporting by John Chalmers in Brussels and Guy Faulconbridge in London; Editing by John Stonestreet and Hugh Lawson)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-talks-eu-seeks-more-concessions-from-uk-as-deadline-looms/story-gdQRDF2Lu3cv5R41rT2alL.html

It is seen as London beginning to move beyond attempts to ‘balance’ relationships.Avinash Paliwal, an international relations expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies, said on Friday: “A defence logistics pact between India and the UK is significant for multiple reasons. Apart from the military strategic value of such a pact, especially in the IOR (Indian Ocean Rim), it signals a foreign policy shift on London’s part on the China and Pakistan questions”. “For long, the UK has tried to balance relations between China and the US, as well as India and Pakistan. Such a defence logistics pact affords clarity of intent i.e. the UK is increasingly wary of China, and is unlikely to let Pakistan’s sensitivities hinder a truly strategic partnership with India (something that has been the case for many years).”Indicating that India would emerge as a key theme in the UK’s post-Brexit worldview, Jan Thompson, acting high commissioner of the UK to India, said in a recent webinar that India will “come through as a very strong theme” in the Integrated Review.The review would “underscore the centrality of India to Britain’s view of the world,” Jo Johnson, member of the House of Lords and former minister, told the webinar organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and the Vivekananda International Foundation.Among the key drivers of change over the next decade identified by the review is “a shift in the international order, marked by intensifying great power competition and a shift in the world’s economic centre of gravity towards Asia.”Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, senior fellow at IISS, said: “The UK’s once-in-a-generation security review with a tilt towards the Indo-Pacific, growing convergence on China and the recent government-to-government arms transfer pact, set the political context for boosting bilateral defence links and maritime security cooperation in the western Indian Ocean”. Outstanding issues in the bilateral relationship include illegal migration, anti-India elements operating from UK soil and the long-held perception in New Delhi of London’s pro-Pakistan tilt. But there are indications that some of these seemingly intractable issues may not hinder India emerging as a “very strong theme” in the review.Paliwal added: “To be clear, the UK would not want to jeopardise bilateral relations with Pakistan given the sizeable Pakistani diaspora in the UK and Rawalpindi’s support for London’s counter-terrorism efforts. But, for a change, London has begun looking at India from a security-strategic perspective, instead of a purely economic lens.”“The defence logistics pact (unlikely to be challenged by the Labour Party under Keir Starmer’s leadership, who has also ameliorated the party’s stand on Kashmir more to India’s liking), will set a new more collaborative tone between India and the UK, and help reducing mistrust in New Delhi about the UK’s ‘pro-Pakistan’ inclinations in the long run,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-india-uk-defence-logistics-pact-on-cards-reflects-policy-shift-in-london/story-2qBXEOxgnZwa7Xr3rzN4jO.html

India banned TikTok on June 2020 along with more than 150 other mobile applications citing that they were ‘prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.’ The move came weeks after the People’s Liberation Army of China tried to alter the status quo at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-blocks-chinese-app-tiktok-over-vulgar-content-reports-pak-media/story-yyYaBKnWmuf44PWOAQjeyL.html
09-10-2020||World||Donald Trump maps return to campaign trail after White House says Covid-19 treatment complete||Republican President Donald Trump on Friday prepared to return to the campaign trail with a pair of weekend rallies after his Covid-19 diagnosis sidelined him for a week in the race against Democratic nominee Joe Biden for the White House.Trump, who announced he had been infected with the coronavirus on Oct. 2 and spent three nights in a military hospital receiving treatment, said late on Thursday he was feeling “really good” and, with a doctor’s blessing, aimed to campaign in Florida on Saturday and in Pennsylvania on Sunday.Trump’s illness has kept him from crisscrossing the country to rally support and raise cash in the final weeks before the Nov. 3 election. A return to in-person events would be aimed at convincing voters he is healthy enough to campaign and to govern.While Trump has released several videos on Twitter, he has not appeared in public since he returned home from the hospital on Monday. He is scheduled to do an on-camera interview with Fox News on Friday night, his first since being diagnosed. He told the network late on Thursday he was likely to be tested for the virus on Friday. The White House has declined to say when he last tested negative for the disease.U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines say people who are severely ill with COVID-19 might need to stay home for up to 20 days after symptoms first appear.Biden has continued to campaign during Trump’s illness, with events scheduled on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada. The former vice president, who has sharply criticized Trump’s handling of the pandemic, is beating the Republican in national polls, though that lead is narrower in some of the swing states that may determine the election’s outcome. White House physician Sean Conley said in a memo released on Thursday that Trump had completed his course of therapy for Covid-19, remained stable since returning home from the hospital and could resume public engagements on Saturday. Sounding hoarse and occasionally pausing and clearing his throat, Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview on Thursday night that he was doing well.“I feel so good,” Trump said. The president is expected to host a “virtual rally” on Friday by appearing on conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh’s radio program. The Trump and Biden campaigns sparred on Thursday over a televised debate that had been planned for next week. Trump pulled out after the nonpartisan commission in charge said the Oct. 15 event would be held virtually with the candidates in separate locations because of health and safety concerns after Trump contracted COVID-19. Biden’s campaign arranged a town hall-style event in Philadelphia instead.Trump’s White House and campaign have experienced an outbreak of the virus in the last week, with multiple top aides, including the president’s press secretary and campaign manager, testing positive. Trump and his staff have largely eschewed wearing masks, against the guidance of health professionals. They have also held rallies with thousands of people in indoor and outdoor venues despite recommendations against having events with large crowds.Trump’s health will remain in the spotlight even if he begins holding events again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-maps-return-to-campaign-trail-after-white-house-says-covid-19-treatment-complete/story-cp5I0UG1yLGqNB4EWUKr6K.html
09-10-2020||World||Most US shoppers say they won’t set foot in a mall this year||For most Americans, this holiday shopping season won’t include one longtime staple: the mall.Just 45% of US consumers plan to go to a shopping mall this season, down from 64% who visited last November and December, according to an International Council of Shopping Centers survey released Friday.The forecast is a fresh blow to American malls already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended the economy, shifted spending habits and made people wary of crowded places. Dozens of mall-based retailers have filed for bankruptcy this year, including J.C. Penney Co. and J. Crew.This year will also bring an increase in e-commerce and deals spread out over a longer period, the council found. More than three-quarters of respondents said they expected to start shopping earlier than usual this year.Even with the changing behaviors, a majority of American holiday shoppers -- about eight in 10 -- said they will still spend in a physical store during the coming months. More than half of respondents plan to purchase more from small businesses hurt by the Covid-19 outbreak.Malls usually shine during the holidays, serving as gathering places where families can browse, eat and take pictures on Santa’s lap. But health concerns have been ever-present since the pandemic began. In the ICSC report, which surveyed 1,004 US respondents from Sept. 28 to 30, Baby Boomers -- whose age puts them at higher risk for the coronavirus -- were least likely to say they would visit a mall this holiday season.Unusual YearGiven the anomalous nature of this year, the trends may not represent a death knell for malls, according to ICSC Chief Executive Officer Tom McGee.“We have to look at this year somewhat in isolation,” he said in an interview. “We’re in the midst of a pandemic and that’s clearly going to temper people’s appetite for going out to public spaces.”Malls should play up their advantages over online retailers, he said, such as experiential elements.“A big part of the holiday is creating that holiday mood experience, so you’ll see a lot of investment in that,” McGee said. “Walking around a mall that’s heavily decorated with music playing and so forth does put you in a holiday mood that you’re not going to get sitting behind a PC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-shoppers-say-they-won-t-set-foot-in-a-mall-this-year/story-sZPPVTi8sidFN9tQh5fFGL.html
09-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: With pandemic dominating election, are older voters turning away from Trump?||Many older Americans have turned away from President Donald Trump this year as the coronavirus ravages the country, eroding an important Republican support base that helped propel him into the White House in 2016, Reuters/Ipsos polling data shows.Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden now split American voters aged 55 years and older almost evenly: 47% say they are voting for Biden on Nov. 3 while 46% back Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos national surveys in September and October. That could be an alarming sign for the president, who trails Biden with 25 days to go before the election. Republicans have relied on the support of older Americans in national elections for years, routinely benefiting from a demographic that consistently shows up in force on Election Day.Trump won the 55-plus age group by 13 percentage points in 2016, according to exit polls. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, achieved the same margin.Reuters/Ipsos state polls also show Biden outperforming Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, among older voters in a handful of battleground states, where seniors make up an outsized proportion of the electorate. Winning those states will be critical to the outcome of the 2020 race: whoever takes the most battleground states will be on track to win the Electoral College and the White House.Biden is beating Trump among older voters in Wisconsin by 10 points and drawing about the same amount of support as Trump is with that demographic in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Arizona, according to the state polls conducted in mid-September and early October. Four years ago, Trump won older voters in each of those states by 10 to 29 points.Half of the older voters in the five battleground states blamed the high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country - nearly 7.6 million cases and more than 210,000 deaths - on “poor leadership and policy decisions from President Trump,” the polls show.Randy Bode, 59, a Republican in Douglas, Arizona, who voted for Trump in 2016, said he was disappointed with Trump’s suggestion that people could protect themselves from COVID-19 by drinking bleach. “He shouldn’t be saying the things he’s saying” about the coronavirus, he said.Bode, who is now undecided, is also concerned about Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and how that would leave millions of Americans without health insurance during a health crisis.“He’s had four years to come up with a plan, and he hasn’t done it,” he said.A DETERIORATING BASETrump’s standing with older Americans has deteriorated this year as the novel coronavirus swept the country, closing thousands of businesses and overwhelming the health care system that seniors rely on more than others.Sixty-one percent said this week in a national Reuters/Ipsos poll that they disapprove of the president’s handling of the coronavirus, up 12 percentage points from May. And Trump’s net approval for his response to the virus dropped among all Americans to its lowest level since Reuters started asking the question in early March. Among older Americans, 83% were concerned about the threat that the coronavirus poses to their personal health and safety. “Seniors were much more worried about COVID than younger Americans,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist whose firm has spotted a similar trend in its polling data.Trump’s campaign has been working to stop the bleeding, and last weekend he dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to campaign at The Villages, the conservative retirement community in central Florida.On Thursday, while still convalescing at the White House from his recent coronavirus infection, the president addressed America’s seniors in a video, calling them his “favorite people in the world” and pledging to make new virus-fighting drugs available to them for free. “You are vulnerable and so am I,” Trump said. “We’re going to take care of our seniors.”The Trump campaign pointed to an executive order he signed last year aimed at bolstering Medicare, the national insurance program for Americans 65 and older.“President Trump and his administration remain laser-focused on protecting our most vulnerable citizens, including our nation’s senior citizens,” said Ken Farnaso, a Trump campaign spokesman. Biden is also pitching directly to older voters, particularly in Arizona and Florida.His campaign has been running ads featuring a Florida couple who can’t see their grandchildren because of the pandemic. Other ads have focused on Trump’s threat to eliminate the payroll tax, which funds Social Security. Conant said Trump needs to figure out how to bring seniors back into the fold - and fast.“It’s crucial,” he said. “Trump will not win without strong support from senior voters.” (Reporting by Chris Kahn and James Oliphant, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Sonya Hepinstall)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-with-pandemic-dominating-election-are-older-voters-turning-away-from-trump/story-opW0YpDZEHxPKtSoouUZnO.html

At Northumbria University, there were also 619 new cases and Durham University confirmed 219 cases in students in the last week.Most universities are planning to switch to online teaching for at least three weeks, except in cases where in-person lessons are essential.Newcastle University said “the overwhelming majority of cases” were from “social and residential settings” and said appropriate measures were being taken to protect everyone on campus.“We expected to see cases rise in light of the increase in cases both locally and nationally and all HE (higher education) institutions have to manage this on an ongoing basis,” a spokesperson said.“We feel confident that we have appropriate measures in place to protect us all while we are on campus and to reduce the potential for transmission in our community,” the spokesperson said. Durham University has asked students living in two colleges to remain on campus for the next week following the sharp rise in cases and Northumbria University said it was “continuing to make extensive efforts” to provide support for its self-isolating students with online concierge services or food parcels delivered by staff and the students’ union. Meanwhile, Leeds University said 555 students and three staff members tested positive between September 28 and October 4. “We are acutely aware that behind each number is an individual with their own needs and concerns, and ensuring the safety, health and wellbeing of everyone is our absolute priority,” said the university’s Vice Chancellor Professor Simone Buitendijk. Manchester’s two main universities – Manchester University and Manchester Metropolitan University – had earlier announced suspension of all in-person teaching for the rest of October, with the exemption of a few practical training courses. In a joint statement, the universities told local media that they met with public health authorities and Manchester City Council following a “significant increase in the number of COVID cases across the city of Manchester”. It comes amid growing concerns for student well-being on university campuses, with many reporting troubles with accessing essentials as they go into compulsory quarantine. Universities UK, the organisation that represents the country’s leading universities, published a checklist this week as a guide for universities supporting students who are self-isolating. “Self-isolation is key to containing the spread of COVID-19. Where it is necessary for students to self-isolate, university staff and students’ unions are making huge efforts to take care of both their physical and emotional wellbeing, including access to testing and health care, mental health support, continuing learning online, safe social interaction, food deliveries, laundry, and financial support,” said Alistair Jarvis, Chief Executive of Universities UK.“This checklist builds on previous guidance published by Universities UK to ensure universities continue to provide each and every student with the support they need,” he said.

US President Donald Trump claimed credit for the British decision.“The West must urgently unite to advance a counterweight to China’s tech dominance,” Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence committee, said. “We must not surrender our national security for the sake of short-term technological development.”The committee did not go into detail about the exact nature of the ties but said it had seen clear evidence of Huawei collusion with “the Chinese Communist Party apparatus”.Huawei said the report lacked credibility.“It is built on opinion rather than fact. We’re sure people will see through these groundless accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,” a Huawei spokesman said.When asked about the committee’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that some in the UK should think before they speak, and that the legitimate interests of Chinese companies were being damaged.“The openness and fairness of the UK market, as well as the security of foreign investments there, is highly concerning,” she said, speaking at a daily news conference in Beijing on Friday.Trump identifies China as the United States’ main geopolitical rival, and has accused the Communist Party-ruled state of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which he calls the “China plague”.Washington and its allies say Huawei technology could be used to spy for China. Huawei has repeatedly denied this, and says the United States is simply jealous of its success.British ministers say the rise to global dominance of Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former People’s Liberation Army engineer, has caught the West off guard.The defence committee said it supported Johnson’s decision to eventually purge Huawei from Britain’s 5G network but noted that “developments could necessitate this date being moved forward, potentially to 2025” to be economically feasible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-colluded-with-the-chinese-communist-party-apparatus-uk-parliament/story-MH6xFgCF3JDtryG9iFjt7H.html

09-10-2020||World||World Food Programme: Five things to know||The UN’s World Food Programme, which won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, delivers food assistance in emergencies, from wars to civil conflicts, natural disasters and famines.Here are five facts about the Rome-based organisation:- Beginnings -Created in 1962 on the request of US President Dwight Eisenhower as an experiment to provide food aid through the UN system, WFP had only existed a few months when an earthquake struck northern Iran.Over 12,000 people died. WFP sent survivors 1,500 metric tons of wheat, 270 tons of sugar and 27 tons of tea.Others soon needed its help: a typhoon made landfall in Thailand; war refugees needed feeding in Algeria.In 1963 WFP’s first school meals project was born. In 1965, the agency became a fully-fledged UN programme.By 2019, it would come to assist 97 million people in 88 countries. WFP says that on any given day it has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes on the move. It distributes over 15 billion rations of food yearly.- Mission -WFP focuses on emergency assistance as well as rehabilitation and development aid. Two-thirds of its work is in conflict-affected countries, where people are three times more likely to be undernourished than elsewhere.It works closely with the other two Rome-based UN agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which helps countries draw up policy and change legislation to support sustainable agriculture, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which finances projects in poor rural areas.WFP is funded entirely by voluntary donations, most of which comes from governments. It raised $8 billion in 2019, which it says was used to provide 4.2 million metric tons of food and $2.1 billion of cash and vouchers.It has more than 17,000 staff, with 90 percent based in the countries where the agency provides assistance.- Where in the world? -There are few places where the WFP has not provided assistance. In western Sahel in the 1970s, ravaged by drought, it used “everything in its power -- from car to camel, from road to river -- to assist those in need”.It delivered 2 million tons of food during Ethiopia’s 1984 famine. It was present in Sudan, Rwanda, and in Kosovo, then later in Asia after the 2004 tsunami, and Haiti’s 2010 earthquake.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is suffering the second largest hunger crisis in the world, it assisted 6.9 million people in 2019, as well as helping fight a deadly Ebola virus outbreak.It helps 4.5 million people in war-torn Syria and 300,000 acutely malnourished children in conflict-struck Nigeria.But WFP’s largest emergency response has been in Yemen, where it tries to feed 13 million people each month.- Hunger today and coronavirus -Over 821 million people in the world are chronically hungry, while another 135 million are facing severe hunger or starvation, and an additional 130 million could join them by the end of 2020 due to coronavirus, the agency warns.The number of severely food insecure people in the world had already risen nearly 70 percent over the past four years, and the economic fallout from the virus pandemic is expected to spark “a hunger pandemic”, WFP said.“We urgently need more support from donors, who of course are already hard-pressed by the impact of the pandemic in their own countries”.- Coronavirus -WFP’s logistics services used a network of hubs, passenger and cargo airlinks, and medical evacuation services to enabled a steady flow of cargo and workers to the frontlines of the pandemic. The coronavirus fallout is being felt hardest in Latin America, which has seen an almost three-fold rise in the numbers of people requiring food assistance, as well as West, Central and Southern Africa.“Before the coronavirus even became an issue, I was saying that 2020 would be facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II,” WFP’s executive director David Beasley told the UN security council this year.“With Covid-19, we are not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-programme-five-things-to-know/story-mjTqXYdZtF0OIzwNP4bvFM.html

Cook said she was disappointed.Last week, public elementary schools in New York City welcomed back students to the classroom as part of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s blended learning plan after a months-long hiatus.But this week New York officials began imposing fresh restrictions to curb a worrying rise in infections in several ‘hot spots.’Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “I’m disappointed because I don’t think that the location of our school really puts us in jeopardy,” Cook, a real estate broker, said on Thursday. “The neighborhood and parents are scrambling.”The school, in the Windsor Terrace-Kensington area of Brooklyn, is located in a so-called ‘orange zone.’ Schools in those zones have been ordered shut as part of new rules imposed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to try to stamp out the virus in several parts of the state, including neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens.A group of parents and their children gathered outside the school on Thursday morning to protest, flanked by two local politicians.Its postal code was “not a Covid hotspot & the schools do not meet any of the agreed upon metrics for closing,” New York State Assembly Member Robert Carroll, who attended the protest, wrote in a Twitter post.De Blasio told reporters on Thursday that 169 schools had closed in the city under the governor’s rules, 61 more than under a plan he had put forward on Sunday that delineated the neighborhoods where closures would be enforced using ZIP codes.Click here for compete coronavirus coverage The mayor’s plan drew scorn from Cuomo, a fellow Democrat with whom he has often feuded. The governor on Tuesday released new color-coded maps delineating closures, sowing confusion among residents.New York is one of about 30 out of 50 US states where cases have risen over the past two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis. Nationally, both cases and the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients are rising, hitting record levels in the upper Midwest and West.Backlash continues In New York, the rapid spread of new infections in so-called ‘clusters’ has alarmed health officials who fear the city, once the US epicenter of the pandemic, could see a second wave.As well as school closures, new restrictions aimed at damping down transmission in the clusters’ ‘red zones’ include capping religious gatherings at 10 people. Many of the clusters are areas that include Orthodox Jewish communities.That has led to a backlash among some members of the community, who say they have been singled out without sufficient consultation. Brooklyn’s Borough Park saw angry protests on Tuesday and Wednesday.On Wednesday evening, Jacob Kornbluh, a well-known journalist working for Jewish Insider, said he was assaulted and beaten by protesters after they recognized him.Police did not respond to a request for comment, but the attack drew the condemnation of the World Jewish Congress, which represents Jewish communities worldwide, as well as both city and state officials.“There’s no excuse for violence, especially against a reporter,” Cuomo said. “It was disgusting behavior, frankly.”Other Jewish community leaders have come out in support of the steps taken by authorities to try and contain the outbreaks.“We support the governor’s and mayor’s efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 by using a data-driven, geographically-based approach,” said Matt Nosanchuk, the president of the New York Jewish Agenda, in a statement released on Thursday.Legal challenges have already begun in the US District Court in Brooklyn, arguing Cuomo’s zones are unconstitutional.In one lawsuit, a Brooklyn law firm in a red zone said the governor’s “arbitrary” line-drawing forced it to shut down though it has had no infections and did nothing wrong, depriving it of due process.Another lawsuit from three Orthodox Jewish synagogues in Brooklyn and Queens said limiting the size of gatherings violated their religious rights.In response, Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Cuomo, released a statement. “We’ve been sued virtually every day for every action taken. We’re concentrating on reducing the virus in these hot spots and saving lives, period,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-parents-scramble-to-deal-with-new-school-closures-as-covid-19-resurges/story-UdxEbqNOA5XmJfgukgvepL.html
09-10-2020||World||Battered Louisiana coast braces for 1 more: Hurricane Delta||Boarded windows and empty sidewalks made parts of Louisiana’s Acadiana region look like empty movie sets as major Hurricane Delta roared ever closer to the U.S. Gulf coast, apparently on track to smash into the same southwestern part of the state where Hurricane Laura blasted ashore six weeks ago.Forecasters said Delta — the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season — would likely crash ashore Friday evening somewhere on southwest Louisiana’s coast. The question was whether it would remain at devastating Category 3 strength or drop just before landfall to a still extremely dangerous Category 2 storm — with winds falling below 110 miles per hour (177 kph).Either way, people in this battered coastal region were taking Delta seriously.“You can always get another house another car but not another life,” said Hilton Stroder as he and his wife Terry boarded up their Abbeville home with plans to head to their son’s house further east.As Delta churned north at 12 mph (19 kph) on Friday morning, the National Hurricane Center had a hurricane warning in place for the Gulf Coast extending from High Island, Texas, to Morgan City, Louisiana.It marked the sixth time this season that Louisiana has been threatened by tropical storms or hurricanes. One fizzled at the southeast Louisiana tip and others veered elsewhere but Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June. And Laura demolished much of the southwestern part of the state on Aug. 27, causing more than 30 deaths.Life wasn’t at a complete standstill though. A gas station was doing steady business as people filled their cars and spare gasoline cans and a grocery store served last customers stocking up. Similar scenes played out not far away in New Iberia, where the few signs of life included cars lined up at a drive-thru daquiri shop and people grabbing food at take-out restaurants.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards noted in a radio show that Delta appeared headed for the area near the Texas state line that was devastated by Laura, including Lake Charles and surrounding Calcasieu Parish, and rural Cameron Parish on the coast. “And we’ve got people who are very tired,” he noted.“People of Lake Charles and in Cameron Parish have already suffered enough, and then here comes this one,” said Desi Milligan, who owns an RV park in Cameron that was heavily damaged by Laura.Reminders of Laura’s danger are everywhere in the region. In nearby Bell City, some debris piles are more than 6 feet (2 meters) high and 75 feet (23 meters) long. Concerns mounted Friday that Delta’s arrival would cause the debris to become airborne, deadly projectiles.Though homes and farmhouses in the area still stood, many rooftops with lingering damage from Laura were covered in blue tarps. In Cameron Parish, power poles along Highway 27 in a desolate stretch of marsh were all either broken or leaning — none appeared to have been repaired since the August storm. A few miles down the road, Creole presented a scene of utter devastation under an overcast sky that soon gave way to pouring rain. Where there used to be buildings, exposed slabs remained. A church and a convenience store had been reduced to debris, and fences were blown over or completely torn down.Delta had already clipped Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 2 hurricane just south of the resort city of Cancún early Wednesday, bringing high winds and heavy rain. No deaths or injuries were reported there.New Orleans, well east of the projected landfall area, was expected to escape Delta’s worst impacts. But tropical storm force winds were still likely in the city on Friday, and local officials said they were preparing for the possibility of tornadoes.And in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency like his counterpart Edwards did in Louisiana. Forecasters said southern Mississippi could see heavy rain and flash flooding.In Abbeville, Tony Russo was loading up on groceries late Thursday. “I don’t know really any different,” he replied when asked his reaction to the busy storm season. “You’re here. If you love it you stay,“ he said. But he added with a chuckle: “2020 has been a hell of a year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battered-louisiana-coast-braces-for-1-more-hurricane-delta/story-4kXOVZ5jcCbqevCDcGpl7I.html

The Kremlin said Putin’s initiative followed a series of calls with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.The latest outburst of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces began Sept. 27 and marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The region lies in Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994.The Kremlin said Putin proposed calling a cease-fire to exchange prisoners and collect the bodies of dead soldiers, adding that the top Azerbaijani and Armenian diplomats were invited to Moscow for consultations.The Russian Foreign Ministry said they confirmed their attendance Friday, but there was no immediate comment from Armenia or Azerbaijan to the Russian initiative.Azerbaijani officials and Nagorno-Karabakh separatist authorities said heavy shelling continued overnight.Fighting with heavy artillery, warplanes and drones has engulfed Nagorno-Karabakh despite numerous international calls for a cease-fire. Both sides have accused each other of targeting residential areas and civilian infrastructure.On Thursday, a historic cathedral in the town of Shusha in Nagorno-Karabakh came under shelling, a shell piercing its dome and damaging the interior. No one was hurt in the attack, but hours later more shelling wounded two Russian journalists inspecting the damage. The Azerbaijani military denied targeting the cathedral.According to the Nagorno-Karabakh military, 350 of its servicemen have been killed since Sept. 27. Azerbaijan hasn’t provided details on its military losses. Scores of civilians on both sides also have been killed.Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, has been under intense shelling. Residents are staying in shelters, some of which are in the basements of apartment buildings.Facing international calls for a cease-fire, Azerbaijan made its acceptance conditional on Armenia’s withdrawal from the region.Armenian officials allege that Turkey is involved in the conflict and is sending Syrian mercenaries to fight on Azerbaijan’s side. Turkey has publicly backed Azerbaijan in the conflict but has denied sending fighters to the region.____Associated Press writers Avet Demourian in Yerevan, Armenia and Aida Sultanova in Baku, Azerbaijan contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-russia-offers-to-host-cease-fire-talks/story-UVJWLHc4xS7uCT64ZiNeoN.html

Funded countries will receive enough doses to vaccinate up to 20% of their population in the longer term, GAVI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-purchase-covax-vaccines-for-1-of-population-foreign-ministry/story-2Y6EAVvVyEomGu22jPC9SO.html
09-10-2020||World||World Food Programme awarded 2020 Nobel Peace Prize||The World Food Program on Friday won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to combat hunger and food insecurity around the globe.The announcement was made in Oslo by Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Nobel Committee.The Nobel Committee said that the coronavirus pandemic has added to the hunger faced by millions of people around the world and called on governments to ensure that WFP and other aid organizations receive the financial support necessary to feed them.There was no shortage of causes or candidates on this year’s list, with 211 individuals and 107 organizations nominated ahead of the February 1 deadline.However, the Norwegian Nobel Committee maintains absolute secrecy about whom it favors for arguably the world’s most prestigious prize.The award comes with a 10-milion krona ($1.1 million) cash prize and a gold medal to be handed out at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway, on December 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death. This year’s ceremony will be scaled down due to the pandemic.On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. Tuesday’s prize for physics honored breakthroughs in understanding the mysteries of cosmic black holes, and the chemistry prize on Wednesday went to scientists behind a powerful gene-editing tool. The literature prize was awarded to American poet Louise Glück on Thursday for her “candid and uncompromising” work.Still to come next week is the prize for outstanding work in the field of economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-programme-awarded-2020-nobel-peace-prize/story-CZBp2dvJd2xxTJ0M7yfZAO.html

09-10-2020||World||China’s holiday travel is back to 80% of pre-Covid-19 pandemic level||Travel in China rebounded over the eight-day holiday period this month as the nation displayed further evidence that it is overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, with about 637 million trips made, government data show.While that was down from the 782 million trips made during the same period in 2019, it is much better than during the 5-day holiday period in May, according to Macquarie Group Ltd economists. The full total for the Autumn Festival period was 81% of 2019’s level, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism released late Thursday show.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The containment of the virus provided the basic public health conditions for holiday activities, which showed an “obvious revival,” according to a report from Citigroup Inc. “Household purchasing power recovered steadily, and consumer confidence also came back on overall economic recovery,” they wrote.The number of trips doesn’t indicate the number of people who travel, according to the China Tourism Academy. A single person could make multiple trips during the same holiday.Domestic tourism income during the holiday was about 467 billion yuan ($70 billion), according to the ministry. That is down 28% from the seven-day holiday a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations, when income was 650 billion yuan.There was a strong recovery in consumer spending during the holiday period, according to economists at Macquarie led by Chief China Economist Larry Hu. This suggests that “service consumption, largely driven by the pent-up demand, could rebound quickly once things are returning to normal.”Follow latest updates on coronavirus here One factor boosting domestic tourism is the effective collapse of international movement due to travel bans and stringent quarantine requirements on returning to China. Mainland visitors to Hong Kong were down 99%, and dropped 85% to Macau during the holiday period, Macquarie said.“Many brands in the luxury hospitality sector are back to pre-Covid levels of occupancy,” said Chloé Reuter, founding partner Gusto Luxe & Gusto Collective. “Sanya in Hainan is a key destination for domestic travelers and for shoppers at the largest duty free mall in the world,” but more experiential and back-to-nature destinations like Yunnan are also seeing high numbers of travelers, she said.There was an 149% increase in duty-free shopping in Hainan Island in southern China over the holiday, Chinese customs said, according to a state TV report Friday.However, schools in Beijing and other places were discouraging their students from traveling during the period, which may have undercut demand.”Travel to the western regions indicated that consumers are releasing pent-up demand due to lockdown during Chinese New Year and shift from international tourism to domestic,” according to Jason Yu, managing director at Kantar Worldpanel Greater China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-holiday-travel-is-back-to-80-of-pre-covid-19-pandemic-level/story-GMSjnf5LN8BjG1Fa2cplQL.html
09-10-2020||World||Even mildest Covid risks leaving lingering symptoms months later||Covid-19 patients who experience even the mildest illness risk suffering symptoms for months, researchers in France found.Two-thirds of patients who had a mild-to-moderate case of Covid-19 reported symptoms 60 days after falling ill, when more than a third still felt sick or in a worse condition than when their coronavirus infection began. Prolonged symptoms were more likely among patients aged 40 to 60 years and those who required hospitalization, according to staff at Tours University Hospital, who followed 150 non-critical patients from March to June.Their study, published Monday in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection, adds to evidence that a proportion of the 35 million people known to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus worldwide will suffer lingering effects weeks to months later. Post–Covid clinics are opening in the pandemic’s wake to cater for an expanding population of so-called long-haulers -- survivors left with scarred lungs, chronic heart damage, post-viral fatigue and other persistent, debilitating conditions.“We were able to assess the evolution of the disease and demonstrate that even the mildest presentation was associated with medium-term symptoms requiring follow up,” Claudia Carvalho-Schneider and colleagues wrote. “Thus, the Covid-19 pandemic will involve a care burden long after its end.”Covid Malaise Poses Economic Drag Long After Virus AbatesTwo months after developing Covid-19 symptoms, 66% of adult patients reported suffering from at least one of 62 complaints, mainly a loss of smell and taste, shortness of breath, and fatigue, the researchers found. The study sought to identify the risk of longer symptom duration in patients with non-critical Covid-19, since much of the existing international research was based on survivors admitted to intensive care units, they said.Longer-ranging studies and clinical trials will be critical to elucidate the durability and depth of health consequences attributable to Covid-19 and how these may compare with other serious illnesses, Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University School of Medicine, and colleagues wrote in an editorial Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association that reviewed the coronavirus’s persistent effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-mildest-covid-risks-leaving-lingering-symptoms-months-later/story-g2q4rCzJAPqvtbLpJKRVAM.html
09-10-2020||World||Nobel Peace Prize 2020: Greta Thunberg, WHO, Jacinda Ardern among top picks||The Nobel Peace Prize remains one of the much-awaited categories, which will be announced on Friday at around 2.30pm (Indian time). This year, 318 nominations have been submitted, including that of 211 individuals and 107 organisations.The names are always kept secret. However, the secrecy around the names never stopped speculations. Here is a list of the frontrunners:Greta ThunbergReports said Swedish teenage activist Thunberg could be honoured, either alone, with other activists, or with her “Fridays for Future” movement. UN’s climate science advisory panel IPCC and former US vice president Al Gore had won the Peace prize in 2007. In 2018, Greta addressed the United Nations Climate Change Conference. In 2019, she sailed to North America to attend the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit where her speech “how day you” brought her international acclaim.“This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope? How dare you,” she had said.If she wins, she would be the second-youngest Nobel laureate in history, just behind Pakistani activist Malala, and the 18th woman to win the Peace Prize. World Health OrganizationThough WHO’s response to the pandemic has invited severe criticism, it is also one of the top favourites as it is working towards ensuring equitable distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine, once it comes. It has set up a vaccine pool, COVAX, which will have rapid access to doses of safe and effective vaccines as soon as any vaccine is approved. Countries which have joined COVAX will get the benefits.Jacinda ArdernNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s response to the Christchurch mosque attacks in 2019 and her leadership in eliminating Covid-19 from the country have kept her as one of the favourites of the bookies betting on probable winners. Ardern was nominated last year tooAlexei NavalnyRussia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was recently poisoned by Kremlin, has been nominated for the prize. The recent news of Navalny being hospitalised after being poisoned during a flight has created a stir in the international media. But Navalny has been fighting against corruption for over a decade now. Russian authorities arrested him several times. Last year, the award went to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, for his efforts to end a 20-year-post-war stalemate with Eritrea. Many other names of possible Nobel winners have also been circulating in Oslo, including Afghan peace negotiator and women’s rights activist Fawzia Koofi, the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN and its secretary general Antonio Guterres, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the icon of Sudan’s revolution Alaa Salah.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-peace-prize-2020-greta-thunberg-who-jacinda-arden-among-top-picks/story-mIklbkXiXORmEcZZhdnxQM.html

09-10-2020||World||Imran Khan’s problem matrix to get complicated with FATF verdict on Pak record||Prime Minister Imran Khan, already facing a mounting challenge to his leadership by a joint coalition of 11 opposition parties, could find his problem matrix getting far more complicated later this when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) takes a hard look at Pakistan’s track record to stop terror. The global anti-terror financing watchdog is expected to conclude that Islamabad should be kept in the grey list with a new set of compliances based on the October 2019 mutual evaluation report (MEP). The mutual evaluation report is done on member countries after every eight years.According to diplomats based in Paris and counter-terror experts, the FATF plenary, which is going to hold its virtual meeting on 21-23 October, is likely to prepare a new action plan for Pakistan based on the October 2019 MEP and add points not compiled by Islamabad for the previous 27-point action plan.Also Read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his handsWhile Islamabad routinely blames India for politicising FATF, fact is that Pakistan based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) are constantly targeting innocent civilians and security forces in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. JeM’s Kasim Jan, one of the key accused in the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack, is still the principal handler of terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir with sleeper cells all over India. Proscribed LeT’s co-founder Hafiz Saeed’s son Talha is active in planning and executing terror action against India with impunity.Pakistan watchers believe that PM Imran Khan may try to leverage its influence over both Taliban and Haqqani Network to negotiate for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and attempt to buy some relief at the FATF. Already, US President Donald Trump has announced that US troops will return from Afghanistan before Christmas this year.However, this is easier said than done since the FATF’s mutual evaluation report 2019 says that Pakistan faces significant money laundering and terror financing risks. “A number of terrorist outfits, including UN-listed groups, operate in Pakistan all of which raise funds through a variety of means including direct support, public fundraising, abuse of non-profitable organisations, and through criminal activities. Funds are moved through formal and informal (mainly hawala or hundis) channels. Pakistan’s geographical landscape and porous borders increase its vulnerability to terror financing and heightens the risks associated with cash smuggling. At the time of the last evaluation, there were 66 organizations and approximately 7,600 individuals proscribed under UNSC resolution 1373, which was passed to prevent and suppress financing of terror acts post 9/11 attacks,” the report stated.The MEP report on Pakistan further stated : “Major money laundering crime include corruption, drug trafficking, fraud, tax evasion, smuggling, human trafficking and organized crime. Corruption is endemic across Pakistan’s economy….and connected with a range of other predicate offences….Illicit funds from predicate crimes are generally money laundered through domestic real estate, precious gems/jewellery and the financial sector. Criminal proceeds are also moved offshore via formal and informal channels.”Also Read: Pakistan’s opposition, public increasingly irked by the military’s role in politicsEven as Pakistan is still to comply with the previous 27-point action plan, the MEP 2019 presents a very grim picture of Pakistan with caustic comments about both its lead enforcement agencies as well as federal agencies for not understanding the full purport of money laundering and terror financing acts.“Based on MEP 2019, a new assessment will be made of Pakistan and a set of tasks to be complied with by Islamabad will be prepared. Under the circumstances, it is very difficult for Pakistan to walk out of the grey list of FATF,” said a counter-terror expert in New Delhi.Also Read: Pakistan PM Imran Khan heads into his biggest challenge. Military is also targetThe downside of Pakistan remaining in the grey list means that much needed loans for reviving a comatose economy will be very hard to come by and PM Imran Khan’s problems will be further accentuated by a united opposition, which is no longer afraid of the all powerful Pakistan Army. On Thursday, former Pak PM Nawaz Sharif, who has been a primary force in cementing the opposition, said that his problem was not with Imran Khan but his selectors (Army). FATF’s October plenary, which would likely keep Pakistan in the grey list, will just exacerbate political tensions in Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-problem-matrix-to-get-complicated-as-fatf-decides-on-pak-record/story-iQ5Nf4zE99Hy0XuUeQoQoO.html
09-10-2020||World||Facebook removes fake accounts linked to conservative group||Facebook has removed 276 accounts that used fake profiles to pose as right-leaning Americans and comment on news articles, often in favour of President Donald Trump, the company announced on Thursday.The platform also permanently banned an Arizona-based digital communications firm that it said was behind the fake accounts.The move was prompted by reporting last month in The Washington Post that a pro-Trump group known as Turning Point Action was paying teenagers to post coordinated, supportive messages, a violation of Facebook’s rules.Facebook and Twitter have been regularly removing fake accounts — both domestic and foreign — that try to insert themselves in the US political discourse and influence the election. But social media companies face broader threats around misinformation and voter suppression that at times come from President Donald Trump himself.The latest network Facebook removed became active before the 2018 midterm elections and went dormant until June, when the accounts began posting on topics including the coronavirus pandemic, criticism of the Democratic Party and its nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as praise for Trump and other Republicans.“So sick of democrats continuing to make republicans look bad! It makes me tired of politics and I just believe Republicans are much more humble when it comes to money because Democrats will do anything to screw over Americans,” read one post Facebook cited as an example.Individuals behind the accounts used stock photos to create fake profiles, many of which were removed by Facebook’s automated detection software. Facebook determined that the accounts were being coordinated by Rally Forge, an Arizona-based firm.“Although the people behind this network attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation linked this activity to Rally Forge,” Facebook said.While Facebook’s investigation cited Rally Forge’s work for Turning Point USA, the work was actually performed on behalf of Turning Point Action, an independent political action committee, according to a statement from the organisation. Turning Point Action added that it will work with Facebook “to rectify any misunderstanding” about its content.Turning Point Action was founded last year by Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based non-profit that recruits college students to advocate for conservative causes. The group posts memes and videos on its social media pages that support Trump and other conservative politicians. Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr have also delivered speeches at Turning Point USA or Turning Point Action events, most recently during a June campaign rally in Phoenix.Messages left with Rally Forge and Turning Point USA were not immediately returned Thursday.In all, 200 Facebook accounts, 55 pages and 76 Instagram accounts were removed. Facebook said the network had more than 370,000 followers on Facebook, and 22,000 on Instagram. While most of the fake profiles had posed as conservatives, Facebook said some pretended to be left-leaning in 2018.Twitter, meanwhile, said Thursday that it had suspended 104 accounts linked to an Iranian effort to “artificially” amplify debates over the death of George Floyd and racial justice in the US. The platform said that in some cases, the accounts had been hijacked from their original owners.“In cases where we identify that an account has been compromised ... we aim to restore the account to the original account holder,” Twitter said in a statement. “We were able to do so successfully in most cases here.” (AP) SCY SCY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-fake-accounts-linked-to-conservative-group/story-i2Mn08eSuW3bL788tYZ3bN.html
09-10-2020||World||More than 6.6 million Americans have already voted, suggesting record turnout||Americans are rushing to cast ballots ahead of the Nov. 3 election at an unprecedented pace, early voting numbers show, indicating a possible record turnout for the showdown between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.With less than four weeks to go before Election Day, more than 6.6 million Americans already have voted, more than ten times the number who had at this time in 2016, according to the United States Elections Project, which compiles early voting data.The shift has been driven by an expansion of early and mail-in voting in many states as a safe way to cast a ballot during the coronavirus pandemic and an eagerness to weigh in on the political future of Trump, said Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, who administers the project.Also Read: US Prez Trump says wants to hold campaign rally on Saturday in Florida“We’ve never seen this many people voting so far ahead of an election,” McDonald said in an interview earlier this week. “People cast their ballots when they make up their minds, and we know that many people made up their minds long ago and already have a judgment about Trump.”The early surge has led McDonald to predict a record turnout of about 150 million, representing 65% of eligible voters, the highest rate since 1908. Biden leads Trump in national opinion polls, although surveys in crucial battleground states indicate a tighter race.The numbers reported so far come from 34 states plus the District of Columbia. All but about a half-dozen states allow some level of early in-person voting.The percentage of voters who cast their ballot at a voting machine on Election Day already had been in steady decline before this year, according to the US Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency.Also Read: Joe Biden says hopes to win election by undeniable marginThe total number of early or mail-in votes more than doubled from nearly 25 million in 2004 to 57 million in 2016, it said, representing an increase from one in five of all ballots cast to two in five of all ballots cast. Trump has railed against mail-in voting, making unfounded accusations that it leads to fraud. Experts have said such fraud is rare.Those attacks by the president have shown signs of depressing Republican interest in voting by mail. Democrats have more than doubled the number of returned mail-in ballots by Republicans in seven states that report voter registration data by party, according to the Elections Project.A national Reuters/Ipsos poll taken last week found 5% of Democrats nationwide said they had already voted compared to 2% of Republicans. About 58% of Democrats planned to vote early compared to 40% of Republicans. McDonald said early voting typically starts strong, then drops before surging just ahead of the election. But in some states, rates of participation already have skyrocketed a month out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-6-6-million-americans-have-already-voted-suggesting-record-turnout/story-4LH8VG7MAr3VzSOzABludN.html
09-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Debate commission rules out rethink on virtual debate||The chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates says it is not reconsidering shifting the second debate from virtual back to in-person, despite a request from President Donald Trump’s team.Frank Fahrenkopf told The Associated Press late Thursday that the nonpartisan group’s decision was not going to be reversed. That means the second debate is probably not going to happen at all.The commission decided to make the Oct. 15 debate virtual after Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Fahrenkopf says the group wanted to “protect the health and safety of all involved” and that the decision was guided by the advice of the Cleveland Clinic, its heath partner for the 2020 debates.Trump’s doctor, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley, said in a letter Thursday evening that Trump would be cleared to resume public activities Saturday, 10 days after his diagnosis.Earlier Thursday, Trump balked at the virtual event and said he wouldn’t participate.

09-10-2020||World||High-profile Covid-19 lockdown breachers fuel Israeli mistrust||Public anger has deepened in Israel over a bitterly unpopular second coronavirus lockdown after reported violations by high-profile figures, including a hairdresser visiting the prime minister’s wife.Israel, which currently has one of the world’s highest Covid-19 infection rates per capita, has re-imposed draconian movement restrictions, with people compelled to remain within a kilometre (less than a mile) of their homes.Only essential workers are allowed to leave their residences, adding further stress to an already battered economy, while Jews have been barred from gathering with friends and family over the High Holidays.A spokesman for the family of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his wife’s decision to summon a hairdresser to their official residence, saying it was part of her efforts to contain the virus.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA family statement said Sara Netanyahu booked the appointment ahead of filming a “video, in which she called on everyone to wear masks”.“Ms. Netanyahu is an influential public figure and this is an informational video for the public service, she assumed that hairdresser services can be used, as is customary on television channels,” the statement further said.It added that the hairdresser wore a mask and gloves and that the premier’s wife “strictly adheres” to all health ministry guidelines on containing the novel coronavirus.Israeli PM’s wife may have violated lockdown with haircutThe Yediot Ahronoth newspaper voiced outrage at what it described as hypocrisy.“Thousands of barbers and hairdressers stayed at home, without their livelihood,” because of the lockdown, it wrote on Wednesday.“Yet once again, it turns out that the rules that apply to Israeli citizens do not apply to the prime minister’s circle and his associates.”Security chief, environment minister Sara Netanyahu’s alleged quarantine infraction came after environmental protection minister and Netanyahu ally Gali Gamliel travelled to Tiberias -- 137 kilometres (85 miles) from her Tel Aviv home -- on Yom Kippur.Israel’s attorney general is due to rule on whether to open a formal investigation into Gamliel’s alleged infraction.Days later, the head of the powerful Shin Bet internal security agency, Nadav Argaman, was accused by Israeli public radio of hosting relatives at his private home for the Sukkot holiday, breaking lockdown rules.Argaman leads an agency responsible for tracking quarantine violators through their cellphones.For Denis Charbit, a political scientist at the Open University of Israel, the “transgressions” of prominent figures serve as a justification for ordinary Israelis to breach the lockdown.“Individual freedoms are hampered by the government-imposed containment, and the lockdown rules are not effective if leaders do not respect them,” he told AFP.“The impunity that these politicians generally enjoy reinforces the public’s mistrust in the authorities,” he added.Within the opposition ranks, lawmaker Miky Levy of the Yesh Atid party resigned from parliament’s coronavirus committee following media reports that he spent Sukkot in his son’s home.Political damageNetanyahu won praise for his initial response to the coronavirus outbreak in March, but surging transmission in recent months and the renewed restrictions have hurt him politically.A protest movement partly driven by frustration over his virus management has continued, with demonstrators constantly adapting to comply with lockdown measures, including gathering in small clusters across the country.Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, which won 36 out of 120 parliamentary seats in March polls, would currently take just 26 seats, according to a poll this week by Israel’s Channel 12.The same survey found that 65 percent of Israelis believe Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis “poorly”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/high-profile-covid-19-lockdown-breachers-fuel-israeli-mistrust/story-I3Z4rOsBrstJnjlDLKoYfK.html
09-10-2020||World||China joins WHO-backed global vaccine alliance COVAX||China has formally joined the WHO-backed global Covid-19 vaccine initiative known as COVAX, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Friday, saying it was doing so to ensure “equitable” distribution of vaccines for developing countries.The ministry did not share details about its level of involvement, but China is now the biggest economy to join the international initiative, with the US and Russia staying out of it.“We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,” ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement.“China will also strengthen vaccine cooperation with relevant countries through the COVAX network,” she added.The WHO hopes to distribute 2 billion doses of vaccines through the initiative by the end of 2021.On October 8, China and Gavi, the international Vaccine Alliance, signed an agreement, officially joining COVAX.COVAX, jointly led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the vaccine alliance Gavi, is “designed to give governments an opportunity to hedge the risk of backing unsuccessful vaccine candidates and give less developed countries access to shots that would be otherwise unaffordable,” a Bloomberg report said in September.It currently has nine vaccines in development and nine others under evaluation in its portfolio.“This is an important step China has taken to uphold the concept of a shared community of health for all and to honour its commitment to turn Covid-19 vaccines into a global public good,” Hua said.In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping had pledged to make any coronavirus vaccine universally available once it’s developed and said China will provide $2 billion over two years to support the fight. “To that end, we have solemnly pledged to make vaccines developed and deployed by China a global public good, which will be provided to developing countries as a priority,” Hua said.“Therefore, China has maintained close communication with COVAX with a positive attitude towards joining it. Even when China is leading the world with several vaccines in advanced stages of R&D and with ample production capacity, it still decided to join COVAX”.As many as 11 Chinese vaccine candidates are under clinical trials, four of them in phase three. Chinese companies are working with related organisations including those in the Middle East, South America, and Southeast Asia, Wu Yuanbin, a senior official with the Chinese science and technology ministry, had said in late September.China’s annual production for Covid-19 vaccines is expected to top 1 billion doses by 2021 while it is expected to reach 610 million doses by the end of this year.The country’s national health commission (NHC) has shared an outline of how the vaccines will be distributed in China when available. The first is the high-risk group, which includes frontline medical workers and those working in the seaports. The second is the vulnerable group, such as the seniors and children. And the third one is the general population. “When we allocate vaccines, we will meet their needs according to those groups,” Zheng Zhongwei, director at NHC’s Development Centre of Medical Science and Technology has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-joins-who-backed-global-vaccine-alliance-covax/story-m8oMw8hNlLKWVhKVdaFpwJ.html

It came back on as Harris began her answer, which focused on the Trump administration’s approach to China that she said “resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs, and America’s standing.” “Screen featuring color bars and the all-caps message, “NO SIGNAL PLEASE STAND BY. The censorship offered a vivid example of Beijing’s willingness to excise information it cannot control, even when it involves potentially important insights into relations with the country’s largest trading partner,” Fox News reported.“Censors in China are moving quickly to block criticism of the country’s leaders, discussion of historical events like the Tiananmen Square massacre or any conversation that could involve organizing resistance to the government,” it added.The US Vice-Presidential debate on Wednesday (local time) witnessed a sharp exchange of words between Vice President Mike Pence and his rival Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-censors-vp-debate-when-pence-was-questioned-about-communist-nation/story-CuKMyPpOWnegwP3PzjbHGO.html

The drugs company said it has asked federal regulators to authorise its antibody treatment for Covid-19 for emergency use.What is Regeneron?REGN-COV2, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, was designed specifically to block infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a Mint report.Also Read: Trump says wants to hold campaign rally on Saturday in Florida“To develop REGN-COV2, Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of fully-human antibodies produced by the company’s VelocImmune mice, which have been genetically modified to have a human immune system, as well as antibodies identified from humans who have recovered from Covid-19,” a statement issued by the pharma company said.Trump received the antibody cocktail last Friday under a compassionate use program.Late last month, Regeneron reported preliminary results from a trial showing that the cocktail could reduce virus levels in coronavirus patients outside of the hospital.Free drug for all AmericansRegeneron has said it currently has doses available for approximately 50,000 patients and expects to have doses available for 300,000 patients within the next few months.The company said in a statement that under its agreement with the US government, the latter would be responsible for the distribution of the drug and would have to make the initial doses available to the American people free of cost if an emergency authorization is granted by the US Food and Drug Administration.Donald Trump’s healthDonald Trump’s physician said the President’s blood samples from Monday show that he had protective antibodies, but according to the pharmaceutical company, those were likely the Regeneron antibodies given to him at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and not a natural response.Also Read: Trump suggests two delayed debates, Biden accepts oneMeanwhile, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci has pointed out that we do not know if the president is well, because patients’ condition can go downhill more than a week after showing the first symptoms.However, White House physician Dr Sean Conley said that the President should be able to return to public engagements as early as Saturday, according to news agency Bloomberg. Trump, who was infected with the virus a week ago, returned to the White House on Monday.

09-10-2020||World||US Supreme Court says women can get abortion pill by mail, for now||The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would for now continue to allow women to obtain an abortion pill by mail during the Covid-19 pandemic.The action came over the dissent of two conservative justices who would have immediately granted a Trump administration request to reinstate the requirement that women must visit a hospital, clinic or medical office to obtain a pill.The court did little more than defer its first action on an abortion-related issue since the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last month. The court called for a lower-court judge to take a new look at the issue and rule within 40 days. That would put any further high court action after the Nov. 3 election.The court said in an unsigned opinion that it was holding the administration’s appeal “in abeyance.”The administration is asking to be allowed to enforce a U.S. Food and Drug Administration rule. The administration has suspended similar in-person visits for other drugs, including opioids in some cases, but refused to relax the rules for getting the abortion pill.A federal judge in Maryland ruled in July that, during the public health emergency declared by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, health care providers can arrange for mifepristone to be mailed or delivered to patients. The FDA has approved mifepristone to be used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy or manage a miscarriage.Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said they would have granted the administration’s request. “Six weeks have passed since the application was submitted, but the Court refuses to rule,” Alito wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justices-say-women-can-get-abortion-pill-by-mail-for-now/story-QZaXieAIkurRLJFUewVCeK.html
09-10-2020||World||Family of woman mistakenly declared dead sues Michigan city||The lawyer for the family of a suburban Detroit woman who was found to be alive after being pronounced dead filed a $50 million lawsuit Thursday against a suburban Detroit community and four of its first responders.Timesha Beauchamp, 20, was placed in a body bag and “left without oxygen for 4 hours, suffering hypoxic brain damage,” attorney Geoffrey Fieger said in a release announcing the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit.Fieger said she remains in critical condition.Beauchamp has cerebral palsy and her family called 911 on Aug. 23 because of what appeared to be serious breathing problems. Emergency medical technicians and paramedics responded to their Southfield home.A doctor at a Southfield hospital who didn’t attend the scene pronounced Beauchamp deceased after one of the first responders reported by telephone that she had been unresponsive for 30 minutes and showed no signs of life.Beauchamp wasn’t taken to a hospital until hour later when Cole Funeral Home in Detroit called 911. The state has said funeral home staff actually saw her chest moving earlier when they picked up the body at the Southfield home.Beauchamp’s family said they were assured by the medical crew that she was dead.“All of this could have been avoided, had more care been taken,” Fieger said in his release.Southfield Fire Chief Johnny Menifee has said the city is investigating. He told reporters in late August that Beauchamp might be alive because of “Lazarus syndrome,” a reference to people who come back to life without assistance after attempts to resuscitate have failed.The Associated Press left messages seeking comment Thursday afternoon on the family’s lawsuit from Menifee and the city’s community relations office.The suit names the city of Southfield, Michael Storms, Scott Rickard, Phillip Mulligan and Jake Kroll. Storms, Rickard, Mulligan and Kroll filed a lawsuit last month in federal court to stop their licenses from being suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-woman-mistakenly-declared-dead-sues-michigan-city/story-gRkkWFkwMGbPHtaIZg7aPI.html
09-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, Barr at odds over slow pace of Durham investigation||President Donald Trump is increasingly at odds with Attorney General William Barr over the status of the Justice Department’s investigation into the origin of the Russia probe, with the president increasingly critical about a lack of arrests and Barr frustrated by Trump’s public pronouncements about the case, according to people familiar with the matter.Trump and his allies had high hopes for the investigation led by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, betting it would expose what they see as wrongdoing when the FBI opened a case into whether the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia to sway the 2016 election. Trump has also pushed to tie prominent Obama administration officials to that effort as part of his campaign against Joe Biden, who was serving as vice president at the time.But a year and a half into the investigation, and with less than one month until Election Day, there has been only one criminal case: a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to altering a government email about a former Trump campaign adviser who was a target of secret FBI surveillance.With time running out for pre-election action on the case, Trump is increasingly airing his dissatisfaction in tweets and television appearances. Barr, meanwhile, has privately expressed frustration over the public comments, according to a person familiar with his thinking. It’s not dissimilar to a situation earlier this year, when Trump complained publicly that he believed ally Roger Stone was getting a raw deal in his prosecution, even as Barr had already moved to amend a sentencing position of the prosecutors in the case.Despite Trump’s unhappiness, there’s no indication Barr’s job is at risk in the final weeks of the campaign. Still, the tensions between Trump and the attorney general over the fate of the probe underscore the extent to which the president is aggressively trying to use all of the levers of his power to gain ground in an election that has been moving away from him.This account is based on interviews with six people who have direct knowledge of Trump and Barr’s relationship. They were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Trump is also said to blame Barr for comments from FBI Director Chris Wray on election fraud and mail-in voting that don’t jibe with the president’s alarmist rhetoric. Wray has said there has not historically been any kind of mass voter fraud, whether through the mail or otherwise, a message at odds with Trump and Barr’s repeated efforts to sound the alarms about a process they claim is especially vulnerable to abuse.Still, much of the uptick in tensions between Trump and Barr centers on the Justice Department’s handling of the Durham probe. A senior administration official said Trump feels like he’s given Barr wide latitude to advance the investigation, including declassifying documents related to Russia. In the absence of blockbuster findings, Trump is now moving to make documents public himself with his new acting head of intelligence.On Thursday morning, Trump did not hide his displeasure in an interview on Fox News Business.“Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes — the greatest political crime in the history of our country — then we’ll get little satisfaction, unless I win,” he said. “Because I won’t forget it. But these people should be indicted. These are people who spied on my campaign. And we have everything. And I say, Bill, we’ve got plenty, you don’t need anymore. We’ve got so much.”The comment followed an earlier barrage of presidential social media posts, including one in which Trump retweeted a doctored image of Barr superimposed with the late “Saturday Night Live” actor Chris Farley in character as a motivational speaker yelling at him. The caption: “for the love of God ARREST SOMEBODY.”The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter. The White House did not immediately comment.Since Durham’s appointment, he has cast a broad net in interviewing former government officials, including ex-CIA Director John Brennan. It is unclear when Durham plans to submit his report or how damning any of his final conclusions might be.Even the outlines of the case involving FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who pleaded guilty in the Durham probe, were already known before he was charged. And the case against him didn’t allege any broader FBI conspiracy to go after Trump.Barr has privately expressed frustration over the president’s public pronouncements on the Durham investigation. Though Barr is broadly in agreement with Trump on the need to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, he’s often bemoaned Trump’s lack of understanding about the intricacies of the legal system and the steps that need to be taken to complete an investigation.A friend of Barr’s said there has been obvious “tension” between the president and the attorney general, and while Barr himself believes deeply in the importance of the Durham investigation and in the president’s authority to exercise control over federal agencies, he will not tolerate interference in specific investigations.The friend said the Justice Department officials were eager for Durham’s work to be completed while Trump is still in office for fear the investigation would be shuttered in a possible Biden administration.Trump aides had banked on the Durham probe being finished before 2020 election to lend credibility to Trump’s claims that his own investigative agencies were working against him. A report from the Justice Department’s inspector general in December knocked down multiple lines of attack against the Russia investigation, finding that it was properly opened and that law enforcement leaders were not motivated by political bias. But Barr has said he and Durham disagreed with the inspector general over whether the FBI had enough information to open a full investigation and, in particular, to use surveillance on a former Trump campaign aide.Despite being close allies on a range of issues, tensions have flared between Trump and Barr at other points, including earlier this year when Trump was tweeting about Stone’s case. Barr later reversed a recommendation from prosecutors that Stone be sentenced to 7 to 9 years in prison, and critics argued he was doing Trump’s bidding.Barr said in an interview with ABC News that the president’s tweets were making it “impossible” to do his job and told those close to him he was considering resigning. The two eventually patched things up.___Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-barr-at-odds-over-slow-pace-of-durham-investigation/story-w3Dex24TjzDtCn2xVVbuWO.html
09-10-2020||World||Putin invites Armenia, Azerbaijan foreign ministers for peace talks||Russian President Vladimir Putin invited the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan to visit Moscow for peace talks Friday and said fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh should be halted for humanitarian reasons.Putin’s invitation came as there appeared to be no end in sight for nearly two weeks of fighting between Azerbaijan and ethic Armenian separatists that has claimed hundreds of lives.“The foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia are being invited to Moscow on October 9,” Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin.“The President of Russia is issuing a call to halt the fighting in the Nagorno-Karabakh on humanitarian grounds in order to exchange dead bodies and prisoners,” the Kremlin added.Yerevan has so far ruled out any talks between the two countries’ top diplomats as long as clashes are ongoing.Earlier talks were held in Geneva but expectations were low and no statements were likely from the negotiations which were being conducted behind closed doors -- and without Armenian participation.Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov was to meet diplomats from France, Russia and the United States, who make up the “Minsk Group” that has sought a solution to the Karabakh conflict since the 1990s.Armenia on Thursday accused Azerbaijan of shelling a historic cathedral in Nagorno-Karabakh.Armenia said several journalists were injured in strikes on the cathedral after an initial bombardment left rubble strewn across the floor, pews knocked over and a layer of dust coating the interior from parts of the building’s limestone walls that had been hit.“There is no military, nothing strategic here, how can you target a church?” said local resident Simeon, who lives nearby.Azerbaijan and Armenia are locked in bitter fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Azerbaijani region controlled by Armenians who declared an unrecognised breakaway statelet after the fall of the USSR and emerged victorious from the war that followed.Hundreds including civilians have been killed in the current fighting, the worst since a 1994 ceasefire, with both sides doubling down on entrenched positions over who should control the region.Defence officials in Azerbaijan and Armenia said fighting continued into Thursday, with both sides claiming to have inflicted heavy losses and accusing the other of shelling civilian areas.There was a gaping hole in the roof of the Ghazanchetsots (Holy Saviour) Cathedral, AFP journalists reported, after Armenia’s defence ministry accused Azerbaijan of targeting a cherished site for the Armenian Apostolic Church.- Thousands forced to flee -A section of the cathedral’s metal roof collapsed and fell to the ground outside.Baku denied its forces were behind the first attack, saying that unlike Armenia, “the Azerbaijani army does not target historical, cultural, or especially religious, buildings and monuments.”Explosions and sirens sounded in Nagorno-Karabakh’s regional capital Stepanakert as the city continued to face regular shelling early Thursday, AFP journalists said.Heavy bombardments have levelled many homes since fighting erupted late last month and Stepanakert is pockmarked with unexploded ordnance and wide craters from shelling.Alongside the new bombardments in Stepanakert, Azerbaijan said Armenian shelling on several villages near the frontline had left people dead and wounded.Alamshar Hasanov, a resident of Shukurbeyli near the border with Karabakh, said his village was subjected to Armenian shelling on a daily basis.“See for yourself,” he said. “A neighbour’s house was destroyed.”“May God grant our soldiers, officers, and commanders health. We rely on them,” he told AFP. Armenia’s rights ombudsman Artak Beglaryan told AFP on Wednesday that the renewed fighting has displaced around half of Karabakh’s 140,000 residents and forced some 90 percent of its women and children from their homes.The fighting in one of the most combustible frozen conflicts resulting from the fall of the Soviet Union reignited on September 27, with Azerbaijan insisting the region must return to its control.- Threat of international conflict -Dozens of civilians have been confirmed killed in the fighting and the Armenian side has acknowledged more than 300 military deaths. Azerbaijan has not admitted to any fatalities among its troops.International leaders have repeatedly called for an immediate halt to the fighting but there are no signs yet of the conflict abating. Turkey’s strong backing for Azerbaijan has sown fears in the West that the conflict could spiral into a full-blown war embroiling Ankara with Moscow, which has a military treaty with Armenia.Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the world leaders to denounce the reported deployment of pro-Turkish fighters from Syria and Libya to Karabakh. Iran on Wednesday warned of “terrorists” who had joined the conflict from abroad.Azerbaijan announced Thursday that it was recalling its ambassador to Athens following reports that Greek citizens were joining Armenian forces in Karabakh.bur-im-jbr/as/har/lc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-invites-armenia-azerbaijan-foreign-ministers-for-peace-talks/story-uUwHoXDXiUutk3RfVvs1AJ.html
09-10-2020||World||Trump suggests two delayed debates, Biden accepts one||President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will not participate in the second debate with Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger, shortly after the organising body announced that the October 15 event would be held virtually.The two campaigns were trying to rescue the debates in an ongoing exchange of statements.“I am not going to do a virtual debate,” Trump, who is convalescing from Covid-19, said in an interview to Fox Business. “I am not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate, that is ridiculous.”The Trump campaign then suggested two in-person debates: a delayed second debate on October 22, when the third and final debate was to take place, and pushing the third debate to October 29.The Biden campaign, which agreed to the virtual debate on October 15, also consented to it being shifted to October 22 and be held in-person. But it rejected the suggestion to hold the third debate on October 29, saying, “We look forward to participating in the final debate, scheduled for October 22, which already is tied for the latest debate date in 40 years. Donald Trump can show up, or he can decline again. That’s his choice.” The Commission on Presidential Debates, an independent body that has conducted presidential and vice-president debates for decades, announced on Thursday morning that “in order to protect the health and safety of all involved”, the second presidential debate scheduled for October 15 “will take the form of a town meeting, in which the candidates would participate from separate remote locations”.The third debate is scheduled for October 22, less than a fortnight before the close of voting on November 3, as per the original calendar.The commission did not cite specifics but there were concerns that President Trump might have been already infected at the first debate, which was held on September 29. He and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the disease on October 1, which was confirmed by a more elaborate test the next day.Calls for changing the next debates, including for vice-president, to virtual events, peaked after the president’s hospitalisation. He has since returned to the White House to recover, but has been eager to get out, claiming he is no longer contagious. “I’m back because I’m a perfect physical specimen,” he said in the fox interview.The president also went on to call Senator Kamala Harris a “monster”, a “communist” and “unlikeable” for her remarks at the debate with vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday night.The vice-presidential debate on Wednesday night was in-person but Pence and Harris were separated by plexiglass to minimise chances of Covid exposure. Pence has tested negative but the White House has turned into a “hot-spot” with increasing infections.The Trump administration’s handling of the deadliest health crisis in more than 100 years dominated the vice-presidential debate, with Harris, further cementing her place in US history as the first woman of colour and Indian-American of either gender to participate in such an event, landing the first punch.“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris said, in response to a question in the first segment of the debate, held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.“I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first,” said Pence, defending Trump and himself as head of the White House task force appointed by the president to lead the fight against the pandemic.Despite the underlying tensions, Harris and Pence debated calmly, unlike their respective ticket leads Biden and Trump whose debate had devolved into name-calling.With 210,000 dead, more than 7 million infections and President Trump, the first lady and a growing number of people in their circle testing positive, Covid-19 was the top issue at the debate. They clashed also on Covid-19 vaccine, climate change, trade war with China, economy, racism, healthcare, Supreme Court, women’s right to abortion and religion.As the running mate on a ticket that’s leading in national polls by a wide margin, Harris was expected to play it safe and not hand the Trump campaign a lifeline. She did just that, overlooking many opportunities to attack Pence, to the disappointment of supporters who had expected to see flashes of her prosecutorial skills.“The debate was civil and constructive as compared to the Presidential debate,” said MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, a leading Indian-American advocacy group. “Kamala and Pence delivered their positions passionately and we now have 27 days to decide.”Puneet Ahluwalia, a Republican running for Lt Governor in Virginia, a state that used to be Republican but has widely come to be considered Democratic lately, said “VP Pence clearly distinguished himself by highlighting the exemplary job done for the American people by President Trump and his administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-suggests-two-delayed-debates-biden-accepts-one/story-siLxgYnwdNnno1MZFwmhfK.html
