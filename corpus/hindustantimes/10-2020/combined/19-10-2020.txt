19-10-2020||News||Analysis | Should corporates take a stand on TV news?||The controversy around television news channels manipulating Televison Rating Points (TRPs) has turned the spotlight on three issues plaguing television news. The first is the growing toxicity in coverage that sometimes borders on what may be termed “hate speech”. The second is the reliability of the TV rating system which decides the fate of nearly ₹30,000 crore in advertising revenues. The third — linked to the two — is the role the advertiser plays in moderating this stridency by leveraging ad spends.The coverage of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and its aftermath made a spectacle that would make most reality shows seem moderate in comparison. Hyper-aggressive anchors, high-voltage drama news breaks, dissing rival channels’ stories have become the norm — all for an increased share of TRPs.TRP is an estimate of the TV viewership for a show, and is the only metric that determines the viewing patterns of 840 million Indians in 197 million TV-owning households and is the basis on which advertisers allocate their money. A TRP of 10 means 10% of Indians with a TV, in of a specified demographic or geography, are watching a channel at a point in time. That is about 84 million viewers.TV advertising spends in 2019 around ₹28,000 crore, excluding Goods and Services Tax (GST). Of this, news occupies a relatively small share of 13% of the total audience, well behind general entertainment, movies, music and sports, and gets ₹3,640 crore of advertising, spread over nearly 400 news channels.Given that news viewership is a small segment of overall viewership, even a small change in TRPs will mean a big swing in ad revenues. Advertising comprises nearly 45% of news channel revenues and can adversely affect channel viability. In this scenario, is there a case for brands to use ad spend as a tool to aid responsible behaviour?Earlier this year, more than 600 companies, including some of the world’s largest advertisers, pulled advertising off Facebook in the United States (US) as part of the “Stop Hate for Profit” campaign. This was for its refusal to moderate hate speech during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. Even in India, a few advertisers have been debating the idea of boycotting certain news channels for similar reasons.One view is that in a true democracy, corporations should not be allowed to tell news channels how and what to report. If corporates withhold spends on channels with a view to ask them to “behave”, they are fundamentally interfering in the process of news delivery, and are actively diving into areas that are beyond their commercial mandate.Such advertiser activism is tantamount to strong-arming news channels with a view to throttle their content and breaches the line between commerce and editorial independence. While today the expectation may be to pull their advertising off news channels that may seem toxic, it won’t be long before activists expect brands to pick sides in ongoing political and social debates, and this can have no end. Also, what constitutes toxicity in a news channel may be quite subjective.Brands also cater to diverse consumer segments and what seems like a justified stance to some customers may seem partisan and biased to another. This can impact revenue and raises questions on the personal alignments of brand owners and their accountability to investors. In today’s polarised atmosphere, any attempt to boycott a channel can backfire, especially if that channel has wide viewership — even though the brand custodians may view that segment of viewers with disdain. In a country with diverging views, choosing issues and sides will be a nightmare that most brands would like to avoid.Businesses which sense that their customers are perturbed about the content or coverage on any particular news outlet, or find the editorial environment incongruous to their brand’s values, will subtly pull back — without overtly making a statement. Businesses also have the option of driving opinion on moderation and responsible behaviour through their own advertising messaging and by supporting causes in the space that they think some news channels are disrupting.The alternative view fast gathering momentum is that it is incumbent for corporations to do the right thing even though it may have short-term implications on their bottomline. Purpose is now becoming central to companies and sticking to strong ethical principles even in the face of short-term threats to profitability is best. A business entity has a stake in the community they operate in and they must contribute positively to stay relevant. Moreover, a new generation of millennials expect their brands to stand up for issues that matter to them. While the government has directed all channels to strictly adhere to the programme code under the Cable Television Regulation Act and cautioned against airing content that is slanderous, defamatory, or based on innuendo and half-truths, the real challenge to address is the need to make TRPs tamper-proof.A combination of a more robust sample by increasing the number of household meters and systemic checks need to be put in place. The government would do well to subsidise the costs that would be needed to make this happen for the greater good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/analysis-should-corporates-take-a-stand-on-tv-news/story-w1lIpcDp9BgnKf6OB5xAeO.html

The arrested accused, Sandeep Machchindra Wagh, had been harassing her since a year, said Oshiwara police officers.Sayed said, “In August 2019, I had gone to Ahmednagar for a protest regarding water issues. Wagh took my number from someone and started calling and texting me without any reason. I was fed up and had blocked him.” “Recently on October 4, he called me again. I didn’t realise it was him and answered the call. He told me that he was calling from Pathardi, Ahmednagar and wanted to invite me for a birthday party. I told him that I charge ₹1 lakh for attending any party. He then started abusing me, following which I warned him that I would file a police complaint. He replied that he would rape me and even kill me if I dared to visit Ahmednagar,” said Sayed.“I immediately disconnected the call and contacted my brother in Ahmednagar and told him everything. I shared the number with him to see who the person was and why he was threatening and abusing me. When my brother called Wagh, he abused my brother as well. He even tried to spread lies about me saying that he supplies drugs to me,” Sayed said.Following this, Sayed filed a complaint against the caller and Oshiwara police registered a case under sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 506(2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.Inspector Vivek Shende from Oshiwara police station said, “We have arrested the accused and produced him before Andheri metropolitan magistrate court on Monday.

A tender in this regard, floated by the BMC in September, was extended until the end of October.Till September, the Centre was making these kits available to municipal bodies. Since then, the Maharashtra government procured 12.5 lakh kits from a private company. BMC had planned to procure them from the state, but most of the test kits were found to be faulty.As of now, the civic body says that their stock of RT-PCR test kits will last till November 15. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “We have an adequate supply of RT-PCR test kits as of now. We are taking a weekly review of the kits that we have and ensuring that there is no shortage. We have conveyed it to the public labs in the city to project if there will be a shortage and inform us. Simultaneously, the tendering process to procure RT-PCR test kits will be completed.”Apart from RT-PCR test kits, the BMC also uses rapid antigen test kits to identify Covid-positive patients, with results delivered in less than 30 minutes. However, these tests are prone to give false negatives compared to RT-PCR tests. Nearly 70% of the daily tests conducted in the city currently are being done through RT-PCR, and rapid antigen test kits have taken a back seat following criticism over false negatives and unreliability.Since September, BMC conducted between 8,000- 15,000 Covid-19 tests daily, of which 30-40% were through rapid antigen testing. Civic officials said that once the procurement of new kits is completed, the daily test count will reach 20,000. According to data released by the civic body, so far, the BMC has conducted 13.54 lakh tests across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-bmc-extends-tender-deadline-for-90-000-more-rt-pcr-test-kits-for-mumbai/story-xUYKtGzMfzWNYEjlCVf2VO.html
19-10-2020||Noida||Thin attendance as schools reopen after seven months in Ghaziabad and Noida||Ghaziabad/Noida: Government and private schools in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar reopened for students of classes 9 to 12 on Monday after remaining shut for nearly seven months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, most of the schools in the two districts recorded thin attendance as a majority of parents are still wary of sending their wards to schools. According to officials of the Ghaziabad district education department, the first day saw an overall attendance of about 10 to 15%. However, the officials said they expected that the number of students at the schools will rise in coming days. In GB Nagar, the government schools witnessed better attendance at 39% of the permitted seats, while the overall attendance in the private schools of the district was mere 11%, officials said. According to the Ghaziabad education department officials, about 50 of 165 private schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE) opened on Monday, while all 226 schools affiliated to the state board -- whether aided, unaided and government-run -- opened up. The Uttar Pradesh government on October 10 had issued directions for reopening of schools (for classes 9 to 12 in the first phase) and also released a set of precautionary measures to be taken at schools in the wake of the pandemic. The government order had also said that students should be allowed to attend classes only after written consent of their parents while online classes would continue. “We opened only classes 10 and 12, and only 17 students came to the school for the classes. The online classes were also held, and the offline classes were made available to other students online. Since we will close down from October 22, we expect that the present days are primarily a test-run about how we run our systems as per standard operating procedure,” said Jyoti Gupta, director of Delhi Public School, Sahibabad. “Once we open up again after the festivals, we will also start transport facility, and expect that the attendance will rise further,” she added. Many schools had put up posters welcoming children to school and had even marked circles on the premises where students were checked for body temperature and other Covid-like symptoms. Some schools said that they opened up on Monday but no students arrived. “We have about 350 students in classes 10 and 12. We had conducted two surveys, and majority of parents were in favour of opening schools from November 2 after the festivals. In the meantime, we have also started with the Covid-19 test of our staff members and have taken all preventive measures in the wake of the pandemic,” said Trilok Singh Bisht, principal of Delhi Public School Ghaziabad, Vasundhara. Office bearers of the Independent Schools Federation of India (ISFI), having about 100 member schools in Ghaziabad, said that about 32 of their member schools reopened on Monday. “We had attendance in different schools in the range of 17-100 students, which means about 15% students attended the physical classes. All our member schools have put in place the SOP and have already started with testing of staff for Covid-19. We are expecting that the attendance will rise after Durga Puja festivals, and will rise further after Diwali. With mandatory use of masks and social distancing, we do not expect much issue in students attending schools,” said Subhash Jain, president of ISFI. Ravi Dutt, Ghaziabad district inspector of schools (DIOS), said that the estimated attendance in all schools was about 10-15% on the first day. He further said that officials of the district administration and the education department also carried out inspection at various schools to check if the SOP has been put in place. “The overall attendance was thin in the range of about 10-15%. But more students arrived at government schools. Our officials carried out inspection at different schools about the adherence to SOP, and we found that schools have taken steps,” Dutt said. The parents, on the other hand, said that they did not send their children as the online classes have emerged as preferred mode in the ongoing pandemic situation. “My daughter is in class 10 and she has preferred to stay home for her online studies. We feel that once the vaccine is made available, more parents would be willing to send children to schools,” said Ruby Singh, a resident of Arihant Harmony, Indirapuram. The parents’ association said that they were expecting low turnout of students. “It is because the parents are still worried. Further, the schools are taking consent forms from parents. Instead, the responsibility of students should be taken by schools or the administration. We conducted a survey among about 200 parents and about 90% of them are unwilling to send their children to schools till Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson of Ghaziabad Parents’ Association.Even the students, who attended schools, said that several activities such as daily assembly, lunch break and games were missing in their schools. “I was very enthusiastic to visit school to see my friends. But, it was very disappointing for us that we’ve to fall in with different atmosphere here due to the implementation of safety norms. I’ll now avoid coming to the school,” said a class 11 student of Government Inter Girls’ School in Noida’s Sector 51. Echoing similar views, a class 10 student of a private school in Noida Sector 11, said, “The saddest part for me is that my best friend has been put in other group as the class has been split into two different groups.” In Noida, UP board schools record better attendance Neeraj Kumar Pandey, DIOS, GB Nagar, said that some of the UP board schools in the district recorded nearly 80% attendance of permitted seats. “But, the overall attendance in 153 schools, affiliated to UP state education board, was recorded 39% in the allotted half capacity. Similarly, a few private schools affiliated to CBSE recorded nearly 30% attendance. But, since most of the private schools didn’t open today, the overall attendance in 181 CBSE schools in the district was reduced to mere 11%,” he said. Pandey further said that children were not allowed to bring any eatables as there was no lunch break. “Even sharing the water bottles and stationery is not allowed. We have asked the parents to pick and drop their children in their own vehicles. Schools, which were open today, ran in two shifts and they have been permitted to call only 50% of students on alternate days,” Pandey said. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the contrast in attendance between private schools and UP board schools clearly indicates the quantum of apprehension in different cross-sections of the society. “We’ll keep monitoring the activities and safety measures of all the schools, irrespective of the attendance percentage there. On the first day, some parents of the children, who have given their consent for offline classes, also visited the schools, which is a positive sign for increase in students’ appearance in coming days. The schools had been closed in the state on March 13 this year after the Covid-19 outbreak,” he said. However, the parents are still reluctant to send their wards to schools. “We are not eager to submit consent letters immediately. Since the schools lack infrastructure to ensure a seating plan with social distancing, it will better for us to adapt a ‘wait and watch’ policy,” said Karun Singh, a parent residing in Noida Sector 77. Corroborating similar views, Deepak Kumar, father of two students in Amity School (Noida), said that there is no point in risking the lives of children till theory classes are live streamed. “But, we’ll have no option other than to send my children to schools for practical classes. However, we have yet not given consent letters in this connection,” he said. When contacted, Renu Singh, principal of Amity school, said that the classes in the school could not begin as consent letters from the parents are still awaited. “However, we kicked off many other activities on the campus today. We are trying to convince the parents about the essentiality of practical classes, particularly for the students appearing in class 10 and 12 board examinations,” she said.DPS Noida said that it is geared up to begin with the trial run of opening the school from Tuesday. “The school begins the trial run with a limited number of class 12 students tomorrow followed by a small number of class 10 students the next day. The students will only be allowed after taking the consent by their parents. The management and the teachers are in the process of convincing and assuring the parents of the safety measures being taken by the school. The school will follow all the norms laid down by the government,” said Kamini Bhasin, principal of DPS Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/thin-attendance-as-schools-reopen-after-seven-months-in-ghaziabad-and-noida/story-N0U3Uu0Y7M7E9rpHkrnwFN.html

On Monday, Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL) said it ran approximately 140 trips till 5pm. By 7pm, 10,194 commuters had used the service. The Metro had been shut for seven months during the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “As Mumbai opens up gradually, the footfalls are expected to grow significantly in the coming few weeks,” said an MMOPL spokesperson. Prior to the lockdown, the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro’s daily ridership was more than 4 lakh. MMOPL said it would observe the travel pattern for a week or a fortnight before increasing services. Prior to the lockdown, MMOPL ran close to 400 services daily, which has now been reduced to around 200 services, with each train catering to approximately 300 commuters. On Sunday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) also restarted Monorail services in a graded manner. Around 350 commuters used the service on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/13-000-commuters-travel-on-mumbai-metro-on-day-1-of-reopening/story-JkEJO0GrVToTJ2YojZ748N.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Conman uses Prince Narula’s name to cheat Mumbai resident of ₹5 lakh, booked||Mumbai Police booked an event manager for allegedly cheating a Parel resident of ₹5 lakh. The accused posed as a music producer and told the complainant to invest ₹5 lakh in an album that he is making with Big Boss Season 9 winner Prince Narula, and offered ₹7 lakh in return. To gain the complainant’s confidence the accused, Krishna Kumar Sharma, also arranged a meeting of complainant’s son with Narula and introduced him with the model. However, after getting the money, the accused started ignoring the complainant, following which the complainant lodged a complaint. The police have mentioned Narula’s name in the complaint, but not as an accused.Speaking to HT, Narula said, “Sharma, who is an event manager, misused my name, misguided me while introducing me to the complainant’s son. Sharma also owes me ₹8 lakh and has now cut all communications with me. He had offered to work with me for a music album, but the project never materialised. To save people from such conmen, I keep on posting awareness messages on my timelines on social media platforms and appeal people to directly contact my manager and verify things before sending money to any person taking my name.”The complainant, Sheetal More, 50, works at the small cause court while her son Prasad is an aspiring model and music artist who also performs in music events. It is during one such event in Bengaluru that he met a person named Raj, who in turn introduced him to Sharma, who is originally from New Alipur, Kolkata.Sharma told Prasad that he is making an album with Narula in America and is short of ₹15 lakh. He further added that Raj invested ₹5 lakh while another friend was ready to invest ₹5 lakh. He then asked Prasad to invest ₹5 lakh and get ₹7 lakh in return,” according to the first information report (FIR), a copy of which is with HT.As Prasad and his mother did not believe them, Sharma, in 2018, called Prasad and Raj to a housing society in Andheri (East) where Narula lives and introduced them to Narula saying that the two would be investing in the music album, the police said.After this, More and Prasad invested ₹5 lakh in the project in 2018 and signed an agreement with Sharma.However, after receiving the money, both Sharma and Raj started ignoring the duo. Following this, More approached the police last year. Initially, the accused said he would pay back, so the police waited. However, the police have now registered an FIR against Sharma under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code for cheating. Police sources said when More had called Narula, he had told her that he was working with Sharma on an album, but later something went wrong and they parted ways. Narula had also offered to help her. More could not be contacted for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/conman-uses-prince-narula-s-name-to-cheat-mumbai-resident-of-5-lakh-booked/story-mvWTG9rxZyOsOX1HTZCZiI.html

The 19-year-old daughter of a farmer was diagnosed with a mental illness and has been undergoing treatment for the past few months, said police. In the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, the girl ran away from home. After her family found her gone in the morning, a local search was conducted in the area, but to no avail. The girl had taken her clothes and her phone, which had run out of battery. Meanwhile, around 9am on Friday, Damini squad of Raigad police received a call from Bazaar Peth in Revdanda about a girl creating ruckus in the market. As the girl seemed distressed, Damini squad – an all-women team for women safety – went to the spot. Two women constables — Abhiyanti Mokal and Anushka Pulekar — approached the girl, but she grew violent and started tearing her clothes and throwing her belongings. “The women constables then quickly changed into civil clothes and approached the girl. This time, they were able to talk to her without making her anxious. They helped her calm down and brought her to the police station, where they fed her and tried to find her home,” said Suresh Yamgar, Raigad police spokesperson. While the girl did not divulge proper information, based on initial inquiry, the police learnt that she took first a vehicle and then travelled the rest of 30km on foot. Later, after charging her phone, police officers managed to contact her family and subsequently handed her over to her father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/raigad-police-reunites-girl-with-family-within-12-hours/story-Uo33Y79sYuoVUoNdsbKHmM.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Public transport to soon open for more sectors: Maharashtra government to Bombay HC||The Maharashtra government on Monday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it has not conducted a meeting of all stakeholders for the usage of public transport services, as per the previous directions of the court, and would require some time to convene the meeting. The state, however, informed that it had held a meeting of various department heads under the chairmanship of state chief secretary, to deliberate on increasing public transport services for various sectors. After the court asked the state government to consider allowing daily wagers, vendors and shop employees to use trains, and to increase services corresponding to the number of such commuters, the state informed the court that Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR) had both increased daily services to 700. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a bunch of public interest litigations (PILs) filed by individual lawyers and the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa, seeking allowance for advocates to avail suburban local services, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state was inclined to permit the same. He, however, added that the state was working on the modalities to ensure that the facility was not misused as a lot of people had been caught travelling with fake IDs. The state said that it would consider the lawyers’ request by Tuesday and take a decision on the same. After hearing the submissions, the HC indicated that the earlier arrangements for lawyers on an experimental basis would continue till November 6, and posted the matter for further hearing on October 29. Kumbhakoni submitted that though the court had directed the state to conduct a meeting of all stakeholders from sectors which have been opened up, the same was not conducted, and it needed more time to convene the same. He, however, assured the bench that a meeting of all department heads had been conducted, and the issue of allowing the normal public to travel by local trains was discussed. Kumbhakoni added that it was decided to allow all women – from essential services as well as other sectors –to travel on local trains from October 17. “The further decision of opening local trains will be taken in a phase-wise manner depending on the situation in Mumbai,” said Kumbhakoni. After hearing the submissions, the bench reiterated its stand that it was concerned about the survival of everyone and hence, wanted to know how soon public transport could be made available for all sectors. It also brought up the option of introducing staggered work timings. The court said that while it was continuing the temporary arrangement for lawyers to travel on local trains, it did not want a situation wherein the courts would have to be shut. The bench further directed the state to consider the representation of lawyers to allow registered clerks to travel by local trains as well as use public transport by Tuesday and said that it would hear the matter further on October 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/public-transport-to-soon-open-for-more-sectors-maharashtra-government-to-bombay-hc/story-NIP8huz36gYI9sbsL4bI3K.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||A month after forming panels, no action against private schools in Mumbai on fee hikes||A month after the Maharashtra education department formed two committees to address complaints with respect to fee hikes in private schools, the department has still not acted on a single school in the city. An official from the education department said, “The work of the committees is getting a bit delayed due to the Covid-19 situation and the resultant restrictions with respect to travel. However, officials are working on the issue and will give a report soon.” Over the past few months, several parents have taken to social media to raise their concerns on unjustified fees in private schools across the state. Several disgruntled parents also participated in the Thali Bajao protest organised by the Forum for Fairness in Education, a city-based non-government organisation, on October 10. With no action against private schools despite several complaints, parents said the education department is not helping address their grievances. “In our school, a fee hike is made even as majority parents have opposed the move. When we objected, the school threatened to remove our children. Complaints made to the education department have gone in vain,” said the parent of a south Mumbai-based school. In a circular issued by the office of the deputy director on September 16, two committees of department officials were formed to look into the complaints of parents from different schools. “While private schools have the powers to fix their own fees as per the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees Act) 2011, the act has set some rules with respect to a cap on the percentage of fee hike, and the duration after which it can be imposed. It has also laid down the procedure for its approval by the Parent Teachers Association. However, some parents have alleged that schools are not following these norms. Hence, we have asked for an inspection of such schools to verify their documents,” said an official from the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/a-month-after-forming-panels-no-action-against-private-schools-in-mumbai-on-fee-hikes/story-aNsbv20GsGRJ1aWSX4U7EO.html
19-10-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Police face challenge as Nepalese origin criminals use state to hide, crossover to Nepal||In a new challenge for Uttarakhand Police, criminals of Nepalese origin are using the state to hide and, in some cases, crossover to Nepal after committing crimes in other cities. The trend came to light after police teams of at least three states, including Maharashtra, Telangana and Punjab, visited the state in the last 10 days to nab Nepalese origin criminals hiding in the state after committing high profile thefts in their respective states. A senior police officer, who didn’t wish to be named said, “the trend has come up in the past few years only.” “Earlier, these Nepalese origin people were not into crime and were considered as trustworthy. But after there was a regime change there some years ago, some Nepalese people have now got into crime in India using the porous border we share with them,” said the officer. The official said that the “Nepalese origin criminals are using the same modus operandi as the Bangladeshi dacoit gangs use in India”.

They then cross over to Bangladesh from the same West Bengal border with the valuables to evade AN arrest. The Nepalese criminals are also following the same thing,” he said. “Also, as Nepalese origin people of both Nepalese and Indian citizenship are living in Uttarakhand for more than 150 years, the criminal elements try to blend in with them to evade arrest.” Former director general of police, Uttarakhand, Aloke B Lal termed the development as a “challenge for the state police.” “This is definitely a challenge for the state police as it is very difficult for them to keep an eye on all such elements considering the fact that the state shares a porous border with Nepal,” said Lal. He said, “unlike other countries, the Nepalese people are allowed to work here freely after entering without a passport. There are possibilities that some criminal elements may also enter taking advantage of the porous border,” he said. The former state top cop also said that the state police cannot plug the loopholes at the border considering the length of the border as well as its available manpower. “Even if it puts all its manpower at its outposts near the border, there would be numerous unchecked points from where the criminal elements may cross over,” said Lal. Ashok Kumar, director general (law & order), Uttarakhand Police, also accepted the development as a challenge and said, “the district police departments, especially in the border districts, would increase vigil.” “We would increase our vigil and alertness to nab any suspicious element in the state. The state police have been coordinating with other state police departments in their probe in our state to nab such criminal elements,” said Kumar.In nearly two weeks, there has been a surprising increase in cases involving Nepalese citizens who are being tracked by the police teams of other states in Uttarakhand. In one of the incidents, a team of Navi Mumbai police reached Bhatlani village of Nainital district in search of a Nepalese man accused of committing theft at a doctor’s house in Navi Mumbai where he used to work as a servant. He allegedly stole jewellery, cash and other valuables worth lakhs from the house and came to the village where his wife lived. The police team failed to nab the accused but took his wife with them to Mumbai after finding a stolen gold biscuit from her possession. His wife told them that he fled to Nepal. Similarly, in another incident, a police team from Telangana visited the state and nabbed seven Nepalese origin criminals who used to commit thefts and burglaries in an organised manner in Telangana and its neighbouring states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In another incident, a team of Punjab police from Ludhiana reached the border town of Banbasa in Champawat district near India-Nepal border to nab two Nepalese men accused of committing theft of about Rs 1.50 cr at a businessman’s house. The team, however, had to return empty-handed as they couldn’t nab the accused believed to be hiding in Banbasa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-police-face-challenge-as-nepalese-origin-criminals-use-state-to-hide-crossover-to-nepal/story-XDOefTrNvLcA09TP3LyzvI.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Anyone with self-respect will not continue in post, NCP chief Sharad Pawar slams governor Koshyari||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Monday upped the ante against Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over his “secular” taunt at chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray last week. Pawar said anyone with self-respect would have resigned from the position of governor after being publicly rebuked by Union home minister Amit Shah. “What can I say about the governor? The Union minister for home affairs has spoken about him… I have come across several governors in my long political career, but no one has taken such a stand. A governor must uphold the dignity of the office. He is also expected to maintain the dignity of a CM’s office,” Pawar said. “It is good Shah rebuked him. I believe a person who has self-respect will not continue in the post after being publicly reprimanded by the Union minister for home affairs,” said the veteran leader, who was in Osmanabad as part of his two-day tour to flood-hit areas in central Maharashtra. The state’s BJP unit shot back, questioning Pawar’s self-respect over “forming an unnatural alliance in the state to form the government”. Party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “Where was Pawar’s self-respect when he chose to make an unnatural alliance with Shiv Sena to form the government in the state?. We believe there are many issues the state is facing at present. Instead of commenting on the governor’s statement, concentration should be more on issues such as providing relief to flood-affected farmers.”Koshyari recently wrote to the CM about unlocking places of worship from the Covid-19 lockdown and asked if Thackeray, who is also president of the ruling Shiv Sena, had “suddenly turned secular”. His remark triggered a war of words with the CM, as the latter reminded him in a letter that secularism was one of the tenets of the Constitution that he swore upon when taking oath as Maharashtra governor. In a recent interview to a TV news channel, Shah said Koshyari could have chosen his words better.“I have gone through the letter. He has made a passing reference. However, I feel he should have been more restrained in his choice of words,” Shah has said. Before this, Pawar had written a letter to prime minister Narendra Modi over Koshyari’s letter, saying he was “shocked and surprised” at the language used. “In the very preamble of our Constitution the word ‘secular’ is added that equates and shields all religions and hence the chair of the chief minister must uphold such tenets of the Constitution. Unfortunately, hon. governor’s letter to the chief minister invokes the connotation as if written to the leader of a political party. I firmly believe that in a democracy, free exchange of views between the hon. governor and the hon. chief minister must take place,” Pawar said in his letter to PM Modi. “However, the tone and tenor used must always be in keeping with the stature of the constitutional post occupied by the individuals. Looking at the turn of events, the chief minister in fact was left with no option, but to release his reply to the hon. governor in the press. I fully endorse the decision of the hon. chief minister on this issue,” he added. NCP is a part of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, which comprises the Sena and the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/anyone-with-self-respect-will-not-continue-in-post-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-slams-governor-koshyari/story-pKAvyyBpVAfKuKXTTrnrPN.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra past 1.6 million cases, daily count dips further||Maharashtra on Monday went past 1,600,000 Covid-19 cases with its lowest single-day spike since July 7 (104 days) as 5,984 new infections took the tally to 1,601,365, which includes 173,759 active cases. On July 7, the state had recorded 5,134 cases. The state also reported 125 more fatalities, its lowest one-day death count since June 22, pushing the toll to 42,240 Meanwhile, Mumbai registered its lowest single-day spike in 48 days with 1,234 fresh infections, taking its count to 243,169, while reporting 43 deaths to push the toll to 9,819. On September 1, Mumbai had reported 1,142 cases. The active caseload in the city went below 20,000 and stood at 19,906. So far, 212,979 patients have recovered and discharged. The recovery rate of Mumbai stood at 87%, while the case fatality rate (CFR) touched 4.03%. Since the first week of September, daily cases have been on the rise in Mumbai with over 2,000 cases on most days of that month. However, in October, cases have been dipping on alternate days.The state’s low case count on Monday could also be attributed to a comparatively lower number of tests. In the previous 24 hours, 46,312 samples were tested, while the average number of daily tests carried out in the month so far is 75,236. State health officials attribute the lower numbers to fewer tests during the weekend, data of which is reflected on Mondays and Tuesdays.The state touched the grim mark of 1,600,000 Covid-19 cases 224 days after it recorded its first on March 9. However, key parameters, including the doubling rate and positivity rate are showing signs that the spread of coronavirus is slowing down in the state. State health department officials, however, warn that there could be a rise in new cases by mid-November.The doubling rate, which is a crucial parameter to show the growth of the outbreak, improved to 48 days in the state. It took 48 days for the state to double its tally from 800,000 to 1,600,000, which is 14 days more than what it took for the state to go from 400,000 to 800,000 Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra went past 800,000 cases on September 1, while it crossed the 400,000-mark on July 29.Another important parameter, the positivity rate, is also seeing a dip compared to previous months. Positivity rate is the percentage of samples that have tested positive from the total samples tested. While Maharashtra’s overall positivity rate is 19.56%, the positivity rate in October so far is under 16% (15.57%). The positivity rate in September was 22.41%, 18.48% in August, 21.25% in July, 21.22% in June, 18.07% in May, 7.31% in April and 4.77% in March.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the Covid-19 situation in the state is seeing a “decline”. He also added that active cases are declining at a faster rate than the new cases. Pointing out that the number of cases has declined by over 50% between September and October he said, “In the second week of September itself, we had nearly 1.53 lakh new cases, and now in the last week we had around 70,000 new cases. This is a reduction by 50% in new cases.”When asked about the lower testing in October, Awate reasoned that with fewer positive cases, the immediate contacts of people, which form the major portion of new tests, have also reduced. “Close contacts of patients form the major component in daily tests. But with new cases reducing, the number of contacts declines; thereby the testing has reduced marginally. Take September second week for instance, where we had over 1.5 lakh cases. In that week, our daily testing was about 89,000. Now it is about 78,000-80,000. So the decline in testing is about 11%, while new cases is about 50%, ” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-past-1-6-million-cases-daily-count-dips-further/story-m9vGB0XTI9Jh9KATsSXG8M.html
19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Liquor smuggling: Haryana cops arrest NV distilleries chairman from Delhi office||Police on Monday arrested the chairman of M/s NV distilleries Ashok Jain from his Delhi office for alleged role in smuggling of liquor in Haryana. Police officials said Jain was earlier served with notices to join investigations in a 2019 liquor smuggling case registered by Panipat police at Samalkha. However, an arrest warrant was issued by a court after he refused to comply. The FIR registered on October 13, 2019 pertained to recovery of 1,179 cases of liquor (there are 12 bottles in each case) marked as Crazy Romeo, an Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) brand owned by M/s NV distilleries having production licenses at Rajpura in Punjab and Ambala in Haryana, officials said. Police had registered a case of cheating, forgery of documents and unlawful import, export, possession of liquor under sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Punjab Excise Act. The seizures of smuggled liquor allegedly manufactured at NV distilleries were also mentioned in detail by a Special Enquiry Team (SET) in its report. The SET, constituted in May by the state government to inquire into the instances of pilferage of liquor from warehouses, had found glaring deficiencies in functioning of excise and taxation department and indicated collusion of officials in smuggling and illegal sale of liquor. “ On analysing police reports regarding the source and intended destination of liquor (more than 100 cases) recovered during April 1, 2019 to May 10, 2020, it was noticed that in several cases there are clear indications that the seized liquor has been sourced from NV distilleries in Naraingarh, Ambala or NV distilleries, Rajpura in Patiala or RS distillery, Chandrao, Karnal. However, the investigating officers have not directed the concerned authorities of the distillery to join investigations,” the SET report had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/liquor-smuggling-haryana-cops-arrest-nv-distilleries-chairman-from-delhi-office/story-lqySKGETLqsfnYX3IDKx5O.html

19-10-2020||Mumbai||Women commuters on Mumbai trains: No consensus between railways and Maharashtra government yet?||Even as the state has asked railways to allow all women commuters to travel by Mumbai suburban trains on Friday, the railways and state officials are yet to reach a consensus on the standard operating procedure (SOP) and operations of more train services. While the railways stated they have asked the state to provide the quantum of increase in passengers and are ready to permit women to travel by local trains, state authorities have questioned the delay.Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said he will again write to the railways. “We had announced the decision, written a letter to the railways and had informed them about the time slot. They have promised us about allowing women commuters in suburban trains in the court. I have also had an interaction with union home secretary Ajay Bhalla and senior railway officials. I don’t know why it has been delayed. Tomorrow again [on Tuesday], I will be writing a letter to the railways in this regard,” Kumar told HT.The Maharashtra government has allowed women commuters to travel in local trains in the stipulated time from between 11am and 3pm, and 7pm till late midnight from October 17. The idea behind the proposal is to make private offices adopt staggered office timings to prevent crowding of trains. The railways are expected to allow all women commuters to travel during non-peak hours from this week. The central and western railways have asked the state to provide an estimated increase in the number of passengers. “We are looking at operating additional trains in the time slot provided by the state. Additional women special trains (women-only trains) can also be operated. However, the decision will only be taken after the state conveys the estimated increase in passengers along with the implementation of QR-based code system and other modalities,” said a senior railway official. Currently, both the CR and WR operate two women special local train services each. Train services are operational only for employees working in essential care, along with differently abled commuters and cancer patients. The railways had on Friday night forwarded the request of state government to the railway board that supervises functioning of zonal railways. The board has sent the proposal for nod of the ministry of home affairs (MHA). On Sunday, senior railway authorities and state discussed over the phone the modalities and increase in the number of passengers. Kumar and Bhalla also discussed the issue. Meanwhile, the WR on Monday issued a statement that the railways have asked the state government to convey the quantum of passengers likely to increase.“Ministry of Home affairs (MHA) have also looked into the issue and have asked state government authorities to finalise the necessary modalities in view of Covid-19 pandemic and convey the same to the Railways. The decision will be based to ensure that social & medical protocols like social distancing with regards to prevailing Covid-19 protocols can be followed,” read the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/women-commuters-on-mumbai-trains-no-consensus-between-railways-and-maharashtra-government-yet/story-N28LzOpVRQIr38unGp0UwM.html
19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Stubble burning: 252 challans, ₹6.50 lakh fine imposed on farmers in Haryana||Amid concerns about the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi-NCR reaching critical levels due to farm fires, the Haryana government has issued 252 challans and imposed ₹ 6.50 lakh fine on farmers of 11 districts for burning crop residue so far. Other steps taken to stop crop residue burning include registration of 124 police complaints/first information reports (FIRs) in six districts till October 14, Haryana government informed the Supreme Court last Friday. As per the official data, Fatehabad district tops the list with 44 complaints/FIRs registered for stubble burning followed by Jind 43, Sirsa and Kaithal 13 each, and Ambala 10. No FIR was registered in other paddy sowing districts like Karnal and Yamunanagar. The apex court has appointed justice Madan B Lokur (retd) as a one-man committee to look into stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. In his October 15 affidavit, while listing out eight different steps taken to reduce farm fires, Haryana chief secretary Vijai Vardhan assured the top court that the state government has been taking all necessary steps required to curb stubble burning and to prevent environmental pollution. The affidavit was submitted in a case seeking urgent directions to Punjab and Haryana to ensure a complete ban on stubble burning so that the AQI in Delhi-NCR does not reach critical levels this year especially in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. Till October 18, the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) detected majority of active fire locations in Kurukshetra (521) and Karnal (562). Also, 57 challans were issued in Kurukshetra and 24 in Karnal till October 14. The highest 63 challans were issued and ₹ 1.57 lakh fine was imposed in Kaithal district. In Kurukshetra, ₹ 1.35 lakh penalty was imposed. Referring to the data (till Oct 14) received from Indian Council of Agricultural Research (lCAR), the chief secretary told the court that there was decline in active fire locations in Haryana in comparison to Punjab and UP. As per the ICAR data quoted in the affidavit, there were 3,020 active fire locations in Punjab against 737 in Haryana and 249 in UP. During the same period last year, Haryana was ahead with 992 active fire locations, Punjab had 856 incidence of farm fires and UP 271. The state government has stated that in order to follow a focused approach and micro-level planning, the districts were categorised into red, yellow and green zones in terms of incidences of crop residue burning based on the data provided by the HARSAC. As per the HARSAC, there were 2,676 cases of farm fires till October 18. Decomposer technologyThe state government has informed the Supreme Court that Agricultural and Finance Corporation Limited has developed the decomposer technology which requires validation before its implementation. The validation is being done by Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar, in collaboration with department of agriculture and farmers welfare. Trial/Microbial treatment on 21 identified locations in four districts of Hisar, Fatehabad, Kurukshetra and Ambala were conducted till November 15 after harvest of the paddy. The results will be declared by December 31 after laboratory analysis of samples. Thereafter, the technology could be adopted for actual implementation, the chief secretary has stated in the affidavit.

19-10-2020||City||DU second cut-off admissions: 5k+ applications approved on Day 1||New Delhi: At least 5,182 admissions were approved on the first day of merit-based admissions under the second cut-off to undergraduate courses in over 60 Delhi University (DU) colleges of which 2,602 students had paid their fees by Monday evening.Around 2,580 more students whose applications were approved by colleges were yet to pay fees to secure admissions. Nearly 9,785 students had applied for admissions.“There is not a major rush like the first cut-off but we approved more than 150 applications till evening. Maximum applications have been in Sociology and Economics – where cutoffs dropped marginally. There have been queries over fee payment and withdrawals,” said Bijayalaxmi Nanda, acting principal at Miranda House.More than 34, 800 students had taken admission under the first cut-off for the 70,000 undergraduate seats offered by the varsity. Applicants who took admission under the first list but wish to change colleges and apply to eligible colleges under the second cut-off can do so by cancelling their admission and paying a fee of Rs 1,000.On the first day of admissions under second cut-off, colleges reported very few cancellations. At Ramjas College, for instance, around 25 students had cancelled admissions. “There were around 2-3 cancellations per subject. We have approved more than 150 applications today and around 950 students in total have paid the fee till this evening [including first cut-off]. However, students are still able to apply in the courses that have been closed for admissions under the first cut-off, leading to an increased number of applications,” said principal Manoj Khanna.Senior officials at the university said candidates can apply to courses and if admissions are closed for a particular subject, colleges can opt to not look at those applications.Applicants who were eligible to take admission and were meeting the required cut-off of a particular college and course combination in the first cut-off, but did not do so, will not be considered for admission in the same college and course combination in the second cut-off. This is a change from previous years when such students would be allowed to take admissions on the final day of the cut-off if there were remaining seats.“It is sad to reject applications with even 100% aggregate just because they could not take admission under the first cut-off for some or the other reason. Earlier, such students would be given a chance on the third day if the said course had vacant seats,” said an official of a north campus college, requesting anonymity.“There have been very few cancellations in our college and we received over 230 applications under the second cut-off. Gradually, people are getting comfortable with the online system and the process is becoming smoother. We noticed that in some cases, as soon as we approved the application of a student, the system reflected that the fee was already paid. We interpreted that this might be the case of students who had cancelled admissions and had already paid the fee in some other college during the first cut-off,” said Simrit Kaur, principal of Shri Ram College of Commerce.There was no cancellation at Miranda House on Monday. Sanjeev Singh, joint director of Delhi University’s Computer Centre, said, “The money paid by those who have taken admission to other colleges under first cut-off is in the virtual wallet. If they cancel their first admission and apply to another college, the same fee is adjusted for the new college. If the new fee is less than the fee paid, the balance is shown. If it is more, the amount to be paid is shown.”On Monday, internet facilities across south campus colleges such as Ram Lal Anand College, Motilal Nehru College and ARSD college were disrupted, affecting admissions work. Singh said, “There was a fibre issue and internet was down for about an hour or so. This did not affect the applicants as they could continue to apply.”Admissions under the second cut-off will continue till 5 pm Wednesday. Applicants can, however, pay the fee till Friday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-second-cut-off-admissions-5k-applications-approved-on-day-1/story-LXdD1lnNL1P0QMy3vZoNcJ.html
19-10-2020||City||Court dismisses bail of Delhi riot-accused||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Monday dismissed the bail application of a man in connection with the case of the alleged murder of head constable Ratan Lal during the Delhi riots in February. The court while dismissing the plea, said it observed the man’s call detail records (CDR), which showed that around the time of incident, his location was around the spot of the incident and he had received three calls from his counsel who was representing him in the matter.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said the call detail record of accused Shadab Ahmad showed that he was in constant touch with the proclaimed offenders and co-accused in the case —Suleman Siddiqui and Ravish.“It could be a coincidence, but not without significance. I will refrain from commenting as to whether it was morally or ethically appropriate for the learned counsel to have represented the applicant (Ahmad) in the matter,” it said.The judge said that a perusal of his CDRs from January 31, 2020, to February 24, 2020, revealed that he was in touch with some of the co-accused persons in the murder case as well in the matter related to the larger “pre-meditated” conspiracy in the riots, which was being investigated by the Special Cell of the Delhi police.It said the accused was at “flight risk” because he is not a resident of Delhi, adding he was identified by witnesses and the police even though he was not visible on the CCTV footage shown to the court during the bail hearing.During the hearing, advocate Seema Misra, appearing for Ahmad, argued he has been wrongly and maliciously implicated in the matter by the investigating agency just because he belongs to a particular community. There was no electronic evidence available against Shadab either in the form of any CCTV footage or his CDR location, which could prima facie show his presence at the scene of crime on the date of the incident, his counsel said.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying Ahmad used to share stage with other protestors and instigate the gathering against the Government of India, which ultimately led to violence on February 24, resulting in the death of more than 50 people in north-east Delhi, including Lal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-dismisses-bail-of-delhi-riot-accused/story-VuMEs3NriTgqBolqH8sT8K.html

19-10-2020||Mumbai||UG medical aspirants from Maharashtra move Bombay HC over discrepancies in evaluation and NEET scores||Days after the National Testing Agency (NTA) declared results for the undergraduate National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG), a student from Maharashtra has approached the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court alleging discrepancies in the test assessment system after she scored zero in the exam. This student in her writ petition has stated that she was expecting at least 600 out of 720 in her entrance exam and was shocked to see her final scorecard. “After having scored 81.85% in her HSC exams, the student was expecting to score at least 600 in her NEET exam. The first problem was that the NTA never uploaded her optical marking recognition (OMR) sheet, then her result shows she has scored zero out of 720. There is a glitch in their online evaluation system,” said advocate Ashwin Deshpande, who represented the student in court on Monday. The court has now asked NTA to clarify whether the said student’s OMR sheet was uploaded in the first place or not by the next date of hearing. “How can a student score zero marks when she was expecting 600 or more? NTA will have to clarify this,” added Deshpande. This is not the only case where students have pointed at discrepancies in the marks on their scanned OMR sheets and their final scorecard. In another case, a student from Akola district in Maharashtra has also approached the NTA with a similar problem. “As per the provisional answer key shared by NTA in the last week of September and the scanned OMR sheet of every student that was uploaded by the NTA, this student has scored a perfect 720 out of 720. However, as per his final scorecard, he has scored a mere 212 marks which is impossible,” said an activist who is currently helping this student approach the Bombay high court. NEET-UG was conducted across the country on September 13 this year and a second phase of the exam was conducted on October 14, following which the results were declared on October 16. Several students, since, have approached the NTA with the scanned copy of their OMR sheets and their final scorecard highlighting a difference in marks. “My OMR sheet shows two different answers to the same question in two different pages. All these points towards technical trouble in the evaluation software. The NTA will have to clarify this problem soon,” said one of the students on condition of anonymity. On Monday, the director-general of NTA, Vineet Joshi said that prima facie, such blatant discrepancies in marks is not possible. “However, since we have received queries from some students, we are individually checking each query and trying to solve the same at the earliest,” said Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ug-medical-aspirants-from-maharashtra-move-bombay-hc-over-discrepancies-in-evaluation-and-neet-scores/story-X5Bg4kOdNoqNDO1BwpK8EI.html

While another 30,927 vials of remdesivir have been provided to patients.The city has more than 20,000 active Covid-19 patients. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug used for the treatment of Ebola, is used in the early stages of the Covid-19 infection to bring down the viral load in patients. While tocilizumab, also known as atlizumab, an immunosuppressive drug is given to critically-ill patients. It was originally designed to treat arthritis, and is imported by Roche pharma and marketed by Mumbai-based Cipla.Since April, the demand for the two drugs has increased drastically which is also leading to black marketing. The civic body, however, ruled out any claim of shortages of the essential drugs.Since the outbreak of the pandemic, BMC has procured over 33,000 and around 2,500 doses of tocilizumab and remdesivir respectively. At present, the civic body has 140 and 2,800 dosage stock of tocilizumab and remdesivir respectively.“We have received promising responses from Covid-19 patients who are treated with remdesivir and tocilizumab. Taking this into consideration, we are in the process of procuring 72,000 vitals of remdesivir. These will be distributed in jumbo centres and hospitals,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.Additionally, the civic body BMC has also procured 3,01,478 tablets of flavipiravir, an antiviral drug which is given to moderately-ill patients to reduce the viral load of Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. Out of these, already 2,67,978 of the tables have been consumed. At present, the civic body has 33,500 tables in stock.After initial months of shortages of drugs, hospitals in the city have adequate amounts of the medicines. “At present, we don’t have any shortages of medicines in our hospital. We do have an adequate number of vials. Also, as the procurement process has got more channelised, the involvement of middlemen has come down,” said Dr Jalil Parkar, a pulmonologist at Lilavati Hospital, Bandra.Doctors in the city are relying heavily on these three promising drugs which are helping save the lives of thousands. As HT reported on August 27, a total of 77% of Covid-19 patients treated with tocilizumab and remdesivir in a major tertiary-care civic-run hospital have survived.Seek written consent to administer remdesivirThe Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) last month issued a circular making it mandatory to take written consent of patients or their relatives before giving remdesivir. This directive was given to involve patients or their relatives in administering expensive drugs like remdesivir and to curb the unregulated usage of it.“The instruction has been provided to doctors following the centralized directive of the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI),” said Dr TP Lahane, director of DMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-355-tocilizumab-injections-and-30-927-remdesivir-vials-used-in-mumbai-bmc-data/story-fpxHHDtA9B7JEXVrFONOxI.html
19-10-2020||City||Need to check unfair terms of tour and travel industry||This week I want to refer briefly to a recent order of the apex consumer court, to highlight the unjust terms and conditions imposed on consumers by the tour and travel industry and the urgent need for the consumer protection regulator constituted under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019, to step in and put stop to all such unfair and inequitable terms.The apex consumer court’s order centres around a claim for refund made by a consumer following cancellation of his trip on account of the Swiss Embassy’s refusal to grant him a tourist visa. Here, the consumer’s contention was that the travel agency collected Rs 60,000 from him on May 23, 2013 as the booking amount and subsequently, on August 21, the remaining amount of Rs 1,92,970, despite knowing that on august 19 his visa application had been rejected and that he would therefore not be able to travel. Worse, later when he sought a refund, he was told that as per their terms and conditions, he was not entitled to any refund.The travel agency in turn claimed that they had got to know of the rejection of the visa application only on August 26 and as per their cancellation policy, the consumer was not entitled to any refund for cancellation seven days prior to the date of departure.The apex consumer court said the agency cannot usurp the money paid by the consumer, particularly when he had not availed of their services in respect of the tour. However, while the lower consumer courts had ordered refund of the entire amount paid by the consumer, the apex consumer court allowed the tour agency to retain Rs 30,000 on account of the fee spent on the visa application and other administrative expenses and ordered refund of the remaining amount with 7% interest.(Makemytrip (India) Pvt Ltd Vs Vijendra Mathur, RP NO 1877 of 2018, date of order: August 27, 2020)Consumers have for long suffered injustice, financial loss and mental agony on account of unreasonable terms in consumer contracts and have had to wage protracted legal battles for justice. Consumers were particularly at a disadvantage on account of the absence of a law to curb such unfair terms.Now the new consumer protection law fills the gap in this area. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, defines unfair consumer contracts as those that cause significant change in the rights of consumers . One of the examples provided, says: “Imposing on the consumer, any unreasonable charge, obligation or condition which puts such consumer to disadvantage” is an unfair contract. So the consumer watchdog -- the Central Consumer Protection Authority(CCPA) -- has to now regulate consumer contracts in the hospitality, travel and tourism sectors and ensure fair play. I particularly refer to the tour and travel industry because of the large number of consumer complaints emanating from unreasonable contract terms and the fact that unlike sectors such as insurance, telecom or housing, there is no sector regulator here.Interestingly, the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom launched a concerted campaign last year against unfair and opaque contract terms vis-à-vis the holiday and travel industry.The two examples of such unfair terms that the Authority quoted is highly relevant in the Indian context too because here also, consumers suffer huge financial loss when circumstances beyond their control such as sickness or death in the family force them to cancel a tripTerms that allow a business to take large, upfront deposit , but refuse refund on cancellation of the trip, irrespective of the amount the business is losing or the reason for the cancellation, is unfair, said the Authority. Similarly, when a business insists on a large cancellation fee which bears no relation to the actual losses it experiences from the cancellation, such a condition is unfair, it said..The consumer protection regulator in India too needs to take up such campaigns to end unfair contracts.---||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-to-check-unfair-terms-of-tour-and-travel-industry/story-LzjBw4si0psR0ipA1Ht19O.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||Panel seeks permission to auction land of three realty projects in Gurugram||A committee comprising senior officials of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and department of town and country planning (DTCP) has recommended that the possibility of auctioning of the land of three projects, whose licences have been cancelled, should be explored and permission regarding this should be sought from the DTCP. The projects owned by three developers cumulatively owe external development charges of ₹150 crore. A letter in this regard has been sent to the headquarters in Chandigarh and further action would be taken after directions are received, said officials on Monday.The DTCP in the last two years had cancelled the licences of 21 developers who had failed to launch their projects and also did not pay EDC/IDC charges to the stage government. Following the cancellation of these licenses, the director, DTCP, had formed a committee headed by administrator, Gurugram, to take over these projects and find ways to ensure that third party rights of buyers, land owners and the dues owned to the government as fees were cleared, said HSVP officials.However, after the cancellation of the licenses, 14 developers out of 21 approached the court seeking relief against the government decision. HSVP officials said that it was brought to the notice of the committee by developers of three other projects that their licences were cancelled wrongly and they would be given fresh hearing. One of them has agreed to get the licence renewed and pay the dues, they added. The report of the committee said that third party rights of the three projects under its scanner have not been created and no stay has been granted by the court. In one of these cases, the owners could not be contacted and the land was lying vacant. “It has been decided by the committee that approval for auction of land may be obtained from DTCP and after conciliation of dues to be recovered by the government and of the allottees if any, the process of auction shall be initiated as per government policies,” said the committee in its recommendation on Friday.The total area of these projects is around 23 acres and two of these were to be developed as IT parks, said officials. RS Bhath, district town planner (DTP), planning, who will take the charge of enforcement wing on Tuesday, said that the committee looked into every aspect of the projects such as land ownership, third party rights and dues to government. “A recommendation has been made to explore the possibility of auctioning the land so that dues to all the stakeholders can be recovered,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/panel-seeks-permission-to-auction-land-of-three-realty-projects-in-gurugram/story-4kYNkrE7OeBMooRzDmA77H.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||Construction workers protest against changes in labour laws, grant of social benefits||Around 250 construction workers in the city gathered at Kamla Nehru Park on Monday and marched up to the Mini Secretariat building to highlight the problems being faced by them related to registration and the availability of benefits under the schemes launched by labour welfare board. The workers also said that only few of them received financial and material help from the state government during the lockdown. Dharm Saini, president, Bhawan Nirman Kamgaar Union, said that the decision of the government to change labour rules and the inability of the authorities to reach out to construction workers during the lockdown and thereafter have caused immense hardships for them. “The construction workers are yet to receive any monetary benefits due to them under the Kanyadan scheme, the death claim benefit scheme, the cycle scheme and the toolkit scheme. Authorities have rejected their claims raising several objections,” said Saini. The protesting workers also said that decision of the government to register workers only online was also causing lot of problems as majority of them have no formal education and find it difficult to complete the online process. “The government should allow offline registration of workers. The money with construction workers’ welfare board should be spent on the welfare of the workers,” said Rajender Saroha, district secretary of the union. Saroha also said that financial and material benefits announced for construction workers reached very few of them, and they wanted to bring this matter to the notice of the government by holding this protest.The Kamgaar union on Monday also submitted memorandums to the state and central governments through deputy commissioner of Gurugram. The protesters also said that if their issues were not solved then they would start a larger protest movement. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram,said that the issues raised by construction workers will be sent to the government for consideration. “The memorandum will be sent to state government for consideration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/construction-workers-protest-against-changes-in-labour-laws-grant-of-social-benefits/story-0QjbYcg9zXjKXxwxrFGI8J.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||Cops bust gang of four vehicle-lifters who stole over a dozen motorcycles||The police on Sunday night arrested four members of a gang for allegedly stealing over a dozen motorcycles from different areas of the city and planning to steal another one on the same night from Sector 45. The police said they have recovered eight stolen motorbikes, two scooters and one auto-rickshaw from their possession and have solved at least 15 cases with their arrest. The police said, during questioning, they revealed that they had also broken into locked houses and had stolen cash and jewellery from at least 11 houses in Sushant Lok-1, Palam Vihar, Sector 5, Sector 14, Sector 29, New Colony and Sector 56. The suspects were identified as Rakesh alias Tatal of Nuh, suspected kingpin of the gang; Jatin alias Tedha of Nai Basti; Aamir Khan of Nuh and Hakummuddin of Sohna. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that these gang members have been arrested seven times earlier. The mastermind, Rakesh, was arrested in March last year and was granted bail on October 1. “He contacted the other gang members who were out and started stealing two wheelers from different sectors of the city. The gang members have been allegedly involved in crime for the last four years. The suspects, during questioning, told the police that they used to visit the city from Nuh thrice a week to steal motorbikes,” he said. The police also said the accused and his friends from Mewat targeted the developing sectors in Gurugram as police presence is low there. In their quest to make a quick buck, they allegedly stole motorbikes which had good resale value. The suspects used to hide the two-wheelers in kingpin’s house in Nuh till he could sell them, the police said. He used to send pictures of the stolen two-wheelers to his friends in Uttar Pradesh who used to get good deals for him. On Sunday afternoon, the gang members visited Iffco Chowk to target parked two-wheelers, but got arrested. “The gang members were arrested after we received a tip-off that four men were roaming near parked motorbikes. We sent our teams, barricaded the area and arrested the gang members,” said Sangwan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-bust-gang-of-four-vehicle-lifters-who-stole-over-a-dozen-motorcycles/story-ogM4nIyGBUdlg3zDf2xK2L.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||Cops arrest two sharpshooters for murdering liquor shop owner||The police on Sunday night arrested two sharpshooters from Sector 95 bus stand for allegedly murdering a 42-year-old liquor shop owner and injuring his friend while they were returning to their house in Jatauli in Haily Mandi on the night of September 2. The police said the liquor trader was shot at least 16 times and died on the spot. His friend, on the other hand, suffered three bullet injuries and was discharged from a private hospital after a week. The police said that the suspects were hired by a business rival and he had paid them an advance of ₹1 lakh to carry out the assassination. The suspects were identified as Ujjwal Kumar of Bulandshahar in Uttar Pradesh and Jeewan Singh of Gautam Budh Nagar of Uttar Pradesh. The Haryana Police had announced a reward of ₹5,000 two years ago for information leading to Kumar’s arrest. According to the police, the incident took place around 10pm on the night of September 2, when the victims, identified as Inderjeet, Vikram and Vishal, who have a liquor business in Haily Mandi, were returning to their residences in a car. As their car entered a lane, a herd of cattle blocked their path and five men on three motorbike surrounded the vehicle and opened fire at them. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, prima facie, it appears a case of personal enmity, which led to the alleged murder. We had formed five teams including crime branch to nab the suspects. The police said Inderjeet, who was behind the wheel, was declared dead on arrival by doctors at a hospital in Pataudi. Vikram, 40, seated on the co-driver’s seat, sustained three bullet wounds on his arm and waist, while Vishal, who was on the back seat, survived the shooting unscathed, the police said. “The probe revealed that in July 2019, some of the accused men had fired gunshots at Inderjeet in Jatauli. An attempt of murder case was registered against a few people and two men were arrested. But the main suspect, Abhishek Kumar, of same village hired people from Uttar Pradesh and paid them money for contract killing,” said Sangwan. Sangwan said the complainant in the case had recorded the statement that in the last week of July, one of the accused men had threatened to kill Inderjeet and tried to extort money from him. “They were threatening him for life and told him they were in touch with criminals. They had also asked Inderjeet to shut down his business. One of the family members was elected in a municipal election too which led to personal enmity,” he said. A case was registered against the suspects under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object, 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and relevant sections of the Arms Act at the Pataudi police station, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-arrest-two-sharpshooters-for-murdering-liquor-shop-owner/story-IMamSWBhaGX2XZW4m4He9L.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||NHAI fined Rs5 lakh for lack of dust control measures||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Monday penalised the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) Rs 5 lakh for dust emission on the stretch connecting the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway with Dwarka Expressway, from Kherki Daula, and issued a show cause notice in this regard.The penalty has been imposed while in accordance with the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to tackle deteriorating air quality, said officials.Air pollution resulting from construction activities emitting heavy dust and particulate matter in air has been one of the main sources of pollution in Delhi-NCR, besides stubble burning and vehicular emission, during winter months.For the last one week, the air quality index (AQI) of Gurugram has been in the ‘poor’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin. Persisting high concentration of pollutants kept Gurugram’s AQI at 245, a slight improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 273. The concentration of ultra fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 251 micrograms per cubic metre, as per the monitor at Vikas Sadan.Neighbouring Delhi had an AQI of 244 on Monday.To tackle the situation of ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality in Delhi-NCR, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) has directed Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan to implement Grap guidelines.“In view of Grap, the pollution board team on Monday visited the Dwarka Expressway stretch of NH 48. During the inspection, it was found that appropriate dust control measures were missing from the site,” said Shakti Singh, regional officer, Gurugram (South), HSPCB, who is also the nodal officer for Grap implementation in the district.He said that complaints have been received regarding constantly visible dust emission on the road and surrounding areas due to construction activities, contributing heavily to the degradation of ambient air quality in the area.“The department has therefore issued the show cause notice and penalty of Rs 5 lakh to the NHAI along with the construction company. The agencies have been given a week to submit a compliance report on the construction activity. They have to tell why the activity should not be stopped under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Also, as to why action should not be taken against them under various provisions of environmental laws for non-compliance of Acts, notification and rules,” said Singh.Singh said the activity was in violation of the directions issued by CPCB, under Section 5 of Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, to regulate dust emission from construction and demolition (C&D) activities.Officials said that the penalty is in line with National Green Tribunal (NGT) rules, which state that a person, owner or builder found to be violating air pollution norms will be liable to pay a compensation of Rs 5,00,000 in relation to construction activity at its site and Rs 5,000 for violation during carriage and transportation of construction material, debris through trucks or other vehicles.Singh said that the CPCB on October 16 issued a letter directing the pollution board to ensure strict vigilance of unregulated construction activity. They have been told that constructed waste material has to be stored in a designated place with all precautionary measures. As per the directive, dumping of waste in open land is the responsibility of the land-owning agency.A senior NHAI official privy to the matter, said, “We have taken measures to curb pollution. But the suggestions put forth by the pollution control board will be implemented. The authority will not allow any pollution to be caused during the construction activity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nhai-fined-rs5-lakh-for-lack-of-dust-control-measures/story-SHpMStdxrwnjWUYGgUaMTL.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||Implementing Grap in Udyog Vihar main priority, say officials||Road dust, dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste and insufficient remedial measures have turned Udyog Vihar into a pollution hot spot, where the implementation the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) is a top priority, according to officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).Officials said that the area was visited by a task force of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in the last week of September. The area was also visited by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) chairman in 2019 and deficiencies were identified, with the same to be addressed as per an order issued by deputy commissioner Amit Khatri on October 14 to prevent severe air pollution in Gurugram.However, despite the problems being identified, incomplete road widening projects, heavy traffic and open dumping of waste in the factory-heavy area continue to worsen air quality. The issue is exacerbated during winter.“The criteria for Udyog Vihar being the hot spot are dumping of solid waste and road dust. Epca chairman Bhure Lal during his field visit in 2019 identified the deficiencies in Udyog Vihar area. Recently, in the last week of September, a CPCB-led task force visited Udyog Vihar,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB.When asked about the concentration of particulate matter in the area, Singh did not comment. The area lacks a proper air pollution monitoring system.According to the reports on the action plan to control pollution, accessed by HT, three road widening projects which were planned to reduce dust emission are still incomplete.Work on the stretches from National Highway 48 (NH 48) to Old Delhi-Udyog Vihar and NH 48 toll gate to Kapashera border in Udyog Vihar could not start due to shifting of utilities, such as 11KV electric lines and 66 KV Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVNL) towers, the report stated.A road-widening project from Shankar Chowk on NH 48 to Old Delhi Road in Daruhera, which is currently underway, is likely to be completed by this year, according to the report.The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), which is the agency responsible for the road projects, cited a shortage of skilled labour due to Covid-19 pandemic as the reason for delay.Besides, the industries department has also invited tenders for projects amounting to Rs 7.69 crores, to repair and upgrade internal roads. The work is yet to be taken up. Pawan Kumar, a property dealer in Udyog Vihar, said that due to construction of Old Gurugram-Delhi Road, there is heavy dust in the area during the peak hours. He said, “There has been enough movement in the area with the unlock, which has led to road dust along with the vehicular pollution. It should be sprinkled with water every few hours, but we haven’t seen any such activity happening.”Open dumping of C&D waste, adding to the concentration of fine particulate matter, compounds the issues in Udyog Vihar further.Officials of the municipal corporation said they are taking action to keep a check on polluting activities.Jitender Garg, additional commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), who is in charge of implementing Grap guidelines in Udyog Vihar, said that garbage-vulnerable points (GVP), where dumping of construction waste is highest, have been identified.On Friday, three people were penalised Rs 5,000 each by the MCG for dumping waste. “Being a hot spot area, we have put a strategy in place, whereby two teams comprising of three members each will do night patrolling as most of the waste is dumped after midnight. A sprinkler machine has already been stationed specifically for the area, along with the road sweeping machine to prevent the dust emission from the GVPs and roads,” said Garg.According to him, actions are being taken in compliance with the October 14 order, which listed solid waste dumping in industrial areas as a problem to be taken up on a priority basis.An employee of a private company in Udyog Vihar, who preferred anonymity, said, “In Udyog Vihar Phase-1, one can easily see C&D waste being dumped on the roadside. But this time, there has been an improvement compared to last year, when there were unpaved roads and excessive dumping of solid waste.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/implementing-grap-in-udyog-vihar-main-priority-say-officials/story-MKsYWmnVa1SmxeFBMWWgeP.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||Second round of statewide sero-survey begins; 630 samples collected||The second round of the statewide Covid-19 serological survey started in the district on Monday. At least 630 blood samples were collected from 12 rural and four urban areas. Through the collection of blood samples, presence of antibodies developed against the Covid-19 infection will be checked to gauge the prevalence of the infection within the community. This because many people might get infected but can still remain asymptomatic. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “On Tuesday, 90 samples will be collected from the identified clusters. The overall sample size of the district is 750. The purpose of the survey is to know how many people in the district have already suffered from the Covid-19 infection. It has been observed that many people get the infection but do not display the signs and symptoms of the illness.” Antibodies develop in the body two weeks after the onset of infection and can last for several months. It is for this reason antibody test is not preferred for detecting acute infection. In the first survey conducted across the state in August, 18,905 samples were collected, which showed sero-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 at 8%. At that time, it was found that urban population was affected more than the rural population. In urban areas, the sero-positivity was 9.6%, while in rural areas it was 6.9%. Districts like Gurugram, falling in the NCR region showed higher prevalence. Gurugram had 10.8% sero-positivity and Faridabad reported the highest positivity of 25.8%. Yadav said that the second round is now being conducted on COVID-19 Sero Survey Mobile App. According to him, this helps in online data entry, geo-tagging, offline data entry, and self-generated SMS. Gurugram Covid-19 numbersOn Monday, the district reported 249 new cases, taking the total count of Covid-19 infections to 25,389. Of these 2,398 are active cases, while 22,801 have recovered from the illness. The Covid-19 toll stands at 190. More than 92% of the active cases are currently under home isolation, 11 in district Covid care centre and 174 are hospitalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/second-round-of-statewide-sero-survey-begins-630-samples-collected/story-2VtNVVWtJ6RZwjmbqoVXGI.html
19-10-2020||Gurugram||Attendance picks up, but space concerns persist in Gurugram schools||Some of the larger government schools in the city on Monday reported an uptick in the number of students, four days after schools were allowed to reopen for classes 9 to 12. However, smaller schools are still curtailed by their capacity to make arrangements for students, keeping in mind social distancing norms. Principals and teachers said that parents of nearly 70% of the class 12 students have permitted their wards to attend classes. In some instances, parents are also visiting the school to review the seating arrangements. On Monday, the largest six of the 52 government schools in the city reported a footfall of over 200 students. There are 125 schools in the entire district.“It is easy to manage a class of 10-15 students in one classroom, but if the number increases, then it would be challenging to adjust students,” said Raj Kumar, principal, Government Senior Secondary School in Islampur. In Kumar’s school, at least 325 students are enrolled in classes 9 to 12. The school currently lacks basic infrastructure like proper rooms and benches.“In class 12, 64 students are registered. Of them, only 15 are visiting the school as parents are hesitant to send them. Fixed number of students are called, based upon their roll number count. Once the footfall increases as we receive proper guidelines from the government, we might have to think of seating arrangements ensuring physical distancing among students. We may have to put carpet in the classroom and get students seated on the floor,” said Kumar.Geeta Arya, principal of a senior secondary school near old Civil Hospital, Jharsa Road, shared similar views. “We have big classrooms, where students are being made to sit on every alternate bench to maintain distance. The footfall will gradually increase this week as many parents whose kids will appear for board exams this year are ready to send their kids to schools. They are coming along with children to see seating arrangements,” said Arya. There are almost 243 students in class 12 at Arya’s school. According to her, more than 70 students of class 12 are visiting the school. Kavita Sapra, who teaches English at the Sector 4/7 Model Government Senior Secondary School, said, “Students are being called in slots and are seated accordingly, to avoid crowding. Every day, almost 70 students of class 12 are coming to school. On Monday, 43 from class 9, 41 from class 10 and 27 from class 11 attended their respective classes. Currently, every batch is being divided into two to three classes, where teachers take one class after the other.”Both Kumar and Arya clarified that it would be difficult to have the entire class 12 batch in one go, even if the classrooms are available. Suman Sharma, the principal of Sector 4/7 school, said that schools might not have enough teachers to take lectures. “Even if morning and evening shifts are created, and class 12 batch is divided into two, it won’t be possible to cater to the entire batch,” said Sharma. In her school, there are 385 students in class 12 — enrolled in two sections of science, three of commerce and two of arts. “Considering we call 192 students in the morning shift and the remaining half in the evening shift, then also it is impossible to hold classes. Even if we make 30 students sit in one classroom, then for 192 students we need six classrooms and six teachers who will reshuffle. It will require more teachers,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/attendance-picks-up-but-space-concerns-persist-in-gurugram-schools/story-0uenlJaYnF9wA21bxRBL3L.html

19-10-2020||Chandigarh||CLU row: Councillor, Ludhiana mayor attempt to woo shopkeepers||Amid the row over change of land use notices being served by the municipal corporation to shopkeepers in the city, a battle of one upmanship was witnessed between Gurpreet Gogi, Congress councillor from ward number 76, and mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, to gain political mileage. While the mayor asked shopkeepers to reap benefits of the change of land use scheme being offered by the civic body, Gogi met municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal with a delegation of shopkeepers and demanded that officials stop the sealing drive at Ghumar Mandi. Gogi said that his ward was being targeted deliberately due to political agenda. He said that few days ago, shopkeepers at Ghumar Mandi received notices in which the civic body had asked them to submit CLU charges within three days, failing which their establishments will be sealed. This led to a protest which further intensified when the MC sealed a few shops. “There is a hidden agenda to target my area and dent my reputation. Ward number 76 has been chosen deliberately to harass me and the shopkeepers. But, we will continue fighting against this draconian step of the mayor,” said Gogi. While condemning the move of sealing of shops in Ghumar Mandi, he said that two notifications were issued by local bodies department in 1995 and 2006 respectively, pertaining to CLU charges being levied on shopkeepers with establishments in eight scheduled road of the city. The charges were nominal but there was no follow-up recover the amount. “All these years, the civic body was sleeping. Today, they are forcing shopkeepers to submit the fees of change of land use. One can understand that this is a desperate attempt by the civil body to fill its coffer, but harassing shopkeepers is not justified,” said Gogi. On the other hand, mayor Sandhu said that shopkeepers had protested initially as they did not understand the scheme. “But now, when the shopkeepers came to know about its benefits, many have submitted cheques for regularisation or change of land use for their shops,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/clu-row-councillor-ludhiana-mayor-attempt-to-woo-shopkeepers/story-4yj3OwzR4dyr499uH5VxOL.html

19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Covid shadow: No Navratri rush at Ludhiana temples||Despite all safety measures put in place by managements of temples to curb the spread of Covid-19, few devotees are turning up to offer prayers during the ongoing Navratri festival. Earlier, during the nine-day celebrations, devotees used to throng temples to pray on each day. Majority of them visited in the evening when “aarti” is performed. This year, all visitors can be seen strictly adhering to safety norms by wearing masks and following social distancing norms. The temple managements have made it mandatory for all visitors to wear masks and they are not allowed to sit in the premises for long hours. Employees have been deployed at the entrances of temples to check temperature of those entering the premises. Visitors are asked to sanitise their hands by using foot-operated hand dispensers. In the previous years, Durga Mata Mandir, near Jagraon Bridge, used to receive a footfall of more than 2,000 devotees every day during Navratri. But this time, only 250 to 300 devotees are turning up daily. During a visit to the temple, it was seen that more people visit early in the morning to avoid overcrowding; few offer prayers in the evening while adhering to social distancing norms. The situation is no different in other temples of the city. Shri Krishna Mandir, Shastri Nagar, witnesses a footfall of around 100 devotees daily compared to 500 in previous years. No rush was witnessed at the temple at 5pm. Shri Nav Durga Mandir, Sarabha Nagar, used to receive a footfall of 500 people daily during Navratri in the previous years, but this time, only 50 to 80 visitors are seen at the temple. Chander Shekhar Shastri, the priest said, “We have decorated the temple and made all necessary safety arrangements so that social distancing can be maintained. But, due to the pandemic, people prefer praying at home rather than visiting the temple.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-shadow-temples-receives-low-footfall-during-navratri/story-SBm8IGAPFUOznEgPzniqeK.html

19-10-2020||City||Cops need to be more sensitive in rape cases: Experts||Expressing deep anguish over the increasing number of cases of violence against women, the experts while addressing a webinar organised by the Social Thinkers Forum Ludhiana strongly opined that there is an urgent need to change the feudal psychology and patriarchal value system in the society so as to give appropriate respect to women. They said that the role of the state government is very important in such situations for speedy justice to the victim. Therefore, the police have to act professionally without any duress from the political masters, they added.Mitter Sen Meet, the former district attorney said that there are several laws pertaining to violence against women. “But their implementation is very faulty. As a result, the accused go scot-free and the conviction rate is very less. The investigation done by the police is centered on the victim including her medical examination and questioning. Ironically, no medical examination is done of the accused which is very important to ascertain the truth in case of sexual violence,” he said.Dr Param Saini while speaking on the psychological impact of such crimes said, “Our police are highly insensitive in such cases.” She found that their training to question the victim is totally faulty and biased in most of the cases. “They move with the presumption that the woman is not speaking truth particularly if she is from a socially, culturally, and economically backward community. This hurts the victim hard and she is further pushed into extreme mental trauma which sometimes forces her to commit suicide,” she said.Gurcharan Kaur Kocher, president of Punjab Istri Sabha Ludhana expressed deep concern at the rising violence against women and wished for a societal upsurge against such elements. Deepak Kumar, general secretary of All India Students Federation Ludhiana (AISF) said that they are trying to organise students on such issues with positive inclination. Arun Mitra convener of the forum said that they will try to take this issue to the ground level. Co-convenor MS Bhatia said that it is not a women’s issue but an issue of the whole society and all have to work in unison to address it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cops-need-to-be-more-sensitive-in-rape-cases-experts/story-duS8IsRC5vABgk2ENpHL3H.html

In such a situation, the government of Delhi is formulating a comprehensive cultural policy to ensure meaningful contribution of art and culture towards transforming the mindset of the society,” he said.The Delhi government wants to create a cultural atmosphere in the city. Just like people go to cinemas and restaurants, now they will have many options to choose from in terms of cultural events as plenty of them will organised in the city, he said.Participating in the meeting, actor and member of the committee Manoj Vajpayee said children from the slums should be introduced to theatre education to help them join the mainstream.Citing the example of French capital of Paris where street artists performing in public spaces is a common sight, he suggested that the Delhi government provide spaces where artists can showcase their talent so that the city can be projected as a cultural capital.Sisodia said the cultural policy is being formulated by a 15-member advisory committee and it will submit its report within two months. In addition to Bajpayee, the advisory committee consists of personalities and experts from the field of art and culture including actor Javed Jaffrey, JNU’s School of Arts and Aesthetics Professor Ira Bhaskar among others.

19-10-2020||Mumbai||SSR death case: ‘Why no action against media trial?’ HC asks I&B ministry||The Bombay High Court has asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) to inform it as to why it has not initiated any action concerning complaints related to media trial in Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case. This comes as the News Broadcaster Association (NBA) implored the Bombay High Court to not give in to the requests of the petitioners who sought directions for the formation of a statutory authority to regulate the electronic media. The NBA said it would lead to an end to the independence of the media. It submitted that the self-regulatory mechanism which is in place has been very effective in redressing complaints against channels and all members have strictly adhered to its regulations except for Republic TV. The NBA informed the court that Republic TV did not want to abide by the NBA regulations and hence left the association and went on to form its own self-regulating authority. The submissions were made in the public interest litigations filed against the media trial by news channels in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by individuals, NGOs and a group of former top police officials seeking a restraint on media trials, was informed by senior counsel Arvind Datar representing the NBA and News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) that the self-regulatory mechanism for channels was working diligently. Also read: Global pandemic made us realise importance of teamwork, says PM ModiThe two authorities were responding to allegations by the petitioners that the electronic media was conducting media trials wherein they resorted to police bashing, disclosing vital details of ongoing investigations and trying to influence the opinion of viewers. The petitioners had stated that the independent self-regulating authorities, in the form of the NBA and the NBSA, were not taking sufficient steps to curb channels from conducting media trials. Datar, however, refuted the allegations and submitted that they had, time and again, taken disciplinary and sometimes stringent action against errant channels by banning its airing for three days to three months. He submitted that though the two authorities did not have any statutory powers, it was adjudicating complaints based on the programme code as directed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB). He added that all member channels adhered to the self-regulatory norms and decisions passed by the authorities. Datar further submitted that it was only recently that an English and a regional language channel had refused to abide by a decision of the NBA and had left it to form another self-regulating authority. Datar concluded by coaxing the court not to grant the requests of the petitioners to have a statutory body to regulate the electronic media as it would become difficult for the media to function independently. He also cited Supreme Court judgements wherein the apex court had refused to interfere or direct the legislative to form a statutory mechanism to regulate the electronic media. In light of this, Datar requested the court to not exercise its discretionary authority. After hearing the submissions of the NBA and the NBSA, the bench sought to know from the MIB whether the two independent authorities were formed without any statutory powers so that channels could afford an escape route by invoking article 19(2) of the Constitution and approaching the courts when they were pulled up for irresponsible and objectionable reporting.

The chief minister talked about it while reviewing the working of the growth centres in the state which are involved in producing various products including agricultural and others. “The products being produced by the growth centres involving locals would soon have an umbrella brand under which other brands would continue to operate,” said Rawat. He said, “The brand would be developed with the help of experts. It would be such that one will get a feeling of Uttarakhand and the Himalayas. This would help the products to be sold in a much better way.”During the meeting, he also directed the district magistrates to visit the growth centres operating in their districts to address their issues. “The DMs should visit themselves to solve the issues faced by the growth centres to facilitate their smooth functioning,” said Rawat. Also read: ‘No political vendetta, Farooq questioned as per law’ - J-K BJP chiefHe also directed the authorities to make arrangements for online marketing of the products. “The products of these growth centres should also be marketed online for increasing their outreach. Also, arrangements should be made for their sale throughout the year over their seasonal sale,” he said.“A mini-truck could also be provided to several growth centres operating in the same areas for easy transport of products to markets with a focus on local ones.”The CM also emphasised the need to provide skill development to the locals working in the growth centres. “It is necessary to develop their skills which would further help in improving the quality of the products they are producing. This move would also be effective to push the cause of ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Vocal for Local’,” he said adding, “the growth centres should work by fixing a target for sales and profits.”Later, during the meeting, Manisha Panwar, additional chief secretary, MSME, informed that at present a total of 104 growth centres are approved by the government out of which 72 are active. “The remaining ones will soon be operational. Among the growth centres, 38 are agri-based, four related to bakery, five dairy-based, 11 tied to fisheries, 10 to organic wool, five to prasad making, four related to spices, among others,” said Panwar. On the profit earned by the growth centres, she said, “Till September, the total sales of these growth centres amounted to Rs 6.09 crore and the profit was Rs 60 lakhs.”The concept of growth centres was suggested by the state commission for migration and rural development to curb the migration from the hilly areas of the state. Under the initiative, the commission had suggested the government to open centres in blocks where people of the area are mainly involved in one occupation like poultry, agriculture or dairy. For an area where people are involved in poultry, the government opened a poultry-based growth centre and similarly for other areas. A few days ago, CM Rawat during a meeting with the state’s entrepreneurs also urged them to use locally available resources for production to promote the initiative of ‘Aatmnirbhar Bharat’ or self-dependent India. Rawat had said that the state-based entrepreneurs should make the locally available resources as the basis for their products which in turn will help in making the country self-dependent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-products-to-have-an-umbrella-brand-to-connect-as-himalayan/story-fhVVQptGhDEra0khvzgf4N.html

Bapat said, “It is expected that, till date, a total of 700km of water pipeline needs to be completed, but on the ground only 300km has been laid. Elected members from various parties are not allowing contractors to carry out the work and are creating hurdles for the same.” Bapat added, “Under this project, the PMC is going to erect 82 water tanks and lay 1,670km of new pipeline. The main aim of the project is to provide round-the-clock water supply to the city. It is wrong, if PMC elected members are threatening contractors. If such complaints are made henceforth, I, personally will look into it and take action against such elected members.”On Monday, Bapat along with mayor Murlidhar Mohol, and PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, met municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar to review various development works in the city.Cong holds party meet after many years The Congress reverted to an age-old strategy on Sunday, holding a meeting of its elected members and party leaders, to decide on a common platform for all major issues in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

19-10-2020||City||Punjab assembly special session: Fiery start as oppn slams govt for not tabling Bill against farm laws||Chandigarh The two-day special session of the Punjab assembly got off to a fiery start on Monday even as the state government maintained a veil of secrecy over the Bill to be introduced to counter the Centre’s agriculture marketing laws. The members of the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) protested, both inside and outside the state assembly, to press for the Bill against the farm laws for which the special session has been convened. The AAP, the principal opposition party in the Punjab assembly, sought copies of the Bill drafted by the Congress government to negate the effect of the new farm laws on the state, whereas the SAD legislators demanded that it should be tabled and discussed on the first day of the special session. Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said they should be provided copies of the Bill. “Will we get copies of the Bill after the session is over,” he asked. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal told members that the government is already in consultation with legal and constitutional experts on the issue and copies of various Bills to be tabled during the session will be given to the opposition parties by the evening. SAD legislator Gurpartap Singh Wadala said the special session has been summoned to counter the farm laws but it seems they (state government) have no clarity. “The main Bill should have been tabled and discussed first in the House. This should have been the first business. The entire Punjab is watching what the government is doing,” he said. The opposition members were not satisfied with the response, and continued their protests for several hours, raising slogans against the state government. While the AAP MLAs squatted in the well of House for five hours for copies of the Bills, Akali legislators led by Bikram Singh Majithia protested outside the gates of Punjab Bhawan, a government guest house here, where they had gone to brief the media, but were denied entry. “Is this Congress Bhawan,” asked Majithia before four of his colleagues scaled the gates and entered the complex. The legislative business, including the one to counter the Centre’s new laws, will be taken up on Tuesday even as several cabinet ministers and MLAs of the Congress denied having any knowledge about the contents of the Bill to be introduced by the government in the House. The day’s proceedings began with obituary references and the House was adjourned for an hour by speaker Rana KP Singh thereafter. The House reassembled for nearly 15 minutes before being adjourned till Tuesday. Earlier, the AAP members, who came wearing black capes, tore and burnt copies of the new farm laws. “This was done to show our anger and register our protest against these laws,” AAP MLA Aman Arora said. Several Akali legislators rode tractors in protest against the farm laws, but they were stopped by police. Homage to farmers The Punjab assembly on Monday paid homage to all farmers who have lost their lives during the ongoing protests against the three agriculture marketing laws enacted by the Centre recently, freedom fighters and other eminent personalities. As soon as the day’s proceedings began, speaker Rana KP Singh listed names of lance naik Karnail Singh and freedom fighters Mahinder Singh, Sardar Singh, Rai Singh Patanga, Mahinder Singh and Hemraj Mittal in the obituary references. On the request of finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, the speaker also consented to include the name of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu. The House also paid tributes to former Punjabi University vice-chancellor Joginder Singh Puar, Punjabi writer Kuldeep Singh Dhir and noted musician Kesar Singh Narula. A two-minute silence was observed in the memory of departed souls as a mark of respect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-assembly-special-session-fiery-start-as-oppn-slams-govt-for-not-tabling-bill-against-farm-laws/story-Pz5wTkZ44VIA6NPXVYo2AO.html

He added that ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ will be an awareness campaign and no enforcement will take place, adding that the environment marshals will give red roses to the violators at the traffic signal to create awareness.

At a press conference on Monday afternoon, Rai briefed the media on the impending dangers of pollution to the environment and the measures being taken to combat the same.  “Very recently, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri Arvind Kejriwal launched a multifold campaign against pollution in the city, titled “Yudh Pradushan ke Virudh”. The first phase under this umbrella campaign was targeted at reducing dust pollution. The Delhi Government has taken stringent measures against those who were found violating rules,” Rai said.“On behalf of the Environment department, DPCC, DDA, irrigation and flood department, PWD, MCD, I appeal to all ongoing construction works, public or private that Delhi is yours as much as it is ours. We should all take responsibility. We are not in favour of taking harsh steps however, in order to save lives during this pandemic, we are bound to take stringent measures,” he added.Rai said that the decomposer produced by Pusa Research Institute which can turn straw and stubble into manure for further use, has been produced at a large scale and is being sprayed in various parts of the city to cease pollution caused by stubble burning and at the same time providing an effective alternative to the same.He said, “As part of the next phase, ‘Red light on; Gaadi off’ campaign was launched by the Hon’ble Chief Minister to curb pollution caused by fuel burning. On Friday, a detailed and strategic meeting was called to discuss the planning of the same. The meeting saw the participation of all the concerned departments including officers from Environment, DPCC, Transport, Traffic Police, and Revenue. Orders were issued to them to submit a detailed action plan today. After detailed discussions and deliberations, it has been decided that this campaign will be launched on the ground on October 21, 2020, and will go on till November 15, 2020.” Rai said that this campaign is targeted at initiating a behavioural change, adding that it is an awareness campaign and not enforcement. “It is the campaign of the 2 crore people in Delhi. People, who are concerned about the catastrophic consequences pollution can have amidst the ongoing pandemic. This campaign is about taking ownership,” he further said.He said, “This campaign will be effective from morning 8 am till evening 8 pm. For this, Transport and Traffic police have identified and submitted a list of a select group of 100 major traffic points, from 11 districts. This campaign has been decided to run by way of these Marshals.”The minister said that around 2,500 environmental marshals have been deployed In these crossroads and t“They will be working in 2 shifts, and 10 Marshals will be positioned at each traffic point. The first shift will be from 8 am to 2 pm. And the other will be from 2pm to 8pm.  Apart from this, places like ITO, which are slightly bigger in size will see civil defence officers in double quantity. 10 such places have been identified. Around 2000 Marshalls for 100 crossroads. Extra 200 for the 10 slightly greater in size. 300 marshals have been kept as reserve in case of need,” he said.Rai said that these Marshals have undergone extensive training and this training was executed under the guidance and surveillance of the district magistrates, officers from traffic police and vehicle department.  Their activities will be monitored by SDM, ACP of traffic police and in case of need, DC of the Transport Department will also be deployed there.  All 2500 Marshall’s will wear T-shirts, cap placards and will have stands to create maximum awareness. Following Gandhian principles, In the initial 3 days, these marshals will give a rose flower to those not turning off their car at the red light. And will appeal to them to participate in this quest to bring about a change. Your 2 mins are vital to save the lives of many,” he said.He said, “This campaign is touted to be a mass movement. Therefore, a letter will be written to all counsellors, MLAs, MPs and officers to participate and create awareness in their regions.  All political parties in Delhi will be requested by way of a formal letter to participate in this campaign. In addition, all RWA, market associations, eco-club, FICCI, ASSOCHAM, NGOs, officer association and trade unions will receive letters from the AAP government to be a part of this campaign.” The minister said that this campaign calls for a collaborative effort for the betterment of the citizens of Delhi. “As mentioned earlier, 15-20% vehicle pollution can be reduced by way of mass participation.  We will also request teachers to educate students in ongoing online classes about this. Children played an important role when we launched the odd even campaign. They would remind adults to follow the rules. Advertisements, FM will be a part of this execution. We believe this campaign will be a role model for this nation. Without causing any major hindrance, only by behavioural change, we can bring down the share of vehicle pollution in PM2.5,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/awareness-campaign-no-penalty-all-you-need-to-know-about-delhi-government-s-red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign/story-qRoIgNnxIihhbDs7WbjWDJ.html

What is the point if I can’t stay back a little after coming all way from my place, which is some 8km away?” Partha Ghosh, an office-bearer of Shivmandir Durga Puja in south Kolkata, said volunteers at the exit and the entry points are ensuring that people do not take off masks or push and shove one another.Thousands of people also thronged the city’s shopping hubs for last-minute purchases.Rita Debnath, when asked why she wasn’t covering her nose, hit back saying she was finding it difficult to breathe with the mask on.“Why just me, there are so many others who are not following protocols. This is the only time of the year I shop for my children and grandchildren...I can’t break that tradition, the woman, in her mid-60s, said outside a shop in Gariahat.The Covid-19 death toll in West Bengal went past the 6,000-mark on Sunday with 64 more fatalities, even as a record number of 3,983 fresh cases pushed the tally to 3,21,036.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/covid-19-thousands-flout-social-distancing-norms-to-throng-durga-puja-pandals-in-kolkata/story-92cfaOXpgX7rj44oGdbMpO.html
19-10-2020||City||SC asks Maharashtra SDMA to decide on Nanded gurdwara Dussehra procession||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) to decide on the representation by Nanded gurdwara management board seeking to hold Dussehra procession amid Covid-19 pandemic.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao, which assembled during the Dussehra vacation of the apex court to hear the matter, said the decision will have to be taken on the basis of ground situation.The bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi, asked the gurudwara management to file its representation with the SDMA by Tuesday.The gurudwara management board can move the Bombay High Court if it is not satisfied with the decision of the SDMA, it said.The top court was hearing a plea by ‘Nanded Sikh Gurdwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib Board’ seeking permission to carry out the customary procession on account of the 300-year old event — ‘Dussehra, Takht Isnan, Deepmala and Gurta Gaddi’ — with certain conditions. During the hearing on Monday, the advocate appearing for the petitioner said that the Centre has issued guidelines on the issue and the state too has not raised objection to limited gatherings.Referring to the guidelines, he said for marriage, 50 people are allowed and the gurdwara management board is not asking for “public participation” and there will be only as many people and on a limited route.“Your contention that the state government is not opposing the procession is wrong,” the bench said, adding that 40-50 people in the procession is okay but who will control the crowds if the gathering becomes bigger on the road.The petitioner’s counsel said the management has reduced the procession route to 1.5 km and its timing can be fixed in the evening to ensure a small congregation; moreover, the proceedings would be telecast.“State is saying there is a health risk,” the bench said. Senior advocate Devdutt Kamat, who appeared for Maharashtra along with state’s standing counsel Sachin Patil, referred to the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the state as well as in Nanded area and said that authorities have not allowed any kind of religious gatherings amid the pandemic.The state government said if this procession will be allowed, then the authorities may have to permit other religious gatherings.“State is genuinely concerned regarding health. Public health is a state subject. Despite whatever the Centre says that functions can go on, public health is something which state has to consider,” Kamat said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, referred to the recent guideline of the ministry of home affairs and said it allows gatherings of up to 100 people subject to conditions. “The petitioner could consider doing the procession early in the Morning so only those who are participating in the religious function will join. Otherwise other people will be on the road,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-asks-maharashtra-sdma-to-decide-on-nanded-gurdwara-dussehra-procession/story-Jq6kQCaNFrhPKPmL5vrokL.html

We have shared their details with other district superintendents and neighbouring states. We are making continuous efforts to nab them at the earliest,” the SP said.A senior police official said a manhunt is on to look for the inmates and they are likely to be declared proclaimed offenders, if not apprehended in the coming days.While nine of the 17 inmates face murder charges, three are booked for attempt to murder, two were booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and two others face theft and a rioting case.An official, who is part of the three-member probe team led by Hisar additional deputy commissioner Aneesh Yadav, said the ADC had submitted the report to Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni two days ago.“We found lapses in security in the observation home. The security guidelines were not followed and both the entry gates were not locked when the inmates fled the home. The security was not tightened and the guards deployed outside the observation home were less than the required number. The CCTV footage clearly shows that the inmates had hatched a plan to flee in advance and the authorities failed to notice their activities. Any action against authorities of the observation home will be taken by the jail department. However, we can say that they failed on all fronts,” said the official, on condition of anonymity.Earlier, the Haryana state commission for protection of child rights chairperson Jyoti Bainda had also pointed to ‘grave lapses’ on part of the staff and management the observation home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/week-on-remaining-12-inmates-who-fled-hisar-observation-home-remain-untraceable/story-b1wPXEzQTxNYwh2uoPxEjM.html

There is no space in the mandis and farmers are being forced to unload their produce on roads,” he said, while interacting with mediapersons at Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra.Chautala also accused the state government of using force on farmers at Pipli and misusing power to register FIRs against them. He said the Union government has enacted these laws to benefit some big corporate houses. “The INLD will revert all wrong decisions of this anti-people government if voted to power,” he added.Chautala also visited Yamunanagar where he met party workers and relatives. He said the INLD candidate is in a good position for the Baroda bypoll and there is a possibility that the result will be against the ruling dispensation.Later, the INLD leader also met BJP MLA Ghanshyam Das Arora at his residence to offer condolences on the demise of his brother last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baroda-bypoll-results-will-pave-way-for-mid-term-elections-in-haryana-op-chautala/story-lSg1nRhyveXwrXbgNsSyHJ.html

19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Atal Tunnel brings tourist influx to HP’s Lahaul, locals brace to preserve culture, ecology||The influx of tourists to tribal Lahaul and Spiti district since the inauguration of Atal Tunnel across Rohtang Pass on October 3 has prompted calls for tighter controls to preserve the cultural heritage and fragile ecology of one of Himachal Pradesh’s remotest regions. With limited infrastructure, it is becoming a challenge to check littering by tourists along the road stretch between Manali and Keylong. Since there are no dustbins on the route, the garbage on the roadside slides down the hills with rain, polluting the rivers. As a first step, the Sissu panchayat near the north portal of the tunnel has imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 for littering. It has put up boards warning visitors against littering the area. With no public toilets in the remote valley, tourists defecate in the open. The extent of the problem can be gauged from the fact that more than 8,000 vehicles cross the tunnel daily since Prime Minister Narendra Modi threw it open to the public on October 3. ‘FOLLOW BHUTAN MODEL OF TOURISM’ “While the tunnel has opened doors to visitors, there is no planned tourist activity in the region. As a result, it is commonplace to find trash along roads and the pollution level has gone up, threatening the fragile ecology,” says Chander Mohan Parsheera, 54, a social activist who heads of the Institute of Vocational (Tourism) Studies at Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla. “There is a need to adopt the Bhutan model of tourism in the Lahaul valley,” he says. Bhutan adheres to a policy of high value, low impact and volume tourism. Its government has set a limit of 3.5 lakh tourists to the Himalayan kingdom a year each of who are charged $250 (Rs 18,328) daily. This money is used to develop tourism in the country. “Our fears have come true. We had been concerned about the impact on lifestyle of tribals due to the opening of the tunnel, hydel projects and tourism,” says Parsheera, who also heads the Lahaul-Spiti Janjatiya Kalyan Samiti. He says there is a need to regulate tourism and focus on waste management, including setting up more toilets, to check environmental degradation. ‘DON’T WANT TO GO KULLU-MANALI WAY’ Lahaul and Spiti district is home to many a Buddhist monastery, including the ancient Tabo monastery built in 996 BC at an altitude of 13,500 feet. Of the estimated 32,000 residents of the tribal district, 85% are Buddhist. Kungri Gompa and Dhankar Gompa at Kibber at 14,200 feet are popular monasteries, too, while Pin valley follows the Nyingma sect of Buddhism. “The tourist boom is a threat to the culture of Lahaul and Spiti. Kullu and Manali are examples of how the influx of visitors changed the local culture. The tourists brought drug culture to these valleys and today they are infamous for narcotic trade,” says Shimla-based historian OC Handa. YOUNGSTERS TAKE INITIATIVE TO PRESERVE CULTURE Before the tunnel’s opening, Lahaul valley was closed for tourism during winter when most cultural festivities took place. “Since there was no interference, most weddings were solemnised in winter months,” says Sonam Zangpo, 36, who heads the Young Drupka Association. Zangpo fears that with tourists getting access to the valley all-round the year, their presence could influence youngsters in Lahaul who would end up aping them. The association, comprising 700 members, has been conducting awareness meetings and social media initiatives in the tribal region, urging locals to preserve and take pride in their culture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/atal-tunnel-brings-tourist-influx-to-hp-s-lahaul-locals-brace-to-preserve-culture-ecology/story-ds3baIM9n2ATufgtHlGlUL.html

Of the arrested accused, 10 belong to Uttar Pradesh and were living in rented accommodations in Karnal and nearby districts.Harjinder Singh, head of detective staff of Karnal police, said acting on a tip off, three accused identified as Mohammad Hanif, Khalil Khan and Pappan, all residents of UP, were arrested from Ghogripur village of Karnal earlier this month for allegedly stealing copper and other material from transformers.During the interrogation, they disclosed the names of members of other gangs including Mahender Singh of Delhi and Surender Singh of Gaziabad, who were then arrested from Delhi. He said after tracking their contacts, Banti and Farman Ali of Bulandshar in UP, Joni of Badli in Sonepat and Munna Kabadi of Gonda in UP were also arrested.Later, the third gang of transformer thieves was busted with the arrest of Pawan Kumar from Gautambudh Nagar of UP, Salinder Kumar from Barsalu village of Karnal and Mukeem Ansar from Badau of UP.The head of detective staff said police have also recovered around 60kg copper wires and five Maruti Eeco cars and three kits used to open transformers from their possession. He said the arrests will help police in solving over 200 cases of transformer thefts in Karnal district alone as complaints of 360 transformer thefts have been registered so far. The accused confessed that they used to steal copper and other material from 4 to 5 transformers every night and then sell it to junk dealers in Delhi. Police said the accused will be produced in the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-gangs-involved-in-stealing-copper-wires-from-transformers-busted-in-karnal/story-xWlAnB4hSXpR0EFLks8FbI.html

One such election rally, conducted on October 16, has jeopardised the career of an entire batch of 100 medicos who were caught in a heavy traffic snarl-up and could not appear in time at the examination centre. The 2017-batch of medicos of the state-run Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), Pawapuri, have requested the Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) for a re-examination of the pharmacology paper II of the MBBS second professional exams. “We have received the students’ representation, along with a recommendation from the examination centre superintendent. We will sympathetically consider their case but any decision in this regard has to be taken by the university examination board. We will place the matter before it,” said Rajeev Ranjan, AKU examination controller. “The superintendent of the examination centre disallowed the medicos to appear for the exam after they arrived 90 minutes late,” he said. Also read: Declare Durga Puja pandals no-entry zone in Bengal: Calcutta High CourtThe college administration had arranged four buses for the examinees to travel to the examination centre at the Nalanda College of Engineering, Chandi. “The students left well in advance at noon, keeping a margin of two-and-a-half hours to reach the examination centre which was located some 40-50 kilometres away. However, our students were stuck in a bad traffic jam as candidates of some political parties were filing their nomination papers for the legislative assembly elections,” said Dr Pawan Kumar Choudhary, principal, VIMS. The medicos and their sympathisers posted about their ordeal on social media. Nalanda superintendent of police (SP) Nilesh Kumar, however, had a different take on the incident. “The allegation is baseless. No political procession is taken out at the time of filing of nomination by candidates. Nomination papers are not filed on national highways but at sub-division offices. Nomination for Nalanda, Islampur and Hilsa constituencies are filed in the opposite direction to Chandi where the medicos had their examination centre,” said Kumar. Kumar said the students were using the traffic jam as an alibi to cover up their delay in leaving for the examination centre. “The students have been staying here for quite some time and should know about the congestion given the poor condition of national highway (NH) 31. On top of that, people do not have any traffic sense, which occasionally leads to traffic snarls at different locations. It’s nothing new. Even if all the police personnel are used, it still takes time to clear traffic snarls. Sometimes, such problems do arise,” he added. “This is no issue at all. However, it doesn’t bother us if, for a handful of acquaintances, you want to make an issue out of it,” Kumar signed off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-medicos-miss-exam-due-to-election-rally-sp-says-baseless-allegations/story-ZkMnWc1knEjt4LqknPJDaO.html

Its larva bores into the stem of a young plant and kills the central shoot,” the scientists said.PAU has also asked farmers to remain vigilant and regularly monitor their paddy crop, especially in fields where long-duration varieties of paddy such as Pusa 44 and Peeli Pusa etc. are grown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pink-stem-borer-infestation-pau-asks-farmers-to-avoid-early-sowing-of-wheat-in-affected-areas/story-hQZDhD3GnE1P24H8SNQS2K.html
19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Less than 20% students turn up to attend opening day of school in Punjab’s Amritsar, Jalandhar||Barely 20% of the total students of Classes 9 to 12 attended school in Amritsar district on Monday after the Punjab government implemented a graded return to normalcy following a seven-month lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The students were permitted to attend school with parental consent and by following the Covid-19 safety guidelines, including wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and using hand sanitisers. The schools have been directed not to make attendance of students compulsory and to continue online classes along with offline. Mandeep Kaur, the principal of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Mall Road, Amritsar, said, “1,600 students are enrolled in Classes 9-12 but less than 20% of them attended school on Monday. Since we were not aware about the number of students coming, all faculty members were called on Monday but we will soon restrict the number of teachers according to the turnout.” Dr Anita Bhalla, the principal of Bhavan’s SL Public School, said, “Less than 15% of the students came to school but more students are expected in the coming days. The school is following safety measures. Since the turnout is low, only one-third of the faculty members will be coming to school.” social ONLINE OPTION REMAINS OPEN About 10% parents submitted the consent letter, enabling their children to attend school in Jalandhar district on Monday. District education officer (secondary) Harinder Pal Singh said many parents had come to school to review arrangements and the authorities hoped to see the strength grow in the coming days. “In each school, five to eight students of Classes 9-12 were present. We ensured all precautions. The district has over 53,000 registered students in Classes 9-12 in 273 schools. Of them, only 5,000 attended class on Monday,” the DEO said. The situation was similar in private schools. Montgomery Guru Nanak Teachers Association president Kranti Ghuman said that 45 students attended class at the MGN Adarsh Nagar school on Monday. A private school teacher said as the option of online classes for students is still open and almost all students have a gadget to attend the class, so most parents chose to play it safe. Manjeet Kaur, a resident of Shaheed Babu Labh Singh, said that the state government and schools had put all responsibility on parents by asking them to fill a form, saying in case a child tests positive, they will be responsible.

We are receiving more requests that are being processed on a daily basis.”State government officials said Uttarakhand has emerged as a preferred choice for filmmakers because of subsidies in shooting, lodging and also rebates in the payment of State Goods and Services Tax (SGST). Also Read: Uttarakhand adds 376 new Covid-19 cases; state tally crosses 58,000-mark“Uttarakhand is blessed with natural scenic beauty, which offers filmmakers breathtaking locales for shoots. There are several other benefits as well such as no additional charges for shooting, 100% online process for approvals, which reduces red tapism, and a 50% discount on lodging of film crew if they stay in government guest houses. There is a 30% refund on SGST on prices of tickets for films that are shot in Uttarakhand among others,” said Chauhan. “The state government gives an additional security of up to five police personnel without any charges to any film unit on request,” he added.The Uttarakhand Film Policy aims “to popularise the state as a major tourist destination. The Uttarakhand government has exempted all films shot in the state from shooting charges.” “Based on merit, films having more than 50% or more outdoor shooting in Uttarakhand will be made tax-free,” it added. Altogether, 475 films have been shot in the state since the policy was initiated in 2015.So far, 148 films have been shot this year, including 98 after the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions were lifted. On Sunday, Bollywood actors Shahid Kapoor and Mrunal Thakur thanked the state government and tweeted for the latter’s support during the shoot of their upcoming film, Jersey. “It’s a wrap on this schedule of Jersey. I would like to thank the Uttarakhand government for supporting and putting in place efficient policies that enabled us to safely shoot and wrap the schedule of our film in many beautiful locations of the state,” Kapoor tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-received-two-film-shoot-requests-per-day-once-lockdown-restrictions-were-lifted/story-oAYi5KmGAwHhPluLEJK2YP.html

It was our in-house labour.”Electrical equipment, including dewatering pump, was being used in the repair work. Also read: Foul smell, akin to gas leak, reported from Mumbai’s eastern suburbsAccording to Vilas Shinde, senior police inspector of Nehru Nagar Police Station, “We have registered an accidental death report (ADR) for the incident and are investigating the matter. We will seek details from the BMC on the incident. We are yet to take statements of the victims. We will take any further action for investigation only after we have recorded their statements.”The labour union, on the other hand, has alleged that an enquiry should be conducted into the incident as the labourers were forced to do the work of an electrician too while on field to fix water pipelines.Mahendra Zankar, secretary of Municipal Kamgar Sangh, said, “We are demanding that an enquiry be ordered into the incident. Time and again, we have requested that electrician should also be sent wherever electrical work is involved, but here, labourers are forced to do electrical work.”He added, “Labourers have to do repair work and also handle the generator, and this is unfair. We are demanding monetary compensation for the families of the deceased and also a job for a family member.”BMC’s reaction to the Union’s allegations is awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-2-labourers-dead-5-injured-on-electrocution-while-fixing-water-pipeline-leak-in-kurla/story-O5feOsyKHObbiEY3aElLmO.html
19-10-2020||Kolkata||Calcutta high court: No pandal-hopper to be allowed inside pandals||The Calcutta high court (HC) on Monday directed that no revellers would be allowed inside Durga Puja pandals in West Bengal because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the state.The court has ordered that pandals would be treated as “no entry zones”, as Bengal gears to celebrate Durga Puja that starts from Thursday (October 22). The court’s direction came amid warnings by doctors that Covid-19 cases could increase up to four-fold after the festive season, if restrictions are relaxed by the state authorities. “A division bench of the Calcutta HC while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) has directed that barricades need to be put up outside puja pandals. In big pandals, the barricade will be installed at least at a distance of 10 metres (m). While for smaller pandals, the barricades will be put up at a distance of five metres. No visitors will be allowed inside the no-entry zone, except for club members,” said Sabyasachi Chatterjee, the petitioner’s lawyer. Also Read: West Bengal: Night-long Durga Puja pandal-hopping to start today amid sharp spike in Covid-19 casesClub members, who are organising a puja, are only allowed to enter a pandal. The HC has also imposed restrictions on the number of puja committee members, who can be allowed to enter a pandal. “In smaller pandals, 15 members will be allowed. While in the case of bigger pandals, a maximum of 25 members will be allowed. The names of the entrants will have to be decided in advance and cannot be changed daily. The puja organisers have been directed to display the list of entrants,” Chatterjee said. The HC’s direction comes on a day, when overnight pandal hopping was slated to start. Though the annual Durga puja starts on Maha Sasthi on Thursday, pandal hopping started since Sunday. “We have not seen the order yet. We will implement the order, as it has been issued by the HC. However, the order has come as a big shock for us. Many organisers have done elaborate decorations of pandals for revellers. Their efforts will go in vain. We had made arrangements for masks and hand sanitisers for visitors,” said a member of the Forum for Durgotsab, an umbrella organisation of over 350 prominent puja committees in Kolkata. Bengal is organising over 37,000 community pujas, including more than 2500 in and around Kolkata , this year. Around 1,700 pujas are being organised by women in the state. However, the list doesn’t include pujas, which are being held in housing societies and individual households. The HC also observed that reports published in the media about growing Covid-19 cases are scary and questioned how only 30,000-odd police personnel could tackle up to four lakh pandal hoppers. However, the state government assured that it would increase the deployment of police personnel.Bengal has reported a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases after puja shopping started and the public started thronging market places. On Sunday, the state reported 3,983 new Covid-19 cases, including 813 fresh viral outbreaks in Kolkata alone. This was the highest number of cases of the contagion in Bengal on a single day. The positivity rate in the state has shot up from 6.6% on September 5 to 9.1% on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/calcutta-high-court-no-pandal-hopper-to-be-allowed-inside-pandals/story-GZrhx6drd91BnhRP3U2ONK.html
19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Pakistan invites Indian Sikhs for Guru Nanak’s 551st birth anniversary at Nankana Sahib on November 27||Pakistan has invited Indian Sikhs to attend the 551st birth anniversary celebrations of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, an official said on Monday. The three-day celebrations, known as Guru Nanak Gurpurb, will begin at Nankana Sahib on November 27. Every year, a large number of Sikh pilgrims from India and different parts of the world gather at Gurdwara Janamasthan Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, in Pakistan’s Punjab province to mark his birth anniversary. However, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to affect festivities this year. VISA WILL EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 2 Indian pilgrims will be offered a five-day visa to enter the country upon the proof of a mandatory Covid-19 negative test, The Express Tribune reported. The Waqf Property Board and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) have also sent regular invitations and itineraries to Sikh societies, including the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, for attending the festivities. In view of the coronavirus pandemic, Sikhs from India will be allowed to stay in the country only for a limited period of time, with no extensions. The special five-day Nankana Sahib visa will effectively expire on December 2. “All pilgrims coming to partake in the festivities of Baba Guru Nanak Dev’s birth anniversary will required to observe and abide by all Covid-19 standard operating procedures throughout their stay, even after showing the mandatory negative Covid-19 test,” an official of the country’s Waqf board said. 3,000 INDIAN SIKH PILGRIMS TO BE ALLOWED According to PSGPC head Satwant Singh, the schedule of their stay in Pakistan had to be revised in consideration of “closed borders and the rising coronavirus tally in India”. “There will be no new restrictions placed on the number of Indian Sikh pilgrims making the journey,” he said. According to the Pakistan-India bilateral agreement, 3,000 Indian Sikh pilgrims will be allowed entry into the country for the Gurpurb celebrations. However, this time around, visitors will only have the option of the Nankana Sahib visa, unlike last year when they had the option of a 10-day visa to visit multiple gurdwaras in Lahore, Nankana Sahib, Hassan Abdal, Kartarpur, Rohri Sahib and Farooqbad. NO STAY OR SHOPPING IN LAHORE For the first time, Sikh pilgrims visiting the country will also not have the option to stay or shop in Lahore and be required to exit the country upon conclusion of religious festivities. According to Satwant Singh, Indian pilgrims will be welcomed at the Wagah border on November 27, from where they will be taken to Nankana Sahib through a special bus service. “The pilgrims will have access to gurdwaras in Nankana Sahib and will also get to participate in the nagar kirtan (religious procession). At the end of which, they will be shuttled back to Wagah on December 1, to head back to India,” he said. CONNECTION THROUGH THE CORRIDOR Last week, addressing a media briefing here, foreign office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said that Pakistan reopened the Kartarpur Corridor on July 29, but India has not yet opened its side. The corridor – which allows Indian pilgrims to undertake visa-free travel to the historic Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara – was closed on March 16 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. India has said a decision to re-open the Kartarpur Corridor would be taken in accordance with the Covid-19 protocols and easing of restrictions. The corridor links Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur to Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Guru Nanak. Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the Ravi river, 4 km from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. In November last year, the two countries threw open the corridor in a historic people-to-people initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pakistan-invites-indian-sikhs-for-guru-nanak-s-551st-birth-anniversary-at-nankana-sahib-on-november-27/story-BqrW4COMjaHDjkoEebKqbM.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Pest infestation in Mumbai’s mangrove depends on rain intensity; attack highest along MMR: Study offers solutions||Scientists have found a direct correlation between the intensity of rainfall over the city and annual pest attacks on mangroves, while indicating that the infestation was highest at mangrove forests in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), for any coastal area.The Institute of Wood Sciences and Technology (IWST), Bengaluru, submitted its final report suggesting solutions for the annual invasion to the state mangrove cell last week after studying the phenomenon for the past three years.“We found the intensity of the infestation varies every year and depends directly on the amount of rainfall received by the city during monsoon. Heavier the rains, worse the infestation,” said R Raja Rishi, principal investigator of the project, IWST.The study documented that the city received 2,239.6mm rain in 2018, lesser than the annual average, which saw isolated incidents of the pest attack. In comparison, 3,670.4mm in 2019 (46% excess rain than the annual average) led to very high incidents of infestation.“Pest attacks have been reported from mangrove forests across the Indian coastline, but the intensity and scale have been the highest in the MMR region. This is because the attack starts in the teak trees at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and surrounding territorial forests during summer and pre-monsoon, which is the primary host area. Whenever the climate is ideal [more rainfall], these pests move to mangrove forests within the region. By late October-November, they go back to the teak trees at SGNP, completing their lifecycle,” said Rishi, adding that availability of more moisture and rain makes conditions favourable for their movement to mangrove trees. “However, a more in-depth study is needed to understand their movement vis-à-vis climate parameters,” he said.The report listed organic solutions as well as a pesticide to ensure mangrove trees are rid of five major pests among 20, led by the Hyblaea Purea moth.“We have suggested the use of a botanical bio-pesticide Hy-Act that has been successful in reducing infestation of the identified pests. It has been developed by the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding in Coimbatore and is not commercially available. Other natural measures include using neem-based solutions [neem oil] to control these defoliating pests,” said Rishi.However, the study concluded with a caveat that more research was needed, whether to control this annual pest outbreak or leave it as is. “Owing to several beneficial and positive impacts on the ecosystem through contribution to the nutrient cycle and food chain [enhance fishery resources or food source for birds], we must examine whether this natural process should be interfered with or conserved,” said Rishi.To get a better idea about this phenomenon, the state mangrove cell in 2017 appointed IWST to study this phenomenon and suggest measures to control the infestation. With 25 field surveys conducted between 2017 and 2019, scientists collected samples of affected leaves, barks and the pest species from four mangrove forests in Airoli, Ghansoli, Gothivali, and Gorai. They conducted local experiments and assessed damages through laboratory studies. In all, six species of caterpillars, five species of grasshoppers, two species each of semi loopers, snails and weevils, and one each of leaf miner, skeletonizer and bagworm were identified as defoliating pests affecting five different mangrove species. “Of these, the Hyblaea Purea moth was most threatening to mangrove trees, along with two similar moths and two snails,” said Rishi.The mangrove cell said that some mangrove areas are already witnessing fresh green cover since rainfall reduced during the first week of October.“Implementing the bio-pesticide on such a large scale is very difficult and may not be cost-effective at this moment,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). “Even in the teak trees in forest areas in interior Maharashtra where Hyblaea Purea infestation is there, pesticide spraying is not done. To spray the entire mangrove forests is not practical,” he added.However, Tiwari explained that if some mangroves showed extremely poor survival rate or their immune system had weakened and pest attacks were happening too frequently, the cell may consider experimenting with this solution in small patches. “At least now we know this is happening and in most cases, mangroves mostly recover,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pest-infestation-in-mumbai-s-mangrove-depends-on-rain-intensity-attack-highest-along-mmr-study-offers-solutions/story-fvqKn99Mf3HmoXi1qUXutM.html
19-10-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to conduct leopard population estimation from December||After a gap of 12 years, Uttarakhand forest department is gearing up to conduct an estimation of the leopard population in the state beginning this December. The state forest department has started identifying grids where leopards are usually found after which camera traps are likely to be placed. Also read: Injured leopard rescued by forest department officials in J&K’s UdhampurUttarakhand forest department chief wildlife warden JS Suhag said, “Till now, estimation of leopards has taken place in the state in tiger landscapes as it was done along with tiger estimation. But now, we are working to conduct a state-wide estimation of leopard population as they are found almost everywhere in the state.” “We are identifying grids where leopards are found, after which we will decide whether to deploy camera traps or to follow some other strategy for the process. Given the topography of Uttarakhand, camera trapping will be a problem for us as leopards are found in hilly regions, and also near human habitations,” added Suhag. He added that the state forest department will carry out the project along with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). The last state0wide estimation of the leopard population was done in 2008 when the state reported 2,335 leopards. In 2014, WII had conducted an estimation for leopards in tiger landscapes (along with tiger estimation), when the state had reported over 700 leopards, said Suhag. “Leopards in the state have adapted themselves and can live near human habitations. Once we know the grids where there is heavy leopard presence, we can formulate policies according to the area to reduce conflict,” added the senior forest official. Meanwhile, 15 leopards are being radio-collared, predominantly Rajaji Tiger Reserve area, to study the nature of leopard, the areas its moves around, how much time it spends in what type of an area, around what time it moves and the habitat that the animal prefers. In the last week of September, a leopard which strayed in human settlements was captured and radio-collared at the Chidiyapur rescue centre in Haridwar district. It was monitored for around 10-12 hours before being released in the wild.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-conduct-leopard-population-estimation-from-december/story-wG5eX0jOfUtPvH6rahkJ6N.html
19-10-2020||Pune||Pandharpur traders facing a loss of Rs 500cr due to Covid-19, floods this year||Though rainfall activity has reduced, some areas remained flooded and several were still reeling under the losses, financially and socially, in Maharashtra’s Solapur district where more than 17,000 people have been shifted to safer places due to the heavy rains and release of water from the Ujani Dam.In Pandharpur tehsil alone, at least 10,000 people from 46 flood-hit villages have been shifted to safer places, while 14 people have died in rain-related incidents since Wednesday in the western Maharashtra district, officials had said. “Things are not good for us this year. The city had already been affected financially when the wari (annual pilgrimage) was cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic and now the floods have hampered our business. Most of the traders and shop owners had started preparations for Diwali and filled up goods at their shops. The rain water damaged all the stored goods. Every year, the Ashadhi Wari turnover in Pandharpur is around Rs 400 crore and due to the floods, traders have suffered a loss of Rs 100 crore due to damaged goods. So, till now the Pandharpur traders are staring at a loss of Rs 500 crore this year,” said Rajgopal Bhattad, president of Pandharpur Traders’ Association. On October 13, Solapur district received over 138mm rain which lead to waterlogging and flood-like situation in several parts of the district. After this, water was released from the Ujani Dam due to which the Chandrabhaga river in Pandharpur flooded and water entered various parts of the city. “The water level reduced on Saturday and the cleaning process by the Pandharpur Nagar Parishad has now started and even at the individual levels. It will take at least a week to clean all the flood-affected areas. The traders had started buying goods in bulk for Navratri and Diwali festivals due to which there was lot of stock in their shops. Now most of the shops and traders have been affected due to the floods and the goods have been damaged,” added Bhattad. Meanwhile, residents of Pune have come forward to help the flood-affected Pandharpur city. Sagar More, an IT professional originally from Pandharpur and currently staying at Pune, said, “When I got to know about the flood situation back in our Pandharpur city, I was frightened as my relatives are staying there. I was in continuous touch with them. The common people are facing huge losses. The wari pilgrimage, which was a source of generating revenue for the city, was also cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic. So, my friends and I have decided to help the flood victims. We have already started collecting contribution from friends and relatives so that we can send some help to the flood-affected people in Pandharpur.” Demand to start Vitthal Rukmini Temple in Pandharpur Pandharpur city majorly depends on pilgrims coming to take visit the temple of Lord Vitthal in Pandharpur, for finances. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the temple has been closed since the last seven months, but now the local public and traders are demanding the government to reopen the temple. “There is hardly any business going on within Pandharpur, right from street hawkers to big shop owners all are dependent on people coming from outside Pandharpur for Lord Vitthal darshan. Now the rain has relented, cleaning process has started and so our demand is that the state government should immediately reopen the temple for devotees. The visits can start and all safety precautions and social distancing norms will be followed and it will help boost the economy of the city,” said Rajgopal Bhattad, president of Pandharpur Traders’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pandharpur-traders-facing-a-loss-of-rs-500cr-due-to-covid-19-floods-this-year/story-GENZu9KZVR2DbD7MwmJF3L.html
19-10-2020||Pune||IMD forecasts more rains for Pune city this week||The city on Sunday recorded 8.8mm of rainfall, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). The weather department also said that more rain is in store for the city as a low pressure belt is building in the Bay of Bengal, as a result of which parts of Central and western Maharashtra may receive heavy rainfall between October 20 and 22. The city has seen severe flooding and massive loss to property as heavy rains lashed Pune and its surrounding areas over the last couple of days throwing normal life out of gear. The city received rainfall on Sunday afternoon.IMD director Anupam Kashyapi, said, “There are chances of likely rainfall between October 20 and 21. There will be moderate rain in and around the city and there are warnings for isolated heavy rainfall in the ghat areas. The IMD is keeping a close and careful watch on the emerging weather situation. After October 23, the withdrawal of southwest monsoon will be initiated and will be completed in a couple of days over the whole state of Maharashtra.”The IMD further stated that low pressure areas were likely to be formed over central Bay of Bengal from October 19 and the expected monsoon movement will be towards the west-northwestwardly direction. It would lead to increase in the moisture intensity in the region and lead to formation of cumulonimbus clouds leading to thunder activity especially during afternoon and evening hours resulting in intense spells of rain. Central Maharashtra, Marathwada, Goa and isolated places in Vidharbha are likely to rains accompanied by thundershower, it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/imd-forecasts-more-rains-for-pune-city-this-week/story-QHMX1f2bXJr55EGIHM1m0I.html

19-10-2020||Pune||Marriage registrations improve after easing lockdown restrictions||The lockdown imposed by the state and central government has impacted every sector including the ‘official wedlock’ registration in Pune. As many as 3,284 marriage registrations took place from January 1 to September 30 this year as compared to 5,163 registrations in the same period during 2019, according to officials of the marriage registrar.Bhalchandra Pol, marriage registrar official, Pune, said, “Many weddings and marriage registrations had to be postponed due to the lockdown restrictions and inter-district and inter-state travel ban.”“The number of marriage registrations is increasing as the restrictions are easing and the numbers are likely to go up in Diwali due to the auspicious ‘muhurat’ ,” he said.The ‘official wedlock’ registration number came down to merely 12 per cent in the ‘peak season’ of April and May. During May only 84 marriage registrations took place as compared with 751 in 2019. In June, 199 registrations were done as compared with 648 last year.There were four important ‘muhurats’ in April, but those timing slots could not be utilised by the couples and their families due to the lockdown restrictions. The marriage registration offices in Pune region were also shut from April 1 to May 18, as a result, no marriage registrations were done during this period, said officials.The lockdown which was imposed in the last week of March saw 336 registrations as compared to 541 in 2019.In September 429 registrations were done as compared to 598 last year. While till October 10, 2020, as many as 75 registrations were done this year, said officials.The marriage registration process requires the mandatory presence of three witnesses along with the bride and groom at the registrar’s office. The inter-district travel ban too added to the travel woes which made it difficult for people to travel. Many couples prefer to perform the marriage ceremony traditionally and then opt for the registration process which enables them to get the marriage certificate.Mukesh Kumar Saxena who postponed his marriage due to lockdown restrictions, said, “The lockdown orders affected my marriage plans and the date had to be postponed. As the restrictions started easing the marriage ceremony was held with only a few relatives and friends.”Marriage registrations in Pune region2020/2019January 686/ 610February 736/ 350March 336/ 541April 00/ 550May 84/ 751June 199/ 648July 383/ 800August 431/ 315September 429/ 598Total3,284 in 20205,163 in 2019||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/marriage-registrations-improve-after-easing-lockdown-restrictions/story-vmMk8ua0cnDRnIHROaty8M.html
19-10-2020||Pune||Doctors: Exercises help improve breathing, mobility post Covid-19||A three-year-old girl who suffered burn injuries and tested positive for Covid-19 got an extra helping hand from physiotherapists at the Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) for regular exercise. The district administration had started offering physiotherapy treatment focusing on post-Covid-19 treatment including respiratory physiotherapy. Doctors in the city have stated that the therapy helps people to improve oxygen uptake and are keeping them mobile. The girl was admitted to Sassoon hospital’s Covid ward and was also suffering from burns on her abdomen. “Last week when she was admitted to Sassoon, we started the treatment on both her burns and Covid-19. We had to keep her mobile. Our exercises helped her to improve her breathing and mobility exercises helped her in overcoming the disability that she might have got because of burns,” said Dr Raziya Nagarwala who was her treating doctor and is also the cardiovascular and pulmonary physiotherapist from Sancheti hospital. Dr Pawan Shirsath, head of the physiotherapy department from Sassoon Hospital said, “We have started the involvement of physiotherapy for a long time in Sassoon. We are rehabilitating people with mild symptoms and with severe symptoms for Covid-19. Also, in critical patients like pregnant women, children and, patients with other complications. Patients in ICU are completely immobile. In many patients, we have seen that they did not die because of Covid-19 but because of immobility which caused deep vein thrombosis (DVT). So, mobility exercises for critical Covid patients are pivotal. For mild patients, we are improving their lung capacity by taking exercises like climbing stairs. For those who are interested, post-discharge, we are even giving them online physiotherapy sessions.” Doctors also say that in some of the critical Covid patients, it is seen that the patients are developing something called ‘post-intensive care syndrome’. This syndrome is characterised by the hampering of physical abilities, cognitive functions, and psychological well-being. Experts mention that physiotherapists are assisting people even post-discharge. Nagarwala added that physiotherapy is helping patients to improve their oxygen uptake and they are keeping them mobile with exercises. “We are working in close association with other specialists too. Our exercises help them to expel the mucus out of their body through cough in such a way that they don’t have to be dependent on external procedures. But in some critically ill patients, we are working alongside ENT specialists to suction out the mucus out of the patient’s body by using the catheter,” said Nagarwala. In the protocol prepared by the administration for post-Covid management, physiotherapy is said essential to avoid complications by assisting them to wean off by doing early rehabilitation. Almost all Covid facilities in the city have appointed physiotherapists in ICU’s and Covid special wards. The protocol states, “Physiotherapy is needed for all patients with Covid-19 disease. Respiratory physiotherapy with respiratory exercise should be taught to all. Patients should continue to do it for a period of six weeks to three months. Details to be provided by a physiotherapist.” Dr Sourabh Sane, a city-based physiotherapist said, “Our physiotherapists are visiting many hospitals and Covid centres regularly. With the aid of physiotherapy, the high oxygen requirement goes down. We have cases where ICU patients used to see breathlessness by walking two steps. But, with physiotherapy, they are learning techniques for getting the strength to become mobile again. Our progressive exercise protocol is helping these patients to overcome the weakness and fatigue post-discharge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/doctors-exercises-help-improve-breathing-mobility-post-covid-19/story-0t86bT88TLsJVZWAcTGeXJ.html
19-10-2020||City||SC asks Maharashtra SDMA to decide on Nanded gurdwara’s Dussehra celebrations||The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday directed the Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib Board authorities in Maharashtra to approach the secretary of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) for permission to conduct Dussehra celebrations on Sunday (October 25).The order was passed by a special bench of the apex court that held a sitting on a day, when the SC was closed because of the Dussehra vacation. The gurdwara Board authorities had approached the apex court last week and sought an urgent hearing of their plea. The petition sought permission to conduct their centuries-old tradition of programmes on the occasion of the Dussehra, followed by Takhat Isnan on November 13, Nagar Kirtan procession on Diwali on November 14, and Gurtagaddi – an exaltation of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs -- on November 16. Also read: Supreme Court reserves order on plea seeking top court monitored probe in Hathras caseThe Nanded gurdwara is one of the five high seats of authority of the Sikhs, where Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th and the last Sikh Guru, had breathed his last in 1708.The Maharashtra government had opposed the petition, as it feared that the procession will attract a large crowd, which will be detrimental to the state’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Senior advocate Devdutt Kamat along with standing counsel for Maharashtra Sachin Patil informed the SC that Maharashtra ranked among the worst-hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic and severe restrictions were still in place as far as public gatherings were concerned.A three-member SC bench, comprising Justices LN Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi, asked the state government: “The latest standard operating procedure (SOP) released by the Centre allows 200 people to gather in an open space. You have already reopened Metro Rail and many other services. You may consider their request in this light.”The state government suggested that the petitioner can approach the secretary of the SDMA with their request. The bench acceded to the petitioner’s plea and asked the latter that in the event their request is rejected, an appeal could be moved before the Bombay high court (HC). The petitioner agreed to approach the secretary of the SDMA within a day.The gurdwara Board stated in their petition that due to the hostile political environment in Maharashtra, their request was not answered by the state government authorities, despite repeated representations. Advocate Praveen Chaturvedi, who appeared for the Board, stated in the petition, “Having the hostile political environment in Maharashtra, ample religious discontent has been spread due to political interests and the petitioner believe that they will be made to grapple with situation without recourse.”The gurdwara authorities stated in their petition that no more than 50 people would attend the religious functions and all the participants would undergo Covid-19 tests before taking part in the rituals. The plea also pledged that all other necessary precautionary measures against the viral outbreak would be adhered to. The participants’ medical record and identities would be maintained for a month and the public would not be permitted at the religious events, the plea added. Arrangements have been made for a live telecast of the events for the benefit of devotees from across the world. Besides, the procession has been reduced from 2.5 kilometres (km) to 1.5 km.Takhat Sachkhand Sri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib is considered a holy place by Sikhs across the globe. Its Board has 17 distinguished members of the community. Amritsar; Anandpur; Patna Sahib in Bihar; Damdama Sahib in Bathinda, Punjab; and Nanded, Maharashtra, are the five high seats of authority of the Sikh religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-asks-maharashtra-sdma-to-decide-on-nanded-gurdwara-s-dussehra-celebrations/story-8SidVeIfzZObxkzXmllSeI.html

19-10-2020||Mumbai||Summon Arnab Goswami if he is named as accused in TRP scam FIR: Bombay HC||Mumbai police on Monday agreed to first issue summons to Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, if he is arraigned as accused in the television rating point (TRP) scam unearthed by the crime branch.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who represented the Mumbai police, agreed to the suggestion of the bench comprising justices SS Shinde and Makarand Karnik that the police should first summon Goswami—as has been the case for eight Republic TV employees—if the officer investigating the TRP scam decides to name him as an accused in the case.The court was hearing a petition filed by ARG Outlier Media Private Limited, which owns the Republic TV and R Bharat news channels, for quashing of the first information report (FIR) registered at Kandivali police station in connection with TRP scam, and also seeking a transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Also Read: Cooperating with Mumbai Police in TRP scam probe: BARCA first information report was registered with Kandivali police on October 7, 2020, after the crime branch busted a racket involving the fraudulent increase of TRPs of certain channels, by payment to households where barometers were placed for the purpose of measuring TRPs.In a press conference held the next day, Mumbai Police commissioner (CP) Param Bir Singh informed the media that one of the arrested accused had revealed that he was working for Republic TV and was paying households to fraudulently increase TRPs of the English news channel.ARG Outlier Media has, however, claimed that the “Mumbai Police, including Param Bir Singh, harbour malice and ill-will against the petitioners as Republic TV and R Bharat have lately been at the forefront in questioning the tardy investigation by Mumbai Police in the Sushant Singh Rajput case and the Palghar lynching incident.”“As a counterblast, a plethora of false and frivolous legal proceedings have been initiated against the petitioners at the behest of the political dispensation in the state of Maharashtra,” the petition read , adding that the TRP scam case was a part of the design to harass the news channel and its editor.The petitioner firm has sought a transfer of the case to the central bureau of investigation (CBI) contending that the investigation will have a pan-India effect on various stakeholders, including cable TV operators, broadcasters, media agencies and advertisers. It said criminal culpability of this magnitude required a pan-India investigation by a reputed agency like the CBI to unearth the real conspiracy and alleged malpractices of any stakeholder.Its counsel, senior advocate Harish Salve, submitted the entire investigation was “a disguise and excuse to target ARG and Republic TV. He said the FIR was liable to be quashed as the police were being entirely and completely biased, after the news channel had questioned their investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput case and the Palghar lynching case, and urged the Bombay high court to restrain the police from taking any coercive steps against Goswami.Sibal responded to the petition saying the investigation into TRP scam had nothing to with the Palghar case. “What we are investigating is the aspect of money paid to rig television ratings, the practice of paying money to increase TRP for commercial profit,” said the senior advocate.Sibal added that the probe is on and investigation is at a nascent stage, and the FIR cannot be quashed at Goswami’s instance, as the FIR does not even mention his name. Responding to Goswami’s apprehension of arrest, he said that eight Republic TV employees have been summoned by the police in connection with the investigation and none of them has been arrested.The judges opined that there was no need to pass any interim order, as prayed by Salve, for extending protection from coercive steps, as Goswami’s name was not even included in the FIR. But, they suggested that the police should issue summons, as in case of eight Republic TV employees, in case the investigating officer decides to add Goswami’s name as an accused in the case.Sibal agreed to the suggestion. Salve said Goswami would “honour the summons, if any, issued by the Mumbai police crime branch... and cooperate with the investigation”.The Bombay high court has now posted the ARG Outlier Media’s petition for further hearing on November 5, with a direction to the crime branch to submit the TRP scam case papers in a sealed cover for perusal of the court. “We will like to go through the case papers and see what progress has been made in the investigation,” said the court.During the hearing, the high court expressed displeasure over police disclosures to the media. “We don’t think that it is the correct method or procedure to give interviews to media... not just in this case but in many sensitive matters,” said the bench. “Police officers are not supposed to reveal incriminating material to the media, when investigation is going on.”“Media is the fourth pillar of democracy... they also need to behave responsibly,” the bench said after Sibal pointed out that the petitioner’s channels, Republic TV and R Bharat had been holding a media trial and vilifying the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-scam-arnab-goswami-will-first-be-summoned-if-accused-mumbai-police-informs-bombay-hc/story-OlNWeJ0wl9WiETF0QwgE7J.html
19-10-2020||City||Kerala high court rejects state government’s plea against airport lease to Adani group||The Kerala high court on Monday rejected the state government’s plea questioning the Centre’s decision to lease out Thiruvananthapuram international airport to the Adani Enterprises.While rejecting the plea of the state government and five others, the court said it did not want to interfere with what it called a policy decision of the Centre. The division bench also observed that the government had participated in the bidding earlier and lost and it was not proper on its part to question the decision now.In August, the state assembly had passed a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to withhold its decision. Later, the government had moved the high court for a second time. In the petition, the state said the Centre showed undue preference in leasing out the airport to Adani Enterprises which has no experience in running airports. But the Centre opposed it saying it was unfair to oppose the decision after losing the bid. Reacting to the high court’s decision, the state government said it will move the Supreme Court soon. “The Union Government’s move to ‘sell’ the airport is nothing short of a daylight robbery. We will move the apex court,” said state tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran. Last year also, the high court had rejected the government’s plea so it approached the Supreme Court which had referred the issue back to the high court with a direction to hear it again.In February 2019, government-owned Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) had participated in the open bidding for the airport but Adani Enterprises won it _ Adani group had quoted Rs 168 per passenger fee, KSIDC at Rs 135 followed by GMR at Rs 63. After losing the bid, the CM had written to the prime minister, asking him not to hand over the airport to a private entity citing the successful PPP model of the Cochin International Limited (CIAL) and Kannur airports. He said the state deserved preferential consideration, taking into account its experience in running two airports. One of the oldest airports of the country (built in 1932), the Thiruvananthapuram airport was operated by the Airport Authority of India (AAI). Situated in the middle of the city on 638 acres of land donated by the erstwhile rulers of Travancore, only 40 acres were added to the airport later, crippling its further expansion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-high-court-rejects-state-government-s-plea-against-airport-lease-to-adani-group/story-6XJBSU5fD9zdCCAVPBHbcN.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||‘Red Light On, Gaadi off’ campaign to start on October 21, says Delhi environment minister||From October 21, at over 100 traffic signals across Delhi, environment marshals and traffic police officials will urge drivers to turn off their ignition as they wait for the traffic signal to turn green.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday announced that the government’s, ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off (red light on, ignition off)’ campaign will be kick-started from October 21 to educate drivers about the benefits of turning off their engines while waiting at signals. This is a step towards controlling vehicular pollution in the city, the minister said. The campaign was first announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last week. Last Friday, Rai chaired a high-level meeting which was attended by officials of the environment department, Delhi traffic police and the transport department to chalk out a detailed plan for its implementation.“This will be an awareness campaign and drivers will not be penalised for it. We will urge drivers, who care about the growing pollution in the city, the health of their children and their elderly parents, to do their bit in controlling vehicular emissions. Doing so will be completely voluntary. The awareness campaign will continue till November 15,” said Rai while addressing a press conference on Monday. For the campaign, around 2,500 environment marshals will be stationed at 100 traffic signals across the city with placards, posters and roses to offer to drivers. The government has also chosen 10 major traffic signals of the total 100, where the stoppage time is more than two minutes. At these signals, the deployment of marshals will be more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign-to-start-on-october-21-says-delhi-environment-minister/story-6tWUncygyO885KU8YVdLlJ.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||‘Can think about implementing odd-even if other measures fail’: Delhi environment minister on air pollution||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Monday that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government can think about implementing the odd-even scheme in the national capital if other measures to control pollution fail.“We have implemented the odd-even scheme many times in Delhi. It would be our last resort and we’ll think about its implementation if rest of the methods to curb the air pollution fail,” Rai told reporters.Delhi’s air quality has already plunged to poor category ahead of the winter season. On Sunday, the air quality index (AQI) - a measure of the suspended PM2.5 and PM10 ultra-fine particle in the air - was 254, in the poor category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Delhi’s AQI was recorded at 287 on Saturday.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had last week announced a ban on the use of fuel-powered generators from October 15 under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), a set of anti-pollution restrictions that include pre-emptive measures to stop the air quality from deteriorating to emergency levels.GRAP lays down sets of curbs that are enforced when AQI crosses certain thresholds - the most serious of these include a ban on trucks, odd-even road restrictions, curbs on construction work, and an advisory to shut schools.The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), a Supreme Court-appointed body tasked with overseeing the implementation of the pollution control action plan in the National Capital Region (NCR), has said that GRAP will be enforced “with no concessions” to any state.Farm fires and emissions from firecrackers during Diwali result in heavy concentrations of PM2.5 particles, which can lead to major health problems since they can enter the bloodstream after penetrating deep into the lungs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/can-think-about-implementing-odd-even-if-other-measures-fail-delhi-environment-minister-on-air-pollution/story-bDXvVPBfF3NzDgAqXyhfOP.html

19-10-2020||Gurugram||An exhibition for an artistic festive season ahead||Art can evoke myriad emotions, and hope is what one needs in these trying times amid the Covid-19 pandemic. And this exhibition in Delhi-NCR promises to do just that. “This year’s collection is ‘happy collection’,” says artist and sculptor Anju Kumar, whose annual show promises just that. All your festive needs are sorted at this exhibition that encompasses a vast range of artworks including paintings, murals, planters, urns, table bases, pillars, Ganeshas, Buddhas, chowkis, Tulsi chauras, mandir, floor lamps and more. “It’s about expressing yourself from the core space, in tandem with the universe. I feel the bottom line of life is Sat Chit Anand. The underlying concept for this art show is that one has to celebrate life and be at their creative best to be happy,” says Kumar, who has experimented with bright hues for the exhibition as “bright artworks change the configuration of the living space dramatically and bring life to mundane walls”.Due to the long lockdown, artists across India are facing a financial crunch. The festive season is the ray of hope one needs at this point in time, and people should support them, feels Kumar. “These are trying times for everyone, be it craftsmen or artists but we need to be connected, and have faith that this too shall pass. Everyone should make a conscious effort to support the indigenous crafts as it is so important to encourage our traditional art,” she says. Ask her the measures she had to take this year to ensure safety, vis-à-vis previous years, and she shares: “This year’s art show is going to be different as we request our valuable clients to come with an appointment.”Catch It LiveWhat: Festive Collection by Anju KumarWhere: Studio Anmol, C-55A, South City-1, Gurgaon 122002On Till: October 25Timing: 11am to 8pmNearest Metro Station: Phase 1 on Rapid MetroContact: 9810033305Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/an-exhibition-for-an-artistic-festive-season-ahead/story-ZOqAUYP550lAXSQiHvPqrO.html
19-10-2020||Lucknow||Ballia shooting case: After party leadership’s snub, BJP MLA to stay out of district for a few days||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) controversial lawmaker Surendra Singh would stay away from eastern Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Ballia district for a couple of days amid reports that the top brass in the party’s state unit has asked him to steer clear following the murder of a villager last Thursday.Surendra’s aide and a BJP member, Dheerendra Pratap Singh, is the main accused in the murder case. “I shall stay in Lucknow for a couple of days,” Surendra said without ascribing any reason for his absence from Ballia district. Surendra was summoned to Lucknow on Sunday by Swatantra Dev Singh, the chief of the BJP’s UP unit, and Sunil Bansal, general secretary (organisation), UP. Also read: ‘I’m being framed,’ alleges main accused in Ballia shooting case“The legislator (Surendra) has been told to stay away from the case and not to make any statements,” a BJP leader said. The outspoken lawmaker admitted that he was asked to lie low by the party’s state unit leadership.“I was asked not to make any statements in the case. I only wanted to ensure that both sides are heard,” he said.“I also told the leadership that I wanted the accused to be punished,” he added. The BJP didn’t issue any statement about him.“He (Surendra) was summoned and snubbed by the party leadership,” said a BJP leader, who is privy to the developments in the case. The snub came hours after the UP Special Task Force (STF) arrested Dheerendra from Lucknow. On Monday, Dheerendra was sent to a 14-day judicial custody in Ballia district. Surendra had admitted that Dheerendra was his aide and a BJP member. He had also approached the police claiming that a counter first information report (FIR) be filed by Dheerendra’s family members in the murder case. Dheerendra had allegedly shot a villager (46) dead during a meeting in the presence of state government officials following a dispute over an allocation of two fair price shops at Durjanpur village in Ballia district on Thursday. On Friday, Surendra, who represents Bairia assembly constituency in Ballia district, had said that Dheerendra was compelled to open fire in self-defence. He had claimed that had Dheerendra not opened fire, several of his family members, including women, would have been killed in a stone-pelting incident by angry villagers on Thursday. On Saturday, Surendra visited Revati police station in Ballia and demanded that an FIR be lodged based on the plea moved by Dheerendra’s female relatives who, he alleged, had sustained injuries due to stone-pelting. “I am carrying medical reports of five of Dheerendra’s relatives, who were injured in the stone-pelting incident,” the MLA said before his meeting with the UP BJP’s top brass on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ballia-shooting-case-after-party-leadership-s-snub-bjp-mla-to-stay-out-of-district-for-a-few-days/story-i3BikHY5Oq229V40Xqn4ZK.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Does Danve mean the country is run by incompetent people: Shiv Sena attacks BJP on country’s economy||The Shiv Sena on Monday targeted the Central government over the state of the country’s economy and backed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Union minister of state Raosaheb Danve’s statement that running a government is not an “incompetent” person’s job. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana asked if Danve meant the country is run by incompetent people.The editorial outlined the poor economic situation in the country, including unemployment, poverty and India’s slipping rank in the Global Hunger Index 2020: it ranks lower than Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. It added that India’s GDP is lower than Bangladesh’s, and India is now in the bottom-three among South Asian countries.Also Read: Maharashtra Governor’s ‘Secular’ taunt: Issue has ended for us after Amit Shah’s stand, says Sanjay Raut“Raosaheb Danve remarked that running a government is not an incompetent person’s job. He a Union minister and therefore his statement must be viewed at the national level because on the issues of hunger and nourishment India’s situation is quite serious. On one hand, we are beating the drums about being a $5 trillion economy while on the other hand, 14%-15% of the population is undernourished,” the editorial read. India now ranks 94th among 107 countries in terms of hunger, and continues to be in the ‘severe’ hunger category according to the Global Hunger Index 2020. According to the study, 14% of India’s population is undernourished. “What Danve said is indeed true. There is hunger, poverty and malnutrition in the country and what is the Modi government doing about it?” it asked.Continuing its sharp attack on the BJP-led government, the Sena mouthpiece said, “Running a government does not mean spreading hatred. When issues are about hunger and unemployment, topics such as Hindu-Muslim or India-Pakistan are created. Demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax has weakened India’s financial strength. Thousands of people have lost employment; instead of providing them jobs, topics such as surgical strike and Rafale are brought out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/does-danve-mean-the-country-is-run-by-incompetent-people-shiv-sena-attacks-bjp-on-country-s-economy/story-y37bFNytIH1BeZYbfieN6H.html
19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Independent candidate Kapoor Singh Narwal withdraws nomination for Haryana’s Baroda byelection||Giving in to Haryana Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s appeal to put up a united show, rebel leader Kapoor Singh Narwal withdrew his nomination as an independent candidate on Monday, the last day to do so, for the November 3 Baroda by election.Hooda had earlier been pushing for BJP rebel Narwal’s nomination as Congress candidate but state unit president Kumari Selja prevailed by calling him an ‘outsider’ and Indu Raj Narwal was nominated instead. Kapoor Singh Narwal said he withdrew his nomination after khap representatives and Hooda urged him to do so in the interest of “brotherhood and for the farmers’ concern”. “This election is being fought to teach the BJP a lesson after it enacted the three farm laws. Both Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Deepender Singh Hooda assured me of respect. Now, I am dedicating myself to senior Hooda sahab,” he said.Narwal is game changer: HoodaWhile addressing a gathering at Kapoor Narwal’s house in Sonepat’s Gohana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said Narwal is the game changer of the election and he has a lot of respect for him.“In the last six years, BJP damaged everything in the state. I assure you that no one can snatch the steering wheel (terming himself as tallest leader of Haryana Congress) from me. If you will ensure my candidate’s win from Baroda, the government’s countdown will begin. You know me, the power steering will remain in my hand,” he added.Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu also extended support to Hooda. Kundu said he can support anyone to ensure BJP candidate’s win in this bypoll for the sake of farmer’s interest.“The BJP’s defeat will be a great tribute to our agitating farmers’, who are sitting on a stir against farm laws,” he added.Two days ago, residents of Congress nominee Indu Raj’s native village Rindhana visited Kathura, the native village of Kapoor Singh Narwal, to request him to take back his nomination. However, his supporters turned down the request. Finally, the khaps and Hooda convinced him. Two others withdraw nominationTwo other independent candidates have also withdrawn their nomination for the bypoll. Loktantra Suraksha Party chief Raj Kumar Saini, who could potentially dent the chances of BJP candidate Yogeshwar Dutt by eating into the backward class votes, asked his party nominee Rajinder Singh to withdraw the papers. However, Saini will contest the bypoll. He said the saffron party had managed to convince his party candidate in the Jind bypoll but this time he is leaving no stone unturned by pitching himself in the fray.“Both the BJP and the Congress have been creating a gap between the rich and poor. The deprived section is still waiting for their rights. All sections of the society will show their resentment against these parties by electing me as their MLA,” Saini said.BJP’s Yogeshwar Dutt, an Olympian wrestler, Indu Raj Narwal, a former Sonepat zila parishad member, of the Congress, , Joginder Singh Malik of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and LSP chief Raj Kumar Saini are in the fray for the Baroda byelections.The Baroda assembly seat had fallen vacant in April after the death of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/independent-candidate-kapoor-singh-narwal-withdraws-nomination-for-haryana-s-baroda-byelection/story-BiNH5dLcIgtSLu4vUvCCYO.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Anyone with self-respect would quit after Amit Shah’s rebuke: Pawar on Governor Koshyari||Sharad Pawar, the chief of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), on Monday upped the ante against Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over his “secular” jibe to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week. Pawar said any person, who has self-respect, would have resigned from the position of the Governor after being publicly rebuked by the Union Minister for Home Affairs Amit Shah. He said that he has never seen such a Governor in his long political career.“What can I say about the Governor? The Union Minister for Home Affairs has spoken about him. Was the dignity of the office (of the Governor) exalted because of his remark? I have come across several Governors in my long political career, but none has taken such a stand. A Governor must uphold the dignity of the office. He is also expected to maintain the dignity of a CM’s office,” Pawar said.Also read: Shiv Sena welcomes Amit Shah’s stance on CM-Governor row“It is good that Shah rebuked him. I personally believe that a person, who has self-respect, will not continue in the post after being publicly reprimanded by the Union Minister for Home Affairs,” said the veteran leader.In an interview to a TV news channel last week, Shah reacted to the raging controversy and said that Governor Koshyari could have chosen his words better. “I have gone through the letter. He has made a passing reference. However, I feel he should have been more restrained in his choice of words,” Shah has said.Koshyari recently wrote to the CM about reopening places of worship in the state amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and asked if Thackeray, who is also the president of the ruling Shiv Sena, had “suddenly turned secular”.His remark triggered a war of words with the CM, as the latter reminded him that secularism was one of tenets of the Constitution that he swore upon while taking oath as Maharashtra Governor. The NCP is a part of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, which also comprises the Sena and the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/anyone-with-self-respect-would-quit-after-amit-shah-s-rebuke-pawar-says-of-governor-koshyari/story-kiMZEwnfLuyR5Vx22wjvCL.html
19-10-2020||Pune||Maharashtra floods: Fadnavis says Centre will help; Wouldn’t need it if state got dues on time, says CM||During his visit to flood-affected areas, Maharashtra Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said while the Centre will help farmers, the state government cannot pass on its responsibility. “It is state government’s primary responsibility to assist farmers. However, what we see today is the growing tendency within this state government to pass on every responsibility to Centre,” said Fadnavis on NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s remarks. Pawar had earlier said the Union government should help the flood affected farmers as the state has its limitations. Pawar also said he will be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the next 10 days. Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, responding to Fadnavis’ allegation that the state government was passing on its responsibility to the Centre, said that if the latter gives dues to the state on time, there will not be need to ask for its help. “I do not want to bring in politics here. However, if the Centre gives our dues on time, there will not be a need to ask for anything from the Centre,” he said. Both Thackeray and Fadnavis are touring the flood-affected areas of the state as heavy rains and floods have claimed at least 48 lives in Pune, Aurangabad and Konkan divisions last week while crops on lakhs of hectares of land have been damaged, leading to farmers demanding immediate relief. At many places in Pune and Solapur district, farmers have complained that despite four days, the administration has not started assessment of cross damage, resulting in a delay in help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/maharashtra-floods-fadnavis-says-centre-will-help-wouldn-t-need-it-if-state-got-dues-on-time-says-cm/story-YuhH04cvhvzGV4pS1lu6BK.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Durga Puja in the time of Covid-19||In the past few months, with the Covid-19 scare, the fact that public gatherings of any nature would be dangerous became quite clear. However, it is commendable that with the festive season approaching, devotees, instead of being disappointed have come up with new ideas and noble causes to celebrate festivals. This remains true for Durga Puja as well. As it was with Ganesh Chaturthi, many have come together and decided to help those in need as we go through this distressing period.In Mumbai, too, the Bombay Durgabari Samiti has decided to tone down celebrations. Susmita Mitra, president of the women-led organisation says that “arrangements have been made to webcast the Puja this year”. Mitra adds that the organisation, that dates back to 1930s, will follow every norm set by the BMC. “Instead of the idol, we have opted for Ghat Puja, observing appropriate rituals. Also, have chosen a smaller venue, which is Sangam Hall in Marine Drive. All the BMC norms of social distancing will be observed,” she says.The same will be true for North Bombay Sarbojanin Durga Puja Samiti. The members, this year, have decided to take their puja to the people through live streaming. “We organise the festival for hundreds and thousands of devotees across India every year, however the celebration will be virtual this time. We are happy to reach millions of people through our virtual celebration. We have set certain rules which are mandatory for every member who will visit the pandal to follow,” says Deb Mukherjee.For devotees, too, this year will be a bit disappointing. Krishna Kumar, a 24-year-old student, who always makes it a point to visit the pandals, says, “Although, it is sad that there will be no gatherings, it is great to see people using the funds and resources to help those affected by the lockdown.” The feeling is mutual for Sreeyash Suresh, a 30-year-old IT professional. “I think online pujas are a great initiative. Many senior citizens will be able to attend it with their families,” he says.Moreover, Jayati Dasgupta, the chairman of the organisation adds that the charitable endeavours that run all through the year, have continued. She says among many other initiatives, “the Samiti actively undertakes various charitable initiatives throughout the year including granting scholarships to underprivileged and deserving students, bhog is distributed to a large number of underprivileged and less fortunate persons.” However, there will be no bhog distribution this year “keeping in mind government regulations and the safety of our devotees in mind,” adds Dasgupta.(Corrigendum: Please note the print version that appeared on October 19 mentions ‘bhog will be distributed this year’. However, this is an error and not true. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, Bombay Durgabari Samiti wants to make sure that everyone remains safe.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/durga-puja-in-the-time-of-covid-19/story-q7vJqEbBhl2HbWioJVTWOO.html

The urban areas accounted for 94.2% of the total cases (35,058) on June 18, though the share kept decreasing to mark 71.19% on July 18, 61.22% on August 18 and 51.59% on September 18. At the same time, the rural areas recorded a spike in the number of cases. By September, the urban parts came at par with the rural areas in terms of cases . Also read: Mumbai Metro to restart operations today; here’s all you need to knowMaharashtra’s population is almost equally distributed in urban and rural parts and the urban-rural population ratio during 2011 census was 45:55. However, this month, the cases in urban parts have started increasing in comparison to the rural areas of the state. “For the first couple of months of the outbreak, most of the cases were from Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) comprising 11 big cities. Gradually, the virus started spreading to other big cities, like Nagpur, Nashik,Aurangabad as people started moving from places recording more cases. By July, the rural part of the state witnessed a massive spread. In some districts, like Jalgaon and Ahmednagar, cases were more in rural parts than in the cities. The rural parts have lived their peak now and have started moving towards the baseline of the infection curve,” said an official from the health department. Dr Gautam Bhansali, a consulting physician, said, “The peak in the rural areas has ended and the cases there are expected to keep reducing. Whereas the mobility in urban areas has increased after unlock and reverse migration to cities has begun. There is also an added confidence in the infrastructure in the cities that has led to more crowding there. On the contrary, in rural parts, there is fear among the people about the infection due to poor health facilities.”However, the state authorities have expressed concerns over the complacency among people in cities. “Citizens are not following the protocol of social distancing and personal hygiene carefully. This is also a reason for high number of cases in MMR, which has gone up to 35% of state cases from 25% over last few months,” an official from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-cases-in-urban-areas-of-maharashtra-on-rise-again/story-ICBkGS7cpOzcgIZk4pby5K.html

Thackeray, along with other senior ministers from his cabinet, is visiting villages that were hit by heavy rainfall in Solapur and will meet with district officials on Monday evening to take stock of the situation.Harvest-ready crops on hectares of land were destroyed in the torrential rainfall and flooding that occurred for over four days last week in many districts of central and western Maharashtra. Farmers have been demanding immediate financial relief.Thackeray, along with revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse and local ruling party MLAs began the tour from Sangvi Khurd village in Solapur district.

We want the entire village to be rehabilitated with immediate assistance to farmers,” said Aftab Shaikh, the village head of Sangvi Khurd.The chief minister’s tour began after criticism from opposition parties that Thackeray should step out and assess the loss from the ground instead of evaluating the situation through video conferencing.The CM will visit flood-hit villages in Osmanabad on Wednesday.Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, too, began his three-day tour of flood-hit districts on Monday. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar visited villages in Solapur and Nanded on Sunday as part of his two-day tour.

It is the state government’s primary responsibility to assist,” Fadnavis said while reacting to Sharad Pawar’s remarks.

19-10-2020||Education||DU to begin admissions under second cut-off list today||Following a record-breaking number of admissions under the first cut-off list this year, 61 Delhi University colleges are set to begin the second round of merit-based admissions to its undergraduate courses from Monday. Over 34, 800 students had taken admissions under the first cut-off for the 70,000 undergraduate seats offered by the varsity. Last year, this figure stood at around 23,000. At over 354,000 applications, the university had also received its highest-ever number of applications this year. Admissions under second cut-off will begin on Monday, 10am, and will continue till Wednesday, 5 pm. Applicants can, however, pay the fee till Friday night. Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai said, “We had anticipated a higher number of students taking admissions this year due to several factors. This is why we have extended the hours for the admission and payment process.” The university’s admission team has advised students to pay the fee early so that errors in the payment process, if any, can be rectified before the deadline is over. HT had earlier reported on how students had reported errors while trying to pay the fee through the university portal till the last day of payment under the first cut-off list. Many principals said that following the second cut-off list, many applicants may switch colleges or cancel their admissions since the results of all entrance examination, including National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), had also been declared.Executive council member Rajesh Jha, who teaches at Rajdhani College, had told HT, “Carrying out admissions under the first cut-off list is relatively less complex. In the subsequent lists, students would want to cancel their admission in one college and take admission in another and doing all that within a three-day window is more of a challenge.” While the second list saw a marginal drop in cut-offs, several popular courses are still available in multiple colleges. For instance, students wishing to study BA (Honours) in English can apply in Lady Shri Ram College (98.75%), Miranda House (98.75%), Hansraj College (97.75%), Ramjas (97.25%) and Kirori Mal College (97%).

19-10-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: Night-long Durga Puja pandal-hopping to start today amid sharp spike in Covid-19 cases||Overnight Durga Puja pandal-hopping is expected to start from Monday amid warning by doctors that the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases could spike up to four times after the festive season, if restrictions are relaxed by the West Bengal government. “Revellers can visit puja pandals in the evening from Tritiya to Ekadashi,” West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said while urging pandal-hoppers and puja organisers to avoid crowding. While Tritiya falls on Monday, Ekadashi will be observed on October 27. Durga Puja, the biggest festival in the state, starts from Friday (October 23).However, most of the big pujas in Kolkata and its suburbs have been inaugurated by CM Banerjee herself. The festivities come amid West Bengal reporting a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases since people started shopping for the festive season and crowding around marketplaces. Also Read: Bengal governor Dhankhar gives ‘last warning’ to officials, CM Mamata on law and orderOn Sunday, 3,983 new Covid-19 cases were reported from across the state, including 813 in Kolkata alone. This is the maximum number of viral outbreak cases recorded in the state and the city on a single day. The positivity rate has increased from 6.6% on September 5 to 9.1% on October 18 in Bengal. Social media is flooded with pictures and videos of pandal hoppers in Kolkata and its suburbs.Earlier, the members of Joint Platform of Doctors had expressed concern about an uptick in Covid-19 cases, which could lead to a “tsunami of the viral infection” and might see a four-fold rise in the contagion, and had drawn CM Banerjee’s attention to the disconcerting trend. They had cited the examples of Kerala, where Covid-19 cases had increased after the annual Onam festival, which was celebrated at the end of August.A similar situation was also reported from Spain following the International Women’s Day celebrations and the staging of a football match. Over 37,000 community pujas are being held across Bengal, including more than 2,500 in Kolkata. Around 1,700 pujas are being organised by women in the state. However, the list doesn’t include pujas that are being held in housing societies and individual households. The Calcutta high court (HC) has asked the state government to submit a plan on Monday about how the authorities would plan to curb overcrowding during Durga puja festivities. The HC asked for the plan while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL). The state government has assured the court that the police were working on strategies to control overcrowding at puja pandals and public places. “Face masks have been made mandatory and pandal hoppers are being given hand sanitisers. Volunteers are ensuring that social distancing is being complied with at puja pandals,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary, Forum for Durgotsab, an umbrella organisation of some of the biggest Durga pujas in Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-night-long-durga-puja-pandal-hopping-to-start-today-amid-sharp-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-0i4fHa1xHwbr5OR3TDDQaO.html

Running her stall near St John’s College in Agra for the last 15 years, Bhagwan Devi, a widow, has been catering to mostly rickshawallas and labourers. But, like all other businesses, small or big, her’s too saw a downfall after the COVID-induced lockdown. Even her usual customers are scarce due to the coronavirus threat. Moreover, her’s being a roadside stall, she always faces a threat of being removed from the footpath from where she runs her eatery.Amma says her two sons don’t look after her and that’s why she runs this small eatery to earn a livelihood. “Nobody is helping me. Had somebody been there with me, I won’t have faced this situation. Most of the time, I am asked to leave this place. Where will I go?

19-10-2020||Chandigarh||No rethink on farm laws, but will reach out to farmers again for talks: Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma||Three farm laws, enacted by the Centre, are facing an unprecedented opposition in Punjab. The BJP is the target of both farmers and major political parties. What is your reading of the situation? Our party is absolutely sure that these laws will ensure protection and freedom to farmers to sell their crops and, thus, strengthen their financial position. Moreover, this new system will not, in any way, is tamper with the minimum support price (MSP) and mandis under the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act. Every party in Punjab is opposing these laws due to their personal reasons and political goals. The ruling Congress’s rant is a diversionary tactic on its failure on the lofty promises --- farm debt waiver, jobs to every household, and drug-free Punjab --- it had made before coming to power in 2017. That is why the Capt Amarinder Singh government latched onto the farm laws as a deflector and started instigating the farmers to oppose it. Our former alliance partner (Shiromani Akali Dal) batted for the bills for three months. Their claim they were never consulted is a blatant lie. The core group of both parties in Punjab had threadbare discussions. They (Akalis) praised the draft bills but asked for assurance from the Centre on the MSP and procurement through APMCs. This conversation happened between me and chotte Badal Sahib (Sukhbir Singh Badal). On their insistence, I spoke to Union agriculture minister who sent a letter on assurances within 12 hours. Ideally, both alliance partners should have gone public on this together. But, the SAD chief, in a bid to take the credit, rushed to hold the press conference and revealed the letter. The real problem of Akalis was that they were desperately looking to reclaim the political ground they had lost since the Bargari sacrilege episode. In a bid to bounce back in perception game, Akali Dal did a U-turn on farm laws and pulled out of the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA). The Aam Aadmi Party’s opposition (to farm laws) is also dictated by the realisation that their Punjab base has been shrinking. But, BJP has a firm belief that satya ko pahunchane main der lag sakti hai,par satya kabhi parajit nahin hota (truth can be delayed but it cannot be defeated). Was the state BJP consulted during the discussion on framing of these laws at the Centre? Usually, the Centre consults only the elected stakeholders, and chief ministers of many states were taken on board. Punjab finance minister was also part of that process. Punjab BJP unit was consulted before the Union government brought the ordinances on farm reforms. Since this carried nothing against farmers, there was no reason to raise doubt. Opposition parties are telling farmers that the Adanis and Ambanis will take over their lands and they will be turned labourers. This is a patently false propaganda. Despite assurances by Prime Minister and agriculture minister, farmers are not convinced and are unrelenting on their agitation. Is that a sign of trust deficit between both the sides? I don’t think so. But when three or four people start talking lies and only one person is defending it, doubts are bound to be raised. I’ve no hesitation in accepting we lacked --- I won’t say we failed --- in convincing the farmers on these laws. But I am fully confident that farmers will ultimately see the benefits of the new laws. Right now, our only task is to convince the farmers. Once that is done, those (political parties) opposing it will be knocked out. Right now, it seems like BJP versus farmers. Last week, your cavalcade was attacked. There are reports of ban on entry of your party leaders to villages. I don’t want to make any comment on the farmers’ agitation. Farmer is our anndata, and the Centre is also very serious about his welfare. Many forces and factors are at play in these agitations. ‘Kisan ka tau sirf naam hai, khel rajneeti ka ho raha hai’ (politics is being played in the name of farmers). On their mind are the 2022 assembly elections. Three or four parties are blocking our entries into villages because they see us as a political threat. It’s a big game involving anti-BJP political parties and those linked to Communist ideology. Those obstructing our outreach are the people who want to disturb the hard-earned peace and communal harmony of Punjab. This is very disturbing. Farmers went to meet the Union agriculture secretary for talks. But they walked out as no central minister met them especially when eight of them were holding virtual meetings in Punjab on the issue. Was it not an opportunity lost? Farmers were called by the agriculture secretary, not the minister. The meeting went on for two hours. Farmer bodies submitted two memorandums and issues were discussed in detail. How can this be called a boycott? The secretary even assured to forward their demands to the agriculture minister and seek his response. The Centre’s doors are open. As far as meeting the agriculture minister, we shall make that happen, too. So farmers may be invited again for talks? Why not? Our channels with farmers and the Union government are open. We will again be reaching out to farmers. A seven-member committee of the state BJP led by former minister Surjit Jyani is in touch with farmer unions. How would you pacify the farmers? Sampark aur samvaad se (through contact and dialogue). Some quarters say that national BJP leadership doesn’t appreciate the sensitivities of Punjab. A prominent Sikh face of your Punjab unit who resigned alleged that the party is anti-Punjab. Those who are saying all this want to make Punjab a state what it used to be 30 years ago. They label us not just as anti-Punjab, but even anti-Sikh. But, look at what the BJP government has done to understand how it understands the Punjab psyche: Opening up of the Kartarpur sahib corridor, justice for the 1984 anti-Sikh violence, abolition of the black list of Sikh NRIs, special package for Sultanpur Lodhi, celebration of 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh. Does all this show the BJP as anti-Punjab or anti-Sikhs? The fact is that only the BJP thinks pro-Sikhs, not the Congress. Is there any scope for rethink on farm laws? Rethink will be there if there is anything against the farmers in these laws. There is nothing like that. Yes, if farmers want some addition or deletion, it will also be done on the table, but not on the roads. Farmers should continue their channels of negotiation. The key demand of protesting farmers is that MSP be made a legal right? That has never been so before. The MSP has all along been an administrative order. No political party can dare to end or even touch it. The Punjab assembly will hold a special session tomorrow apparently to pass a bill to nullify the central farm laws. What will be the BJP MLAs stand in the House? The BJP stand firmly in favour of the laws. We don’t have any doubt. How will the end of 24-year-old SAD-BJP alliance impact your party in Punjab? Jo hota hai achhe ke liye hota hai. At one time, BJP used to contest 66 of 117 seats in Punjab. In 1996, for the sake of communal harmony and peace, BJP formed an alliance with Akalis and agreed to contest only 23 seats. Today, the BJP is not what it used to be 10 years back. We have organisation structure in every assembly segment. There is a talk in political circles about that BJP aligning with breakaway Akali factions, including one led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa ? Hum samajik sanstha ya bhajan mandali nahin hain (we are not a charity organisation or a religious group). We are into politics and will welcome any one keen to ally with us. Are you open to Navjot Singh Sidhu’s ‘ghar wapsi’ to the BJP? Sidhu at present is Congress’s problem. It is up to them how to deal with it. Whosoever wants to come is welcome. Let’s wait for an appropriate time. ‘Ye halke halke badal hain, jo thode dino main chhatt jayenge (These small clouds would disappear in coming days). Then, the sun will rise and the lotus will bloom. Chief minister Amarinder Singh apprehends that the tumult over farm laws may be exploited by Pakistan? If the head of any state, who is constitutionally responsible to uphold law and order and peace in the state, will start giving such statements, it only incites people. He should act as a chief minister. Barring a few political parties, nobody wants Punjab’s peace to be disturbed. The central government is alive to the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-rethink-on-farm-laws-but-will-reach-out-to-farmers-again-for-talks-punjab-bjp-chief-ashwani-sharma/story-1e6zieJtt6pDy8BS2nZSvI.html
19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM to introduce Bill to counter Centre’s farm laws on Tuesday as special assembly session begins||The two-day special session of the Punjab assembly convened to introduce a Bill to counter the Centre’s farm laws began on Monday morning with obituary references that included farmers who died during the ongoing agitation against liberalising agriculture.The House was adjourned for an hour after paying tributes to Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu of Tarn Taran, former Punjabi University Joginder Singh Puar, lance naik Karnail Singh, besides freedom fighters Mahinder Singh, Sardar Singh, Rai Singh Patanga and Hemraj Mittal, who passed away recently.The session resumed around noon but was adjourned for the day after adopting a resolution to extend the duration of the special session by a day. On Sunday, the state cabinet authorised chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to introduce the Bill to counter the Centre’s three farm laws. It will be presented in the House for approval on Tuesday.Earlier, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema of the Aam Aadmi Party asked for copies of the Bills to be tabled by the Congress government, particularly the one related to the Centre’s farm Bills.Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala also demanded that the Bill on the farm laws should be taken up on Monday itself as the special session had been convened for the purpose. Thereafter, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings for the day.Defiant Akali MLAs insisted that they be allowed inside the Punjab Bhawan to address the media but police prevented them from doing so.DECLARING PUNJAB ‘PRINCIPAL MARKET YARD’ The chief minister had assured representatives of farmer organisations on September 29 of the Bill to counter the Centre’s laws. The SAD asked the state government to declare Punjab as “principal market yard” for agricultural produce so that the Centre’s laws do not apply in the state, terming it as the quickest and the most effective counter measure. FACTORIES ORDINANCE TO BE TABLED To improve investment and generate employment, the cabinet on Sunday gave its nod for converting the Factories (Punjab Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 into a Bill, to be tabled for enactment in the Vidhan Sabha to amend the Factories Act, 1948. The Bill will facilitate faster settlement of cases and reduction in court action, besides changing the existing threshold limit for small units from 10 and 20 to 20 and 40, respectively. The change has been necessitated with the increase in manufacturing by small units in the state. FARMERS TO MEET ON TUESDAY TO DISCUSS FUTURE COURSE Meanwhile, farmers continued their protest against the farms laws across the state. Devinder Singh, the Amritsar district president of the Kishan Sangharsh Committee, said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had introduce the farm laws to benefit corporates but the farmers would not allow the laws to be implemented in Punjab.“The Prime Minister has brought such laws to benefit his friends Ambani and Adani, but the farmers of Punjab will not let anyone control their land and these laws will not be allowed to be implemented in Punjab. We have expressed our opposition against the laws and have burnt the effigies of Ambani, Adani and PM,” he said. Farmers are meeting on October 20 to discuss the future strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/special-punjab-assembly-session-to-counter-centre-s-farm-laws-begins-today/story-p8m4IdE9Q1d2Ljk0OwIdTM.html

19-10-2020||Chandigarh||Thin attendance as government schools reopen in Punjab’s Malwa amid Covid-19 pandemic||Government schools in Punjab reopened for students of Classes 9 to 12 on Monday after seven months of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Thin attendance was reported from schools in Bathinda, Mansa, Ferozepur and adjoining districts of south Malwa. Most parents are concerned about the safety of their wards and are not keen to send them to school just yet. “Parents are not eager to submit consent letters immediately. Schools lack infrastructure to ensure a seating plan with social distancing. We are waiting and watching. Stakeholders need time to build confidence though preparations are being made to resume school,” said a Bathinda-based parent, requesting anonymity. OPEN ONLY FOR THREE HOURS Of the 1,527 students at Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Bathinda’s Model Town, only 53 students turned up on Monday. Principal Saveen Kiran said parents are slowly approaching the school with consent letters. “Parents have to make plans to drop and pick up their wards as educational institutions are open for only three hours. Students are keen on resuming classes and hopeful that the situation will improve soon,” she said. Another government school at Gobindpur village has 317 students in Classes 9 to 12 but only 52 children attended class on Monday. In Mansa’s Girl’s Senior Secondary School, only 60 of the 1,200 students attended class. SCHOOLS CAN START AT 9AM District education officer Iqbal Singh said that all schools have been sanitised and Covid-19 standard operating protocol (SOPs) are being followed. “Schools are scheduled to open for three hours only after 8.30 am. However, the headquarters has given school heads the relaxation to start school from 9am, depending on the requirement of students,” he said. ATTENDANCE TO PICK UP AFTER HARVEST SEASON School managements in the rural areas of the state’s Malwa region expect to see an improvement in attendance from October-end as students, mainly boys, are engaged in the harvesting of paddy and cotton at present. A principal from a rural school said: “We are not expecting an improvement in attendance for at least two more weeks.” A teacher in Mansa said like parents, teachers also have apprehensions of safety at schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/thin-attendance-as-government-schools-reopen-in-punjab-s-malwa-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-JgYQS55w9iWlX3vAumy2LM.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||Sex workers take to art to survive Covid-19 pandemic||With her wailing toddler in her arms, a 35-year-old woman watches keenly as another woman in a large hall of a school displays how to make bags out of designer paper. “If you pack well, you sell well. You receive a better price for the product,” the trainer tells a dozen women surrounding her.Once these women learn the process, they will fill these paper packets with clay lamps they have artistically painted over the past couple of days.The woman holding the child is desperate to learn this work -- or any work for that matter.Click here for full Covid-19 pandemic“This could be the opportunity I am looking for a way out for the past 12 years. I have to think of an alternative future for my daughter,” says the woman. She is among scores of sex workers from Delhi’s GB Road who are looking for an escape route from the profession, or at least an alternative career until business picks up after the pandemic.And the opportunity may have arrived, thanks to ‘Hunar Jyoti’ -- a joint initiative of the Delhi Police, the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLA) and NGO Naina Activity Educational Society (NAES).“In the first three days, the sex workers are being trained in painting designer clay lamps and making paper packets. Over the next few days and weeks, they’ll be trained to make incense sticks, key rings and work with fabrics,” said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central district).This is not the first time the Delhi Police have attempted to impart vocational training to GB Road’s sex workers. When they did that way back in 2012, only about two dozen sex workers showed interest.This time, Bhatia said, about 200 of them have registered and half of them have showed up for the training. “This time it is also different because the pandemic has left them financially broken and looking for other jobs. They know that due to the threat of infection, the sex work may not be as feasible as before. We are trying to use it as an opportunity to wean them away from sex work,” said Bhatia.The sex workers agreed that this time it is different.During the nationwide lockdown, about 20% of the about 2,000 sex workers employed at the 30 brothels of GB Road had left for their native places, the police estimate. The others were left without any work and had to rely on the police and NGOs even for their daily meals. Customers began coming in from late August and early September, but they are far fewer in number.“Earlier, I would have five-six customers. Now, I feel lucky if I can find one or two. The money I am making right now is barely enough to keep my children going,” said another sex worker who has been working on GB Road for a decade. Even after customers had begun walking in, she had tried to avoid work for fear of getting infected by the coronavirus, but she soon gave in as the need to feed her children took priority over her health.This situation is what prompted her to make it to the training centre that is temporarily operating out of a school at a walking distance from the brothels.The initiative was the brainchild of sub-inspector Kiran Sethi, who according to the DCP, is the first woman officer in-charge of the GB Road police post. “Initially, I got the women to do yoga at a common place. Then we requested a bunch of doctors from AIIMS to carry out a health check-up for them,” said Sethi.But as she gradually made her future intentions clear, she faced resistance, particularly from the brothel-in-charges. “Few of them called me to say that the sex workers wouldn’t be allowed to interact with me. But I was stern and they had no options,” said Sethi.Soon, a make-shift workplace was set up at a nearby school and the NGO NAES pooled in raw resources and trainers. “Training sex workers is a work not many want to touch. Once they are trained, they can do it from the place where they work itself,” said Shiv Kumar Kohli, the director of the NGO.The DSLA, meanwhile, entered the initiative to help the sex workers open bank accounts, procure ration and Aadhar cards, etc.“Since this opportunity may actually prompt some women to give up sex work, we have appointed a legal aide council to cater to them if they face any trouble,” said Neeti Suri Mishra, a metropolitan magistrate and the secretary of DSLA’s central district unit.While the training has been sorted, challenges of selling the products made by the sex workers remain.Sethi said while the lamps will be purchased by the police and the legal community members to begin with, the police are reaching out to the Khadi Gram Udyog, the Dilli Haat and even Tihar Jail whose inmates make and sell such products.The sex workers, meanwhile, saw a ray of hope at a time when they are among the worst hit. “I agreed to attend the first day of the training just out of curiosity. But now I may have some work to do while sitting on the stairs (of the brothel),” said a third sex worker, a 52-year-old woman who has been working here for three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sex-workers-take-to-art-to-survive-covid-19-pandemic/story-iSpneaqDgHZKvCyJRQdFrJ.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||‘Digital’ the buzzword for police in Covid-19 era||In March, when the Capital went into shutdown mode to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Delhi Police suddenly found itself enforcing not just law and order, but also lockdown restrictions, social distancing norms, and the wearing of masks, while trying to ensure its own personnel did not fall prey to the raging virus. It turned, tentatively, to technology to navigate the unknown territory. Six months on, “digital” is the buzzword in Delhi Police. What started with Zoom calls for law-and-order meetings and WhatsApp for sending notices and summons to minimize touch and physical contact, has had a transformative effect on the Capital’s police, with many of its legacy processes and procedures going online.The most significant of them is the replacement of the traditional beat book (a paper diary where a beat officer kept all information and data about his beat) with the e-beat book -- a mobile application, integrated with the existing online data systems such as Zipnet, Dossier, CCTNS (the Crime and Criminal Tracking Networks and Systems), and ICJS (Interoperable Criminal Justice System) that aligns various pillars of the criminal justice system such as e-courts and e-prisons databases. The e- beat book will allow a beat officer to carry out a host of tasks remotely. Also Read | Good cop, bad cop online: Interrogations go digital“The beat is the primary unit of policing, and the e-beat book will empower the beat officer like never before. He can now access the criminal record of a suspect on the spot, without having to take him to the police station. This new tool has face recognition software and all a beat officer needs to do is click his picture and search the database,” said SN Shrivastava, commissioner of Delhi Police. “It will help detect, map and prevent crime more effectively.” According to the latest National Crimes Records Bureau (NCRB) report, overall crime in Delhi went up by 20 percent in 2019, compared to the previous year, including crimes against women. The e-beat book, says Prem Nath, Additional CP, technology and cybercrime, will help record the crime, the criminal, and other relevant data for the beat; provide real-time location of all 1,752 beat officers in the city; and allow online tasks to be allocated to them; apart from enabling them to file various verification reports online.“The moment you fill a form for a tenant or servant verification online, it will come to the beat constable, who can file his report on e-beat book,” said Nath. Delhi Police have rolled out the e-beat book initiative in all districts, having distributed new mobile devices among all beat officers Many of Delhi Police’s registers and diaries -- a legacy of the Raj – also went digital in June. Take for example “roznamcha” (police diary), which is a record of all happenings at a police station, including all the registered FIRs, complaints, arrests, attendance, among other things. It is now digital. Similarly, the Police Control Room ( PCR) register, which maintains the record of all information regarding distress calls marked to that police station as well as complaints and missing person registers, have gone online. “All of this is now being done in digital format on CCTNS, a centralised integrated system of the Union home ministry. During the pandemic, we started sending even court files online,” said Rajan Bhagat, a retired DCP of Delhi Police who is now a consultant in-charge of technology projects. Delhi Police have also introduced an Integrated Complaint Management System (ICMS), which allows people to get a complaint number and track the status of their complaint. “This is to ensure that the public grievance redressal is faster, more transparent, accountable and paperless,” said Shrivastava. Delhi Police, he adds, will soon start online delivery of many other citizen services such as permissions for processions, events, rallies, licensing NOCs, among others. “We will do so through our Tatpar app, where we have amalgamated all citizen services,” said Shrivastava. Most of these digital procedures Delhi Police adopted during the pandemic -- sending summons and bailable warrants on WhatsApp, video conferencing for meetings, virtual examination of witnesses, interrogation of accused, and interactions with victims -- will continue to be an integral part of policing in the Capital, says Shrivastava. “Some of these digital tools have turned out to be very effective, ensuring that the police personnel spend more time on crime prevention duties than travelling to deliver documents,” he said. “Video conferencing has allowed me to personally intervene in many cases. I take both complainants and concerned police officers on the call. We will continue to use it.” Retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Prakash Singh, who served as the chief of Uttar Pradesh and Assam police in 1991-1993 and whose public interest litigation led to the SC passing landmark police reforms in 2006, said, “The pandemic made us look at ways of living/working, we had not thought before. Delhi Police seem to have turned a challenge into an opportunity. Digitisation is the need of the hour. I am not aware about the concept of e-beat book but if what you have said is true then it looks promising. Others should also replicate it. It is a step forwards towards modernisation. A general diary, which is a register that documents every thing at the police station is a nuisance. It came into being because of the mistrust of the police when it was started. It was unnecessary paper work. Moving to virtual summon/interrogation, granting permission online is the best solution today this but one must not forget the importance of meeting complainants in person.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/digital-the-buzzword-for-police-in-covid-19-era/story-ug7GIZ4lj9EepVFNXUChgI.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The quaint circles of Shakti Nagar||It is commonly assumed that nothing exciting ever happens in small towns and villages. At best, the threadbare public life centres around a tree in the square, under which folks might stop to trade some mild gossip.With their malls and multi-storeys, big cities are denied of such charms — rather, dig out your dog-eared copy of R K Narayan’s short stories, set in the small town of Malgudi, to experience the pleasures of such quaint settings.Or, you can make a tour of the circles of Shakti Nagar. The sleepy north Delhi neighbourhood is an enclave of private houses interspersed with teenie-weenie boutiques, one-man tailoring shops and boxy groceries that give “flat 10 percent discount on MRP”. The locality lanes are marked with three roundabouts, each distinguished by a tree, and marooned in the uniqueness of its setting.Start the walk with Alam Chand Chowk that boasts one of the tallest trees in this part of the city. The majestic banyan shoots up far beyond the altitudes of the surrounding residences, as if wanting to slam into the very surface of the sky. Its huge trunk is extensively creased, like hundred of streams running down a mountainside. Portraits of Gods lie by the tree, indicating the veneration it commands in the area. The circle has a small rain shelter, the kind seen in parks. It is decked up with dozens of mooras. A rickshaw puller is drinking water from a filter installed beside the tree. The roundabout faces a couple of shops. Among them, Banga Studio displays romantic portraits of smiling couples, while an elderly man is sitting quietly in Sparsh Confectioners & Stationers.A minute-long wall away lies Dhariwal Chowk. It is more subdued, though with a carefully cultivated wildish look consisting of a central tree surrounded by minor ones—-a board is painted with the gardener’s mobile number. Two cows are loitering beside the fence. On the adjacent Nanku Paan Corner, a sign warns against spitting. An elderly couple in their balcony are intently gazing at Shri Hari Drycleaners, which claims to be an expert in “European Dryclean Service.”The third circle, Choudhury Deepchand Ruhil Chowk, has a graceful peepal. A passerby informs that neighbourhood folks offer prayers under the tree during the early morning hours. A flier slapped on the circle’s metal signage is advertising “PG for boys” with benefits like “RO Water, Friendly Environment, and Walking Distance from Delhi University.”A small maternity hospital lies next to the circle. A woman is sitting at the gate, looking bored, as if nothing ever happens in this part of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-quaint-circles-of-shakti-nagar/story-51tUbPQOijBiYA4HI6rRkN.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi man bleeds to death after liquor bottle pierces thigh||A 25-year-old man was killed after he fell on the ground while being assaulted allegedly by a group of people and a liquor bottle tucked in his trouser’s pocket broke and pierced his thigh in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar on Friday night, police said. Police said the man was attacked after he allegedly used a toilet in a building without permission. The incident was captured in a CCTV camera installed in the lane where the man died, they said.A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code was registered at the New Ashok Nagar police station, said deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh.“We are scanning the CCTV footage to identify the people who assaulted the man,” said DCP Singh, adding that the victim has been identified as Manish Yadav who worked in a vehicle washing agency in Noida.Senior police officer said that on Friday night, Yadav had come to a building to meet his friend, Manish Thakur, who lives there as a tenant. They consumed liquor on the building’s terrace. Around 9.30 pm, Yadav was leaving the building when he saw a toilet on the ground floor and went inside to urinate without asking for permission, they said.A woman living on the ground floor as a tenant raised an alarm after seeing Yadav. Hearing her scream, the building’s owner and some locals reached there and thrashed Yadav following an altercation, said a police officer associated with the probe.According to the officer, the CCTV footage shows four-five men quarrelling and thrashing Yadav, who is seen walking in the lane. The footage shows Yadav coming back and getting involved in a scuffle with them.“During the melee, he fell on the ground on his back. A liquor bottle tucked in the rear pocket of his trouser broke and it pierced his left thigh right above the back side of his knee. It led to excessive bleeding. Yadav was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead,” the officer added.DCP Singh said Yadav’s family was informed about the incident and his body had been preserved in Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital’s mortuary for autopsy. “The autopsy will be conducted on Monday because Yadav’s Covid-19 report is awaited,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-bleeds-to-death-after-bottle-in-pocket-breaks/story-y0GRpRPkI5yOV0PKU0zvqJ.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||Learnings from polio on how to vaccinate 50 million||With several promising experimental coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines likely to be available by early next year, India has begun preparing to immunise 200-250 million people by July 2021. “In the next few months at the most we should have a vaccine and in the next six months we should be in the process of delivering the vaccine to the people of India,” said Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan in his comments at the Annual General Meeting of Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) and St. John’s Ambulance last week. Most of the potential Covid-19 vaccines will have to be given in two doses to offer protection against infection or reduction in disease severity, which would mean that 400-500 million jabs of the vaccine will have to be given within six months. Is this possible? Deepak Kapur, who is Rotary’s National PolioPlus chair for India, said it is achievable. Kapoor, who took over this role in 2001, led a team of volunteers who advocated and supported government to reach marginalized and migrant populations where many children were being missed, which was leading to the wild poliovirus surviving in India. The mammoth effort led to 170 million children getting vaccinated against polio on every national immunization day. “When the polio eradication initiative began, and even towards the end, experts from across the world thought that India may not be able to do it at all, and if it did, it would be the last country in the world to actually do so. But we defied all odds, and despite a huge population, insanitary conditions and a whole lot of other factors like malnutrition, India delivered,” said Kapur. The last polio case was recorded in India on January 13, 2011. And on 27 March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared India polio free, since then no cases of wild polio have been reported for five years. In the week leading up to World Polio Day on October 24, Kapur, who is also a member of India Expert Advisory Group that advises the health ministry on keeping India polio free, is optimistic. “It is possible, it will require a great deal of training in vaccine delivery because the cold-chain has to be adequate, and from what I understand, there are those (Covid-19 vaccines) that are okay at about minus 30-degrees Celsius and those that are okay at minus 70-degrees Celsius. Quite obviously, India will have to go with the ones that can be maintained at minus 30-degrees Celsius because our cold chain is geared to that,” he said. A cold chain is a temperature-controlled supply chain to ensure no vaccine spoilage. Work has already begun in India, which is identifying warehouses and deploying its indigenously developed Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) that digitizes vaccine stocks and monitors cold-chain temperatures to ensure quality and efficacy are not lost to temperature variations. Health centres are geo-tagged and sensors in refrigerators and freezers storing vaccines automatically inform a central database when temperatures change, signalling that the equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. A major learning from polio is to be prepared to rapidly dispel misinformation and rumours that may lead to people refusing to get vaccinated. With misinformation spreading within seconds on social media, quashing rumours must be swift. “Even one or two unfortunate side effects, like fever and pain in injection site, can feed rumours about vaccine safety, leading to refusals in some regions. It happened during the pulse polio programme, and more recently, with measles immunization. We have begun tracking people’s concerns about safety and preparing campaigns to counter false information,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity. Unlike polio drops that were given by volunteers, Covid19 vaccines are injectable and can be administered only by health workers. The public sector cannot do it alone, we need partnerships, like the ones that played a role in polio eradications, tandem to reach vaccination goals. “I believe it must become a people’s movement, with community involvement and door to door outreach. The supply may be there, but unless the beneficiaries are willing and ready to accept immunization, the reach will not be possible. I don’t believe any of these are insurmountable if we go into an emergency preparedness mode right now and lay the groundwork,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/learnings-from-polio-on-how-to-vaccinate-50-million/story-GiGUvLJ4MCtC2Vngc2bvaO.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Death of Cox & Kings general manager: Family suspects foul play; Kalyan GRP to probe case||The Kalyan government railway police (GRP) are probing if there is any foul play in the death of Sagar Deshpande, the general manager of travel company Cox & Kings. On October 11, Deshpande left his Thane home in his car. When he did not return, his father filed a missing person’s complaint with the police. The next day, around 6.30am, an injured man was found on the tracks between Titwala and Khadavli stations. He was rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Kalyan GRP circulated his description among police personnel groups and on Saturday, Naupada police identified him as Deshpande. The police first filed an accidental death report after suspecting it to be a case of suicide. However, Deshpande’s family has raised suspicions over his death. “We sent the body for post-mortem as the family is suspecting a foul play in the case,” said Valmiki Shardul, senior police inspector, Kalyan GRP. The investigating officers have dusted Deshpande’s car for fingerprints to ascertain if he was alone on the day he went missing or if he was accompanied by someone. The four-wheeler was found metres away from the tracks at the railway crossing. “As we have not found any eyewitness in the case, we are leaving no stone unturned,” said a police officer, adding that they are going through the CCTV footage of the cameras installed around the nearby areas. The GRP officers would also take help of the traffic police to obtain the CCTV footage to track the movement of Deshpande’s car after he had left his home on October 11. Deshpande had worked with Cox and Kings for 10 years and had been asked to appear before the Enforcement Directorate (ED). There are allegations that the company had carried out fraud of approximately ₹20,000 crore. Earlier this month, ED had arrested Cox and Kings’s former chief financial officer Anil Khandelwal and internal auditor Naresh Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/death-of-cox-kings-general-manager-family-suspects-foul-play-kalyan-grp-to-probe-case/story-ghHwfNeSNRYwjPRcjQ7yTJ.html

The statement further read that all fresh third-year BCom and BA exams, scheduled to start from October 26, will be conducted online. The second-year Master of Arts (MA) exam will commence from November 2, while the Master of Commerce (MCom) exams will start on November 6. “Practice exams for the same will be held soon,” added the statement.On October 7, close to 9,000 TYBCom and TYBA of IDOL and other MU departments could not attempt their exams owing to “technical glitches”. The contract with the original exam service provider, LittleMORE Innovation Labs, was cancelled after the incident. The university approved a new service provider, Pune-based Splashgain Technology Solutions, on Saturday to conduct the online exams henceforth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/university-of-mumbai-s-distance-education-institute-releases-new-dates-for-online-exams/story-eMJgOcAyiVw0IFNDHUkbDI.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Medical officers in 18 institutes across Maharashtra protest, seek permanent posts||At a time when Maharashtra government is willing to pay lakhs of rupees to private practitioners for treatment of Covid-19 patients, the medical officers (MO) who are already employed with the state government said that despite working round-the-clock, their demand for permanent posts has fallen on deaf ears. There are 453 MOs across 18 medical colleges in the state who have been renewing their contracts every 120 days for basic employment benefits from the past 10 years.On October 15, members of the Medical College Medical Officers Association (MCMOA) held a silent protest by wearing black ribbons at the 18 institutes, seeking the status of permanency. They also wrote a letter (a copy of which is with HT) to the Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) on October 14 on their demands. “There are MOs working on these posts for the past eight to 10 years. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, these MOs work day and night to take care of patients and to help in the administration. If the doctors are regularised, there will be no additional financial burdens but the step will help in strengthening the administration of the government hospitals,” reads the letter.Despite repeated attempts, Saurabh Vijay, secretary, MEDD, did not respond to HT’s calls and messages.An MO with a south Mumbai hospital that despite working round-the-clock since the Covid-19 outbreak in March, he had to request the hospital twice in seven months to renew his employment contract. With 13 years of experience in medicine, he continues to work as a contractual employee. While his colleagues on permanent payroll receive more than ₹1 lakh a month, his salary has stayed stagnant at ₹65,000 as he is not qualified for increments at par with permanent employees.After dean and medical superintendents, MOs hold the most important position in hospitals. Along with the administrative work, they are also responsible for medico-legal cases and provide the first line of treatment to emergency patients in casualty wards. MOs also have to handle Covid-19 and non-Covid patients along with VIP duties.“We don’t have provident funds and pensions as we are on contract. As per rules, we have to stay near our respective hospitals but we are technically not qualified to be lodged in hospital quarters. Every 120 days, we have to request the hospital to renew our contracts, which is quite unfair as we work as much as the permanent employees,” said another MO of the south Mumbai hospital.The state is paying over ₹1 lakh to private practitioners a month for treating Covid-19 patients in government hospitals but are not paying any heed to the demands of their own employees, owing to which MOs are opting for private practice.“Many doctors have been waiting for years to get permanent. In the process, several have quit their jobs, leading to a further dearth in the number of doctors, especially in rural areas. And there are some doctors who have waited so long that due to age limitations, they can’t apply anywhere else,” said a MO with Grant Medical College (GMC), Aurangabad.Until 2010, the health service in the state was run as the department of public medical education. Later, it was bifurcated into public health and medical education departments. Since then, all new MOs who joined in the medical education departments have not been employed permanently. “All the 18 medical colleges and their attached hospitals are tertiary care medical centres. We get the highest number of patients. So many MOs have contracted Covid-19 infections on duty. Despite working 24.7, we aren’t even qualified for the Seventh Pay Commission,” said another MO from Latur GMC. “I have no option but to join private hospitals,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-officers-in-18-institutes-across-maharashtra-protest-seek-permanent-posts/story-kNSfnMW7FVRtdEA7URhWFM.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||First fortnight of October saw 25% rise in Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases, say officials||The city has seen a spike of 25% in Covid-19 cases recorded in the first 15 days of October, as compared to the first fortnight of September. Authorities have attributed the surge to more testing in the city, even as experts have warned that infections could balloon in the upcoming festive season.According to data by the state health department, Mumbai recorded 25,888 cases between September 1 and September 15 but in the first 15 days of this month, it added 32,371 cases. The city’s testing also went up by 20% during the same period. While around 1.62 lakh tests were conducted in the first half of September, the city conducted 1.95 lakh tests in the first half of this month.“The Covid-19 situation in Mumbai is under control, despite relaxing more restrictions and the festival season. However, a large number of citizens do not wear face masks and this can lead to the situation getting difficult in future,” municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Sunday.Earlier this week, Chahal also said that although the number of daily cases has increased, other factors such as mortality, bed availability, recoveries and active cases ratio have improved in October as compared to that in September.“Cases are going up only because we are testing more. In the coming days, BMC plans to augment capacity for testing around 20,000 samples daily,” he had said last month. Currently, Mumbai conducts 15,000 tests everyday. Experts too, have stressed on the need for increased testing. Private health consultant Dr Siddarth Paliwal said, “Within the next one month, there will hardly be any restriction. But as we unlock, the testing has to go up significantly. In a city like Mumbai, we should be testing around 30,000 samples everyday.”Another expert Dr Shashank Joshi, who is the member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, recently wrote in a medical journal, “In order to close the Covid-19 tap, we need to test aggressively and early at the first suspicion or symptom to limit further exposure and transmission by isolation. Only way to truly contain the virus is aggressive tracking and tracing every single contact and ensuring they are supervised and tested.”In September, BMC had said that the Covid-19 situation is unlikely to improve until the end of this year owing to the festivals lined up in the next three months (Navratri in October, Diwali in November and Christmas in December). In August, an increase in the number of cases was witnessed after thousands of citizens thronged to markets ahead of the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. Meanwhile on Sunday, the city reported 1,600 cases, taking the tally to 241,935, while the toll surged to 9,739 after 46 new deaths were recorded. The fatality rate in the city is of 4.02%.Until Sunday, 210,782 patients have been discharged from Covid-19 facilities after treatment, taking the city’s recovery rate to 87.12%. Currently, there are 20,907 active cases. Dharavi, that was previously a Covid-19 hotspot, recorded 17 new cases on Sunday, taking its tally to 3,417. Of these, 2,967 patients have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-fortnight-of-october-saw-25-rise-in-mumbai-s-covid-19-cases-say-officials/story-w7e3XZQYtXY2rEZJH4Lc1O.html

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which operates the monorail, started 30 services, with trains running between 7.03am and 11.24am and 4.03pm and 9.24pm. According to officials, at least five passengers were also asked to go back as they were not wearing a mask. Monorail has made it mandatory for commuters to wear a mask at all times at the stations and in the train. “While one train used to carry 562 people at a time, we are now limiting it to 120 people with alternate seating. We expect the number of commuters to increase from Monday,” said an official from MMRDA. The 19-km line operates between Chembur and Sant Gadge Maharaj Chowk. Meanwhile, the Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL) will start services from 8.30am on Monday. MMOPL will be running 200+ services between Ghatkopar and Versova till 8.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monorail-rides-into-new-normal-mumbai-metro-to-start-its-journey-today/story-GM5B8qDTGOcIp5Tbf4R7LK.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees lowest one-day Covid toll since July 18; tally 1,595,381||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case tally inched closer to the 1.6 million mark as 9,060 new infections took the count to 1,595,381, even as the state reported its lowest one-day toll in 92 days with 150 deaths. The state on July 18 had reported 144 deaths.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 toll on Sunday reached 42,115, as the average number of daily deaths in October went down to 303, from 403 in September and 309 in August. Of the 150 fatalities reported on Sunday, 46 were in Mumbai, taking the city’s toll to 9,785; 14 in Nagpur; nine each in Pune and Satara. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.64%. Mumbai on Sunday reported 1,600 new cases, taking its tally to 241,935.With the drop in daily caseload over the past four weeks, the last 100,000 cases are expected to be reported in 10 days. The previous 100,000 cases were reported in eight days. In September, 100,000 cases were reported in just five days on two occasions. However, the state machinery is wary of a surge in cases by the end of November amid the onset of winter coinciding with more curbs lifted and the ongoing festival season.Following Mumbai, the state’s second capital Nagpur clocked 1,315 new cases, Pune 824 (369 in city, 279 in rural parts and 176 in Pimpri-Chinchwad) and Ahmednagar added 344 infections. While cases in the rest of the state were on a decline, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) kept to its high share of cases in the total state tally by adding 34.56% or 3,132 cases on Sunday.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned citizens about a potential second wave if social distancing and personal hygiene protocols were not strictly followed. Thackeray said on Sunday that the battle against Covid-19 is at a turning point and Covid-appropriate behaviour by citizens will play a crucial role in avoiding a potential second wave. “It is up to the people of the state to decide whether they want the second wave or they adopt the protocol of mask, physical distancing and sanitisation. The mask will play the role of vaccine until it is available to fight the coronavirus,” he said, while inaugurating an apheresis unit for plasma therapy at a district hospital in Ratnagiri.On the state expecting a surge in cases by November-end, a senior official from the health department said, “Two weeks after major activities have been opened up in the state, we have witnessed a surge in cases. We expect a similar rise in the next few weeks as a result of the unlocking rolled out in the first week of the month. The surge, however, would not be as high as in the first two weeks of September, when we saw daily cases at an average of 20,354. The virus is very unpredictable and the projections about its behaviour and infection curve have gone wrong across the globe. The surge, however, depends upon how seriously Covid precautions are followed by citizens.” Maharashtra tested 70,336 samples in the last 24 hours with a positivity rate of 12.88%, though the overall positivity rate of the state stands at 19.6%. The recovery rate is reported to have touched 85.86%, after the number of recovered patients touched 1,369,810 on Sunday. There are 1,82,973 active patients, including 39,845 in Pune.State has 2,412,921 people under home quarantine, while 23,384 are institutionally quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-lowest-one-day-covid-toll-since-july-18-tally-1-595-381/story-9dcuLMsh1HSfIcimn6m6yO.html

But, his application was dismissed and he returned to Australia via Nepal.“During investigation, we found that the accused came to India via Nepal due to the look-out circular. He stayed at the house of his parents in Sangrur and returned to Australia after his bail plea was denied by court,” said ASI Hardev Singh, who is investigating the case. Therefore, his parents, Jugraj Singh and Charanjit Kaur, residents of Mehrana Khurd village, Sangrur, were booked under Section 212 (harbouring offender) of the Indian Penal Code.In her rape complaint, the woman had alleged that she met Parminderjit in 2015. He had raped her after promising to marry her and also duped her of Rs 20 lakh on the pretext of taking her to Australia. Later, he got married to someone else and left for Australia. A case in this regard was registered at the Daba police station in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-booked-for-harbouring-fugitive-on-the-run-in-rape-case/story-RrQ1cTyWY40SxxY1BkDeGP.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||No labs, innovation best tool for science teachers in Mumbai||Teaching basic and conceptual science without access to laboratories has emerged as a challenge for teachers in schools and colleges across the country as classes move online. As the Covid-19 pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown, schools and colleges moved to an online mode of instruction. However, explaining concepts in science without stepping into an actual laboratory has become equally difficult for teachers and students. “The initial few days of online teaching was tough for all of us. The science teachers were tried to figure out ways and means of teaching concepts to students in a manner that they could understand,” said Kshama Valanjoo, assistant headmistress, VPM’s Vidya Mandir High School in Dahisar. The challenge has pushed teachers to innovate in their teachings by using visual aids. For example, science teachers at Valanjoo’s school used videos and diagrams. “While some laws in physics were explained with the help of videos and diagrammatic representations, teachers also used available resources like dry cells to demonstrate some simple experiments from their homes,” said Valanjoo. The school has also allowed teachers to carry a few science apparatus at home for teaching purposes. At Kandivli’s Children’s Academy school, teachers have started using simulation platforms to demonstrate experiments to students. “We had started exploring the idea even before the pandemic. There are several simulation-based resources that explain concepts in science in a very interesting manner. These platforms can be used by teachers in online classes and students can be asked to try out the experiments post class,” said Nikita Mukhopadhyay, research associate (physics) at Children’s Academy. The school has also delivered STEM kits to students of Grade 3 to 10. “The kit consists of some ‘do it yourself’ activities for students to understand the concepts in science easily,” said Sheela Mallya, school principal. While private schools managed to innovate, municipal schools in Mumbai, which are struggling to get students to attend online classes, have a different set of troubles. “Every three months or so, we take our students on field trips to Vidnyan Bhavan in Sion to show them various models in science. Students also get hands-on learning experience as there are several interactive models. This year, however, we could not do any of that. Some of our students are unavailable for online classes too. So, our teachers try to send them short videos of basic experiments which they can watch. We have also distributed them worksheets through their parents,” said Suman Patil, principal at Ayodhya Nagar Municipal School in Chembur. Meanwhile, engineering and technology institutes, including Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), have adjusted their curriculum and deferred all laboratory courses that require physical presence to the next semester. Only computer-based practical classes are being conducted but with limited success, said teachers. Engineering colleges are adopting animations and virtual lab simulations as teaching aids. “In some cases (very few), animations or demonstrations are being used [to teach concepts]. In a regular semester, these animations are used in addition to hardware laboratories with live experiments. While these videos help, they are not very effective for learning remotely, especially if students are not getting hands-on experience,” said Shantanu Roy, dean, academics, IIT-Delhi. Virtual labs is an initiative of the ministry of education, government of India, to provide remote-access to labs in various disciplines of science and engineering. Teachers said that while the labs have aided instruction, they could not replicate actual experience of a lab. “In general, in engineering and sciences, a lot of learning happens in laboratories by physically doing experiments. It is difficult to replicate that experience online,” said Roy. Connectivity is just one of the challenges in teaching online, said Varun Bhalerao, assistant professor at the department of Physics at IIT-Bombay. “It’s important to have a good rapport with the students and understand their situation, and decide how busy to keep them,” he said. Bhalerao heads a team of researchers working on Growth India—the country’s first fully-robotic telescope. “There was no point pining for a lab that you could not visit. The only solution to this was to redefine our goals,” wrote Bhalerao in a recent article in a series titled ‘Academics Post Covid-19’ hosted by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The solution was to shift focus to long-term activities such as wrapping up ‘almost complete’ papers and reading review articles. “We shifted the focus of every group member from their primary project to a closely aligned data analysis project,” said Bhalerao in the article. While teachers are rising up to the challenge, students face a myriad of difficulties ranging from lack of connectivity, poor infrastructure and absence of peer groups. Usually, videos, animations and simulations are used as auxiliary tools to live teaching, which is the primary mode of instruction. “This semester, the primary mode of instruction is missing and only auxiliary tools are available to us. Lectures are pre-recorded and circulated,” said Pranav Jeevan P, a PhD scholar from IIT-Bombay. “For researchers, it is the environment around us that matters the most while doing research work. Usually, we work in isolated academic spaces with very little distractions. That safe space is missing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-labs-innovation-best-tool-for-science-teachers-in-mumbai/story-a4GNju5VtbQI0whADJ31uO.html
19-10-2020||City||Three brothers, auto driver murder Ludhiana man, dump body in canal||Police have booked three brothers and their aide for allegedly murdering a 45-year-old disabled man whom one of them owed Rs 20,000.One of the brothers and their aide have been arrested, and have confessed to killing the victim, Charanjit Singh, and dumping his body in a canal near Khanpur village, Dehlon, on October 2.Divers have been pressed into service to locate the victim’s body that has been missing for 16 days.The arrested accused have been identified as Veeram Singh, alias Bittu, of Mohalla Basant Nagar and Simran Singh, an auto-rickshaw driver, who lives in the same locality. Veeram’s brothers Gurdit Singh, alias Panchi, and Dapinder Singh, alias Gagan, remain at large. The matter came to fore after Baljit Singh Malra, a Congress worker and resident of Mohalla Guru Nanak Nagar, approached the police, stating that Charanjit, a resident of Gian Chand Nagar, Lohara, was missing since October 2.Baljit stated that he went to Charanjit’s house on October 7, but found it locked from outside. Later, Narinder Singh, a friend of Charanjit, told him that he had met the latter on October 2. He had dropped him at Veeram’s house, where Veeram and his brothers thrashed Charanjit over some monetary issue. Later, they took him somewhere in Simran’s three-wheeler.“When I confronted Veeram, he refused to have met Charanjit on October 2, following which I filed a police complaint,” he added.Baljit alleged that Veeram had borrowed Rs 20,000 from Charanjit on September 20 and promised to return the money in 10 days. But, he refused to pay back later.“On being apprehended, Veeram confessed to having thrashed Charanjit when he came to his house to recover his money on October 2. Later, Veeram and his brothers took Charanjit to the canal near Khanpur village in Simran’s auto-rickshaw. There, the four accused stabbed him with sharp-edged weapons and bludgeoned him with bricks to ensure his death,” said inspector Pavittar Singh, SHO, Daba police station. They dumped the body in the canal and fled the spot. Divers are trying to locate the body. The Daba police have also contacted other police stations to find out if any body was fished out from the canal after October 2.“All four accused have been booked under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. We will add murder charges in the FIR after recovering the body,” the inspector added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-brothers-auto-driver-murder-ludhiana-man-dump-body-in-canal/story-NV4UBgUxZr8KfKI1LcgjEN.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||JoSAA’s first seat allotment list out: Computer science in IIT-Bombay remains toppers’ first choice||The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay has once again attracted a large chunk of top rankers, according to the first seat allotment list released by Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) on Saturday. Information shared by IIT-Delhi, the admissions authority this year, shows top ranks in most categories chose the four-year computer science and engineering course at IIT-Bombay (IIT-B). The total intake capacity of 23 IITs stands at 16,053, up from 13,583 in 2019. Officials have attributed the increase in seats to the supernumerary seats added across institutes in order to accommodate women students as well as those under the 10% economically weaker section (EWS) quota. Apart from IITs, JoSAA also looks into admissions to National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) and other Government Funded Technology Institutes (GFTIs), so the total intake capacity for all these institutes stands at 50,822 this year. “All seats, except 128 seats across IITs, NITs, IIITs and GFTIs, have been allotted in the first round itself. These remaining 128 seats too will be allotted in the upcoming rounds and the aim is to ensure zero vacancy across institutes,” said professor Sidhartha Pandey, organising chairman, JEE Advanced 2020. This year, JoSAA will conduct six seat allotment rounds instead of seven, in order to complete the admissions process before Diwali. Similarly, due to Covid-19, students will be virtually reporting to their allotted IITs to complete the admission process this year. “We have received quite a few queries from students confirming admission online and we are helping everyone possible,” added Pandey. This is the third year that all institutes have kept aside supernumerary seats for women students and IIT-Bombay alone has 156 seats under this category this year, as opposed to 96 last year, that have been allotted to excess number of students, in case some students don’t opt for the seat. Admissions to IITs depend on the Joint Entrance Examination-Advanced (JEE-Adv) scores of students, results for which were declared on October 5. Of the 1.50 lakh students who had appeared for the exam, 43,204 were declared eligible for admissions through JoSAA this year. IIT-Delhi lowered the bar to allow more students from all categories to make it to the ranking list and eventually avoid seat vacancy across institutes. The cut-off for the general category has been reduced to 17.5% from last year’s 25%, while that for scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) is 8.75%, down from last year’s 12.5%. The qualifying score for the general-EWS and OBC-NCL categories is at 15.75% this year, lower than the 22.5% last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/josaa-s-first-seat-allotment-list-out-computer-science-in-iit-bombay-remains-toppers-first-choice/story-QDe9x3Ie2mo6sGBPx5kM2O.html
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra leaders survey districts hit by floods||While Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar toured some of the flood-affected districts from western and central Maharashtra on Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, leaders of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar will start tour of the districts from Monday. Harvest ready crops of soybean, sugarcane, cotton and pulses on more than seven lakh hectares have sustained massive losses due to the heavy rain and flooding in Osmanabad, Solapur, Parbhani, Latur, Sangli and Satara from October 13. The incessant rain has also claimed lives and damaged houses as well as other structures. Pawar visited a few villages in Solapur and Latur, the two districts which saw substantial crop losses due to the heavy rain over the past few days. The NCP chief also announced he would lead a delegation of members of parliament (MPs) from ruling parties in Maharashtra to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand a relief package for the farmers who suffered losses. “A drought affects crops, but torrential rain hits crops and the agricultural land as the surface run-off leads to soil erosion. It is a long-lasting loss for farmers and will take years for the soil quality to be restored. The crisis will have effect on the agricultural economy of the state. The state will help farmers, but it has its own limitations. The Centre can lend a helping hand,” he said. Wadettiwar faced the wrath of the farmers during his tour of Nanded district, as they shouted slogans demanding immediate relief. Former MP and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana chief Raju Shetti too has demanded immediate relief from the state. He has also written to PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah to deploy NDRF teams to survey the losses. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh and social justice minister Dhananjay Munde too visited villages in Nanded and Beed, respectively. The Bharatiya Janata Party, whose MP Sambhaji Chhatrapati toured Osmanabad district, slammed the state. “The leaders from the ruling parties have been demanding a relief package from the Central government. The first responsibility of immediate financial aid lies with the state government. While in power, our government had released relief funds immediately in case of such calamities,” said Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil. He also taunted chief minister Uddhav Thackeray saying it is because of their criticism that the CM stepped out of his house for the first time, to visit the flood-affected villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-leaders-survey-districts-hit-by-floods/story-mUPsHQnBF23tcEcGD9BAcN.html

One of the accused died in a hospital during treatment on Sunday night within hours of being paraded on streets in Jabalpur, the police said.The accused murdered the boy on Friday, within 24 hours of the kidnapping. The kidnappers claimed part of the Rs 2-crore ransom after playing the boy’s recorded voice over the phone during a call for ransom made to the transporter, said the police. The arrested accused include Rahul alias Monu Vishwakarma, 30, who died during treatment at the hospital; Malay Rao, 25, and Karan Jaggi, 24 - all residents of Maharajapur locality under Adhartal police station in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. They looted a mobile phone from a man before executing their kidnapping plan. The accused told the police that they killed the boy as he had identified one of them. Additional superintendent of police Gopal Khandel confirmed the death of accused Rahul alias Monu Vishwakarma. However, he didn’t give details.Also read: Delhi doctors defer strike over salary, cite inconvenience to patientsAditya, son of Jabalpur transporter Mukhesh Lamba, was a class 7 student and was kidnapped when he went out on Thursday evening to purchase chips from a nearby shop. His dead body was found in a canal near Bichhua village under Panagar police station, about 15 kilometres from the district headquarters, on Sunday morning. Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur, Siddharth Bahuguna said, “The accused, Rahul alias Monu Vishwakarma, Malay Rao and Karan Jaggi, told the police during the interrogation that they committed the crime to repay loans and get rid of financial constraints. Rahul and Karan both face several criminal cases including theft, loot, attack, among others.”The police officer said, “After identifying their target, the accused started with the recce of the transporter’s house which continued for several days. When they spotted the boy alone returning from the grocery shop on Thursday evening, they stopped their car and asked him about his father’s address as plan of their crime. They asked the boy to accompany them to his father’s house. After kidnapping the boy, they first made a call to the boy’s mother and then to his father to demand a ransom of Rs 2 crore.”The officer said, “The kidnappers drove around in Panagar area the whole night and even stayed at a dhaba where they had dinner and also offered food to the boy. On Friday morning, they stayed in a vacant house near Rahul’s house in Maharajpur locality. In the afternoon, they hired a car and took the boy to Kundam Badhraji locality in rural area. When they stopped at a dhaba to have some snacks, the boy recognized Rahul and told him that he had been to his (boy’s) place whereupon the accused hatched a plan to kill him.”“Before killing the boy at Jalgaon under Panagar police station, they asked the boy to say “papa jaldi aa jao (papa, come soon)” and recorded his voice on a mobile phone which they later played over the phone when they demanded the ransom again at 8 pm on Friday. When Mukesh Lamba said he could have arranged only Rs 8 lakh, the kidnapper who made the call asked him to keep the money in a bag and drop it on Sihora bypass road near Khajari-Khiriya village by 9.30 pm to get his son back safely. Mukesh did the same but boy was not to return as he had been murdered by then.”The police officer said, “the accused were arrested on Sunday on a tip-off from informers and with the help of technology. It was on their information during the interrogation that the dead body of the boy was recovered from the canal and Rs 7.66 lakh of the ransom money was recovered. They have been booked under various sections of the India Penal Code (IPC) for charges including kidnapping and murder.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/police-arrest-3-for-kidnapping-and-murder-of-jabalpur-transporter-s-son-one-dies/story-QD2hDcv9w9aJkyfiPSUunL.html

They will now be able to get the property registered in their names, a CHB official said.The process for the 160 two-bedroom flats, allotted under the self-finance scheme of 2010, has begun, and forms, checklists and applications can be downloaded from the CHB website.The lock-in period for the scheme is five years and the conveyance deed is done only after that. The two-bedroom flats in Sector 51 were allotted by the CHB in 2015, which means the lock-in period ended in February 2020. “The work was delayed due to the pandemic. Apart from this, most of the CHB staffers were also engaged in pandemic-related duties,” the official said.“CHB has already approved two such deeds,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/allottees-of-chb-s-sector-51-flats-can-now-get-conveyance-deeds/story-4jIlMjU7zOOVayYLvhK6WK.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||After a delay of seven months, north MCD sends ‘incomplete’ sets of textbooks to schools||Seven months into the academic session, a large number of students enrolled in schools run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation are still waiting for their textbooks, senior officials have told HT, a delay that has further disrupted a session where several students are struggling to access classes online. Further, officials at some schools, where textbooks arrived last week — after more than half the academic session is over — alleged that they have received incomplete sets of books. The south and the east municipal corporations have already distributed books among students enrolled in their schools. However, schools run by the north civic body are still found wanting in this regard.The north MCD runs over 700 schools, where around 350,000 students are enrolled.The principal of a north MCD school in Kirari said a majority of their students do not have access to online education, and in the absence of textbooks, have largely been left out of the learning entirely this session. “Parents of most of our students are daily wage workers, which is why they do not regularly collect worksheets for their children from the school. If these students have textbooks, they will at least read or write something at home. If this continues, I fear it will be really difficult to get them back to the classrooms when schools reopen,” said the principal, who asked not to be named.To bridge the existing digital divide, schools run by the state government and civic bodies have been providing hard copies of assignment sheets to students who do not own the requisite electronic devices.Several principals said their schools received textbooks last week, but not for all classes. The principal at a north MCD school in Jahangirpuri said they have not received books for classes 4 and 5. “How are you supposed to teach students using just worksheets? They need books. The books for classes 1 to 3 arrived after seven months, and now we don’t know how much time it will take to get the renaming sets of books,” the principal said.Despite several attempts, north MCD Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti did not respond to texts and calls requesting comment. North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said the delay was down to the prevailing situation and a lack of funds. “We have now started sending textbooks to the schools. We have already sent some books to schools of at least five zones. The schools who received half the books will get the remaining sets in the coming weeks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-a-delay-of-seven-months-north-mcd-sends-incomplete-sets-of-textbooks-to-schools/story-AzMgCpSbGbqP8OgeXiKjTO.html
19-10-2020||City||Admissions under second cut-off to begin today, students can now withdraw or cancel their admission||New Delhi: Delhi University colleges will begin the process for admissions to seats vacant across several undergraduate courses under the second set of cut-offs from Monday. The university on Sunday said students, who did not take admission despite applying and meeting the eligibility criteria in the first list, will no longer be able to apply for the same course in the same college. While addressing students’ queries during a webinar on Sunday, dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said, “Students who applied and did not take admission despite meeting the eligibility criteria in the first cut-off will not be allowed to enrol in the same course and college under the second cut-off list. The second cut-off list is for those who could not meet the eligibility criteria in the first list, or did not apply in the first list due to any reason.” However, she added that this condition wouldn’t apply in case the second cut-off percentage in a particular course in a college is the same as it was in the first cut-off.The second cut-off list released on Saturday saw eligibility scores drop marginally, between 0.2 and 1 percentage points, with seats in several popular courses like English (Hons), BCom (Hons), and Economics (Hons) still up for grabs in several colleges.Applicants who applied in the first cut-off and had their admission approved by the principal of the respective college, but did not pay the fees and now want to get admitted under the second list, will first have to withdraw their admission, varsity officials said. “They will have to pay the withdrawal fee of ₹1,000 to confirm the withdrawal and then re-apply. Similarly, applicants, who applied in the first cut-off and paid the fees but now want to take admission in another course or college in the second cut-off, will have to cancel their admission and restart the process,” Bagai said on Sunday, adding that a cancellation fee of ₹1,000 will be applicable in the latter situation.“The option for cancellation or withdrawal is now available on the candidate’s admission portal and they won’t be allowed to select it more than once. Applicants who had applied in the first list but their application not approved by the principal will be considered as fresh applicants,” she added.Suman Kumar, a member of the University’s admission branch, reminded the students not to visit the university or any college in person, due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. “They can call or send their queries on the numbers or email addresses as given on the university website,” he said. Of 70,000 available undergraduate seats in colleges across the varsity, 35,500 have been filled under the first cut-off list this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/admissions-under-second-cut-off-to-begin-today-students-can-now-withdraw-or-cancel-their-admission/story-Yd7Uclkw9LlqlKVBVvEE5N.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality improves, but stays poor||Delhi’s air quality improved marginally on Sunday, but remained in the ‘poor’ category, with the overall air quality index value of 254, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) daily bulletin. Delhi’s AQI on Saturday was recorded at 287 on Saturday. Levels of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) and PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) also saw a downward trend during the day. Also Read: Share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution likely to increaseCPCB data showed that the PM 2.5 level went down from 127.5ug/m3 at 4am on Sunday to 108ug/m3 at 7pm. A similar trend was seen in the levels of PM 10, which dipped from 280ug/m3 at 4am to 243ug/m3 at 7pm. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said air pollution has remained “in control” over the last few days because of high wind speed over the city. “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from the west with wind speed of up to 12 kmph with the skies remaining mostly clear on Sunday. On Monday, the predominant surface wind is likely to blow from from southeast/northwest direction of Delhi with wind speed of up to 10 kmph, sky may remain clear and mist is likely in the morning,” read the bulletin by ministry of earth sciences’ air quality early warning system, Safar. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recordings also showed that 1,230 farm fires were spotted over the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana on Sunday. However, the impact of this mass burning on PM 2.5 levels over Delhi was 17%. “Wind speed is likely to marginally improve for the next two days leading to relatively better dispersion. But, AQI is predicted to stay in the higher-end of ‘poor’ to the lower end of ‘very poor’ categories for the next two days,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-air-quality-improves-but-stays-poor/story-SgeY0usPtHNDhyntHR40yN.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||Puja festivities already muted, immersion one more concern||The clay idols are done, but something else has been keeping Subir Pal busy for the past week — consulting his clients on how to immerse the idols once rituals are over. Pits of various sizes need to be dug, depending on how large the idols are, and with space at a premium, Pal, who sculpted the idols, is the best person for the job.A professional idol-maker, Pal said he has helped several organisers create artificial ponds – with tank volumes ranging from 400 cubic-feet for Sarojini Nagar Kali Mandir to 1,960 cubic-feet for the organisers in the Uttara Swamimalai Mandir in RK Puram.With Durga Puja celebrations allowed in the Capital, but subject to a strict set of safety protocols in the light of Covid-19, most organisers in the city have decided to keep the fanfare to a minimum. The riders put in place by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) include prohibition on all kinds of fairs, food stalls, exhibitions, rallies and processions. Additionally, masks must be worn mandatorily, gatherings have been limited to ensure social distancing. All visitors must also be thermally scanned before entering the venue, and all proceedings will be recorded on video, and reports submitted to a nodal officer appointed to check potential violations.Several organisers have decided against idols of deities at their venues this year. However, the ones who decide to place idols, they will have to arrange for immersion on their own, the district administrations have said — as a precondition for issuing no-objection certificates (NOC), several organisers and government officials told HT.The idol immersion ritual is scheduled for Friday.Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “The decisions were taken considering safety protocols concerning the Covid-19 pandemic. Durga Puja celebrations have been allowed with the precondition of certain safety precautions, and those have to be adhered to. People’s safety is our priority.”In Delhi, idol immersion in the Yamuna and natural water bodies is prohibited, under recommendations of a committee set up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). “It should not be much of a problem, because most organisers who are celebrating with idols have limited it’s height to five feet. A limited space in the localities for immersion will do,” said Debashis Saha, chief coordinator of the Durga Puja committee at Matri Mandir in Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave.There are over 500 Durga Puja celebrations in the Capital every year, according to records of the government’s revenue department, which conducts inspection of venues and arrangements jointly with the police before an NOC is issued. In 2019, Delhi had recorded all idol immersions in artificial ponds for the first time. While around 50 prominent organisers in the city had arranged for idol immersions in their own venue or open spaces in close proximity, the other 550-odd organiser had immersed the clay idols in 115 artificial ponds of different sizes created by the government across the city.“Own arrangement for artificial ponds has been set as a pre-condition for an NOC this year. Those organisers who do not have ample space are likely to face difficulty in case they have decided to have idols,” said Robin Bose, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee in Kashmere Gate.The idol immersion process often includes a procession involving trucks, cars, two wheelers and around 50-100 people, depending on the scale and prominence of the organiser. “Immersion rituals can lead to gatherings and violation of the DDMA conditions. So, organisers will have to do it in their own venue or locality and ensure proper social distancing,” said a government official who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/puja-festivities-already-muted-immersion-one-more-concern/story-YngsgteAnfAVDJM56xOolO.html
19-10-2020||City||Zirakpur SHO sent to police lines over ‘false’ rape case||Zirakpur station house officer (SHO) Gurwant Singh has been shunted to the police lines following a complaint that he falsely implicated two Mumbai-based men in a rape case. An inquiry has also been marked against him by Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh.Superintendent of police (SP, rural), Ravjot Kaur Grewal, who has been entrusted with the inquiry, said, “The SHO has been shifted to the police lines so that he does not hamper the probe. I will be submitting my report to the SSP in the next two days.” As per information, the FIR against the two Mumbai-based men was registered at the Zirakpur police station on September 27. The complainant in this case had told the police that she was fond of acting and was informed by a friend that two people had come from Mumbai for casting in a TV serial. She was also reportedly told that one of them had even done editing for the popular show, ‘Bigg Boss’. Following this, the woman, along with her friend, allegedly went to meet the duo at a hotel. She claimed that after her friend left, the duo served her drinks laced with sedatives and raped her. The men named in the FIR, however, alleged that they do not know the victim and have never met her.When contacted, the investigating officer in the case, sub inspector Vandana Rani said, “I was told to take the victim’s statement and register an FIR but I handed over the case to some other person.” As per sources, SHO Gurwant Singh had asked the IO to register the case as he had got directions from the SP (detective) to register the case.When contacted Mohali SSP Satinder Singh said, “A probe is underway and I will let you know soon.” Another senior police officer in Mohali said, “All rape cases registered during the tenure of SHO Gurwant Singh need to be verified, so that, no innocent is implicated in any false case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/zirakpur-sho-sent-to-police-lines-over-false-in-rape-case/story-p5FdxyqpZzgpXzI7m7Y8LL.html
19-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi struggles to control garbage burning||Every winter, residents of Kirari in northwest Delhi wake up to a think blanket of smoke enveloping the entire area. It is mostly because of open burning of piles of waste every evening. This year too, complaints have already started pouring in and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has slapped the North Delhi Municipal Corporation with a fine of Rs 1 crore for its failure to control these fires, which are one of the major local contributors to air pollution in Delhi. “During a surprise inspection we found that the garbage was being burned beside the main road since morning and no official action was taken by the local municipality against the burning,” said Gopal Rai, Delhi environment minister. Local residents said many open spaces along the main road have become a dumping site for local waste and every now and then someone lights these piles on fire, enveloping the entire area in a grey blanket. Rekha Rani, a resident of Kirari Harijan Colony, said that sometimes the fire rages so wild that the flames and the resultant smoke can be seen from several kilometres away. “You will see garbage dumped in any open space that is available here and every other day you find it lit up. During winters, eyes start burning and it becomes difficult to breathe,” Rani said. Experts have also pointed out that as Delhi faces its annual winter air pollution emergency, curbing open waste burning could prove to be proverbial Achilles’ heel. Data provided by Delhi Fire Services (DFS) control room shows that between September 15 and October 15, 127 complaints of open waste burning were received from across the city. Officials attending these calls said that some of these fires had turned unmanageable. In fact, over the last ten days five major garbage fires were put off by fire fighters. On Sunday, the DFS received calls about 28 such fires. On October 11, a vacant plot near the Ashram intersection saw a major fire, which took over two hours to control. Similarly, on October 15, a fire was also reported from northeast Delhi’s Bhajanpura, DFS officials said. DFS chief, Atul Garg said, “DFS teams have been actively contributing to pollution control measures in the city. Apart from controlling the frequent garbage fires, our teams have also been sprinkling water on the roadside and open spaces to control dust.” Kripal Singh Ranawat, a shop owner near Bhajanpura police station, said waste collection and management is a major problem in these areas and some of the privately employed waste collectors often dump waste on road sides and on open plots and set it on fire. “Pillars of flyovers and boundary walls are coated with soot, so if the agencies do not believe us they can see this as proof of how frequently burning happens in these areas,” Ranawat said. DPCC control room data also shows that over the last 10 days, teams had to intervened at 52 places where open garbage burning was spotted. Officials said that while monitoring teams are on-ground monitoring such burnings, they are also relying heavily on complaints being received from resident welfare associations (RWAs) and the general public. “Our teams are also patrolling areas in the night because waste is usually burnt at night,” said a senior DPCC official. In Dwarka, residents complained that vacant plots have been turned into dumping grounds and despite repeated complaints to the pollution control agencies and the local municipalities, waste burning continues. “Garbage burning is common in Dwarka and in its surrounding areas. The (Winter) season has begun and the government must set up a 24×7 helpline for reporting garbage burning to control pollution. It normally happens in vacant DDA (Delhi Development Authority) plots,” Karamvir Anil Parashar, activist and resident of Dwarka tweeted, along with pictures of smoke emanating from garbage fires. Experts agreed that waste management is an area where authorities need to work harder. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said waste management can be tackled with strict enforcement. “Waste burning is an offshoot of the larger problem of waste disposal and management. Agencies will need to step-up action not just during winters but all year long in order to control this,” said Roychowdhury. A senior official of the north corporation said that the agency is doing its best to control cases of open burning in their areas. “While you can take prompt action against other polluting sources, preventing waste burning is difficult. The action in such a case is taken afterwards when the damage is done. What we can do is douse such fires immediately to prevent any further damage. Complete control can only come with awareness and cooperation from the public,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-struggles-to-control-garbage-burning/story-wfqsN68ODsoRi8SzlzT1UM.html
19-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Property sales record steady rise since May||Noida: Property sales in Gautam Budh Nagar have started gaining momentum as the district stamps and registration department generated a revenue of ₹130 crore last month. However, the department is far behind its revenue target for the current financial year, officials said.While the department had not registered any property in April due to the Covid-induced nationwide lockdown, it has witnessed a steady rise in its revenue since then.“The department’s revenue was zero in April. In May, June and July, we collected ₹12 crore, ₹60 crore and ₹110 crore, respectively as stamp duty. The trend indicates that the property registration is improving. In August and September, we collected ₹116 crore and ₹130 crore, respectively, which shows an upward trend,” said SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general (registration), Gautam Budh Nagar. Tripathi said that the department has collected ₹80 crore from October 1-16. “We hope to generate a revenue of ₹150 crore in October,” he said. However, the officials said that people mostly come for sale and purchase of small properties these days. “We have not got any application for registration from significant developers,” Tripathi said.The UP government has given ₹3,148-crore revenue target to the GB Nagar registration department for the financial year 2020-21. The target appears difficult to meet as the department has so far collected only ₹508 crore till Mid-October, the officials said.Tripathi said that there are six sub-registrars’ offices in GB Nagar. “The number of property registrations has increased in the past two months. All the six registration offices usually perform around 8,000 registries per month,” he said. The officials said that 73 e-stamp vendors have been given licence to sell stamps in the district. “We have found that so far only 58 stamp vendors are actively involved in the work. We have asked the other vendors to sell the stamps or their licence may be cancelled,” Tripathi said.PPS Nagar, a city-based lawyer who facilitates property registration, said that the lockdown had affected the property sales in the district. “There were some instances in March-April when sale and purchase deals were fixed, but registry could not be done due to the lockdown. Now, these people are coming for registration of their properties,” Nagar said.For the past four years, the department has not been able to meet the target due to slump in the real estate industry. In 2019-20, the department had collected ₹1,856.48 crore against the annual target of ₹2,597 crore, while in 2018-19, it had collected ₹1,879 crore against a target of ₹2,552 crore. Similarly, in 2017-18, the department had collected ₹1,685 crore as stamp duty, falling short of its target of ₹2,232 crore, while in 2016-17, the revenue collected was ₹1,761 crore against a target of ₹2,222 crore, as per the official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-property-sales-record-steady-rise-since-may/story-s94nfomxMYsnQaVG42AGUJ.html

Many principals have decided to reopen schools in two shifts and the same room will not be used for both shifts. Also, benches, tables, window and door handles will be sanitised everyday after the end of each shift.Principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Dhandari Khurd, Ujjalveer Singh, said, “The school will be sanitised tomorrow. We have received no funds from the state education department and if required, we will utilise amalgamated funds to purchase thermal guns and sanitisers. Students have been asked to report in two shifts and soaps have been kept in washrooms. Sanitisers will also be put outside classrooms. The teachers of Classes 6 to 8 will make sure students follow all safety norms and teachers of Classes 9 to 12 will take classes.”Principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Punjab Agricultural University, Sanjeev Thapar, said, “We have purchased 10 hand sanitisers and soaps have been kept in washrooms. The school has been properly sanitised twice by municipal corporation staff. We have received no financial aid and are managing with welfare funds as safety of students and staff is our top priority.” Schools can use amalgamated funds to purchase items, follow SOPsDistrict education officer (secondary), Swaranjit Kaur, said, “The schools have received no funds specially to sanitise the premises or follow other Covid safety norms. But, they can utilise amalgamated funds to purchase sanitisers, soaps and thermal guns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-financial-aid-ludhiana-govt-schools-left-in-the-lurch/story-dduh8LD40t18dMsIXjBulO.html

Demers, said in the Justice Department statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-six-russian-intelligence-agents-over-destructive-cyberattacks/story-JsSYXsJpBV9cViRHV0qVWN.html
19-10-2020||World||What is the China-Taiwan divide and US’ role in it?||According to defence observers cited by the South China Morning Post, the presence of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been increasing in China’s Southeast coast as it prepares for a possible military invasion of Taiwan. Just in the past one month, a lot has happened with talks about China invading Taiwan and other military provocations; Washington’s help to Taipei and Beijing’s beefing up of coastal forces.A brief history of Taiwan Taiwan has enjoyed de-facto independence since the end of the civil war in 1949 in which the losing Kuomintang faction fled to Taiwan and its leader Chiang Kai-shek established a self-rule with hopes of retaking mainland China. But gradually in the late 1980s, Taiwan moved to becoming a democracy. The economy is highly export oriented and the per capita GDP is extremely high as well. Their excellent response to the coronavirus pandemic further improved their global status. Presidential election and Tsai Ing-WenIn presidential election held in January this year, Taiwanese voters re-elected incumbent president Tsai Ing-Wen in a landslide election with 57.13 per cent of the votes. This upset Beijing as Tsai defeated her opponent Han Kuo-yu whose party promotes closer ties with Beijing. This month, Time magazine put Tsai on its 100 most influential people list and after its Hong Kong dilemma, Beijing has been irked by the changes in Taipei with President Xi asserting that “reunifying” Taiwan with China is his focus even if force is required to do the same. Also Read: Chinese aggression, censorship brings India and Taiwan closer, says reportPresident Xi Jinping’s reasons for Taiwan pushGaining “lost” territory, reduced support among Taiwan’s public for China, rise of Hong Kong like pro-independence sentiment in Taiwan, wanting the world to recognise “One China” policy and Washington’s increasing ties with Taipei are all reasons for President Xi Jinping’s bellicose moves in Taiwan. US’ role in TaiwanThe US is Taiwan’s most important friend and ally even though in 1979 President Jimmy Carter ended diplomatic recognition of Taipei. Taiwan Relations Act passed by the US Congress promises to supply Taiwan with defensive weapons and any attack by China on the island is considered very serious by USA. For decades, the US has sold weapons to Taiwan and this week, the White House moved forward with drones and missile sales to Taipei. The increasing hostility between the US and China over the past years has resulted in Washington being closer to Taipei, thus playing a major role in the divide between Taiwan and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-the-china-taiwan-divide-and-us-role-in-it/story-blygr7f8vJMY8sJc2IqfKJ.html
19-10-2020||World||Dr Jajini Varghese, Indian-origin oncoplastic surgeon honored Outstanding Young Person 2020||Dr Jajini Varghese, a UK-based Indian-origin plastic surgeon, has been named an ‘Outstanding Young Person of the World 2020’ by a non-profit NGO for her “incredible” scientific contributions to diagnosing and treating breast cancer. The 39-year-old Consultant in Oncoplastic Breast Surgery at Royal Free Hospital and University College London is one of 10 nominations from the UK for the international award, which honours outstanding young people under the age of 40 every year from across 110 countries for extraordinary accomplishments in various fields. Varghese has been recognised in the “Medical Innovation” category for making it her personal mission to attempt to restore the lives of millions of women affected by breast cancer and will be presented with the award at a ceremony at the 2020 Junior Chamber International (JCI) World Congress in Yokohama, Japan, in early November “Cancer will not defeat. We aim to restore people and lives. I can only search for the answers and heal the external scars but ultimately only God can heal the mutilations caused by breast cancer,” said Varghese. “I am only an ordinary individual with an extraordinary urge to succeed and to alleviate suffering. I count excellence as the eventual result of a continual striving to do better. I count myself fortunate to be healthy, to love what I do and to be able to help others,” she said. Based in London with her husband and two children, the young surgeon traces her roots to Muttom Haripad in Kerala where her parents George and Jolly Varghese live. In the UK, she is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Plastic Surgery (FRCS) and a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS). She is also on the Board of Examiners for the MSc in Plastic Surgery at University College London (UCL). After graduating with a first class in medicine from India, Varghese became one of the few doctors to be awarded the Cambridge Commonwealth Full Scholarship to the University of Cambridge to complete her MPhil and PhD on the “Genetics of Breast Cancer”. Thereafter, her research has been to identify susceptible women with high breast density and to find out their genes associated with breast cancer. This led to the discovery of the ZNF 365 gene, associated with breast cancer, in collaboration with Harvard University and the Mayo Clinic, which was published in several academic journals including ‘Nature Genetics’. This genetic mutation, which confers a higher risk in the carriers, is now used in microarrays worldwide to identify women with a genetic predisposition for early detection, prevention and prophylactic treatment of breast cancer. JCI, a global leadership organisation which provides personal and professional development opportunities to young leaders aged 18 to 40, praised Varghese for adopting strategies to prevent breast cancer by offering early screening for women in developing countries. “With medical advances, many women live beyond the initial diagnosis of breast cancer. Her current work focuses on providing women as normal a body as possible following this procedure through extensive reconstructive oncoplastic surgery,” JCI notes. Varghese’s work has won her other awards, including the top prize at the Association of Breast Surgery Conference and UK Radiology International Congress. The medic refers to herself as “a timid woman of small stature” in quite a male-dominated arena of plastic surgery. She currently lectures on the UCL Athena Programme, encouraging women to take up a surgical career, and has mentored several doctors to hold leadership roles in their chosen fields. “Availability of health care should be a universal and a basic right,” she said. To address the need for doctors in rural areas of India, Varghese was instrumental in setting up EMET Scholarships in India 17 years ago, offering help for Indian medical students who at the end of their education are asked to spend up to two years in an area of India lacking medical care. During her free time, she is a trained Indian classical dancer and painter and has been recognised in those fields too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dr-jajini-varghese-indian-origin-oncoplastic-surgeon-honored-outstanding-young-person-2020/story-9gHAX1ink6gYNy1m42HDYO.html
19-10-2020||World||Virgin Atlantic to start flights to Manchester from Mumbai, Delhi||British premier carrier Virgin Atlantic, which had announced the launch of flight services from India to Manchester, which has a sizable population of Indian origin people, will start from October 20. Virgin Atlantic is delighted to announce it will be launching services from Delhi and Mumbai to Manchester as the airline ramps up flying from its home in the north of England, a release said. Flying three times a week from Mumbai to Manchester, beginning in December, and twice weekly from Delhi, starting in January, these new services will go on sale from October 20 and will complement the airline’s existing services from Mumbai and Delhi to London Heathrow, it said. The airline will operate one of its newest and fuel efficient aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, on these new routes, the release added. Erstwhile carrier Jet Airways used to fly to Manchester, the UK’s third-largest airport by passenger volume, connecting Mumbai with the northwest city of England. However, since its collapse in April 2019, the destination remains untapped from India. Besides flying passengers, Virgin Atlantic will also offer a fast cargo service presenting new opportunities for companies looking to export and import goods such as fresh produce, pharmaceuticals and textiles between prime markets in the UK, US and India, the airline stated in the release. “We’re delighted to launch new flying from our home in the north in Manchester. India boasts the largest foreign-born population in the UK and we’re anticipating that post Covid-19, the demand to travel home to visit loved ones will increase,” Virgin Atlantic Chief Commercial Officer Juha Jarvinen said. Following the relaunch of services from Heathrow to Mumbai and Delhi in September, these new services from Manchester represent Virgin Atlantic’s continued investment in India, he added. With over 16 million Indians living outside the country and 5,00,000 living across the north of England, India has the world’s largest diaspora, Virgin Atlantic said. “We are excited to welcome passengers onboard Virgin Atlantic services from Delhi and Mumbai to Manchester for the very first time. Manchester is our home in the north of England and is positioned as a fantastic hub for onward travel,” said Alex McEwan, Country Manager for India at Virgin Atlantic. These new services will open up over 1,30,000 seats between India and Manchester and the airline aims to respond to the large, fast-growing demand to visit friends and relatives as well as capturing demand for business and leisure travel to the region as global economies gradually recover from the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, Virgin Atlantic said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virgin-atlantic-to-start-flights-to-manchester-from-mumbai-delhi-tomorrow/story-bB5ckVzkWWp3qiKYbP5mKO.html
19-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Florida begins early voting, no major problems reported||Floridians began early voting in much of the state Monday with no serious problems reported as the Trump campaign tries to cut into an early advantage Democrats have posted in mail-in votes in the key swing state.Many polling sites had long lines before dawn as voters awaited their opening. One county had to close an early voting sites after the elections supervisor and an employee tested positive for the coronavirus and another county had its website go down.In Miami, Aldo Rodriguez, 62, lined up early and waited in heavy rain to cast his ballot for Democrat Joe Biden over President Donald Trump. He said he wanted to make sure his ballot for the former vice president gets counted.Biden “knows pretty much how the country was running and hopefully he’ll get it back the same way it was,” Rodriguez said. “No fighting against any colors or races, we are all the same. ...We shouldn’t have this bickering.”In Orlando, some voters cast their ballots at the arena used by the NBA’s Magic, where coach Steve Clifford assisted poll workers. The NHL’s Tampa Bay Lightning’s arena and the NFL’s Tampa Buccaneers stadium are also being used as early voting sites as sports teams around the country have been encouraging turn out.“I felt like I was a player. I just had to make the right decisions,” said Anton Versch, 30, after he cast his ballot for Trump. Versch, who works in the pharmaceutical industry, said his main issue is “freedom,” particularly of speech and the right to bear arms.“We should be able to do the most that we are allowed to do, as long as we aren’t infringing on anybody’s rights or liberties,” Versch said.With 29 electoral votes, Florida is crucial to both candidates but especially Trump, who moved his official residence to his Palm Beach estate Mar-a-Lago from New York last year. A Florida loss would make it nearly impossible for Trump to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to retain the White House. The state typically has close elections, most notably in 2000 when Republican George W. Bush defeated Al Gore by 537 votes after a recount.California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, will visit Orlando and Jacksonville on Monday to encourage her party’s voters to cast early ballots. Trump will visit Florida on Friday after visiting last week.Under state law, counties can offer up to two weeks of early voting and many do, including Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and other population centers. Large counties offer multiple sites and all counties allow those who have received mail-in ballots to drop them off. The latest a county can start early voting is Saturday. The final day is Nov. 1.About 2.5 million mail-in ballots have already been cast, with Democrats returning 1.2 million and Republicans about 758,000 as of Monday. Non-affiliated voters and third-party members make up the rest. The number of mail-in votes is approaching the 2.7 million cast in 2016 when Republicans had a 70,000-vote margin on returns. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the state by about 113,000 votes. No Republican has won the presidency without winning Florida since Calvin Coolidge in 1924.Florida Republicans say they aren’t worried about the mail-in gap, believing any advantage Biden gets will be swamped by Trump supporters casting in-person ballots starting this week and on Election Day. They believe Democrats are “cannibalizing” their own votes — moving in-person voters to mail-in without increasing their overall support. They point to their increased voter registration, which narrowed the Democrats’ lead to 134,000, down 327,000 four years ago.Political strategist Steve Schale, who runs the pro-Biden super PAC “Unite The Country,” said Monday that Democrats shouldn’t get comfortable.“Republicans are going to get their vote out,” he said.While Florida Republicans have historically outperformed Democrats in mail-in voting, Schale said Trump’s criticism of the practice has crippled his party’s Florida mail-in effort — even though he has praised his adopted home state’s system.“Trump basically decided to take a match and just torch 20 years of Republican work down here,” he said.In Orange County, the home of Orlando, the elections supervisor’s website was unavailable Monday morning because of a problem with its domain. Supervisor Bill Cowles said there was no issue with hacking, and it didn’t impact voting.In the Panhandle, Okaloosa County Elections Supervisor Paul Lux announced that he and an employee had tested positive for the coronavirus. That resulted in the closure of the early voting site at the county’s main office, but four other sites remained open. The Republican-dominated county has approximately 150,000 voters.___AP reporters Mike Schneider in Orlando and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee and photographers Lynne Sladky and Marta Lavandier in Miami contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-florida-begins-early-voting-no-major-problems-reported/story-vjjz0vDYOFgMv0hVvcoVFK.html
19-10-2020||World||US election 2020: Economy, unemployment and the impact on polls||America has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Being the worst-hit country, its economy has taken a plunge. Though some experts have predicted its revival, one of the major indicators - unemployment rate - has many in the US alarmed. The US unemployment rate dropped to 7.9 per cent in early October. According to the country’s Labour Department, employers added just 661,000 jobs in September down from 1.5 million in August and 1.8 million in July. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits has reached 898,000. In contrast, China’s economy is recovering with 4.9 per cent growth between July and September and it is now leading the global recovery post the coronavirus pandemic. So what exactly is happening in United State’s economy and how could this impact the upcoming presidential elections?What is happening in America’s economy?The US economy is showing signs of a significant slowdown with experts saying that the recovery is reaching a “plateau”. Monthly job gains, consumer spending and factory output are decreasing overall. As US’ coronavirus numbers continue to rise, experts believe that it will be difficult to manage the economic slowdown. While the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic has been lifted in some states, many services like travel, live entertainment and indoor dining are still functioning with a very limited capacity. Moreover, consumer spending habits have also changed due to the pandemic and job recovery depends highly on the increase in demand for goods and services. Experts believe that the initial expectation of a V-shaped recovery is far-fetched for now as its rate is very slow. The recovery is also said to be very uneven, the result being that billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have continued to thrive despite the pandemic. What is President Trump’s response to the economy?The current unemployment numbers are the worst job losses that any American President has faced in an election year since the Second World War. From the beginning of his presidency, President Trump has touted the US economy in various speeches and tweets and on the campaign trail as well he continues to talk about a V-shaped recovery in the economy. A new stimulus bill is also impending with President Trump proposing a $1.8 trillion relief package. What is Joe Biden’s response to the economy?Former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden is continuously talking about the impact of unemployment on poor Americans and is focussing on increasing the existing social programmes as his solution to the economic slowdown. His strategy to improve the economy, if he becomes the President, is through the ‘Build Back Better’ plan focussed on the New Deal which promises to create clean jobs via infrastructure and clean energy improvements.Will the economy be a major issue for the 2020 presidential election? Yes, economy is a major issue for the 2020 presidential election and the contrasting positions of the presidential candidates are of interest to the voters which is exactly why Biden has continued to target President Trump on the economy. In 1992, campaign strategist James Carville coined the phrase “It’s the economy, stupid” and this shaped Bill Clinton’s victory in the elections. Thus, the economy could end up being a major factor on which voters pick their President on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-economy-unemployment-and-the-impact-on-polls/story-MoJ3eOib9LZX07eQqnqv1L.html

19-10-2020||World||John Oliver now has a sewage plant named after him||Comedian John Oliver made a secret trip to Connecticut last week to help cut the ribbon on a sign naming a sewage treatment plant in his honor.Danbury’s City Council voted earlier this month to rename the sewage plant “The John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant,” following a tongue-in-cheek battle that began with an expletive-filled rant against the city on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” in August.Mayor Mark Boughton responded to the attack by posting a video of himself at the sewage plant saying the city was going to name it after Oliver “because it’s full of crap just like you, John.”Oliver offered to donate $55,000 to local charities if Danbury actually followed through with the idea.Oliver shared a video of the ribbon-cutting on his show Sunday. During the ceremony, he wore a homemade protective suit, which appeared to be made from a white plastic trash bag, with rubber gloves and a see-through plastic helmet.“This place takes the worst that humanity can produce, and transforms it into something that we can live with,” Oliver said. “And now more than ever, there’s something inspirational in that, because at the end of this awful, awful year, what could be more important than evidence that, if we want to, we can come together, overcome our differences and sort our s—- out.”Boughton said Oliver’s promised donations have helped spur local fundraising efforts for area food banks that could end up collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars to feed needy families.He said the ceremony was kept private as a public health precaution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/john-oliver-now-has-a-sewage-plant-named-after-him/story-tM4VJpw8mXwZOMzeMS4fMN.html
19-10-2020||World||French police operations underway after beheading of teacher||France’s interior minister said Monday that police operations are underway into dozens of people who allegedly issued messages of support for the attacker after the beheading of a history teacher near Paris.Gerald Darmanin said on French radio Europe 1 that at least 80 cases of hate speech have been reported since Friday’s attack.Samuel Paty was beheaded in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, northwest of Paris, by a 18-year-old Moscow-born Chechen refugee, who was later shot dead by police. Police officials said Paty had discussed caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad with his class, leading to threats.French President Emmanuel Macron held a defense council on Sunday at the Elysee presidential palace. The government will reinforce security at schools when classes resume on Nov. 2 after two weeks of holidays, Macron’s office said.French President Emmanuel Macron met with Paty’s family on Monday morning, the French presidency said.Macron will also meet with the members of France’s leading Muslim organization, the French Muslim Council, or CFCM, later in the day.A national homage is to be held for Paty on Wednesday.Players, coaches and referees at high-level soccer matches this weekend will wear a black armband in a tribute to Paty. The French league said in a statement Monday that a minute of silence will be observed before kick-off at all professional matches in leagues 1 and 2.Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered on Sunday across France in support of freedom of speech and in memory of the slain 47-year-old teacher.French authorities said they detained 11 people following the killing.Darmanin said they include the father of a student and an Islamist activist who both “obviously launched a fatwa,” or religious ruling, against the teacher.A man who said he was the father of a student had posted a video on social media asserting that Paty had shown an image of a naked man and told students it was “the prophet of the Muslims.” He called on other angry parents to contact him, and relay the message.Darmanin said authorities were also looking into about 50 associations suspected of encouraging hate speech. Some will be dissolved, he said.The president of the Conference of imams in France, Hassen Chalghoumi, said “we are hurt, we are condemning this barbaric act,” on French news broadcaster BFM TV. “Samuel is a martyr of freedom.”“Barbarism has no place in schools nor elsewhere in France,” he said.Chalghoumi, who is an imam in Drancy, a suburb northeast of Paris, said he had received death threats and insults on social media from radical Islamists in recent days.Justice authorities opened an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive. At least four of those detained are family members of the attacker, who had been granted 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March. He was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun, which fires plastic pellets.Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said a text claiming responsibility and a photograph of the victim were found on the attacker’s phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-police-operations-underway-after-beheading-of-teacher/story-PNnL7gZJYbh6tL5muixMqJ.html
19-10-2020||World||Thai authorities seek to censor coverage of student protests||Thai authorities worked Monday to stem a growing tide of protests calling for the prime minister to resign by threatening to censor news coverage, raiding a publishing house and attempting to block the Telegram messaging app used by demonstrators.The efforts by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s government to drain the student-led protests of support and the ability to organize comes as they have grown in the capital and spread around the country, despite an emergency decree, which bans public gatherings of more than four people in Bangkok, outlaws news said to affect national security and gives authorities broad power to detain people.The mostly young protesters have gathered en masse across Bangkok the past six days to push their demands, which also include a controversial call for reform of the monarchy.The protesters charge that Prayuth, an army commander who led a 2014 coup, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution written and passed under military rule is undemocratic.But their more recent demand for checks and balances on the monarchy has deeply angered conservative Thais — and broken a taboo since the monarchy is considered sacrosanct and tough laws protect it from insult. It has also raised the risk of confrontation in a country where calls for political change have a history of being met with military intervention or even violence.Authorities are now increasingly turning to censorship to try to clamp down on the demonstrations after protesters heckled a royal motorcade last week in a once unthinkable scene.With protesters starting to gather for three new rallies in Bangkok on Monday evening, a top official with the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission confirmed reports that the agency had been ordered to block access to the messaging app Telegram. Suthisak Tantayothin said it was in the process of talking with internet service providers to discuss doing so, but so far the encrypted messaging app favored by demonstrators the world over was still available in the country.Police also searched the office of a publishing house that handles books by Thai and foreign scholars with sometimes controversial perspectives. Same Sky publishing house said police took away copies of three titles that had been sold at a recent book fair in a bundle it called Monarchy Studies, and asked their publisher to come for questioning at their station.Deputy police spokesman Kissana Phataracharoen also confirmed an order signed by the chief of police that could allow officials to block access to news sites that give what he called “distorted information.”Under existing laws, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society are empowered to ban broadcasts and block internet content. Police themselves can also do so under the emergency decree, which went into effect October 15.Kissana spoke after a leaked copy of the censorship request circulated on social media. The order calls for blocking access to the online sites of Voice TV, The Reporters, The Standard, Prachatai, and Free Youth, and removing their existing content. It also proposes a ban on Voice TV’s over-the-air digital broadcasts.All the outlets have been broadcasting live coverage of the protests. Voice TV and Prachatai are openly sympathetic to the protest movement, and Free Youth is a student protest organization. As of Monday, none had been blocked. At least one local cable TV provider, however, has been censoring international news broadcasts during their segments on the Thai protests.The Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand said it was “deeply concerned” by the censorship threat, adding that it “makes the government appear heavy-handed and unresponsive to criticism, and could stir up even more public anger.”“Bona fide journalists should be allowed to report important developments without the threat of bans, suspensions, censorship or prosecution hanging over them,” the club said in a statement.Despite the spread of protests outside the capital, Prayuth, the prime minister, told reporters the state of emergency will remain only in Bangkok for now.In addition the emergency decree making protests illegal, authorities have also tried in vain to keep people from gathering by selectively shutting down stations on Bangkok’s mass transit lines. It has also warned that it will take legal action against those who promote the protests on social media, including by taking photographs there or checking into them on social media apps.Despite that, protest-related hashtags remain the most used on Twitter.Prayuth said Monday that the government is open to an extraordinary session of Parliament to seek a solution to the current situation. It was not clear when that might be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-authorities-seek-to-censor-coverage-of-student-protests/story-jly1jSXW9WfeBikaZ7N3MP.html
19-10-2020||World||Pak oppn claims police chief was ‘kidnapped’, made to order arrest of Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law||The Pakistan opposition is crying foul over the ‘arrest’ of former premier Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law, saying a provincial police chief was kidnapped by paramilitary forces and made to register cases against him and 200 others.Muhammad Safdar Awan, the husband of Maryam Nawaz, Sharif’s daughter and vice-president of his PML-N party, was arrested hours after she took part in the second major rally of the newly-formed joint opposition front Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) in Karachi on Sunday night.Maryam tweeted on Monday morning: “Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt Safdar.” The retired captain and 200 others including Maryam were reportedly booked for sloganeering inside the mausoleum of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah a day earlier, and thus violating its sanctity.Later on Monday, PDM leaders claimed at a press conference in the Sindh capital that the province’s Inspector General (IG) of Police Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar was kidnapped by the paramilitary Rangers Force along with his deputies and forced to order the arrest of Safdar.The Rangers swung into action after the provincial government refused to bow to pressure from the Imran Khan government to take action against Safdar, they claimed.PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman told the media that police then broke into the hotel room of Maryam Nawaz and took away her husband. Prominent journalist Hamid Mir also tweeted: “Unfortunate incident. Sindh Govt informed PML-N leader Muhammad Zubair that IG Sindh was kidnapped by Rangers at 4 in the morning he was brought in sector commander’s office where addnl IG was already present and were forced to issue the orders for the arrest of Cpt Rtd Safdar”.Ali Zaidi, maritime affairs minister in Khan’s government and a Karachi native, rejected the opposition’s allegations as “nonsense”.“If this is true then CM Sindh must fire IG Sindh or resign himself as his orders were followed,” he tweeted.So far, no announcement has been made by the government regarding Safdar’s arrest.Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), had hosted Sunday’s protest rally. The police action reportedly came after Khurram Sherzaman, a member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Party, lodged complaints against Maryam and Safdar at a police station in Karachi.PTI leaders were reportedly angered by “slogans raised at the mausoleum” targeting Khan’s administration. Video clips circulating on social media apparently showed Safdar and several others chanting slogans against Pakistan’s government and its military leadership, from the inner circle of the mausoleum.Political activities are banned inside the mausoleum and its immediate surroundings.Earlier on Sunday, Maryam, Safdar and PML-N supporters had visited the mausoleum to offer prayers ahead of the PDM’s rally that was held in Karachi’s Jinnah ground, located near the mausoleum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-claims-police-chief-was-kidnapped-made-to-order-arrest-of-nawaz-sharif-s-son-in-law/story-z79lCQ8lumGvHKPhWKV4WN.html

A case [should be] registered against him for raising political slogans inside the mausoleum complex, death threats against me and for damaging government property,” according to the complainant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-s-son-in-law-arrested-in-pakistan/story-laAX7QUR0kedCpa7OVOyoI.html
19-10-2020||World||Taiwan Diplomat Hurt in Scuffle With China Officials in Fiji||Chinese diplomats injured one of their Taiwanese counterparts during a scuffle in the South Pacific earlier this month, a senior Taiwanese official said, highlighting rising concerns over Beijing’s aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy.Two uninvited diplomats from the Chinese embassy in Fiji were asked to leave an event celebrating Taiwan’s national day in Suva on Oct. 8 after they were seen photographing other guests, Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Harry Tseng told lawmakers in Taipei on Monday.When confronted by Taiwanese officials, the Chinese diplomats initiated a physical confrontation, leaving one staff member from the Taiwanese representative office in Fiji needing hospital treatment for a head injury, Tseng said.Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it called “provocative wolf warrior diplomacy” as a violation of rule of law and civilized behavior, a reference to Chinese diplomats who have taken an increasingly assertive stance on social media in advocating for Beijing’s policies. A ministry spokesperson told Bloomberg News by text that the injury was a “mild concussion.”“We strongly condemn the violence against our diplomat in Fiji by China’s uncivilized ‘wolf warriors,’” Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter. “Taiwan is a force for good in the world & we won’t be intimidated.Diplomatic FightChina Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday that the allegations had “no facts” and that Taiwan was “playing victim here.”“Any attempt to sow discord between China and Pacific Island countries using the Taiwan issue will not succeed,” he told a daily briefing in Beijing.The Chinese embassy in Fiji said in an earlier statement that a Chinese diplomat had been injured when staffers from the Taipei Trade Office in Fiji “acted provocatively,” and asked local police to investigate.Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry objected to China’s “untrue statement” about the incident, saying it was an attempt to “muddy the issue.”“We can’t let China bully its way into doing whatever it wants,” Taiwanese lawmaker Wang Ting-yu tweeted. “Our diplomats in Fiji have my full support.”Diplomatic BattlegroundThe incident in Fiji is particularly sensitive as the Pacific is one of the major battlegrounds for diplomatic influence between Beijing and Taipei. After the Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched ties to China in quick succession in 2019, the U.S. stepped in to shore up support for Taiwan in the region, urging Taipei’s last four remaining allies not to follow suit.While governments around the world are becoming increasingly concerned about China’s more strident approach to diplomacy, Taiwan has long been on the receiving end of it. China’s Communist Party -- which claims the democratic island as part of its territory despite never having ruled it -- has steadily increased its diplomatic and military pressure on Taipei.Aircraft from China’s People’s Liberation Army repeatedly encroached into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone in recent months, twice crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait -- which for decades stood as a tacit border between the two sides. China has also steadily whittled away formal recognition of Taiwan in the international arena, leaving Taipei with just 15 official allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-diplomat-hurt-in-scuffle-with-china-officials-in-fiji/story-hq3Ai95uritlhbNz4NjSnN.html
19-10-2020||World||UK church leaders warn Boris Johnson govt over key Brexit bill||Five influential leaders of the UK’s Anglican churches on Monday warned the Boris Johnson government that a new Brexit bill currently going through parliament would set a “disastrous precedent” since it would allow ministers to break international law.The controversial Internal Market Bill could not only violate the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the Johnson government with Brussels last year, but also strain trading relationships between the four constituents of the UK: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Interventions by leaders of the Church of England on pressing issues of the day are influential, given the context of the long history of the relationship between the church and UK parliament. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, the bishops of London, Durham and Winchester and 21 other bishops sit in the House of Lords.The bill was passed in the House of Commons in September and was due to be debated in the House of Lords on Monday. The government defended the bill on the ground that it is needed as a ‘safety net’ in the post-Brexit trade arrangements.The five leaders wrote to Financial Times: “We are taking the rare step of writing together because the decisions implemented in this bill will profoundly affect the future of our countries and the relationships between them.” “The bill represents a profound shift in how trading relationships within the UK will be regulated and governed…The bill is, of course, not just concerned with domestic law. It currently asks the country’s highest lawmaking body to equip a government minister to break international law”. They added: “This has enormous moral, as well as political and legal, consequences. We believe this would create a disastrous precedent. It is particularly disturbing for all of us who feel a sense of duty and responsibility to the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement — that international treaty on which peace and stability within and between the UK and Ireland depends.” The letter was published ahead of the UK’s complete exit from the European Union on December 31, with little prospect of a trade deal in the post-Brexit future. Preparations for Brexit have added to the challenges of the government grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic.The church leaders added: “The UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol with the EU to ‘protect the 1998 Agreement in all its dimensions’. One year on, in this bill, the UK government is not only preparing to break the protocol, but also to breach a fundamental tenet of the agreement: namely by limiting the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland law.” “If carefully negotiated terms are not honoured and laws can be ‘legally’ broken, on what foundations does our democracy stand? We urge lawmakers to consider this bill in the light of values and principles we would wish to characterise relationships across these islands long after the transition period”. The letter was signed by John McDowell, Archbishop of Armagh, Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, Mark Strange, Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, John Davies, Archbishop of Wales, and Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-church-leaders-warn-boris-johnson-govt-over-key-brexit-bill/story-l6GaD6kpEtq3YTdz4ioueJ.html
19-10-2020||World||Two-week lockdown in Wales from Friday as UK cases surge||The Wales government announced a two-week ‘short, sharp’ lockdown from Friday to break the cycle of transmission of Covid-19, as the number of new cases continued to surge in the UK and other European countries.Calling it a ‘firebreak’, first minister of the Labour-led Welsh government, Mark Drakeford, announced on Monday that for the two weeks, everyone will need to stay at home. All businesses will be shut. The only exceptions would be workers engaged in critical services. As of Sunday evening, the UK recorded 16,982 new cases–more thrice the daily peaks in April and May–and 67 deaths. Overall, there have been 57,690 deaths and 722,049 cases in the country.Calling the lockdown a ‘short sharp shock’, Drakeford said: “There no easy choice in front of us as the virus spreads rapidly in every part of Wales. If we do not act now, it will continue to accelerate. Most starkly of all, even more people will die from this deadly virus.”Wales has already banned people from parts of England currently in Tier 2 and Tier 3 alert levels from entering. Liverpool and areas around Leicester are currently under the highest Tier 3 alert level, with Greater Manchester expected to follow due to surge in new cases.Manchester mayor, Labour politician Andy Burnham, has resisted attempts by the central government in London to place the area under Tier 3, which would involve closing businesses and adding to the economic woes of the region. He has demanded more financial support.Communities secretary Robert Jenrick said on the Manchester impasse: “Delay I’m afraid will only make the situation worse, will only put people’s lives at risk, and will only make the economic fallout for the city worse in the long term.”“We do now need to take action. I hope that we can reach agreement but one way or another, we need to draw this to a conclusion,” he added, days after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he may need to intervene if local leaders did not agree to Tier 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-week-lockdown-in-wales-from-friday-as-uk-cases-surge/story-1Yhwoz9jJrEMannYS9nUtN.html
19-10-2020||World||US election 2020: What are mail-in ballots and why are they important?||US election 2020: What are mail-in ballots and why are they important?One of the most discussed topics in the run-up to presidential election in the United States has been the mail-in ballots as more and more voters are choosing the option because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. What is mail-in voting and how does it work?Mail-in voting means casting a vote through mail. Different states have different rules with respect to mail-in voting but all of them have the option available. Some states have absentee ballots which are provided if the voter provides a reason why they cannot cast their vote in person. In the Florida 2020 primary election, President Donald Trump voted using an absentee ballot as he is a registered voter in Florida but was unable to vote in person. In some states, absentee voting does not require a specific reason and in a few others, vote my mail is sent to every registered voter without any request made.Is there a verification process followed by the states?Different states have different methods to verify the ballots like in some states authorities check if ballots have come from voters’ registered address; some states require signatures on the envelopes and others require witness or notarised signatures. Why are mail-in ballots important in this election?In the 2016 US Presidential election, nearly 25 per cent of votes were cast by using mail-in ballots and this number is expected to rise much more in the 2020 US presidential election because of Covid-19.What is President Donald Trump’s take on mail-in ballots?While being a supporter of absentee ballots, President Donald Trump has constantly criticised the process of mail in voting and has also said that it leads to voter fraud. The Republicans have also reduced funding to the mail service and have been against expansion of the mail-in ballot process. President Trump has also talked about how the mail-in voting may result in delay in the results of the presidential elections. What is the Democrat Party’s stand on this issue?The Democrat Party has supported the mail-in voting process and has blamed the Republican Party for disruption in the election process.How can the use of mail-in ballots affect the elections? While President Trump’s claims of voter fraud in the mail-in voting system have not been proved, there is common consensus that the mail-in voting process will cause a delay in the results of the elections as the counting process might take a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-what-are-mail-in-ballots-and-why-are-they-important/story-wqlTxxqF1fhkZSVEmII7WJ.html
19-10-2020||World||US envoy warns new violence threatens Afghan peace process||The US special envoy to Afghanistan warned Monday that “distressingly high” levels of violence threaten to derail ongoing peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.Zalmay Khalilzad’s comments come as renewed fighting for days has plagued Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province, a longtime Taliban stronghold. The Taliban this Friday agreed to halt its attacks on condition of the US stopping its airstrikes in the area.But then came a suicide car bombing Sunday that killed at least 13 people and wounded around 120 others in Afghanistan’s western Ghor province. Though no one claimed responsibility for the bombing, suspicion immediately fell on the Taliban.“Violence has stalked Afghans for far too long. It has robbed far too many Afghans of their loved ones,” Khalilzad wrote on Twitter. “The tragedy in Ghor today is the most recent example.”He added: “The belief that says violence must escalate to win concessions at the negotiating table is very risky. Such an approach can undermine the peace process and repeats past miscalculations by Afghan leaders.”The Taliban offered no immediate reaction to Khalilzad’s tweets. However, it issued a statement Sunday over the US airstrikes targeting Helmand province. The Taliban warned that “all responsibility and consequences from continuation of such actions shall fall squarely on the shoulders of the American side.”Omer Zwak, a spokesman for Helmand’s provincial governor, said Monday there were still gun battles in a few areas of the province’s Nad Ali and Nawa districts. The Afghan air force separately conducted limited airstrikes to support Afghan forces trying to retake Taliban-held areas, Zwak said.The fighting has overwhelmed the only emergency hospital in Lashkar Gah, Helmand’s provincial capital, said Marco Puntin, the program coordinator at EMERGENCY, an aid group working there. He said doctors faced those wounded from six-consecutive nights of fighting.“Most of the patients we are currently admitting to the hospital are victims of bomb attacks and therefore suffer complicated injuries, which require complex surgery and a long hospital stay,” Puntin said in statement. “Civilians are paying the price for this offensive, trapped by the crossfire and often hit by mortars, rockets and grenades.”The peace talks in Qatar between the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators began in September, but after a ceremonious start they became bogged down, mainly in the minutiae of Islamic jurisprudence. This current round of negotiations come after a deal in February between the US and the Taliban that seeks to end America’s longest war.Despite the challenges, the ongoing talks represent the most-serious effort yet at ending decades of war in Afghanistan that followed the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled its Taliban government, which then was hosting al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden who planned the September 11 attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-warns-new-violence-threatens-afghan-peace-process/story-iTpTmPAU1bTxEzewoHd1xJ.html
19-10-2020||World||Covid-19 delay: New coronavirus relief may slip past election||Congress is quickly moving past the point at which it can deliver more coronavirus relief before the election, with differences between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, her Senate Republican rivals and President Donald Trump proving durable despite the glaring needs of the country.Trump’s GOP allies are reconvening the Senate this week for a revote on a virus proposal that about one-third the size of a measure being negotiated by Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But the Senate GOP bill has failed once before, and that Trump himself now says is too puny. The debate promises to bring a hefty dose of posturing and political gamesmanship, but little more. A procedural vote on a stand-alone renewal of bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program business subsidies is slated for Tuesday.Even the architect of the larger Senate measure, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., isn’t claiming the vote will advance the ball. Once the measure fails, he plans to turn the chamber’s full attention to cementing a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court by confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett. It is likely to be the Senate’s final act before Election Day.In that context, this week’s action has the chief benefit of giving Republicans in tough reelection races one last opportunity to try to show voters they are prioritizing COVID relief — and to make the case to voters that Democrats are the ones standing in the way.“It was important to indicate to the American people before the election — not after — that we were not in favor of a stalemate, that we were not in favor of doing nothing,” McConnell said in a Kentucky appearance last week.McConnell is resurrecting a measure in the $650 billion range that would repurpose $138 billion in small business subsidies to provide a second round of paycheck relief, add $300 per week in supplemental unemployment benefits, and help schools and universities reopen. The last version of the bill left out help for states and local governments sought by Democrats and another round of $1,200 direct payments demanded by Trump.The last coronavirus relief package, the $1.8 trillion bipartisan CARES Act, passed in March by an overwhelming margin as the economy went into lockdown amid fear and uncertainty about the virus. Since then, Trump and many of his GOP allies have focused on loosening social and economic restrictions as the key to recovery instead of more taxpayer-funded help.Trump has been anything but consistent. He now insists that lawmakers should “go big” with a bill of up to $2 trillion or more, a total reversal after abandoning the talks earlier this month. But Trump’s political problems aren’t swaying Senate Republicans.“He’s talking about a much larger amount than I can sell to my members,” McConnell said.The most recent bill from House Democrats weighs in at $2.4 trillion — or more than $2.6 trillion when excluding a $246 billion tax increase on businesses that’s unlikely to gain GOP acceptance. The package is a nonstarter with Senate Republicans and McConnell, who is making the case for a more targeted approach that’s well south of $1 trillion.The moment is challenging for Pelosi as well. For months she has been promising a COVID relief package of more than $2 trillion stuffed with Obama-era stimulus ideas. Even though the Senate and White House are both in GOP hands — and will be at least into January — she has sharply rebuffed anyone who suggests that Democrats should take a smaller deal now rather than risk going home empty-handed until next year.“This is not the time to say, ‘Okay, let’s fold.’ This is what we have been building up to,” Pelosi told fellow Democrats on a recent teleconference. She said Sunday that she remains optimistic of reaching an agreement with the administration but that a deal would have to come within 48 hours — or Tuesday — for it to be enacted by Election Day.Taking a smaller bill now would likely require Pelosi to give up tax cuts for the working poor and accept a far smaller aid package for states and local governments. But it would also mean that relief would flow immediately to millions of workers whose supplemental unemployment benefits were cut off this summer.Liberal economist Jared Bernstein, who worked for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in 2009 and advises him now, says inaction would mean “a lot of completely avoidable suffering for economically vulnerable people.”When an aid bill finally passes may depend on the outcome of the election.If Trump loses, Congress is likely to stagger through a nonproductive lame-duck session comparable to the abbreviated session after the decisive 2008 Obama-Biden victory or the 2016 session that punted most of its leftovers to the Trump administration. That scenario would push virus aid into 2021.Delays in coronavirus aid come as the recovery from this spring’s economic shutdown is slowing and as the massive stimulus effects of the $1.8 trillion March relief measure wear off. COVID cases are spiking again heading into a third wave of the pandemic this winter. Poverty is climbing and the virus is continuing to take a disproportionate toll on minority communities.“If Congress doesn’t act the next administration is going to inherit a real mess,” said Harvard economist Jason Furman, a former top Obama adviser. “Economic problems tend to feed on themselves.” He is in the Democratic camp that prefers imperfect stimulus now rather than a larger package in four months or so.Instead, if history repeats, COVID relief is likely to be the first major item out of the gate next year, but it’s not clear even then that it’ll be as big as Democrats hope.“Pelosi decided in July that the political benefit of the next package would accrue to the president’s benefit and therefore she was going to lay out the most aggressive terms possible,” said veteran GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, who predicts that Pelosi won’t get much more next year than she could have gotten now “unless they’re willing to break the filibuster for a $3 trillion bailout for blue states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-delay-new-coronavirus-relief-may-slip-past-election/story-SbJHgInsz23IdH72ZMy3SN.html

19-10-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine storage issues could leave 3 billion people without access||From factory to syringe, the world’s most promising coronavirus vaccine candidates need non-stop sterile refrigeration to work.But despite great strides in equipping developing countries to maintain the vaccine “cold chain,” nearly 3 billion of the world’s 7.8 billion people live in places with insufficient temperature-controlled storage for an immunization campaign to bring Covid-19 under control.The result: Poor people around the world are likely to be the last to emerge from the pandemic. The cold chain hurdle is just the latest disparity of the pandemic weighted against the poor, who more often live and work in conditions that allow the virus to spread and whose health systems are not equipped for large-scale testing.Maintaining the cold chain for coronavirus vaccines won’t be easy in the richest of countries, especially when it comes to the handful of candidates that require ultracold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F). Logistics experts say most of Africa and much of Southeast Asia, Central Asia and Latin America lack the infrastructure to preserve even more conventional vaccines.A tiny medical clinic outside Burkina Faso’s capital that went nearly a year without a working refrigerator is a microcosm of how the cold chain can break.The clinic in Gampela couldn’t keep vaccines on site once its refrigerator broke last fall, nurse Julienne Zoungrana said. Staff members use motorcycles to fetch vials from a hospital in the capital, Ouagadougo, and must make a second trip to return unused doses.When Adama Tapsoba, 24, needs to take her baby for routine immunizations, she walks four hours to reach the clinic and often waits hours for a doctor. The mother of two thinks it will be difficult for her family to get coronavirus vaccines.“People will have to wait at the hospital, and they might leave without getting it,” she said.To uphold the cold chain in developing nations, international organizations have overseen the installation of tens of thousands of solar-powered vaccine refrigerators. Keeping temperature-sensitive vaccines safe from beginning to end also requires reliable electricity, sound roads and planning.For poor countries like Burkina Faso, the best chance for receiving supplies of a coronavirus vaccine is through the Covax initiative, led by the World Health Organization and the Gavi vaccine alliance. The goal of Covax is to place orders for multiple promising candidates with the aim of distributing successful ones equitably.The U.N.’s children’s agency, UNICEF, began laying the groundwork for global distribution months ago in Copenhagen. At the world’s largest humanitarian aid warehouse, logistics staff try to foresee shortages in part by learning from the past, especially the spring chaos surrounding masks and other protective gear that were commandeered off airport tarmacs or stolen for black-market trade.Cracks in the cold chain start once a vaccine leaves the factory. Cargo ships are too slow for vaccines with a limited shelf life. Carrying vaccines by air at cold temperatures costs a lot more, and air cargo traffic is only now rebounding from pandemic-related border closures.German logistics company DHL, which has expanded its cold storage capacity in response to the pandemic, estimated that 15,000 cargo flights would be required to fully vaccinate the world against the coronavirus.For every gap in the cold chain “we need to find a bridge,” DHL chief commercial officer Katja Busch said.Coronavirus vaccines will be one of the world’s most sought-after products, so theft is also a danger.“They can’t be left on a tarmac and fought over because they would actually be spoiled and they would have no value — or worse still, people would still be trying to distribute them,” said Glyn Hughes, the global head of cargo for the International Air Transport Association.Johns Hopkins University researcher Tinglong Dai, who specializes in health care logistics, said creativity will be needed to keep the cold chain intact while coronavirus vaccines are dispersed on a global scale. Gavi and UNICEF have experimented with delivering vaccines by drone. India’s largest cold storage company for food is weighing setting aside space for vaccines.“If people can figure out how to transport ice cream, they can transport vaccines,” Dai said.Multi-dose vials, which are the equivalent of bulk storage for vaccines, reduce manufacturing and transportation costs. But if too few people show up for their jab in time, whatever remains in the vials must be discarded.For now, UNICEF is betting on 20-dose vials and hoping that the amount wasted will stay below 15% for opened ones, according to Michelle Siedel, one of the agency’s cold chain experts.UNICEF also expects to have 520 million syringes pre-positioned and maps of where refrigeration needs are greatest by year-end, “to ensure that these supplies arrive in countries by the time the vaccines do,” Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.If Burkina Faso were given 1 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine today, the country wouldn’t be able to handle it, Jean-Claude Mubalama, UNICEF’s head of health and nutrition for the West African country.“If we had to vaccinate against the coronavirus now, at this moment, it would be impossible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-storage-issues-could-leave-3-billion-people-without-access/story-7BAUPPsAJhzcvjALrcrfJN.html
19-10-2020||World||Researchers identify ‘silent’ mutations that helped novel coronavirus thrive||Researchers have identified a number of ‘silent’ mutations in the roughly 30,000 letters of the novel coronavirus’s genetic code that helped it thrive once it made the leap from bats and other wildlife to humans -- and possibly set the stage for the global pandemic. The subtle changes involved how the virus folded its RNA molecules or genetic material within human cells, according to the researchers. The finding, published in the journal PeerJ, could lead to new molecular targets for treating or preventing Covid-19. The researchers used statistical methods to identify adaptive changes that arose in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in humans, but not in closely related coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins. “We’re trying to figure out what made this virus so unique,” said Alejandro Berrio, a postdoctoral associate in biologist Greg Wray’s lab at Duke University in the US. Previous research detected fingerprints of positive selection within a gene that encodes the “spike” proteins studding the coronavirus’s surface, which play a key role in its ability to infect new cells. The new study flagged mutations that altered the spike proteins, suggesting that viral strains carrying these mutations were more likely to thrive. However, with their approach, the researchers also identified additional culprits that previous studies failed to detect. They report that so-called silent mutations in two other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, dubbed Nsp4 and Nsp16, appear to have given the virus a biological edge over previous strains without altering the proteins they encode. Instead of affecting proteins, Berrio said, the changes likely affected how the virus’s genetic material -- which is made of RNA -- folds up into 3D shapes and functions inside human cells. What these changes in RNA structure might have done to set the SARS-CoV-2 virus in humans apart from other coronaviruses is still unknown, he said. But they may have contributed to the virus’s ability to spread before people even know they have it -- a crucial difference that made the current situation so much more difficult to control than the SARS coronavirus outbreak of 2003. “Nsp4 and Nsp16 are among the first RNA molecules that are produced when the virus infects a new person,” Berrio said. “The spike protein doesn’t get expressed until later. So they could make a better therapeutic target because they appear earlier in the viral life cycle,” he said. By pinpointing the genetic changes that enabled the new coronavirus to thrive in human hosts, scientists hope to better predict future zoonotic disease outbreaks before they happen. “Viruses are constantly mutating and evolving,” Berrio said. “So it’s possible that a new strain of coronavirus capable of infecting other animals may come along that also has the potential to spread to people, like SARS-CoV-2 did. We’ll need to be able to recognise it and make efforts to contain it early,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-identify-silent-mutations-that-helped-novel-coronavirus-thrive/story-0awXaljQ1oAPrmvW6JYICK.html
19-10-2020||World||A beginner’s guide to US Elections 2020||The US presidential elections take place every four years and the outcome is not only awaited in the United States but also throughout the world.Here’s a beginner’s guide to US elections 2020:When is the election?The election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 3, 2020.Is the election limited to choosing the President?No. While the entire focus of the election is on who will be the next President of the United States of America, voters will also be choosing new members of the Congress which includes the House of Representatives and the Senate. In the House of Representatives members serve two-year terms after which elections need to be conducted. In the Senate, senators serve six-year terms which are split in three parts and therefore, one-third of the senators are up for election every two years.How do the elections work?For becoming the President, candidates compete to win the Electoral College votes. Each state gets Electoral College votes based on its population. Voters decide who will go to the Electoral College and except two states, all others have a “winner takes all” rule which means that whoever wins the highest number of votes in the state gets all of the Electoral College votes. From a total of 538 Electoral College votes, the winner has to get 270 votes or more in order to become the President. This also means that it is not necessary to win the popular vote to become the President as US has an indirect election system. Elections will be held for all 435 seats of the House of Representatives. In Senate, 33 seats are up for grabs.Who can vote and how?A US citizen who is 18 years and above is eligible to vote in the elections. Voting can be done in person on the election day, in person but early before election day, through mail-in ballot or postal ballots and through absentee ballots.

19-10-2020||World||‘Absolutely not’ surprised Donald Trump got Covid-19: Anthony Fauci||America’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says he was “absolutely not” surprised when Donald Trump contracted COVID-19 after seeing the president surrounded by several people not wearing face masks and flouting best public health practices against the deadly pandemic. Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases appeared to be referring to the White House Rose Garden event on September 26 where Trump announced Judge Amy Coney Barrett was his pick to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. At least 12 people have tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the function.Fauci said during an interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that was aired on Sunday, “I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded -- no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask.” “When I saw that on TV, I said, ‘Oh my goodness. Nothing good can come out of that, that’s got to be a problem,’“ he said. “And then sure enough, it turned out to be a superspreader event.” His remarks came as Americans face another surge in the COVID-19 pandemic ahead of the November 3 US presidential election. Infections have crossed the 8-million mark and are rising rapidly. Over 219,000 people have died due to the disease, according to latest Johns Hopkins University. Even though the ceremony was held outdoors and many attendees were tested before being allowed in, photos and videos of the event showed few people wearing masks, many people greeting each other with hugs and handshakes, and people mingling and sitting very closely, CNN reported.There were also smaller, private gatherings inside the White House that did not include the mask-wearing or social distancing that public health experts have advised is essential to stopping the spread of the virus, the report noted.Fauci had previously labelled the event as a “superspreader” -- noting the lack of public health measures in place and the slate of positive tests that followed.“The data speak for themselves,” he said.Trump announced that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for coronavirus, just days after the Rose Garden event. The 74-year-old president was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and received various treatments before returning to the White House.Upon his release, the President told his followers that the virus that had hospitalised him for 72 hours discharge from hospital, was nothing to fear. He also posed for a mask-less photo-op on the White House balcony, sending a message to his supporters that he was not afraid of the disease.“Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life,” Trump wrote several hours before walking carefully out the hospital.During the interview with the CBS, Fauci said it does not make sense to him why Trump “equates wearing a mask with weakness.” Masks, Fauci maintained, “really do work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/absolutely-not-surprised-donald-trump-got-covid-19-anthony-fauci/story-hk5SRgE1WybOqfcDOtaOLM.html
19-10-2020||World||Confirmed Covid-19 cases cross 40 million mark globally||The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the planet has passed 40 million.The milestone was passed early Monday according to Johns Hopkins University, which collates reporting from around the world.The actual worldwide figure of Covid-19 cases is likely to be far higher, as testing has been variable, many people have had no symptoms and some governments have concealed the true number of cases. To date, more than 1.1 million confirmed virus deaths have been reported, although experts also believe that number is an undercount.The US, Brazil and India are reporting by far the highest numbers of cases, although the increase in recent weeks has been driven by a surge in Europe, which has seen over 240,000 confirmed virus deaths in the pandemic so far.Last week, the World Health Organization said Europe had a reported a record weekly high of nearly 700,000 cases and said that the region was responsible for about a third of cases globally. Britain, France, Russia and Spain account for about half of all new cases in the region.WHO said new measures being taken across Europe — including new requirements on mask-wearing in Italy and Switzerland, the closure of restaurants and bars in Northern Ireland and Belgium, a night-time curfew in France and targeted limited lockdowns in parts of the UK — are “absolutely essential” to stop Covid-19 from overwhelming hospitals.The agency said several European cities could soon see their intensive care units overwhelmed and warned that governments and citizens should take all necessary measures to slow the virus’ spread, including bolstering testing and contact tracing, wearing face masks and following social distancing measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-of-confirmed-covid-19-cases-passes-40-million/story-lapnwxyP2h9kSjMVfitsRK.html
19-10-2020||World||UK police to implement self-isolation by tracking Covid-19 ‘case-by-case’ data||Police forces in England will have access to data of people told to self-isolate through the official National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace system as part of their enforcement of coronavirus lockdown rules.Forces will have access to information telling them if an individual has been told to self-isolate on a “case-by-case basis”, the government’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said on Friday. It said the move was part of a legal requirement for people who had tested positive and their close contacts to self-isolate when formally notified to do so.“The DHSC has agreed a memorandum of understanding with the NPCC (National Police Chiefs Council) to enable police forces to have access on a case-by-case basis to information that enables them to know if a specific individual has been notified to self-isolate,” a DHSC spokesperson said.“The memorandum of understanding ensures that information is shared with appropriate safeguards and in accordance with the law. No testing or health data is shared in this process,” the spokesperson said.Police will not have access to data from the NHS Covid-19 app as it works on an anonymous basis.Under legal requirements in place, anyone who receives a positive result for Covid-19 is currently required to isolate for 10 days after displaying symptoms – or 10 days after receiving their result if asymptomatic. Members of the person’s household must also isolate for 14 days. Failure to comply with these legal requirements can lead to a fine starting at 1,000 pounds for first offences, which can scale up to 10,000 pounds for repeat offences and serious breaches of the law.“If there is evidence to suggest you are not complying with the duty to self-isolate without reasonable justification, your local authority may pass this information on to local police forces to investigate further. This may lead to enforcement action being taken against you, which could include you being fined,” notes the latest DHSC privacy information guidance related to coronavirus testing.“A police force may request information relating to positive Covid-19 tests from the NHS Test & Trace programme directly, where they are investigating a report of someone who may not be complying with the mandatory self-isolation period,” it said.A spokesperson for NPCC said police forces would continue to encourage “voluntary compliance” but would enforce regulations and issue fines where appropriate.“Officers will engage with individuals to establish their circumstances, using their discretion wherever it is reasonable to do so,” they said.Meanwhile, Scotland Yard issued an update on its policing plan as London moved into the high alert Tier 2 category of lockdown rules over the weekend amid a spike in infections. It came ahead of the Metropolitan Police dispersing groups of drinkers after they spilled out of bars after the 10pm curfew and many continued gathering on the streets in the early hours of Saturday, soon after the new stricter rules against gatherings came in.“Frustratingly, we have seen a small number of dangerous and reckless breaches of the regulations and as the alert level in London increases, we are adopting our policing approach,” said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist, Met Police lead for Covid-19. “Communities across London can therefore expect to see an increase in our efforts to deal with the most deliberate, harmful and flagrant breaches of regulations. We will not hesitate to take action against those individuals or businesses who put people at risk,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-to-implement-self-isolation-by-tracking-covid-19-case-by-case-data/story-RqH2woPhwYGw2MlQAe547O.html
19-10-2020||World||Which country wields most power in Asia? US leads but China is catching up||China is closing in on the US as the most powerful country influencing the Asia-Pacific, as America’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic tarnishes its reputation, a study showed.While America retained its place as the region’s top superpower, its 10-point lead on China two years ago has been halved, according to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index for 2020, which ranks 26 nations and territories. The US “lost prestige” due to its poor response to the pandemic, multiple trade disputes and President Donald Trump’s moves to withdraw from multilateral deals and agencies, according to Herve Lemahieu, the study’s research chief and director of Lowy’s Asian Power and Diplomacy Program. “The pandemic was a game changer,” he said in a phone interview. “It contributed to a double whammy of problems for the US because on the one hand, its poor handling of the Covid-19 crisis has resulted in a diminished reputation. And on the other hand, obviously it will take many more years to recover from the economic fallout of the pandemic.”The US economy could take until 2024 to recover to pre-pandemic levels, the institute said. In contrast, China’s economy has rebounded from the virus and is the only large economy forecast to recover in 2020. This could give it an advantage against neighbors over the next decade. China stayed firmly in second place for the third year running, despite seeing a “notable fall” in diplomatic clout after facing  accusations of withholding information about the severity of the Wuhan outbreak. Lemahieu also cited wolf warrior diplomacy — more aggressive rhetoric and actions from Beijing’s envoys — contributing to that drop.A Trump re-election in November would bring “more of the same” trends, he said. However, China would find it hard to replace the US and become the region’s uncontested dominant power.“I think it’s more likely that China will eventually level with the United States and may, toward the end of this decade, even surpass the United States. But not meaningfully enough to pull ahead by substantial margins,” said Lemahieu.“Asia will learn to cope without the United States if Trump wins a second term,” he added. “With [Joe] Biden, I think Asia will be far more willing to do business with the United States.”India, the fourth most powerful nation on the index after Japan, lost economic growth potential in the pandemic and is also ceding strategic ground to Beijing. Lowy projects India will reach 40% of China’s economic output by 2030, compared with the 50% estimate last year.“It’s certainly delayed India’s arrival as the great power in the region,” said Lemahieu. “And it also means that India will be quite distracted by the development challenges and by the new poverty rate, with more newly impoverished people in South Asia.”As many as 347.4 million people in the Asia-Pacific region could fall below the $5.5 a day poverty line because of the pandemic, according to the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research.Overall, Asia’s economy, which was poised to become larger than the rest of the world economy combined in 2020, now faces “a perfect storm of public health, economic and strategic challenges” due to the pandemic, the Lowy report said.Third-placed Japan, described in the report as a “smart power” for using limited resources to wield broad influence in the region, gained the most points in terms of its defense diplomacy — which spans a country’s defense dialogues to joint military exercises and procurement of arms — overtaking South Korea on this measure.Russia, Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia round out the top 10. Southeast Asian nations on the list have been gripped with political turbulence, yet have managed to keep virus spikes in hand despite limited resources, Lemahieu said.Taiwan was among the few places to gain relative power this year, alongside Australia and Vietnam. Taiwan in particular improved its diplomatic influence score this year, after setbacks in 2019 when a handful of allies cut official ties as Beijing sought to isolate the island on the world stage. Australia climbed by one spot to 6th, overtaking South Korea. The country gained points in cultural and diplomatic influence due to favorable perceptions of its domestic response to the virus, with daily infections slowing to a trickle. It also boosted its economic relationships score after this year securing its 14th free-trade deal, with neighbor Indonesia.Apart from the US, Russia and Malaysia posted the biggest losses on the index. Russia took hits to its diplomatic influence and military capability scores and performed best on resilience measures thanks to “ample resource security and well-established nuclear deterrence capability.”The index measures power using 128 indicators including economic relations, defense spending, internal stability, information flows and projected future resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-country-wields-most-power-in-asia-us-leads-but-china-is-catching-up/story-n3FELbatWw92LkmDZZXJcP.html
19-10-2020||World||Indonesian president warns not to rush vaccines amid halal concern||The president of the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, Joko Widodo, called on Monday for Indonesia not to rush the rollout of vaccines, citing concerns over public awareness about whether they were halal.With more than 365,000 coronavirus cases and 12,000 deaths, Indonesia has struggled to get its outbreak under control. and the government has been racing to secure a supply of vaccines while still under development, drawing criticism from some epidemiologists for seeking a “silver bullet” solution before full vaccine efficacy and safety is known.Senior ministers have indicated that emergency vaccine authorisation could be granted as early as November.But the president, better known by his moniker “Jokowi”, signaled a more cautionary approach, warning against haste and urging clear public messaging about whether vaccines were halal, or permissible under Islam.“I ask that this vaccine is not rushed because it’s so complex,” Jokowi said ahead of a closed meeting.“I want to ensure there is good preparation. On public communication, especially in relation to halal and haram, the price, and quality.”Indonesia has previously pledged to vaccinate more than 100 million people next year, but Jokowi on Monday said that scale of inoculation in an archipelagic nation of 270 million would be uniquely challenging.Controversy over whether vaccines adhere to Islamic principles has stymied public health responses before in Indonesia, including in 2018, when the Indonesian Ulema Council issued a fatwa declaring a measles vaccine was haram, or forbidden under Islam.Indonesia has secured 50 million doses from China’s Sinovac by March next year and 100 million from AstraZeneca by next April, in addition to other deals.Vaccines from Sinovac as well as China’s Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics for 9.1 million people will be available this year, with health workers prioritised, said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official.Indonesia’s rush to secure supplies of unproven vaccines has generated concern among epidemiologists, some of which argue it should instead focus on testing and contact tracing until a safe and effective vaccine is available.“Many countries think a vaccine will be their silver bullet to deal with the pandemic,” said Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist from Australia’s Griffith University.“But unfortunately, the history of pandemics, the literature, does not support that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-president-warns-not-to-rush-vaccines-amid-halal-concern/story-Dp3MbPGopdkDcL6fkThK9H.html
19-10-2020||World||Chinese aggression, censorship brings India and Taiwan closer, says report||Taiwan and India do not have formal diplomatic ties but their citizens have bonded over a shared feeling of being targets of Chinese aggression and censorship, reported The Diplomat.As China and India are engaged in border stand-off, netizens support their counterparts in Taiwan and Hong Kong, bringing along masala chai to become an adjacent member of the online pro-democracy “Milk Tea Alliance.”Ahead of Taiwan National Day, the Chinese Embassy in India sent guidelines to Indian media on how to refer to Taiwan. The move backfired and led to outrage in both India and Taiwan.China in recent years has also increased military drills around Taiwan, with almost 40 Chinese warplanes crossing the median line between the mainland and Taiwan on September 18-19 -- one of several sorties the island’s President Tsai Ing-wen called a “threat of force.”“It looks like communist China is hoping to march into the subcontinent by imposing censorship,” Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted on October 7. “Taiwan’s Indian friends will have one reply: GET LOST!”The Chinese demand did, in fact, spur a flurry of op-eds and news coverage of Taiwan’s National Day and the state of Taiwan-India ties, in both countries.In India, #TaiwanNationalDay trended on Twitter throughout the day on October 10 as internet users, along with journalists and politicians, sent well wishes to Taiwan.Y. Satya Kumar, national secretary of ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), tweeted: “Greetings to my Taiwanese brothers and sisters on #TaiwanNationalDay. India stands in solidarity with the courage, strength and resolve that you people have displayed in your struggle against colonialism and oppression by the imperial power!”Indian Twitter users followed Taiwanese accounts, including that of President Tsai Ing-wen, en masse. Tsai thanked her new followers on Tuesday by tweeting several photos from her trip to India in 2012, writing: “Your architectural marvels, vibrant culture & kind people are truly unforgettable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-aggression-censorship-brings-india-and-taiwan-closer-says-report/story-Qsgkrep2S05rdfbogbnsGK.html
19-10-2020||World||Pakistan opposition rally calls for PM Imran Khan to quit||Tens of thousands of opposition supporters rallied in Pakistan’s largest city of Karachi on Sunday as part of a campaign to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan, who they accuse of being installed by the military in a rigged election two years ago.The mass demonstration in Karachi was the second in three days launched by Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), formed last month by nine major opposition parties to begin a nationwide agitation against the government.Under Khan, Pakistan has experienced mounting censorship of the media and a crackdown on dissent, critics and opposition. But the campaign against him sought to tap into discontent over his handling of the economy, which was tanking even before the global coronavirus pandemic struck.“You’ve snatched jobs from people. You have snatched two-time a day food from the people,” Maryam Nawaz, the daughter and political heir of the former three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, told the rally.In the early hours of Monday, police snatched her husband, arresting Muhammad Safdar following complaints from Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party that he had raised political slogans at the mausoleum of Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, an action deemed illegal.“Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt. Safdar,” Nawaz tweeted on Monday morning. A spokesman of the provincial government said police had not acted on their orders.During Sunday’s rally she had shared the platform with Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, whose late mother Benazir Bhutto was also prime minister two times. “Our farmers have hunger in their homes... our youth is disappointed,” said Zardari, whose Pakistan People’s Party governs the southern city of Karachi. The message struck a chord with their supporters, in a country now suffering double digit inflation and negative economic growth.“Inflation has broken the back of poor citizens forcing many to beg to feed their children,” said Faqeer Baloch, 63, at the Karachi rally. “It is high time that this government should go now,” he said as the crowd chanted, “Go Imran go!” The next general election is scheduled for 2023.On Friday, the opposition held a mass rally in Gujranwala, a city in the eastern province of Punjab, a stronghold for Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League (N).Addressing the rally via video link from London, Nawaz Sharif accused army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa of rigging the 2018 elections and orchestrating his ouster in 2017, saying the corruption charges brought against him were concocted. The military, which denies meddling in politics, has yet to respond specifically to Sharif’s accusations. Khan, who denies the army helped him win, has defended the military and on Saturday threatened a fresh crackdown on opposition leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-rally-calls-for-pm-imran-khan-to-quit/story-Uonzm5ZSDC7TNMrOUOdQtM.html

19-10-2020||World||For good relationship with India, vote for Donald Trump: Indian-American supporters||Describing President Donald Trump as India’s “good friend”, a group of Indian-Americans have urged the community members across the country to support and vote for the Republican leader in the November 3 elections. Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, on Sunday said the Indian-American community has emerged as a force to reckon with for the first time in the history of the US presidential election. “Your support will contribute to President Trump’s win,” he said. “This is a historical election where we all e have to make a simple choice. Do we want better economy, less taxes and smaller government, then let’s re-elect President Trump? You want to have a good friend for India, first time ever, let’s elect President Trump,” said eminent Indian businessman Chintu Patel.Trump also needs to be elected to successfully address the challenges posed by China, said the founder of the Amneal pharmaceuticals at a ‘meet a greet’ event organised for Donald J Trump Jr, son of the president, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee.“We could be small in numbers, but we are strong in dollars. So let’s unite, make our vote count. We will elect this president. We have to take our country forward, not backward,” said Patel.Dr Raj Bhayani, who has been working among Indian-Americans in some of the key battleground states, said it is important for the community that they support and vote for Trump as the president has supported India in the last four years, including on the issue of China.Shridhar Chityala, a member of the ‘Indian Voices for Trump’, said the policies of President Trump in the last four years have been bold, disruptive and transformative. “On the issue of China, the president has sent a strong message that he stands with India. We would like to see him reelected again,” he said.Businessman Navin Shah said Trump has successfully managed the coronavirus. The president has led America towards peace and prosperity and that his achievements in the field of economy is unparalleled. “We need to spread the word and help re-elect Trump,” he said.Dr Shobha Choklingam asserted that Trump has supported India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of Kashmir. “President Trump is the one that takes on China the way it should be,” she said.“I want to thank him for the support he gave to India against China...As a patriotic American we need to support him very, very strongly,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-good-relationship-with-india-vote-for-donald-trump-indian-american-supporters/story-kecUPV1J6BCgm7yyUg9Y0N.html

Donald Trump Jr said he was surprised at the reception his father had received at the beginning of the year when the US president and his family visited India for the first time for the Namaste Trump event in Ahmedabad.“The relationship between my father, president of the United States Donald Trump, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is incredible. When I saw the reception he received in India a few months ago, it was overwhelming. I think they understand that these two big democracies are fighting together against communism and socialism spreading across the world… I love that they have a powerful relationship that will benefit the world,” Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of the US president said, according to news agency ANI.Trump Jr was speaking after the release of his book Liberal Privilege and the event was organised exclusively for the Indian American community. The book documents allegations of corruption against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Both Republicans and Democrats are aiming to impress the Indian-American electorates across the United States. On October 14, a report said that according to the Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) conducted by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins University and Princeton in partnership with YouGov, 72% of Indian American respondents could vote for Democrat Joe Biden in the upcoming presidential elections.Republicans expect that Donald Trump’s anti-China and anti-immigrant rhetoric will impress Indian Americans and will lead them to vote for him on November 3. Donald Trump Jr also echoed the same sentiment. “We have to understand the threat of China and no one knows that probably better than Indian-Americans,” he said. He added that Biden will be soft on China and will not benefit the India-US ties.During the 2019 Howdy Modi event in Houston, PM Modi highlighted how Trump strengthened India and the ties between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-modi-relationship-is-incredible-says-donald-trump-jr/story-ZWDmkzRDZnHROVqXAACVPJ.html
19-10-2020||World||Imran Khan incapable and clueless; betrayed people of Pakistan: Opposition leaders||Prime Minister Imran Khan is “incapable and clueless”, and his government is worse than a dictatorship, Pakistan’s opposition leaders have said at the second rally of an alliance formed to oust the premier.The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of 11 opposition parties formed on September 20, has launched a three-phased anti-government movement under an “action plan” to remove the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) government.Under the plan a number of rallies public meetings and demonstrations will be held across the country, before a “decisive long march” to Islamabad in January next year. The first of these rallies was held on Friday in Gujranwala near Lahore. “This incapable and clueless prime minister will have to go home,” Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said on Sunday at the Bagh-e-Jinnah, which was packed with people including supporters and workers of the alliance’s members.History has proved that the biggest dictators could not survive and “what standing does this puppet have?”, Zardari said targeting Prime Minister Khan and added that “this is not a new fight but this will be a decisive fight”.The rally here also marked the 13th anniversary of the twin blasts in Karsaz that targeted the homecoming procession of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007. The blast left around 200 people dead and several injured.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice presidents Maryam Nawaz and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Achakzai and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman were among the leaders of opposition parties who attended the rally. The PPP also invited Mohsin Dawar, who heads the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), to address the gathering at the Bagh-e-Jinnah. Maryam Nawaz, daughter of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, attacked the PTI government for declaring opposition leaders and her father as “traitors”. “When answers are demanded, you say we are traitors,” said the PML-N vice president. Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was also declared a traitor, Maryam Nawaz told the gathering.Calling PM Khan a “coward”, Maryam accused him of using the armed forces for his face-saving and declaring opponents as traitors only to save his skin and hide incompetence.“Do not scare us (by declaring us) traitors,” the PML-N vice president said and added that “when you (Khan) are pressed for answers, you hide behind the armed forces”.“You bring the army into disrepute. You use them (army) to hide your failures. Who gave you this right?” Maryam asked.“Remember this, one or two personalities are not the entire institution, but one or two people can defame the entire institution, and when they take cover of that institution, they cause heavy losses to that institution,” she said. “We cannot respect those who violate their oaths. Is Nawaz Sharif wrong in saying that the army should not interfere in politics?” she asked. Addressing the first power show of the PDM in Gujranwala via video link from London on Friday, Sharif had accused the military and Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI of being behind his ouster as premier and installing their “puppet government” by bringing Imran Khan into power.It was for the first time that the 70-year-old PML-N supremo, who was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court on graft charges, directly named army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI head Lt Gen Faiz Hameed for interfering in the elections of 2018 to ensure victory of Khan.On Sunday, Prime Minister Khan warned that he would be getting tough with the opposition and would ensure Sharif is brought back from London and put in jail for his deeds.Sharif has been living in London since November last year after he was allowed by the courts and the government to go there for a period of eight weeks for medical treatment. But he did not come back, while his lawyers told the court that he was still recovering.The Islamabad High Court through newspaper advertisements has asked Sharif to appear before it by November 24 to avoid being declared a “proclaimed offender”. Maryam said Khan’s speech was that of a defeated man who was worried about the support the PDM had gathered in a short time.Bilawal, in his speech, lashed out at Khan for “betraying” the people of Pakistan and said the rise of “facism” in the country had weakened the country’s position on Kashmir and other issues. Taking a jibe at PM Khan and Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman said, “Bajwa Sahib, I respect you so much. But please try to avoid these foolish (Khan) friends.” Mohsin Dawar, who was one of the first speakers at the rally, termed the PDM as a “beginning for real democracy and civilian supremacy” in the country. He criticised the incumbent government for filing “baseless cases” against political workers, whether they were from Waziristan, Gilgit Baltistan, Baluchistan or Sindh. The cases, Dawar claimed, were filed due to political differences. The current regime is “worse than a dictatorship”, he said. The PDM will hold rallies in Quetta on October 25, Peshawar on November 22, Multan on November 30 and then a rally in Lahore on December 13.Opposition leaders have announced that they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek “the selected” prime minister’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-incapable-and-clueless-betrayed-people-of-pakistan-opposition-leaders/story-IKDve3rvX9Oav4eBsSZCjN.html
19-10-2020||World||Pak Oppn hammers Imran Khan at rally, cops ‘gate crash’ Maryam Nawaz’s hotel||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s administration came under attack at Sunday’s mass protest rally that was held at Karachi’s Jinnah ground. Thousands of people attended the event held by the newly-formed 11-party opposition alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).Maryam Nawaz, daughter of former PM Nawaz Sharif and currently PML-N vice-president, attended the mass protest where she launched a scathing attack on PM Khan in a speech. “When you are pressed for answers, you hide behind the armed forces. You coward! You bring the army into disrepute. You use them (the army) to hide your own failures. Who gave you this right?” she questioned the prime minister amid cheers from the crowd.In her speech, Maryam also responded to comments made by PM Khan a day earlier. “Yesterday, you must have seen on your TV screens a man screaming his defeat,” she told the crowd. “You (Khan) tell people ‘ghabrana nai hai’ (don’t worry), there has only been one ‘jalsa’ (rally). But you are already worried.”Maryam challenged Khan to ban the opposition PML-N Party, saying, “Don’t even think about it. This is the biggest party of Pakistan.”Also Read: Maryam Nawaz’s husband Safdar Awan ‘arrested’ in Karachi after rally against Imran KhanIn a reference to India, Maryam said, “You say the opposition is speaking (Indian Prime Minister Nardendra) Modi’s language, when it was you who prayed for Modi’s re-election, were dying to talk to him, gave him Kashmir on a plate… and we are the ones speaking his language?”Maryam was softer in her approach when she spoke about Pakistan’s military establishment, saying the PDM was not against the army but only some of its generals. “Those soldiers who sacrificed their lives, Nawaz salutes them, Maryam Nawaz salutes them, we all salute them. Remember this, one or two personalities are not the entire institution, but one or two people can defame the entire institution. And when they take cover of that institution, they cause heavy losses to that institution,” she said.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also gave a speech at the event, criticising PM Khan for promulgating an ordinance to take over two islands located near Karachi. He said Khan betrayed the people of Karachi by offering an unconvincing package and taking over the two islands in order to build housing colonies.Bilawal also questioned the ruling party’s strategy on Kashmir, accusing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of weakening the Kashmir cause. “He (Khan) claimed to be the ambassador of Kashmiris. But now, he has become the lawyer of Kulbhushan (Jadhav). He (Khan) has done a deal on Kashmir,” Bilawal said.“This incapable and clueless prime minister will have to go home,” said Bilawal and told the audience that the main demand of the PDM was “real democracy”.A surprise speaker at the event was Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) leader Mohsin Dawar. The PTM member of parliament talked about human rights violations in north Waziristan and other parts of the tribal areas. He lamented that over time, people had gone missing not just in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), but all across the country.“I consider this government to be worse than a dictatorship because they have placed a prime minister as a punching bag. In reality, the decision makers are the Pakistan Army and its agencies,” he told the crowd.Another leader who spoke at the protest rally was Balochistan National Party-Mengal’s (BNP-M) Akhtar Mengal, who began his speech by mockingly welcoming PDM leaders into what he called a “gallery of traitors”.“Traitor certificates for us, the followers of Bacha Khan, were issued in 1947. Our certificates are so old, they are moth-eaten by now. Yours are new, so I welcome you,” he said.The BNP-M leader also questioned why Pakistan was created in the first place. “Was this country made for us or for the Defence Housing Agency (DHA)?” he asked. Political observers say the Karachi rally was a success. The provincial government, which belongs to the opposition PPP, is believed to have managed the event’s logistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-top-opposition-leaders-slam-pm-imran-khan-at-pdm-s-protest-rally-in-karachi/story-O1rffiCNK1rhbH6TXUgMKL.html
19-10-2020||World||China’s post Covid-19 economic recovery rate accelerates||China’s shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.The world’s second-largest economy expanded by 4.9% over a year ago in the three months ending in September, official data showed Monday. Retail spending rebounded to above pre-virus levels for the first time and factory output rose, boosted by demand for exports of masks and other medical supplies.The recovery is broadening out and becoming less reliant on government stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. He said growth is “still accelerating” heading into the present quarter.China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.It is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.The Chinese economy expanded by 3.2% over a year earlier in the three months ending in June, rebounding from the previous quarter’s 6.8% contraction, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s.The economy “continued the steady recovery,” the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, “the international environment is still complicated and severe.” It said China faces great pressure to prevent a resurgence of the virus.Authorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus’s telltale fever. Travelers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.Last week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a two-month streak with no virus transmissions reported within China.Industrial production rose 5.8% over the same quarter last year, a marked improvement over the first half’s 1.3% contraction. Chinese exporters are taking market share from foreign competitors that still are hampered by anti-virus controls.Retail sales rose 0.9% over a year earlier. That was up from a 7.2% contraction in the first half as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. Online commerce rose 15.3%.In a sign demand is accelerating, sales in September rose 3.3%.“China’s recovery in private consumption is gathering momentum,” said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp in a report.China has reported 4,634 coronavirus deaths and 85,685 confirmed cases, plus three suspected cases.Economists say China is likely to recover faster than other major economies due to the ruling party’s decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.The International Monetary Fund is forecasting China’s economic growth at 1.8% this year while the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 4.3%. The IMF expects a 9.8% contraction in France, 6% in Germany and 5.3% in Japan.Private sector analysts say as much as 30% of China’s urban workforce, or up to 130 million people, may have lost their jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year.The ruling party promised in May to spend $280 billion on meeting goals including creating 9 million new jobs. But it has avoided joining the United States and Japan in rolling out stimulus packages of $1 trillion or more due to concern about adding to already high Chinese debt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-post-covid-19-economic-recovery-rate-accelerates/story-ztDBgR55pp2MyIkkJSO8gO.html

19-10-2020||World||Israeli delegation visits Bahrain after agreement to normalise ties||Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy said on Sunday the President’s push for an Israeli-Arab rapprochement was gaining momentum and he hoped more accords would follow even if Trump loses next month’s election. Avi Berkowitz, who accompanied an Israeli delegation which visited Bahrain on Sunday, said the so-called “Abraham Accords” had bipartisan support in the United States and were designed to bear long-term fruit by encouraging grassroots engagement between Israel and its new Arab partners.“Peace is something everybody should celebrate and see as a positive thing for the world,” Berkowitz said in an interview. “It’s our sincere hope that, no matter who wins the election, the Abraham Accords will continue to grow.”Bahrain followed the United Arab Emirates in agreeing last month to normalise ties with Israel, angering Palestinians who had conditioned any such regional rapprochement on statehood, with East Jerusalem as capital of their independent state.The administration has been racing against the clock to secure normalisation deals for Israel, in an effort to help Trump secure re-election in November.For allies in the Middle East, it is a chance to close ranks on Iran more overtly.The flight carrying the Israeli delegation flew over Saudi Arabia, an accommodation by the Gulf’s powerhouse, which has so far resisted appeals to normalise ties with Israel.“That is a decision for them to ultimately come to, our conversations with them have been positive on numerous fronts,” Berkowitz said when asked about any Saudi plans to follow suit. “We look to them for an understanding in the region of the temperature of how things are going on numerous fronts, we’ve had very good discussions with them but time will tell,” he added. Berkowitz, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other officials will travel on Monday to the UAE, where the accord with Israel has opened up bilateral commerce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/berkowitz-hopes-abrahamic-accords-grows-no-matter-who-wins-us-elections/story-tmdbo2AstggTLsK5PNAc3J.html
19-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump, Biden urge supporters to vote early as this week’s final debate showdown awaits||President Donald Trump implored supporters in Nevada on Sunday to cast ballots early in a state he narrowly lost in 2016, while Democrat Joe Biden urged North Carolina residents to “go vote today,” as the final presidential debate looms later this week.(Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage)Some 27.9 million Americans have already cast ballots either by mail or in person ahead of the Nov. 3 election, according to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida. The record-shattering figure is being driven in part by concerns about crowds at polling sites on Election Day during the coronavirus pandemic.(Read more: US president Donald Trump woos evangelical Christians in Nevada rally)At a rally in Carson City, Nevada, a state where voting started on Saturday, Trump told attendees: “Early voting is under way, so get out and vote.” (Read more: Twitter blocks tweet from Trump adviser downplaying face-masks)In North Carolina, a battleground where 1.4 million, or 20%, of the state’s registered voters had already voted as of Sunday morning, Biden asked people to cast ballots as soon as possible. The race is neck and neck in the state, which Trump won by 3.66 percentage points in 2016.“We gotta keep the incredible momentum going; we can’t let up,” Biden told a “drive-in rally” in Durham, as attendees sitting in their cars honked in approval. “Don’t wait - go vote today.”Biden also criticized Trump for saying over the weekend that the United States had “turned the corner” in the coronavirus pandemic, noting that the rate of new cases across the country had risen to the highest level in months.“As my grandfather would say: ‘This guy’s gone around the bend if he thinks we’ve turned the corner,’“ Biden said. “Things are getting worse, and he continues to lie to us about circumstances.”Despite Trump’s recent recovery from his own bout with the virus, he mocked Biden in Nevada for his cautious approach toward the pandemic. There was little social distancing at the packed outdoor rally at the Carson City airport.“Listen to the scientists!” Trump said in a mocking voice. “If I listened totally to the scientists, we would right now have a country that would be in a massive depression.”The Biden campaign responded almost immediately. “New coronavirus cases are surging and layoffs are rising,” said spokesman Andrew Bates. The two will debate for a final time on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee. Their second scheduled debate, set for last Thursday, was canceled when Trump pulled out of the event after organizers said it would be virtual to lessen the risk of infection.HARRIS RETURNING TO TRAILBiden’s pick for vice president, Senator Kamala Harris, canceled in-person events over the weekend as a precaution after an aide tested positive for Covid-19. She will return to the campaign trail on Monday with a visit to Florida to mark that state’s first day of early in-person voting. Harris tested negative for the virus on Sunday, the campaign said. The president, who rarely goes to church but has remained popular among evangelical Christians for his opposition to abortion and for appointing conservative judges, began his day by attending a service at the International Church of Las Vegas. Trump did not wear a mask for the indoor service.One of the church’s pastors, Denise Goulet, said to Trump from the stage that God had told her he would win the 2020 election. Trump put a handful of $20 bills into an offering bucket and bowed his head during a prayer. Trump will campaign every day leading up to Thursday’s debate, including stops in Arizona and North Carolina, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. While Trump lags in opinion polls at the national level and in many battleground states, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said over the weekend that the national figures were misleading because must-win states were close.“We cannot become complacent because the very searing truth is that Donald Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire,” she wrote in a memo to donors.U.S. presidential elections are determined by electoral votes, allotted to U.S. states and territories based largely on their populations, rather than by a tally of the popular vote nationwide.

Safdar,” Maryam tweeted early Monday.  Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt. Safdar.So far no official announcement has been made regarding the arrest by the police. This is also not clear whether the Safdar’s arrest has been made with regard to an FIR that was lodged yesterday at Brigade police station by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government representatives against Maryam, Safdar Awan and their “200 goons” for violating the “sanctity of Quaid’s Mazar Under Quaid-e-Azam’s Mazar Protection and Maintenance ordinance 1971”.On the way to Bagh-e-Jinnah garden, Maryam made a stopover visit at Quaid’s mausoleum on Sunday. Retired Captain Safdar had chanted the PML-N slogan “vote ko izzat do (honour the vote)” and urged people to join him.This move was condemned by government representatives saying that ‘the sanctity of Quaid’s Mazar has been disrespected’. According to Geo News, the government representatives approached the police asking them to initiate legal action against all those who participated in the act.Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry also criticised Safdar and said both he and Maryam must apologise.“An FIR has been lodged at Brigade police station against Maryam, Safdar Awan and their 200 goons who violated the sanctity of Quaid’s Mazar Under Quaid-e-Azam’s Mazar Protection and Maintenance ordinance 1971,” PTI tweeted.Speaking at the Sunday’s anti-government rally, Maryam paid tribute to the provincial government for their efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic, while they were subjected to humiliation and taunts by the federal government, Dawn reported.“Yesterday, you must have seen on your TV screens a man screaming his defeat...You [PM Imran] tell people ‘ghabrana nai hai’, there has only been one jalsa yet and you are worrying already,” she said.While taunting the Prime Minister for PTI’s recently failed 126-day sit-in on Shahrah-e-Dastoor, the PML-N leader said, “You [PM Imran] addressed empty chairs, dug democracy’s grave, [and yet] Nawaz Sharif never took your name. Even today, you will long for it but Nawaz Sharif will not even take your name, because children have no role in the fight between elders.”(ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryam-nawaz-sharif-s-husband-safdar-awan-arrested-in-karachi/story-dqKfPwaCIi77mds3IrqaPI.html
19-10-2020||World||Saudi Arabian artist makes world’s ‘largest coffee painting’||A Saudi artist has created the world’s “largest coffee painting”, becoming the first woman from the country to achieve a record title single-handedly, the Guinness World Records announced Sunday. Ohud Abdullah Almalki used expired coffee to illustrate renowned leaders from the kingdom and the neighbouring United Arab Emirates for the 220 square metre (around 2,370 square feet) piece.“It took me 45 days of continuous work to complete, under the watchful eyes of two witnesses, video recording and drone footage,” Almalki said, according to a Guinness World Records statement. The artwork, titled “Naseej 1” (meaning “Woven Together”) was created in the Saudi city of Jeddah on a canvas of seven connected cloths.It features the founding fathers of Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- the late King Abdul Aziz bin Saud and the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, respectively. Below them is a series of smaller portraits of other leaders from the two Gulf countries, while the whole work is bordered in the traditional “Al-Sadu” style of Bedouin decoration.“My aim is to remind the world of the centuries-old entente between the two nations,” Almalki said.The artist used approximately 4.5 kilogrammes of expired coffee granules to complete the painting, according to the Guinness World Records statement. Almalki expressed hope that her accomplishment “will contribute to empowering the women in Saudi Arabia and beyond.”It is the first time a Saudi woman has achieved a record alone, Guinness World Records said, though others have taken part in previous attempts.In 2015, 8,264 women came together in Riyadh to make the largest “human awareness ribbon”, to raise awareness about breast cancer.dm/lg||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabian-artist-makes-world-s-largest-coffee-painting/story-143rWonjbRMhz9vc458NsI.html
19-10-2020||World||Nepal Government not to bear costs of Covid-19 test, treatment||Amid the continuous surge in COVID-19 cases, the Nepal government has decided not to bear expenses of all virus-infected people and not to bury infected people who died during home isolation.The decision, which was made earlier week by KP Sharma Oli-led administration, has been made public on Sunday through the daily COVID-19 briefing held by Ministry of Health and Population.Decided during a Cabinet meeting, a list of people completing certain criteria will be getting the facilities from the government, spokesperson at the Ministry announced.“Those from economically deprived, differently-abled and helpless, single women, senior citizens, front-line health workers, sanitisation workers, security personnel and those civil servants who are working in the risk-prone zone would be tested for free and treated as well. In case aforementioned persons have an insurance policy from any company, then expenses will be reimbursed from their insurance policy which shall cover the expenses of tests and treatment. Others who don’t fall in the criteria would require taking tests and expenses for treatment on their own,” Dr Jageshwor Gautam, one of the spokesperson at Ministry of Health and Population said in the regular press briefing on Sunday.The latest decision has gone into effect for all government, non-government hospitals and laboratories from Sunday itself. The new decision has left more than 25 per cent of the population (statistics from ADB, 2010) deprived of proper tests for COVID-19 infection.A large number of people, especially those depending on daily wage, will be adversely affected as a standard COVID-19 test costs NPR 2,000 in private labs.Government Hospitals and Labs have been conducting the tests for almost free of cost as they earlier use to receive reimbursement from the government on the basis of tests conducted.Besides, the Government has distanced itself from criminating the bodies of those succumbing to the deadly virus.Amending the “Dead Body Management of COVID-19 Cases Guideline” the government has made family members bury the body of their kin if he/she dies during home isolation.As per the new rule, the family members need to inform the local administration and police in case the infected person in home isolation dies and funeral rites need to be carried out by maintaining a physical distance. However, the guideline bars people above 60 years and children to participate in the procession.The new regulation also states that family members would require to arrange a vehicle to carry the dead body while the persons going close with the body would need to wear gloves, surgical masks, boots, spectacles and full sleeve dress.Kathmandu Valley which hosts almost half of the active cases in real-time have the highest number of infected ones in home isolations as a hospital run out of beds and other infrastructures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-government-not-to-bear-costs-of-covid-19-test-treatment/story-RwN56cSag0QVn7n9Fh1E0M.html
19-10-2020||World||Brexit - Britain, EU blame game continues; post brexit trade deal still possible||Britain and the European Union will on Monday attempt to breathe life into post-Brexit trade talks that appeared all but dead last week, with each side telling the other it needed to fundamentally change course.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday there was no point in continuing talks and it was time to prepare for a ‘no-deal’ exit when transitional arrangements end on Dec. 31.But Michael Gove, one of his senior ministers, struck a more conciliatory tone on Sunday, saying the door was still ajar to a deal if the bloc was willing to compromise.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had been due in London for talks with his British counterpart David Frost this week. Instead, they will now speak by telephone on Monday to discuss the structure of future talks, Barnier’s spokesman said.Negotiations broke down on Thursday when the European Union said Britain needed to give ground.Issues still to be resolved include fair competition rules, dispute resolution and fisheries.Gove said on Sunday that the bloc had squandered some of the progress that had been made because it had not been willing to intensify talks or produce detailed legal texts.“We hope that the EU will change their position; we’re certainly not saying if they do change their position that we can’t talk to them,” he said.Asked by Sky News if Barnier should come to London, Gove said the ball was “in his court”.EU diplomats and officials cast Johnson’s move as little more than rhetoric, portraying it as a frantic bid to secure concessions before a last-minute deal was done, and European leaders have asked Barnier to continue talks.“A DEAL, BUT NOT AT ANY PRICE”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said compromises on both sides would be needed. French President Emmanuel Macron said Britain needed a Brexit deal more than the 27-nation EU, which remained united.“We are ready for a deal, but not at any price,” Macron said.A “no deal” finale to the United Kingdom’s five-year Brexit crisis would disrupt the operations of manufacturers, retailers, farmers and nearly every other sector - just as the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic worsens.“It is not my preferred destination,” Gove said in an opinion piece in the Sunday Times.“But if the choice is between arrangements that tie our hands indefinitely, or where we can shape our own future, then that’s no choice at all. And leaving on Australian terms is an outcome for which we are increasingly well prepared.”Critics say that an “Australian-style” deal is simply code for no deal at all with Britain’s largest export market.Britain is launching a campaign this week urging businesses to step up preparations for a no-deal exit. In a statement accompanying the launch, Gove says: “Make no mistake, there are changes coming in just 75 days and time is running out for businesses to act.”More than 70 British business groups representing over 7 million workers on Sunday urged politicians to get back to the negotiating table next week and strike a deal.“With compromise and tenacity, a deal can be done. Businesses call on leaders on both sides to find a route through,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-britain-eu-blame-game-continues-post-brexit-trade-deal-still-possible/story-5uUEboodomok6tUXoIOwCI.html

The record-shattering figure is being driven in part by concerns about crowds at polling sites on Election Day amid the coronavirus pandemic.Trump, a Republican, was spending his Sunday in Nevada, a state he hopes to wrest away from Democrats after narrowly losing it in 2016.The president, who rarely goes to church but has remained popular among evangelical Christians for his opposition to abortion and for appointing conservative judges, began his day by attending a service at the International Church of Las Vegas. Trump, who recently came down with his own bout of COVID-19, did not wear a mask for the indoor service.One of the church’s pastors, Denise Goulet, said to Trump from the stage that God had told her he would win the 2020 election. Trump put a handful of $20 bills into an offering bucket and bowed his head during a prayer. Biden flew to North Carolina, a battleground where 1.4 million, or 20%, of the state’s registered voters had already voted as of Sunday morning.The former vice president’s campaign said he would urge residents to make a plan to vote as early as possible at an event in Durham, while also detailing his proposals to lessen economic inequality for Black Americans.His pick for vice president, Senator Kamala Harris, canceled in-person events over the weekend as a precaution after an aide tested positive for COVID-19. She will return to the campaign trail on Monday with a visit to Florida to mark that state’s first day of early in-person voting. Trump will campaign every day leading up to Thursday’s debate in Florida, including stops in Arizona and North Carolina, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. While Trump lags in opinion polls at a national level and in many battleground states, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said over the weekend that the national figures are misleading because must-win states are close.“We cannot become complacent because the very searing truth is that Donald Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire,” she wrote in a memo to donors.US presidential elections are determined by electoral votes, allotted to US states and territories based largely on their populations, rather than by a tally of the popular vote nationwide.Trump campaigned on Saturday in Michigan and Wisconsin, two battleground states he narrowly won in the 2016 election.In Muskegeon, Mich., he attacked Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, for imposing restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus and made light of a right-wing plot uncovered by the FBI to kidnap her.“Hopefully you’ll be sending her packing pretty soon,” Trump said, prompting the crowd to yell back “Lock her up!” several times.Whitmer said on Sunday’s “Meet the Press” on NBC that the president’s rhetoric was “incredibly disturbing” and “dangerous” for her and her family as well as other politicians whom he targets.Opinion polls have shown a high level of concern among voters about the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 219,000 people in the United States and hammered the economy.While the virus is deadliest for older people, the pandemic is motivating young voters as well, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 13. Among likely voters aged 34 and under, 25% named COVID-19 as their top concern when picking a president, while jobs and the economy were cited by 20%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-woos-evangelical-christians-in-nevada-rally/story-pexxQ4twRPbPk1M0L0GukM.html
19-10-2020||World||UAE minister faces Scotland Yard investigation after allegations of sexual assault arise||A British woman working on a literary festival in the United Arab Emirates, has alleged she was sexually assaulted in February by the UAE minister for tolerance, according to The Sunday Times newspaper.Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, 69, who has denied any wrongdoing, is being investigated by Scotland Yard, the newspaper said in an article on Sunday.The assault allegedly happened when Hay literary festival worker Caitlin McNamara, 32, who has waived her right to anonymity, visited the minister at a private island villa on Valentine’s day, the report said.The alleged victim said the attack occurred when she accepted an invitation to meet the sheikh shortly before the opening of the inaugural Hay Festival Abu Dhabi.In the UK, she later made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police who are investigating it as an allegation of rape, the report added.Chair of the Hay Festival board, Caroline Michel, said: “What happened to our friend and colleague Caitlin McNamara in Abu Dhabi last February was an appalling violation and a hideous abuse of trust and position.“Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan made a mockery of his ministerial responsibilities and tragically undermined his government’s attempt to work with Hay Festival to promote free speech and female empowerment,” The Sunday Times report quoted her as saying in a statement.London libel lawyers Schillings told The Sunday Times: “Our client is surprised and saddened by this allegation, which arrives eight months after the alleged incident and via a national newspaper. The account is denied.”The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a woman contacted officers in July to report an allegation of rape.“An initial statement has been taken from the woman,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-minister-faces-scotland-yard-investigation-after-allegations-of-sexual-assault-arise/story-pYMcoDMzkw3RuqItrp5OVP.html
19-10-2020||World||Pakistan most likely to stay in ‘grey list’ of terror funding watchdog||Pakistan’s failure to fulfil six key obligations of the FATF, including action against two of India’s most wanted terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, and the sudden disappearance of more than 4,000 terrorists from its official list will most likely lead to its continuation in the ‘grey list’ of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, officials said on Sunday.The virtual plenary of the Financial Action Task Force, to be held on October 21-23, will take the final call on Pakistan’s continuation on its grey list after a thorough review of Islamabad’s performance in fulfilling the global commitments and standards in the fight against money laundering and terror financing. The FATF had given Pakistan a total of 27 action plan obligations for completely checking terror financing of which so far it has cleared 21 but has failed in some of the key tasks, an official privy to the developments said.The mandates which Pakistan has failed include action against all UN-designated terrorists like Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Azhar, Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Seed and the outfit’s operational commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.Besides, FATF has strongly noted that there was sudden disappearance of the names of more than 4,000 terrorists from its original list of 7,600 under Schedule IV of its Anti Terrorism Act. “Under these circumstances, it is almost certain that Pakistan will continue in the FATF grey list,” the official said.Also, the four nominating countries — the US, UK, France and Germany — are also not satisfied with Islamabad’s commitment to taking strong action against the terror groups operating from its With Pakistan’s continuation in the grey list, it is increasingly becoming difficult for Islamabad to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the country which is in a precarious financial situation.Outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for them, another official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-most-likely-to-stay-in-grey-list-of-terror-funding-watchdog/story-TRR7EVS8RsLEncecaxyocL.html
19-10-2020||World||Twitter blocks tweet from Trump adviser downplaying face-masks||Twitter blocked a post Sunday from an adviser to President Donald Trump who suggested that masks do not work to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Scott Atlas, who joined the White House in August as a science adviser, had tweeted “Masks work? NO,” and said widespread use of masks is not supported.The tweet violated a Twitter policy that prohibits sharing false or misleading misinformation about Covid-19 that could lead to harm, a company spokesperson said. The policy bans statements that have been confirmed to be false or misleading by experts such as public health authorities.In such cases, Twitter disables the account until its owner deletes the post in question.Trump has downplayed the importance of masks in reducing the spread of the virus, even after he contracted the disease, which has killed more than 215,000 Americans.“I don’t understand why the tweets were deleted,” Atlas said in an email, calling Twitter’s actions censorship. He said his tweet was intended to show that “general population masks and mask mandates do not work,” and he clarified that the correct policy is to use masks when one cannot socially distance. Atlas added that infections exploded even with mandates in Los Angeles County, Miami-Dade County, Hawaii, Alabama, the Philippines, Japan and other places.Researchers have concluded that masks can control the spread of the virus, and public health experts have urged the public to wear them. But Trump and his team often go without masks while campaigning.Atlas, the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center and a fellow at Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution, has no expertise in public health or infectious diseases. He has criticized the coronavirus lockdowns and campaigned for children to return to classrooms. Some scientists view Atlas as promoting dangerous theories around “herd immunity.”Last week, Twitter and Facebook moved quickly to limit the spread of an unverified political story published by the conservative-leaning New York Post. The story cited unverified emails from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son, and it has not been confirmed by other publications. There have been no new tweets from the Post since Oct. 14, indicating Twitter may still be blocking the newspaper’s tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-blocks-tweet-from-trump-adviser-downplaying-face-masks/story-DJ7gik2zzgXl5jYylek1yN.html
19-10-2020||World||Start of the fourth global Covid-19 wave||As the global case tally of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crossed the 40 million mark, the outbreak appears to have entered the fourth and strongest (yet) wave. The latest spurt of infections is fuelled by the second wave in most European nations, the third in the United States, and the tail-end of the first wave in India and South America. Here is a look at the countries that are behind the still-rising casesClick here for full Covid-19 coverage1. Global Covid-19 cases at a new all-time highThe first wave of the infections started in China at the start of the year with the first batch of infections reported in December 2019. After a rapid initial outbreak, China managed to control the outbreak by the end of February, marking the end of the first wave. The second wave started in March in Europe, with Italy as the earliest hot spot along with Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany. The virus started gripping the US by May, which marked the start of the third wave. This wave flattened through August and September, largely due to a recent plateau in daily cases in the US and Brazil. India became the global epicentre around early August 2. Where is this wave coming from?Third wave starts in the USThe US has reported an average of 55,917 new cases every day in the past week, according to Worldometers.info. This is the highest that the seven-day average of new infections has touched in the country since early August when the second wave of infections was receding. New infections are rising in most parts of the country with states such as Florida, Texas and California, all of which were hit hard in the second wave, reporting most cases since August. Scientists warn that the third wave is likely to surpass the peaks of the second wave. Europe’s second wave surpasses the firstThe new case trajectory in Europe is at an all-time high with new infections crossing 150,000 for the first time on Friday, just a week after daily infections on the continent surpassed the 100,000 mark for the first time. Nations such as Russia, France, Spain and UK are all reporting a record daily numbers of infections in their second waves. In the light of the new wave, many countries have imposed curbs on movement — for instance, a night-time curfew came into effect in France from Saturday.  India’s 1st wave dips, but still highest in worldFor a month now, new cases in India appear to be dipping consistently – the first time this has happened since the outbreak started in early March. For the week ending on Saturday, India reported 63,025 new cases every day — a drop of 33% from the peak recorded in mid-September, and the lowest this number has touched since the middle of June. However, India remains the country with the worst current trajectory of daily cases. To be sure, the US is set to retake the spot as it has reporting 55,917 daily cases in the last week, and the curve is rising there. 3. Deaths from 2nd wave remain worst While every wave of cases has been stronger than the one it precedes, the same can’t be said for deaths. With time, scientists are becoming better at saving lives from Covid-19 and as a result, the peak of deaths reported during the second wave of cases has never been surpassed. This is despite the fact that the third, and now fourth, waves have had a far higher number of cases. This is something that has helped countries like India (which saw its peak in the third global wave) keep its mortality rate better than the world average||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/start-of-the-fourth-global-covid-19-wave/story-4jwp8sj51gLTZ9NrUfctVK.html

The pathogen that causes the flu survives on human skin for about 1.8 hours by comparison, said the study published this month in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal. “The nine-hour survival of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus strain that causes Covid-19) on human skin may increase the risk of contact transmission in comparison with IAV (influenza A virus), thus accelerating the pandemic,” it said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe research team tested skin collected from autopsy specimens, about one day after death. Both the coronavirus and the flu virus are inactivated within 15 seconds by applying ethanol, which is used in hand sanitisers.“The longer survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin increases contact-transmission risk; however, hand hygiene can reduce this risk,” the study said.The study backs World Health Organization guidance for regular and thorough hand washing to limit transmission of the virus, which has infected nearly 40 million people around the world since it first emerged in China late last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-remains-active-on-human-skin-for-9-hours-study/story-9IqRzq6AAuZcqTQbY76PiO.html
19-10-2020||World||‘We are not afraid’: France rallies after beheading of teacher||Tens of thousands of people rallied in Paris and cities across France on Sunday in solidarity with a teacher beheaded for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.Demonstrators on the Place de la Republique held aloft posters declaring: “No to totalitarianism of thought” and “I am a teacher” in memory of murdered colleague Samuel Paty.“You do not scare us. We are not afraid. You will not divide us. We are France!” tweeted Prime Minister Jean Castex, who joined the Paris demonstration.Castex was accompanied by Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo and junior interior minister Marlene Schiappa who said she was there “in support of teachers, of secularism, of freedom of expression”. Politicians from the other major parties also attended.Also Read | Paris beheading: Suspect in teacher’s attack in France was Chechen teenSome in the crowd chanted “I am Samuel”, echoing the “I am Charlie” cry that travelled around the world after Islamist gunmen killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in 2015 for publishing caricatures of the Islamic prophet.Between bursts of applause, others recited: “Freedom of expression, freedom to teach.”“I am here as a teacher, as a mother, as a Frenchwoman and as a republican,” said participant Virginie.The Charlie Hebdo attack in 2015 unleashed a wave of Islamist violence and forced France into a national discussion about Islam’s place in a secular society.After the massacre at the magazine, some 1.5 million people gathered on the same Place de la Republique in support of freedom of expression. ‘Things have to change’Local authorities said around 12,000 people rallied in Lyon in eastern France.In Toulouse, in the southwest, around 5,000 turned out. “The entire educational community is affected, and beyond it society as a whole,” teachers union representative Bernard Deswarte said there.Hundreds more assembled in Nice on the south coast, where in 2016 a man killed 86 people when he rammed a truck into a crowd on the July 14 national holiday.“Everyone is in danger today,” said student Valentine Mule, 18, attending the Nice rally. “Things have to change.”There were other marches in the eastern city of Strasbourg, in Lille in the north, and in the southern cities of Marseille and Montpellier. Samuel Paty was murdered on his way home from the school where he taught in a suburb northwest of Paris on Friday afternoon.A photo of the teacher and a message confessing to his murder was found on the mobile phone of his killer, 18-year-old Chechen Abdullakh Anzorov, who was shot dead by police.Witnesses said the suspect was spotted at the school on Friday asking pupils where he could find Paty.On Saturday, anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said Paty had been the target of online threats for showing the cartoons to his civics class.Depictions of the prophet are widely regarded as taboo in Islam.Online campaignThe father of one schoolgirl had launched an online call for “mobilisation” against the teacher and had sought his dismissal from the school.The aggrieved father had named Paty and given the school’s address in a social media post just days before the beheading, which President Emmanuel Macron has labelled an Islamist terror attack.The father and a known Islamist militant who was involved in his campaign against Paty are among those arrested, along with four members of Anzorov’s family. An 11th person was taken into custody on Sunday, a judicial source said, without providing details.Ricard did not say if the assailant had any links to the school or had acted independently in response to the online campaign.The Russian embassy in Paris said Anzorov’s family arrived in France from Chechnya when he was six to seek asylum.Locals in the Normandy town of Evreux where the attacker lived described him as low key, saying he got into fights as a child but had calmed down as he became increasingly religious in recent years.Friday’s attack was the second of its kind since a trial started last month over the Charlie Hebdo killings.The magazine republished the controversial cartoons in the run-up to the trial, and last month a young Pakistani man wounded two people with a meat cleaver outside Charlie Hebdo’s former office. ‘Doing his job’According to his school, Paty had given Muslim children the option to leave the classroom before he showed the cartoons, saying he did not want their feelings hurt.Kamel Kabtane, rector of the mosque of Lyon and a senior Muslim figure, told AFP on Sunday that Paty was merely been “doing his job” and had been “respectful” in doing so.Ministers in France’s defence council on Sunday agreed to step up security at schools when they return after half term.Action would also be taken against anyone expressing support for the attack.And authorities will be looking into the authors of 80 messages of support for the attacker from Monday, the Elysee added.A national tribute is to be held for Paty on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-not-afraid-france-rallies-after-beheading-of-teacher/story-AVp4Vg3VauhBGOltWDjjjK.html
19-10-2020||World||Livid Imran Khan vows to jail Nawaz Sharif as oppn holds 2nd rally||As the joint opposition movement held its second rally on Sunday, Pakistan government went into overdrive to reply to the speeches made at its first major meeting.A visibly upset and angry Prime Minister Imran Khan told a conference of his supporters in Islamabad on Saturday that he would get “tougher” with the opposition leaders and put them all behind bars. “Come back and see where I put you,” he said in reference to exiled former prime minister and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, at whom he largely directed his ire. “Now I will try my best to bring you back and put you in common prison, not VIP.” Khan told his supporters that the 11-party Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) thrust was to create a rift between his government, the judiciary and the army. “I will not let that happen,” said Khan, who also made fun of PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz, whom he called a “Naani” (grandmother).Other ministers attacked PDM leaders over the weekend. Railways minister Shaikh Rasheed, seen to be close to the military, told a press conference, “Now it is a free for all. We will not hold back.” Also targeted were Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who had said in his speech at the Gujranwala rally on Saturday that he was not sure who brought Punjab chief minister Usman Buzdar to power. “Was it a Jadugarni (witch) or a Khalai Makhluq (extra terrestrial being)?” he asked. He was referring to Imran Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi, herself a political and religious figure who is known to make decisions in the province and to ISI, the powerful intelligence agency. In response, minister Fawad Chaudhry said it was strange that the PDM was holding a rally in Karachi on the anniversary of the attack on Benazir Bhutto. “Benazir Bhutto was attacked by the Taliban and today the PDM, which is led by a Taliban sympathiser (Maulana Fazul Rehman), is paying tribute to her.”As the PDM continues its rallies all over the country, the political temperature in Pakistan has started to rise. Apart from personal attacks, there has been a rise in questions about the role of the army in the political affairs of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/livid-imran-khan-vows-to-jail-nawaz-sharif-as-oppn-holds-2nd-rally/story-UzTEHoGu0xgGooENgUN4mK.html
19-10-2020||World||Hard hit by coronavirus, airlines push for tests over quarantines||What will it take to get people flying again? International air traffic is down 92% this year as travelers worry about catching Covid-19 and government travel bans and quarantine rules make planning difficult. One thing airlines believe could help is to have rapid virus tests of all passengers before departure.Scattered experiments on improving safety are under way around the world, and a UN organization is leading talks to set guidelines. There is a lot at stake. With no end in sight to the pandemic, the near total halt to international travel will hinder economies as they try to bounce back from recession and return to normal levels of business activity. Millions of jobs - at airlines, airports and travel related businesses such as hotels and restaurants - are affected.Here’s a look at some of the key issues.___WHY IS THE FOCUS ON TESTING?One major factor keeping people from taking long-haul flights is the fear they will be seated next to someone with Covid-19, according to a survey by the International Air Transport Association. While flying helped carry the virus around the world initially, airplanes themselves have so far not been proven to be super-spreader locations the way business conferences and meat-packing plants have been.Most people are also reluctant to fly into a quarantine that restricts their activities for up to two weeks after arrival. Quarantines themselves aren’t perfect in terms of stopping the virus from spreading, as in some cases they’re not strictly enforced.“Testing all passengers will give people back their freedom to travel with confidence. And that will put millions of people back to work,” says Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO.___HOW WOULD TESTING WORK?Initial trials focus on testing passengers before departure, either at the airport or remotely. Information about the test result could be documented through a smartphone app. Newer tests can give results in less than an hour.___WHAT DO HEALTH AUTHORITIES SAY?They are open to the idea but are still assessing how effective it would be.The US Centers for Disease Control noted that testing technology, capacity and access to testing is improving. It added that “efforts are currently ongoing internationally to assess the risk reduction, determine what a feasible testing regime for air travel may look like, and gain some level of agreement on standards for a harmonized approach to testing globally in air transportation.”___WHO’S GOING TO DECIDE THIS?The IATA is calling for rapid, accurate and scalable testing for all passengers. After airline executives appealed for help on this from the European Union and the White House’s Covid-19 task force, the issue appears to have moved to a United Nations forum, the International Civil Aviation Organization based in Montreal.The ICAO is working on guidelines based on scientific advice that countries could use in establishing testing regimes. The issue is on the agenda for an Oct. 29 meeting, but that’s not a guarantee that guidelines will be approved.___WHAT TRIALS ARE UNDER WAY?Various forms of testing have been tried for weeks in different places. What airlines want is a larger-scale international approach.For instance, China requires a time-consuming negative polymerase chain reaction test before departure. At Frankfurt’s international airport, diagnostics firm Centogene has been offering tests to non-symptomatic people for 59 euros ($69) for a result within 12 hours and 139 euros for six hours. A doctor’s certificate - for another 25 euros - can help avoid quarantine restrictions.The Switzerland-based Commons Project Foundation and the World Economic Forum are holding trials this month for CommonPass, a digital health pass that lets travellers securely document compliance with COVID-19 test requirements through a QR code on their smartphones or on paper. The idea is to get around the problems posed by printed test results, which may be from unfamiliar labs or in a language that those inspecting them don’t know.Cathay Pacific has trialled CommonPass with volunteers on a Hong Kong-Singapore flight and United Airlines will test it between London Heathrow and Newark Liberty International. The CDC’s Martin S. Cetron, head of the global migration and quarantine division, says it is “eager to learn” from the trials and that CommonPass “could be one of the many potential tools.” CommonPass could be adopted by individual countries, without waiting for international agreements.___WHAT’S THE HOLDUP?There are a lot of moving parts to any testing regime. First off, the test must be accurate, fast and cheap enough to deploy on a large scale. Governments must agree to accept the results; while governments are represented in the ICAO, the organization’s guidelines will not be mandatory. There has to be a way of certifying the result, while at the same time protecting privacy of passenger medical information, and a procedure for handling people who test positive.Scientists warn there are concerns about the accuracy of some rapid tests. People can test negative for a couple of days after being infected. People can be infectious before they show symptoms, and these people may also test negative.___IS TESTING THE ONLY SOLUTION?The International Air Transport Association advocates a layered approach. In addition to testing, that means: social distancing at the airport, touchless check-in, wearing masks in flight, and limiting passenger movement in the cabin.In a survey published in May, consulting firm McKinsey asked 40 corporate travel planners what would give them the confidence to book travel. Seventy-five percent said they would want a vaccine, while 39% said testing. McKinsey said business travel spending exceeded $1.4 trillion in 2018, or 21% of the global travel and hospitality sector. Business travellers drive 55% to 75% of the profit at top airlines - even though they make up less than 10% of passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hard-hit-by-coronavirus-airlines-push-for-tests-over-quarantines/story-cv5lZ1acKMrVtnmxA48RbK.html
19-10-2020||World||Donald Trump says he’d go over $1.8 trillion on stimulus, blames Nancy Pelosi for delay||President Donald Trump said he’d support a virus relief package in excess of $1.8 trillion -- his administration’s most recent negotiating proposal -- and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for delaying a deal.“We’re not holding it up, she’s holding it up,” Trump said in an interview Thursday on Fox Business. “She wants to wait until after the election. She thinks it hurts the Republicans.”Pelosi is scheduled to have another call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Thursday in a continuing saga of talks on another stimulus for the economy. Democrats want a $2.2 trillion aid plan, including a number of priorities that Republicans reject. Pelosi has accused the administration of not taking the impact of the coronavirus pandemic seriously.“Absolutely I would” go over $1.8 trillion, Trump said Thursday, echoing his recent mantra “go big or go home.”However, Trump faces another hurdle beside Pelosi to getting such a deal -- Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP lawmakers have resisted any plan of much more than $1 trillion. Some Republican senators have questioned whether any additional stimulus is needed.McConnell, speaking in Kentucky Thursday, reaffirmed his plan to put a narrow bill worth roughly $500 billion on the Senate floor next week. He said the proposal is “what we think is appropriate to tackle this dread disease.”He said he doesn’t expect Democrats to support it. “They still are insisting on upwards of a $2.5 trillion grab bag,” McConnell said of the larger package passed by House Democrats. He has been among those expressing skepticism about getting anything done before Election Day.Investor disappointment over the continuing impasse in the U.S. and new virus restrictions in Europe have contributed to declines in the S&P 500 Index this week. The gauge was down 0.6% as of 11:19 a.m. New York time, heading for a third consecutive drop.Mnuchin said earlier Thursday that Pelosi’s “all or nothing approach doesn’t make sense for the American people,” but that the administration is “not giving up” trying for an agreement.Trump indicated he’d be open to calling Pelosi on the stimulus but doubted it would result in a deal. The two haven’t spoken directly in about a year.Trump, who canceled negotiations last week and only days later reversed course to advocate a bigger stimulus than congressional Republicans support, said that Pelosi has “a lot of mental health problems and it’s going to be very hard to do anything with her.”The president and speaker have each been questioning each other’s mental faculties. Pelosi said last week that Trump was “in an altered state right now,” and she suggested to colleagues that his thinking might be affected by the steroids he was given as treatment for Covid-19.Trump and Mnuchin both said they’d like to deploy leftover funds from the March stimulus act. McConnell’s proposal would use such money to help small businesses, though Democrats have opposed a piecemeal approach to providing assistance.Mnuchin said that there is $300 billion left from the Cares Act that is “sitting in the Treasury bank account right now, ready to go” if Congress could approve it for repurposing.The Treasury chief also said, speaking on CNBC, that he wouldn’t let differences with Pelosi on a national coronavirus testing plan get in the way of a deal. The House speaker said Wednesday that she was hoping to get “better language back” on that issue Thursday.Other roadblocks to a deal have included differences on tax credits for lower-income families and for real-estate and other businesses, along with the magnitude of support for state and local authorities.Meanwhile, the economy continues to show evidence of the impact of a withdrawal of past fiscal stimulus -- just as anticipated by Federal Reserve policy makers and private economists alike.Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped last week to the highest since August, a report showed Thursday. Initial jobless claims in regular state programs totaled 898,000 in the week ended Oct. 10, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, Labor Department data showed Thursday.Trump said Thursday that he did still think a stimulus deal is possible before Nov. 3 -- “because I think there’s a lot of pressure on Pelosi.”Yet when Trump was asked whether he told Mnuchin to seek a bigger stimulus package, the president expressed frustration with his main negotiator.“I’ve told him,” Trump said on Fox Business. “So far he hasn’t come home with the bacon.”Trump’s own undermining of his team, by endorsing a bigger package than they have fought for -- and that Senate Republicans oppose -- has encouraged the Democrats to hold out.“Pelosi suggests that she has the leverage in negotiations with Mnuchin since President Trump seems anxious for a big pre-election deal,” said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The closer to the election a deal might be reached, the better for Democrats and the worse for Trump.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-would-go-higher-than-1-8-trillion-on-coronavirus-stimulus-deal/story-b8GP9zbnPWAc9f6X8611KN.html

And, despite such a large number of positive cases, I don’t know what is their issue, they (Centre) can admit it clearly. If positive cases coming in lakhs are not termed community spread, when will it be called a community spread. Never saw positive cases in such a large number,” Jain told reporters.The Delhi health minister also asserted that the sero-prevalance survey in September found that 25 per cent of the sampled people had anti-bodies to Covid-19, meaning around 50 lakh people got affected and cured.“So, they (Centre) will know what is their problem in admitting that there is a community spread,” he said.Health ministry officials had said the World Health Organisation has not given any standard definition of community transmission. The WHO permits its member-nations to assess the spread of the disease, based on their own analysis of the situation, and do their reporting, which the global body shows on its website.On the ongoing October sero-prevalance survey, Jain said it started on October 15 and will go on for a few more days.The Delhi minister also asserted that the Covid-19 situation in the national capital was “better” than what it was a month or so ago.“The peak of cases seems to have got a bit lowered,” he said.On the festival season approaching and the chances of infection spread, Jain said, “I would once again appeal to people to wear masks and maintain social distancing, in markets and elsewhere, to contain the spread of infection”.Asked if there was any shortage of blood in its banks, he said, “Plasma is the main thing required for Covid-19 patient, blood bank situation is fine as of now”.“Also of the total number of beds at our disposal, only 30 per cent is occupied,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-admit-it-clearly-delhi-health-minister-on-govt-s-stance-on-community-transmission/story-lkKHf2vG4QmJ46hNMDah5L.html

All the victims belong to a tribal colony and the liquor is suspected to have been procured from Tamil Nadu. Initial reports suggest spurious liquor is behind the deaths but a clearer picture will emerge only after post-mortem, Palakkad police superintendent Siva Vikram said after visiting the village. Two women are among those who have been hospitalised. According to villagers, one of the deceased K Sivan (37) brought country-made liquor when he went to neighbouring Tamil Nadu and later distributed it among the villagers. His wife is among those hospitalised. They said after consuming it some of them complained of blurred vision and burning sensation in their stomachs. Last month in Idukki, one person had died and two were hospitalised after consuming spurious liquor. Later, the Excise Department found that sanitizer had been mixed with country-made liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-die-after-consuming-spurious-liquor-in-kerala-9-in-hospital/story-vpJhxVxU34pyg1zcKO2VPM.html
19-10-2020||India||Odisha to bring special law for managing 11th century Lingaraj temple||More than six and half decades after it brought in a special Act to manage the affairs of the 12th century Jagannath temple in Puri, the Odisha government has drafted a similar Act to manage the rituals and other activities of the 11th century Lingaraj temple, the biggest temple in Bhubaneswar.The Lingaraj Temple Act, 2020 (a draft of which is with HT) would free the temple in old Bhubaneswar area from the Odisha Hindu Religious Endowment Act and put the Shiva temple under the control of Lingaraj Temple Managing Committee with a full-time administrator looking after day-to-day affairs of the shrine. The Jagannath temple was the first temple in Odisha to have a special Act made for it in 1955 after being under British control for a long time.A law department official said the draft Act would be discussed on Tuesday before being brought in as a Bill in the winter session of the Assembly next month.Under Lingaraj Temple Act, a fund would be created in which the income derived from the movable and immovable properties of the temple would be deposited. Besides, donations and offerings by the pilgrims and devotees in Hundies would be deposited in that fund. The temple has around 1500 acre in various parts of the state and the land in most of the places are under encroachment.The move to have a special law for Lingaraj temple came after chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s tour to Puri on Saturday to take stock of the Rs 3,200 crore package for infrastructure development of the temple town. Patnaik on Saturday went around the Jagannath temple, which has been shut since March due to pandemic, and ordered quick completion of the beautification project around it.In January this year, Patnaik had visited the famous Maa Samaleswari temple in western Odisha district of Sambalpur to offer his prayers. Prayers over, Patnaik announced that an expert team will soon assess the requirements of the temple and the devotees and based on that the state government will take further steps.The same month, he visited Baripada town of Mayurbhanj district, announcing a grant of Rs 5 crore for the development of the temple. In December last year, the Odisha CM had announced a Rs 5 crore package each for the Baladevjew temples of Kendrapara town.Though some Congress workers on Saturday showed him black flag on his way, political analysts say the BJD’s temple moves are concerted efforts to portray a soft Hindutva image.“BJP is already the party’s main opponent in Odisha and by 2024 it would mount a major challenge to unseat the regional party. As BJP is likely to play the religious card in a deeply religious state like Odisha, the BJD may be trying to deny BJP the same. It’s a very calculated move,” said political science professor Gyana Ranjan Swain of Ravenshaw University in Cuttack.Swain said the move to have a special Act for Lingaraj temple and beautification of Jagannath temple would help the regional party set a separate narrative on religion. “BJD’s mobilisation on temples is an attempt in initiating a separate discourse on religion that would be different from BJP. The party surely does not want to give the BJP any edge on this matter.”Political analyst Rabi Das said while BJD’s moves on the temple were a tactic to stop the BJP’s growth in a religious place like Odisha, it wants to take advantage of BJP’s predicament in matters of religion. “While BJP may try to criticise BJD in demolition of some temples around Jagannath temple and Lingaraj temple, the truth is a majority of people in Odisha support the government’s move. The temple beautification drive also helps the state’s tourism as a large part of the domestic tourists come to Odisha for its temples,” said Das.However, BJP leader Sajjan Sharma said having special Act for Lingaraj temple or beautification of the temples would not hide the government’s failure in temple management. “The government is yet to account for the properties in Jagannath temple treasury as it is yet to be opened. For the last 9 months, Jagannath temple has been closed while thousands of devotees and priests want it to be opened. Merely beautifying temples would not give BJD any Hindutva appeal,” said Sharma.BJD leaders said the special Act for Lingaraj temple as well as beautification of the temples should not be seen from a religious angle. “If the government is taking steps for better management as beautification of the exterior of our temples then more and more tourists will come. These temples would be our growth engines,” said Bijay Nayak of BJD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-bring-special-law-for-managing-11th-century-lingaraj-temple/story-qtUVF49uPkZ4eHJtH2hsxK.html
19-10-2020||India||‘We have learnt to work in Covid-era’||Away from his ‘karmbhoomi’ Mumbai, actor Neeraj Sood has made Mandi, Himachal Pradesh his current base in the time of Covid crisis. Currently, the ‘Jabariaya Jodi’ actor is operating from his hometown. The actor recently wrapped up his first OTT series ‘Jackson’ in Lucknow and will be going to Agra for a film shoot in November. “Compared to Mumbai, it’s very safe in mountains and people are very much aware and cautious. I was surprised to see locals in Lucknow roaming around without masks as if corona period is over,” said the actor currently in self-quarantine. During his stay in the city he feared contracting the deadly virus. “Since I came from mountains to Lucknow, I had a bad cold and cough. I got scared! Thankfully, with steam inhalation and ‘khadha’ I recovered. People have learnt to work in the given conditions. There is no other option!” The actor has done a lot of work in UP belt. “Last I shot ‘Pati Patni aur Woh’ in Lucknow, ‘Yahan Sabhi Gyani Hain’ in Kanpur, TV show ‘Krishna Chali London’ in Malihabad (also by Jackson director Saurabh Tewari), a film in Agra and ‘Shubh Mangal Savdhan’ in Rishikesh. Again, I’ll return to Agra (for a film starring Pulkit Samrat) for a 20-day schedule and then I will be shooting another film in Bhopal. So, I’m on a work mode.” The actor has two theatrical releases coming up this year. “First to hit the screen is Abhishek Sharma’s ‘Suraj pe Mangal Bhari’ where I play a pandit who fixes marriages. It’s a comic role while in December Kabir Khan’s ‘83’ will release where I play a BCCI official which is a small yet powerful role.” Having done a lot of TV dailies he is avoiding small screen for now. “I have stopped doing TV for now to keep my dates free for films. Films that were stalled during lockdown are now being scheduled. Though a lot of small screen offers are coming my way but I’m avoiding taking up work in Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/we-have-learnt-to-work-in-covid-era/story-yyVRFl3mLhAa3pvXYoHbrL.html
19-10-2020||India||‘People thought I am some crazy guy!’||Actor Faissal Khan best remembered for his last film ‘Mela,’ is all elated to be back on screen with his directorial debut, a romantic-thriller. The film will mark his comeback almost after two decades. “You can call it a comeback but truly I was very much around working on ideas and scripting them. It was in 2016, that I got an idea from a newspaper for the subject of my upcoming film and that’s when I started working on it. Finally, after all pre-production I was able to start the shoot in 2019,” said Faissal. He has previously assisted on superhits like ‘Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak,’ and ‘Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander’ for Mansoor Khan whereas ‘Tum Mere Ho’ with his late father Tahir Hussain. Faissal shares that working on his new film ‘Facctory’ was nowhere an easy task. “No one was ready to believe in my vision thinking I am some crazy guy. But I had to resurrect myself and leave behind those tough days. I gave my all to make people trust me. It was difficult to even find a team but I strongly feel all’s well that ends well. The film is complete and at present we plan for an OTT streaming. A few big production houses have monopoly on theatres but thanks to OTT that things are looking up for beginners like me.” For his film the actor has donned many hats. “I enjoy the creative process that goes in making a film. Multi-tasking kept me on my toes and I enjoyed directing, co-writing, singing and acting all of it but in future I will prefer directing on larger canvas,” Faissal said. Giving his take on various controversies doing round in the industry, Faissal said, “See we live in a country where film-stars have always been idolized so the expectations are too high so when that image of perfection gets tarnished a lot of hearts are broken. I believe if one has hurt someone somewhere, he or she should own up and let life move on. Audience here is too emotional and forgives. Though I am not into groupism or gangism but I’m sure it does exist like in any other industry that’s why I decided to fly solo as that’s the best way to be. I try my best to concentrate on my work and support my team…rest follows!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/people-thought-i-am-some-crazy-guy/story-ds8NZDfBnVST5Tighn2rcK.html

Details of the meeting are not available yet. Several persons on both sides were injured when villagers of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam clashed with residents of Vairengte in Kolasib district of neighbouring Mizoram on Saturday night. The clashes reportedly started after some people from the Mizoram side torched some huts made by Lailapur residents on a disputed portion of the border between the two states.Meanwhile, officials from the two states also held talks on Monday at Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam along the border in a bid to resolve the flare-up amicably through confidence building measures. Superintendent of police Cachar Bhanwar Lal Meena held discussions with his counterpart from Kolasib district in Mizoram Vanlalfaka Ralte and agreed to ensure peace and decided to help resume movement of trucks immediately. The officials agreed to provide point-to-point escort to the trucks.Due to the flare-up and subsequent blockade of roads leading to Mizoram by some sections on the Assam side, hundreds of trucks had got stranded along the border in the past two days. Earlier today, Mizoram’s home department issued a release, assuring truck drivers from Assam and other parts of the country that their vehicles are safe within the state.Mukesh Aggarwal Special DGP (Border) Assam Police said that the border issue has to be addressed through a conciliatory approach and added the process might take some time as it has to go through certain process and mechanism.Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km long boundary.

19-10-2020||India||By February, 50% of Indians may have had coronavirus: Government panel estimates||At least half of India’s 1.3 billion people are likely to have been infected with the new coronavirus by next February, helping slow the spread of the disease, a member of a federal government committee tasked with providing projections said on Monday.India has so far reported 7.55 million cases of the coronavirus and is second only to the United States in terms of total infections.But Covid-19 infections are decreasing in India after a peak in mid-September, with 61,390 new cases reported on average each day, according to a Reuters tally.“Our mathematical model estimates that around 30% of the population is currently infected and it could go up to 50% by February,” Manindra Agrawal, a professor at the Indian Institute for Technology in Kanpur and a committee member, told Reuters.The committee’s estimate for the current spread of the virus is much higher than the federal government’s serological surveys, which showed that only around 14 per cent of the population had been infected, as of September.But Agrawal said serological surveys might not be able to get sampling absolutely correct because of the sheer size of the population that they were surveying.Instead, the committee of virologists, scientists and other experts, whose report was made public on Sunday, has relied on a mathematical model.“We have evolved a new model which explicitly takes into account unreported cases, so we can divide infected people into two categories – reported cases and infections that do not get reported,” Agrawal said.The committee warned that their projections would not hold up if precautions were not followed, and cases could spike by up to 2.6 million infections in a single month if measures such as social distancing and wearing masks were ignored.Experts have warned that infections could rise in India as the holiday season nears, with celebrations for the Hindu festivals of Durga Puja and Diwali due this month and in mid-November, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/by-february-50-of-indians-may-have-had-coronavirus-government-panel-estimates/story-Zgp0qGyVQNRqQlcWv1mg6N.html
19-10-2020||India||Malabar exercise will help Australia and partners uphold regional stability: Marise Payne||Australia on Monday said its participation next month in the Malabar naval exercise, which features the navies of India, the US and Japan, will bolster the ability of the four countries to uphold peace and stability across our region. India confirmed that it has invited Australia to participate in this year’s Malabar exercise, which began in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian and US navies. Japan joined the manoeuvres as a permanent member in 2015, and this year’s edition will be the first military drill to include all members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad following its revival in 2017. Australia’s foreign minister Marise Payne said in a statement that the announcement was “another important step in Australia’s deepening relationship with India”. “This builds on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, to which Prime Minister [Scott] Morrison and Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi agreed on 4 June 2020, and which I progressed with my counterpart, minister of external affairs Jaishankar, this month when we met in Tokyo,” she said. “It will bolster the ability of India, Australia, Japan and the United States to work together to uphold peace and stability across our region,” Payne added. During the virtual summit between the two prime ministers in June, India and Australia had signed the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) to facilitate reciprocal access to military bases, to allow for more complex joint exercises and to improve interoperability between the armed forces of the two sides. The Australian statement said this year’s exercise will bring together “four key regional defence partners” and defence minister Linda Reynolds said the Malabar 2020 marked a milestone opportunity for the Australian Defence Force. “High-end military exercises like Malabar are key to enhancing Australia’s maritime capabilities, building interoperability with our close partners, and demonstrating our collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” she said. “Exercise Malabar also showcases the deep trust between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests,” Reynolds added. Australia last participated in the Malabar exercise in 2007 along with the navies of several other countries. The activities of the Quad have gained pace against the backdrop of China’s growing assertiveness and aggressive activities across the Indo-Pacific. India had held off on announcing Australia’s participation in the Malabar exercise because of sensitivities linked to ongoing negotiations with China on the border standoff, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malabar-exercise-will-help-australia-and-partners-uphold-regional-stability-marise-payne/story-nbYzdFxCEJhtJaI1FQUDHL.html

19-10-2020||India||‘No political vendetta, Farooq questioned as per law’: J-K BJP chief||The Jammu and Kashmir BJP on Monday outrightly denied any political vendetta behind the questioning of the National Conference president and Lok Sabha member Farooq Abdullah in a multi-crore scam of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The party maintained that the huge scam was probed on the directions of the High Court in accordance with the provisions of law. The ED on Monday questioned Farooq Abdullah in connection with a money-laundering probe related to a multi-crore scam in the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association. “There is no political vendetta behind the questioning of Dr Farooq Abdullah by the Enforcement Directorate in multi-crore JKCA scam. It is an old scam and it happened when he (Farooq) was the president of the cricket body. A petition was filed before the High Court and on its directions, action under law is being taken. If he was asked to appear before the ED then it was purely as per law. There is no political vendetta behind it,” said JK BJP president Ravinder Raina. Raina further said, “If someone has done something wrong and has misused public money meant for development then he has to be held accountable under the law and has to be punished under the law. We all are answerable to the law.” Former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta said that it was a long pending scam and none dared investigate it. “It was a big fraud and at that time the JKCA was divided into two factions. The probe should have been held long back. Where the heck crores of rupees have gone… it is a huge sum of money that belonged to taxpayers,” he said. Gupta also questioned that if Dr Farooq’s father was a government teacher then from where did they accumulate such huge wealth. Also read: ‘Farooq Abdullah kept at ED office for 5 hours despite his age’ - People’s Alliance attacks Centre“Those who misused power, they need to be exposed,” he added. Dr Farooq Abdullah’s son and vice president of the National Conference Omar Abdullah reacted acerbically to the development. “The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less then political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr Sahib’s residence,” Omar posted on his Twitter handle. PDP chief and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti also expressed her anger. “ED’s sudden summon to Farooq sahab displays the extent of GOIs nervousness about mainstream parties in J&K fighting as one unit. Also reeks of political vendetta & wont in the least blunt our collective resolve to fight for our rights,” she posted on Twitter. People’s Conference chairman Sajad Lone posted, “What a sorry state of affairs. Dr Farooq sahib summoned by ED. Reeks of vendetta. Contrary to what they want to coercively achieve this will certainly have the opposite impact”. Several constituents of the newly formed People’s Alliance, comprising mainstream political parties from Jammu and Kashmir, described Abdullah’s questioning as a “witch hunt” and “political vendetta” by the Centre. The ED case is based on an FIR filed by the CBI which booked former JKCA office-bearers, including general secretary Mohammed Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza. The CBI later filed a charge sheet against Abdullah, Khan, Mirza as well as Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali (former JKCA treasurer) and former accountants Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh for the “misappropriation of JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore” from grants given by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to promote the sport in the state between 2002-11. The ED said its probe found that the JKCA received Rs 94.06 crore from the BCCI in three different bank accounts during financial years 2005-2006 to 2011-2012 (up to December 2011). The ED alleged that several other bank accounts were opened in the name of the JKCA into which the funds were transferred. The bank accounts, along with the existing bank accounts, were later used for laundering JKCA funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-political-vendetta-farooq-questioned-as-per-law-j-k-bjp-chief/story-18t3JVV429Eral63OLENzJ.html
19-10-2020||India||Uttarakhand to develop villages along major routes as ‘trekking clusters’||In another move to boost tourism in the state, Uttarakhand tourism department has now decided to develop villages near important trekking routes and sites as ‘trekking clusters’. The project will start from Chopta village near Tungnath shrine, the world’s highest temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Dilip Jawalkar, secretary for tourism, during an inspection of developmental works being carried out in and around Tungnath, said that Chopta will be developed as a camping destination and proposals will be taken from the district magistrate and divisional forest officer for this. “Under Trekking Traction Home-stay Scheme, villages near important and popular trek routes will be developed by the tourism department as trekking clusters. This will give a lodging facility to the tourists and they will be able to enjoy the place by staying there itself,” said Jawalkar. Under this scheme, financial assistance of Rs 60,000 per room will be given to locals for building new rooms in their houses for the purpose of home-stay and Rs 25,000 for constructing new toilets with the rooms. The financial assistance will be provided for a maximum of up to six rooms. The state tourism department is currently selecting places to be developed for trek routes and clusters for the scheme through a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the district magistrate. “Tungnath is the highest temple of Lord Shiva in the world. It is a very old temple and we have requested the Archaeological Survey of India to help get the temple renovated. We are working to ensure that the route to the temple is made more accessible so that more people can visit the shrine and increase employment opportunities for locals,” said Jawalkar. To increase lodging facilities in the area, the secretary for tourism has also instructed district officials to renovate the old bungalow of Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam after permission is obtained from the state forest department.Tungnath shrine is considered to be the world’s highest temple for Lord Shiva located at a height of 12,070 feet above sea level. The temple is not only popular with devotees but also a tourist attraction as it is surrounded by lush green alpine meadows. Tungnath, 3 km uphill from Chopta, the last motorable road, is a beautiful tourist destination and very popular among tourists. On a steep climb of about 2 km from Tungnath temple lies Chandrashila, a famous tourist attraction that commands a breath-taking view of snow-clad peaks of Nanda Devi, Chaukhamba, Panchachuli, Bandarpoonch, Kedarnath and Neelkanth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-develop-villages-along-major-routes-as-trekking-clusters/story-v7cgYOPPRd6nrzmYjEp6UK.html
19-10-2020||India||PLA soldier strays across contested LAC in Ladakh, held||The Indian Army on Monday apprehended a Chinese soldier in eastern Ladakh’s Demchok sector after he strayed across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), the army said a statement, amid the ongoing border tensions with China in the sensitive theatre where both armies have deployed more than 50,000 soldiers each along with advanced weapons and systems. The army identified the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldier as Corporal Wang Ya Long. It said it had received a request from the PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier. The army plans to hand over the soldier to the PLA soon. “As per established protocols, he will be returned to Chinese officials at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point after completion of formalities,” the army statement said. The Chushul-Moldo meeting point is where senior commanders from both armies have been holding military talks to reduce friction in the eastern Ladakh theatre. The army said Corporal Wang had been provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes to protect him “from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions”. The soldier will undergo a thorough medical examination before he is handed over to the PLA in a day or two, officials said. Indian and Chinese military commanders met for the seventh time on October 12 in their latest attempt to defuse tensions. The Indian side demanded comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the talks. The two sides agreed to continue with the dialogue process to arrive at a mutually-acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh theatre, said a joint press statement issued a day after the talks. They said they had a better understanding of each other’s positions in the sector after the latest round of talks. India and China are expected to hold the eight round of military talks this week, although a date has not been announced yet. The situation in the eastern Ladakh theatre will also figure prominently on the agenda for the upcoming Army commanders’ conference that will be held in New Delhi from October 26-29. The border row is in its sixth month and efforts to disengage and de-escalate have yielded no results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-soldier-strays-across-contested-lac-in-ladakh-held/story-bfzKlSn2R70O47kzPGFgwJ.html

The state will go to polls next year along with Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam.Here are the key highlights from Nadda’s address:- The basic policy of BJP and Modi ji is of inclusivity - “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”. The policy of the other parties is - divide the society, keep it separate and rule.- You must have seen the blows the Hindu community received in West Bengal under the Mamata government. Now, when she has realised this, attempts are being made to include every member of the society. These are the people who only do vote bank politics, only do politics to stay in power.- Every BJP worker is pained by the Debendra Nath Ray incident. He was a social representative. We assure you that we will take all steps to reach the right conclusion.- I call upon our MPs to make a list of local products of West Bengal, plan a roadmap and scheme for them and we assure you that Modi government will brand it right and bring the right market for the local traders in the state.- Under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package, Rs 1 lakh crore has been provided for FPOs and agricultural infrastructure. Cold storages and general storages will be built for our farmers.- The Mamata government has not allowed the implementation of PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi Yojana in West Bengal. We assure you that if we come to power in Bengal, we will provide the scheme for all farmers in the state.- Sadly, Mamta ji’s government did not allow the Kisan Samman Nidhi to be implemented in Bengal. Seventy six lakh farmers of Bengal have been denied the benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-delayed-due-to-covid-19-will-be-implemented-soon-bjp-chief-jp-nadda/story-qbnz31n2nMDU5v2vjGAYQP.html

The message was sent to only this group out of the many WhatsApp groups where I am a member. Also, the time when this message was sent, I was nowhere near the phone and I was fast asleep,” Kavlekar said in his complaint to the police.“There have been many such attempts in the recent past to defame my name and project a wrong image of me in front of the public, he said demanding strong action against all such miscreants and unscrupulous individuals who have criminally hacked/ tampered with my mobile phone... and uploaded and transmitted obscene material,” he added.The message was sent at 1:20 am on Sunday night. The issue was highlighted by political opponents who accused him of demeaning the high office he holds.In a complaint to the Women’s Police Station, the women’s wing of the Goa Forward Party has demanded an FIR against the Deputy Chief Minister for ‘outraging a women’s modesty’ as well as for offences under the Information Technology Act.“Knowing full well that the video is completely lascivious in nature and containing sexually explicit content, was in fact porn, he still went ahead and shared it on a public group thereby transmitting it in electronic form,” the complaint states.The complaint also alleges that the women members of the group have been offended by the incident and therefore it also was a case of outraging their modesty.Elected on a Congress ticket, Kavlekar was one among ten Congress MLAs to switch over to the BJP in 2019 and was rewarded with the post of deputy chief minister at the expense of Goa Forward Party’s Vijai Sardesai, who was dropped from the cabinet.Kavlekar was the leader of Opposition in the Goa Assembly prior to his switch over to the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/porn-clip-shared-from-goa-deputy-chief-minister-s-phone-blames-miscreants/story-5c24bZbXLsbEvfXb9LFX8K.html

19-10-2020||India||Shivraj Chouhan leads BJP leaders in silent protest against Kamal Nath||Led by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, BJP workers across the state on Monday observed a two-hour ‘Maun vrat’ (observance of silence) against the “item” remark used by Congress state chief Kamal Nath against state cabinet minister Imarti Devi. CM Chouhan also urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi to condemn the act and remove state Congress chief Kamal Nath from all party posts for his remarks against Imarti Devi, the state’s women and child development minister and a Dalit woman.The protesters were led by Chouhan in Bhopal, Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia in Indore and union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and state BJP president VD Sharma in Gwalior. The party workers held placards in their hands, condemning the remark, demanding an apology from Nath and action against him.   Nath was addressing an election meeting in Dabra (SC) legislative assembly constituency on Sunday in the Gwalior district, which is witnessing a bypoll, when he made the remark while comparing virtues of the Congress candidate Suresh Raje with those of the rival candidate Imarti Devi from the BJP.   Nath said, “Suresh Raje is a simple man. He is down to earth. He is not like the person. What is the name of the person?” As crowd responded to Nath’s question citing Imarti Devi’s name, Kamal Nath called her an “item”, saying, “Why should I name her? You know her better than I know. You should have warned me. Ye kya item hai...”   Chouhan said in Bhopal on Monday, “My Dalit sister Imarti Devi was insulted by the state Congress president Kamal Nath but what is more painful is that he is not remorseful for his act. Instead, he is trying to justify his indecent remark shamelessly.” Defending Nath, his media coordinator said it was a case of misrepresenting things to gain advantage for the bypolls, and reminded BJP of the “maal” jibe by its leaders. “The BJP is trying to create a controversy by misinterpreting a word for its political gains in bypolls. During an election meeting in Sumaoli constituency union minister said Congress didn’t have candidates, hence it took ‘rejected maal’ of BJP. Is this not an insult to women given the fact those from BJP who joined the Congress include women leaders too? For this, the union minister and entire BJP should tender an apology,”  said Narendra Saluja, Kamal Nath’s media coordinator. In his letter to Sonia Gandhi, Chouhan said, “I thought being a woman you would take notice of the news on insult to cabinet minister and scheduled caste woman leader Imarti Devi and take action against state Congress president Kamal Nath while condemning the indecent remark but you have not done it so far…She broke down while sharing her pain. Elections come and go but insult to a Dalit woman like this brings a bad name to the entire political arena.” He said, “I request you to condemn the indecent remark and remove your party’s former chief minister Kamal Nath from all the party posts to teach a lesson to leaders of your party who insult women. I wish to add that if you keep silent on the insult it would be considered that it has your consent.” In Indore, Scindia observed silence with a placard in his hand which read: “Mata bahano ka jo kare apmaan, Shastra kahen wo hai shaitan (Holy scriptures say those who insult mother and sisters are devils).”  Scindia said, “Kamal Nath has insulted the entire scheduled castes and Dalit community by calling Imarti Devi ‘item’. By making such an indecent remark he has brought a bad name to Madhya Pradesh.”  Demanding action from Sonia Gandhi, Scindia said, “If she doesn’t take action, people will come to know as to what is the difference between what Congress preaches and what it practises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-chouhan-leads-bjp-leaders-in-silent-protest-against-kamal-nath/story-TFmNV1tLO8KirGrxOkCyjP.html

Sivasankar, who was admitted to a hospital on Friday, moved the HC saying the Customs department was harassing and planning to arrest him despite his cooperation with the ongoing probe. Last week, the HC had restrained the Enforcement Directorate from arresting him till Friday. The HC will hear both pleas (ED and Customs) on Friday. In his plea, Sivasankar contended that he was being made a dice in the political game and an intense media trial was on. He said he had undergone more than 90 hours of questioning and probe agencies had failed to detect any wrong-doing on his part. The court later stayed his arrest till Friday. On Friday Sivasankar was rushed to a hospital after he complained of uneasiness while customs personnel came to his house. Though he had some variation in his ECG, doctors alter said he was not suffering from any major health complications. Customs told the court that the hospitalization was a ploy to avoid arrest. It also informed the court that it has enough evidence to book him under money laundering and foreign exchange violation charges. The gold smuggling case surfaced on July 5 after 30 kg of yellow metal was seized by the Customs from a package camouflaged as a diplomatic consignment marked to the United Arab Emirates consulate in the state capital. Later, P Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate who came to receive the luggage, was arrested by the Customs after it seized gold hidden inside bathroom fittings. Two other suspects, Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Sivasankar was suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced. Now, a multi-agency team is probing the case and 30 people have been arrested so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-stops-customs-from-arresting-ias-officer-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-VY1WSQbsO0lI56y02Lr2lI.html

Recent history is a witness to how the BJP has been employing coercive and intimidating measures through various departments to target opposition leaders across the country. The recent ED summon to Dr Farooq Abdullah is a case in point,” the spokesperson added.The statement said the timing of the recent summon is very clear. “His previous summons were just before August 5 last year and today’s summon comes within days of forming the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration of which Dr Farooq Abdullah has taken a lead,” the spokesman said, adding that Dr Farooq Abdullah continues to maintain his innocence and will cooperate with the authorities in what is nothing but a witchhunt.Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesman Altaf Thakur said if Abdullah is clear on his part, he should face the probe. “Why has the ED summon created ripples in the NC? If Dr Farooq is clear, let him face the ED probe. I wonder why such a huge hullaballoo is in NC camp,” Thakur said.He said that linking ED’s summon with the BJP is nothing but a myopic vision of NC leaders. “BJP is a party of principles and doesn’t indulge in any act that goes against the party’s constitution and principles,” Thakur said.He said that the ED is perhaps probing the cricket scam and the NC should allow the agency to carry out the investigations in a transparent manner.Ten office-bearers of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA), including Abdullah, are accused of turning the sports body into a lending agency and operating several bogus accounts between 2005 and 2012 when the scam was unearthed.The scam came to light in March 2012 when JKCA treasurer Manzoor Wazir filed a police complaint against former general secretary Mohammad Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Mirza. Soon, a list of around 50 names linked to the financial scandal was out. Abdullah lost the post of the JKCA president later after holding it for more than three decades.The ED attached assets worth Rs 2.6 crore in a money laundering case related to the alleged embezzlement of JKCA funds, the central agency said in a statement issued in February. A provisional order for attachment of assets was issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the former JKCA treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza and its finance committee member Mir Mansoor Gazanffer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-abdullah-summoned-questioned-by-ed-in-multi-crore-j-k-cricket-scam-party-cries-foul/story-bHFro7LTqLxNdUkcRGaE7K.html

19-10-2020||India||India sends Australia a Malabar invite that will give Quad a huge upgrade||New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government has invited Australia for the annual Malabar naval exercises next month with the United States and Japan already confirming their participation. The move is expected to further lay the foundations for the eventual formalisation of the QUAD grouping.According to people directly familiar with the matter, the Malabar exercises will take place in two stages on India’s eastern and western seaboard; the 2019 exercise took place from September 26 to October 4 off the coast of Japan. The naval exercise featuring the QUAD partners will be held on November 3-6 and November 17-20. The shared objective of all four countries is free and open navigation in Indo-Pacific.The decision to invite Australia was announced by the Modi government on Monday.“As India seeks to increase cooperation with other countries in the maritime security domain and in the light of increased defence cooperation with Australia, Malabar 2020 will see the participation of the Australian Navy,” the defence ministry announced in a statement.The Malabar 2020 exercises will take place in two parts; one would be in the Bay of Bengal, north of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the other, in the Arabian Sea.The exercise comes after the QUAD Foreign Ministers meeting in Tokyo on October 6 and will follow shortly after the India-US two plus two dialogue on October 26-27 during which the geo-spatial agreement called BECA is expected to be signed by the two countries.The last time Australia was invited as a non-permanent partner by India for Malabar in 2007, Beijing issued a demarche to India, US, Japan and Australia (Singapore was the other partner) seeking details of the exercise in the context of QUAD initiative, which at that time existed only on paper. Both India and Australia were defensive back then.In the context of the emerging contours of QUAD, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had no hesitation in speaking his mind about the grouping at a Question and Answer session after his meeting with Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein in Kuala Lumpur on October 13. He termed the US Indo-Pacific strategy a “ big underlying risk” designed to stir up confrontation among different groups, and stoke geo-political competition with the Cold War mentality. The same minister called QUAD a “sea foam” in 2018 in Beijing. While Wang visited Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand and Singapore to secure Beijing’s interests in ASEAN from October 11 to 15, high ranking diplomat Yang Jiechi has been touring Myanmar and Sri Lanka to push the Chinese narrative on the Indo-Pacific and coronavirus.Meanwhile, the four QUAD members have signaled their intent to move away from the trope of blocs to describe their shared values. Their objective, the countries maintain, is to secure sea lanes for open trade and not be constrained by an expansionist Chinese Navy. “QUAD is a security architecture between democratic countries, which have military logistics as well as communication agreement. It is not an emotion or a Cold War-type alliance,” said a senior diplomat.According to a retired commander of Indian Navy’s Western Naval Command, who asked not to be named, the Malabar exercises are aimed at interoperability with an emphasis on humanitarian assistance, surface war manoeuvres, anti-submarines warfare, counter-terror operations, gunnery training and aerial surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-australia-a-malabar-invite-that-will-give-quad-a-huge-upgrade/story-L1v46CCm87rQcPCWvsl8UP.html

Recent history is a witness to how the BJP has been employing coercive and intimidating measures through various departments to target opposition leaders across the country. The recent ED summons to Abdullah is a case in point,” the statement said.The NC said the timing of the summons is very clear as the previous summons was issued just before August 5 last year, when the BJP-led Centre abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution, and this summons comes within days of forming the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, of which Abdullah has taken a lead.“Abdullah continues to maintain his innocence and will cooperate with the authorities in what is nothing but a witch-hunt,” the statement added.Meanwhile, taking to Twitter, Abdullah’s son and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah described the ED summons as political vendetta.“The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less than political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr Sahib’s residence,” he wrote on Twitter. The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less then political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration.

Also reeks of political vendetta & wont in the least blunt our collective resolve to fight for our rights,” she said in a tweet.

I can’t understand why Gandhi family chooses to be absolutely silent,” Irani said, as quoted by news agency ANI. Nath, while addressing an assembly bypoll meeting on Sunday in Gwalior’s Dabra town, made the purported remark, sparking a nationwide controversy.“I don’t think Gandhi family will take action against Kamal Nath for making such a derogatory statement against a lady. Be it Kamal Nath or Digvijaya Singh, these are the people who keep fire burning in Gandhi family’s kitchen,” the BJP leader added.The former chief minister, however, said the remark was not meant to insult anyone. “I said something, it wasn’t to insult anyone... I just didn’t remember the (person’s) name... this list (in his hand) says item number 1, item number 2. Is this an insult? Kamal Nath doesn’t insult anyone, he’ll only expose you with truth,” the Congress leader was quoted as saying by ANI.Meanwhile, Imrati Devi, BJP’s candidate in the Madhya Pradesh elections, said Sonia Gandhi should dismiss Nath.Condemning Kamal Nath’s remark, the National Commission for Women (NCW) on Monday sought an explanation from the Congress leader.“The commission strongly condemns this irresponsible and disparaging statement made by the leader. The words used in the video are highly defamatory and shows disrespect towards the dignity of a woman,” the NCW said in a statement.“At a time when we want more women to enter politics, such disrespectful remarks against a woman leader, that too from a person holding such a responsible position is very unfortunate,” the statement further said.The NCW has also asked the Election Commission to take necessary action against Nath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-kamal-nath-s-item-jibe-smriti-irani-s-question-for-gandhi-family/story-NM4PqkXhYArI2YVTTdbWdN.html

According to the Central water commission, the Bhima river has been in spate since October 14 due to torrential rain in Maharashtra and release of water from the dams there. The river, which is a tributary of the Krishna, has wreaked havoc in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura,Yadgir and Raichur, which are experiencing intermittent heavy rain. Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) officials said as many as 97 villages in the four districts are worst affected and people residing there have been shifted to safety. “So far we have evacuated 36,290 people. We have opened 174 relief camps where 28,007 people are staying,” a KSNDMC official said. The Army and the disaster response force personnel are engaged in evacuating people from the flood hit areas, according to sources.

Raymonds, Muthoot Group, Jio, Max Bupa, Kent, Air India, Star Health Insurance, Nissan, Dabur, Mahindra, Amazon, Samsung, Sony, Maruti, Nerolac, Toyota. Can they find the moral courage to be like Parle?” Tharoor tweeted.

Can they find the moral courage to be like Parle?“Shouldn’t Corporates have the ‘same moral and social duties as individuals, to condemn immoral ideology, to abjure hate and communalism, to not incite one community against another, to distinguish between the truth and falsehood,” he added, saying that “these amoral Corporates should know that their ‘Return on investment’ is ‘a society and country being torn apart by the channels they fund. Our Corporates aspire to be global entities but fail to espouse global values’. Why do companies fund hatred?” Dubey has alleged that Tharoor’s conduct, by openly discussing various aspects under examination by the panel, is ‘an affront’ to the overall working of the parliamentary committees. He asked the speaker to nominate him to some other committee. According to those close to Tharoor, however, Dubey’s allegations were baseless he has not attended a single meeting of the Committee since its reconstitution and therefore is understandably unaware of what was and wasn’t discussed within the Committee. “If he had turned up, he would have realised that this is an issue that was not discussed in the committee, and therefore there is no question of confidentiality violation,” said one such person. “The thread of four tweets is specifically linked to a blogpost by Avay Shukla, the subject of which has nothing to do with the committee, any subjects it has discussed, but is about certain challenges with corporate financing.” Also Read: IT panel takes up TRP issue, says it’s ‘easily manipulated’Dubey, however, said that the Speaker was in the know of why he hadn’t attended the meeting. “Tharoor is misusing his position as panel chair,” he told HT. The Parliament’s panel on information technology on Thursday took up media ethics and flagged that Television Rating Points (TRPs) are “easily manipulated” amid allegations of a scam involving certain news channels. HT, on October 16, had reported that the panel had unanimously agreed that the TRP is not a robust method to measure viewership. “It is not in tune with current technologies,” said a person familiar with the matter. Over 10 members, including Bharatiya Janata Party’s Syed Zafar Islam and Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. and the Congress’s Karti Chidambaram attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shashi-tharoor-violated-panel-confidentiality-bjp-mp-nishikant-dubey-writes-to-om-birla/story-syQMkfVFxE3R1fejSwm6xM.html

The court has also directed the complainant to file her reply on the petition within three weeks. Ayush Negi, counsel of the BJP MLA Mahesh Singh Negi in his writ petition filed on Friday has sought quashing of the FIR against the lawmaker. The court also stated that till the state government and the complainant file their replies within three weeks, there will be a stay on the arrest of the MLA, said Ayush Negi. On August 13, Dehradun police had started a probe in the alleged extortion case against the woman after the MLA’s wife lodged a complaint accusing the woman of demanding Rs ₹ 5 crore by threatening her to lodge a false rape complaint against her husband. On the same day, the woman released a video on social media in which she accused MLA’s wife Rita Negi of lodging a false complaint and alleged that the MLA sexually harassed her for the last two years. She also claimed that she has an illegitimate daughter with the MLA. She also demanded a DNA test of her daughter and the MLA to prove her claims. On August 16, the woman filed a counter-complaint against Negi, accusing him of raping her on several occasions, fathering her child and his wife for trying to hush up the matter by offering her money. With the latest development, all three involved in the case, MLA, his wife and the complainant have filed pleas in the HC seeking quashing of FIRs against them. On October 1, the HC directed the state government not to take any coercive steps against Rita Negi till November 18 provided she cooperates with the investigation. The next date of hearing in the case is November 18. On September 4, the HC had directed the state government to file its response on the writ petition filed by the woman against whom Dehradun police filed an FIR on August 14 on the complaint of Rita Negi, accusing the woman of blackmailing her husband and trying to extort ₹5 crore. The court also directed that till the next hearing in the matter (November 18), there will be stay on the arrest of the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-asks-state-govt-to-file-response-on-bjp-mla-s-plea-to-quash-rape-fir/story-m5FgaVhYpVXTyToh5FrVFN.html

The Bombay high court asked the Mumbai Police to issue summons to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami if he is proposed to be addressed as an accused.Republic TV is one of the three channels accused by Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh of manipulating the ratings.The police has filed a First Information Report (FIR), but the court said they first need to issue summons to Goswami. The case is being heard by a bench comprising Justice SS Shinde and MS Karnik.During the course of the hearing, Goswami’s counsel Harish Salve said that his client will appear before the police if summoned. Salve also assured the court of full cooperation from Goswami’s side.The channel moved the high court seeking quashing of the FIR registered in the case and its transfer from Mumbai police to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The channel filed the petition on October 16, a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a plea of one of its senior officials challenging the summons issued by the Mumbai police, and asked him to approach the Bombay high court instead.It has also pleaded that no coercive action (including arrest) should be carried out against employees of the channel.The high court has agreed to start the final hearing in the case from November 5. It has directed the police to produce all the developments in investigation before it in a sealed cover by November 4.Six people have been arrested by the Mumbai police in the scam, which allegedly involves inducing homes which form the sample set whose TV viewing is monitored to ensure that certain channels get higher ratings. The ratings are a key influencer of advertiser preferences while placing commercials. The police claim this is a “multi-crore” scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issue-summons-to-arnab-goswami-if-he-is-proposed-to-be-addressed-as-accused-in-trp-scam-fir-bombay-hc/story-IaF4kFgaMvLPglsstA55JP.html

The team will be led by a deputy superintendent of police (DSP).A senior police official privy to the development said the police want to produce Ansari in a MP/MLA court on October 21 in a case pending against him. He said Ansari was accused in over a dozen fresh cases registered against him in the past six months in the crackdown launched against him, his wife, two sons and close aides. Ansari would be brought back in an armoured police vehicle, the official said. The gangster-turned-politician has been in Punjab jails since January 2019 when he was produced there in a local court on production on a complaint of extortion lodged by a local builder. The officer said Ansari remained in Ropar jail initially and was later shifted to the Mohali jail. He said Ansari reportedly got himself shifted to Punjab jail fearing threat to his life in UP jails after one his closest aide Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi was shot dead inside Baghpat jail by another gangster Sunil Rathi on July 9, 2018.The officer said the role of some UP jail officials were questioned when Punjab police was allowed to take along Ansari on a production warrant so easily without bringing it to the notice of senior state government authorities. The Yogi Adityanath government is carrying out a drive against illegal properties of Ansari and his henchmen in eastern Uttar Pradesh, including Varanasi, Ghazipur, Mau, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Lucknow and other parts of the state. In the past few months, the state authorities had seized property worth ₹68 crore from Ansari’s aides and freed illegal possession on properties. Moreover, the gang’s annual earning of ₹45 crore was stopped while as many as 96 gang members were arrested and some others were killed in encounters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-member-up-police-team-to-bring-back-mukhtar-ansari-from-punjab-jail-in-armoured-vehicle/story-qT9YxgrJXNkUT6fStKk56K.html

Nath’s statement comes after Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appealed to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to immediately remove him from all party posts.“I said something, it wasn’t to insult anyone... I just didn’t remember the (person’s) name...this list (in his hand) says item no 1, item no 2, is this an insult? Shivraj is looking for excuses, Kamal Nath doesn’t insult anyone, he’ll only expose you with truth,” said Kamal Nath.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi, Chouhan said that Nath committed a shameless act by insulting a woman member of the Scheduled Caste and then attempted to justify the statement. “Immediately remove him from all party posts and strongly condemn his statement. If you fail to react, I will be compelled to believe that you support it,” Chouhan wrote in a letter. “The comment was made not once, but twice from a public platform,” he added.Earlier in the day, Chouhan, BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and other party leaders sat on a two-hour silent fast to protest against Nath’s remark.Nath referred to Imarti Devi as an ‘item’, sparking a controversy while speaking at a rally in the run-up to Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly bypolls. “Suresh Raje ji hamare ummeedvar hain... Yeh uske jaise nah hain... Kya hai uska naam... Main kya uska naam loon?.. Aapko toh mujhe pehle savdhan karna chahiye tha... Yeh kya item hai (Suresh Raje ji is our candidate and is not like her... What’s her name? You know her better and should have warned me earlier... What an item!),” Nath had said in Hindi.The former chief minister was addressing a campaign rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Dabra for Congress candidate Suresh Raje. Imarti Devi is also contesting on a BJP ticket from Dabra.Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state assembly and joined the BJP in March this year, in the process bringing down the Kamal Nath-led government. By-elections for 28 assembly seats in the state will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will be held on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-don-t-insult-anyone-only-expose-truth-kamal-nath-on-item-jibe/story-mrERlRq7gOtCHLdMcm0qsN.html

They said he might have entered Indian territory inadvertently and will be returned to the Chinese army as per established protocol after following due procedure.According to the Indian Army, the Chinese soldier has been provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes “to protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions.”The Indian Army added that it has received a request from PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier. “As per established protocols, he will be returned back to Chinese officials at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point after completion of formalities,” the statement said.India and China have been involved in a border standoff at the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh since May. Tension escalated on June 19 when 20 Indian soldiers were killed during a clash with Chinese troops at Galwan Valley. There have been seven rounds of military and diplomatic talks between the two countries to resolve the standoff so far.India and China are expected to hold the eighth round of military-diplomatic talks next week on disengagement in the Ladakh theatre. Senior officials said have said that both the sides have decided to keep the dialogue channels open at both the military commander level and diplomatic levels. The talks are also aimed at preventing any vertical escalation at the friction points in case of an accident or the aggressiveness of an individual commander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-soldier-apprehended-in-ladakh-s-demchok-sector-in-army-custody/story-xKWvypvPly4ofRFbtRgYDO.html
19-10-2020||India||PM Narendra Modi set to hold virtual summit with Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, visit Dhaka next year||Bangladesh is set to be among the first foreign destinations visited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak, as he is expected to participate in celebrations marking 50 years of the country’s independence next March. The Indian prime minister has accepted the Bangladesh government’s invitation to take part in the celebrations to be held in Dhaka on March 26. The visit will be preceded by a virtual summit between Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina in mid-December. “We invited the Indian prime minister to visit Bangladesh on March 26 next year. It was accepted,” Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen told reporters in Dhaka on Sunday. “We would love to see Prime Minister Modi join the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of our independence. Our victory means India’s victory as well,” he added. Also Read: Bangladesh-India flights to resume from October 28 through ‘air bubble’Momen said the two prime ministers were expected to hold a virtual summit next month. India had proposed December 16 as the date for the meeting, though people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity it could be held later as Bangladeshi leaders would be preoccupied with the Victory Day celebrations on that day. There was no official word from the Indian side on either the summit or Modi’s visit to Bangladesh though the people cited above said both events were on the agenda. Modi made his last foreign visit to Brazil in November 2019 to attend a summit of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping. Foreign travel by the Indian leadership has been severely curtailed due to Covid-19-related restrictions. External affairs minister S Jaishankar has travelled only to Iran and Russia, where he attended a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), in September and to Japan this month for a meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to Quad.A planned visit by Modi to Bangladesh in March this year, when he was to participate in events marking the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was put off after Dhaka deferred the celebrations because of the pandemic. India has taken several steps in recent months to bolster its ties with Bangladesh after they were hit by several irritants, such as the controversy over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, last year. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla visited Bangladesh in August and delivered a personal message from Modi to Hasina. Momen, who spoke to the media after meeting India’s new envoy Vikram Doraiswami, said an air bubble between the two sides will start soon. However, he said Dhaka wants New Delhi to ease restrictions on travel by road and railways as these modes were preferred by Bangladeshi travellers. Doraiswami’s posting in Dhaka is among the measures taken by New Delhi to strengthen bilateral relations as he is considered an old Bangladesh hand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-set-to-hold-virtual-summit-with-bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-visit-dhaka-next-year/story-bzzPGk1wZ2sj29m31e4RIM.html

Two such surveys have already been conducted in Pulwama district. Besides the Government Medical College Srinagar, the Medical Colleges of Baramulla and Anantnag, SKIMS and SKIMS Medical College will be conducting the sero survey.The second sero-survey in Kashmir’s Pulwama had revealed that 27 per cent of the population has developed Covid-19 antibodies as opposed to 2 per cent of the population three months ago.“Each district will be taken into consideration for assessing the whole of Kashmir. It is being done in collaboration with Directorate of Health Services Kashmir and involves all five medical colleges in training, mentoring and monitoring,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar.“Each medical college will train and monitor two districts. SKIMS, SKIMS Medical College, GMC Anantnag and GMC Baramulla are part of study. The Directorate of Health Services is collaborating in field activities. The study is supported by J&K National Health Mission.”Khan said the sero survey has already begun. “The survey in Srinagar is already underway in collaboration with Chief Medical Officer Srinagar.”The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had earlier conducted the second national sero-survey for Covid-19 in August to monitor the trends of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in India.Also read: Cannot rule out possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 during winters: NITI Aayog’s VK Paul“The second round of the ICMR’s national sero-survey for SARS COV-2 infection (Covid-19) in Pulwama district showed prevalence of 27.3 per cent. In the first round, in June, it was only 2 per cent,” said Dr Khan, who is the nodal person for the ICMR’s national sero-survey for Pulwama district.The community-based surveillance was conducted across 60 districts and 10 hotspot sites across all states and Union territories to map the changing trend of the population’s response to SARS COV-2 infection over the months.The first round was held in May and June this year where the prevalence of IgG antibody was found 0.73 per cent among the general population in the country. During the survey, blood samples were collected to determine the prevalence of infection in the recent past and the body’s immune response to the SARS CoV-2 infection.In the second round in Pulwama district, 413 blood samples were collected in ten different clusters of which 113 reported to be positive for IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 infection which makes it 27.3 per cent.“Sona Samilo village cluster showed the highest, 52.5 per cent, positive prevalence while Khaigam recorded the lowest prevalence at 2.5 per cent,” Khan said.The district was chosen in the first survey as it was a low-risk district depending on the number of cases per million population.So far, Jammu and Kashmir has recorded 87,942 Covid-19 cases out of which 77,886 people have recovered while 1,379 have died in the Union territory till Monday. Srinagar and Jammu districts have recorded the maximum deaths.Experts say this is the first wide range of sero sampling in which samples will be taken from 10 districts. Recently a similar survey was conducted in Jammu district which showed that 8.2 per cent of the surveyed population has antibodies.“The survey is important to know how much of the population has been infected and will help to formulate a strategy ahead of the winter,” a senior consultant at Government Medical College Baramulla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-begins-in-all-10-districts-of-kashmir-to-gauge-covid-19-impact/story-AehGnmwyFABtWYFMYwIw4O.html
19-10-2020||India||Pakistan readies plan to sabotage J&K telecom blackout with new mobile towers||Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government has readied a plan to expand coverage of its mobile coverage in Jammu and Kashmir that is not only designed to help Pakistan-trained terrorists infiltrating into the valley but also neutralise the impact of a future communication blockade imposed by the government, people familiar with the matter said.The plan, according to a top security official in New Delhi, to tweak existing telecom towers and build new ones has been in the works for about a year. It was initially conceived to strength the existing phone network to help terrorists who have infiltrated into Kashmir. But the Pakistani foreign ministry pushed hard to scale up the exercise to give it the ability to sabotage the communications blockade ordered in Kashmir after last year’s Aug 5 decision to end its special status. It wants Kashmiris to use Pakistani telecom services that cannot be blocked by Indian security forces.New Delhi had last year pulled the plug on Jammu and Kashmir’s communication network before it went public with the decision to abrogate Article 370 to be able to ensure that trouble-makers do not spread rumours on and off social media. The restrictions have since then been lifted but local security officials do routinely snap phone links for some time in localities to prevent rumour mongering. If Pakistan is able to see its plan through, this would provide Kashmiris with an alternative to Indian phone companies. Also Watch | How Pakistan is hoodwinking FATF and the world on terror fundingAlso Read: Imran Khan window dresses Pak record on terror, gets groups to change tacticsA top national security planner told Hindustan Times that Pakistan’s Special Communications Organisation (SCO) - the state-run firm mandated to provide telecom services in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Gilgit-Baltistan region - had analysed signals from 38 sites along the Line of Control and the International Border with India. It has told the army that Pakistan could get a spillover effect via 28 existing phone towers. According to its analysis, the GSM antenna would need to be reoriented in 18 locations to achieve this objective though it would reduce the coverage on its side of the LoC.The blueprint also includes setting up the new base transceiver station in Pak-occupied Kashmir as well as use of Wireless local loop phones in Indian territory.“This plan has been accepted and is being implemented,” the senior official said.Pakistan’s ISI is also pushing for increasing the signal strength of SCO mobile towers in PoK nearest to Indian sites such as in Cham opposite Baramulla, Leepa opposite Sopore, Upper Neelam Valley and Athmuqam opposite Kupwara and Hillan Meera opposite Srinagar to provide coverage across the LoCA parallel exercise by the SCO, which is maintained by the Pak army, is looking at increasing transmission power of TV towers located at Lawat near Muzaffarabad, Upper Neelam and at Khuiratta to provide extended TV coverage in J&K.These efforts are in continuation of the SCO’s previous attempts to install a small cellular system with Internet based backhaul that could cover Kashmir towns at some distance from the LoC, a counter-terror official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-plan-to-neutralise-telecom-blackout-in-kashmir-includes-new-mobile-towers/story-bNXWhSYyFiPr0lVlym7soL.html

You have not just disrespected Smt Imarti Devi, but each and every girl and sister of Gwalior-Chambal region,” Chouhan said in a tweet in Hindi on Sunday. “Kamal Nathji, who gave you the right to play with the respect of women?” he asked in the tweet.Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state assembly and joined the BJP in March this year, in the process bringing down the Kamal Nath-led government. By-elections for 28 assembly seats in the state will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will be held on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remove-kamal-nath-from-all-party-posts-shivraj-chouhan-writes-to-sonia-gandhi-over-item-jibe/story-iZI1mADlczMbFxMvsuP8NI.html

The state government has roped in the Green Gang under the Mission Shakti programme launched on Saturday for the security, empowerment and dignity of women and girls across the state. The Green Gang, comprising women volunteers, is running de-addiction and anti-gambling campaigns in rural areas of Purvanchal region, said a spokesperson of the state government. They will take responsibility for the security of women in 200 villages in Varanasi, Sonbhadra, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Chandauli and Ayodhya districts. In the coming months, the Green Gang will be activated in 50 more villages, he said. Volunteers will also celebrate the birth of the girl child in villages. As a mark of happiness, they will put a green impression on the door and wall of houses where girls are born. Members will pursue complaints of harassment and ensure that anti-social elements involved in harassment of women are put behind bars, the spokesperson said. The Green Gang is run by Hope Welfare Trust constituted by students of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in 2015. It will also impart self-defence training to girls. The volunteers will enlighten rural women and girls about the law and organise programmes to boost their self-confidence, he added.

Mission Shakti is a six-month programme to sensitise people to respect and provide security to women. It was launched by the state government on October 17 (from the beginning of the Shardiya Navratri) and will run till April next year (Vasantik Navratri).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-co-opts-green-gang-in-mission-shakti-for-drive-against-anti-socials/story-siGtN5OUV5oCUWo5SzljOP.html
19-10-2020||India||ED questions National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah in J-K Cricket Association scam: Officials||National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah is being questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Srinagar office in connection with its probe into the multi-crore Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) scam, officials familiar with the development said on Monday, prompting his party to condemn the questioning.Farooq Abdullah was summoned by ED at 11am at its Rajbagh office where he is being questioned by the agency’s officials regarding the money of JKCA. Farooq Abdullah’s son Omar Abdullah said the questioning was political vendetta and connected to the alliance forged by six parties from Jammu and Kashmir over the restoration of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. “The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less then political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr Sahib’s residence,” Omar Abdullah posted.He was referring to the alliance forged by six parties from Jammu and Kashmir for restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state as it existed before August 5 last year. The declaration came after a meeting at Farooq Abdullah’s house and was attended by PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, Peoples Movement leader Javaid Mir, CPI(M) leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami and Awami National Conference vice-president Muzaffar Shah.The meeting was called by Farooq two days after Mehbooba was released.  The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less then political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr Sahib’s residence.Farooq Abdullah’s questioning has drawn sharp criticism by the leaders of different political parties. Another former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said the summon depicts nervousness about the mainstream politicians. “ED’s sudden summon to Farooq sahab displays the extent of GOIs nervousness about mainstream parties in J&K fighting as one unit. Also reeks of political vendetta & wont in the least blunt our collective resolve to fight for our rights,” Mehbooba Mufti tweeted.National Conference spokesperson said in a statement that the ED summon to Farooq Abdullah, who represents Srinagar in the Lok Sabha, shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has failed to fight him politically and now taking help from agencies. “The ED summon to Dr Farooq Abdullah is clearly the result of unity that Dr sahib has forged between different mainstream political parties in JK. This is the price one faces when opposed to the BJPs ideology and divisive politics,” the spokesperson said.Ten office-bearers of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA), including Abdullah, are accused of turning the sports body into a lending agency and operating several bogus accounts between 2005 and 2012 when the scam was unearthed.The scam came to light in March 2012 when JKCA treasurer Manzoor Wazir filed a police complaint against former general secretary Mohammad Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Mirza. Soon, a list with around 50 names linked to the financial scandal was out. Abdullah lost the post of JKCA president later after holding it for more than three decades.ED attached assets worth Rs 2.6 crore in a money laundering case related to the alleged embezzlement of funds of JKCA, the central agency said in a statement issued in February. A provisional order for attachment of assets was issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the former treasurer of JKCA Ahsan Ahmad Mirza and its finance committee member Mir Mansoor Gazanffer, it said.The ED case is based on a Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI’s) first information report as part of which the latter probe agency booked former office-bearers of JKCA, including general secretary Mohd Saleem Khan and Mirza. The CBI filed a charge sheet against Farooq Abdullah, Khan, Mirza, Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali, Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh (former accountant of JKCA) for “misappropriation of JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore” from grants given by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to the association for promoting the sport in the state between 2002-11.The ED probe has found that during the financial years 2005–2006 to 2011–2012 (up to December 2011) JKCA received Rs 94.06 crore from BCCI in three different bank accounts. “However, several other bank accounts were opened in the name of JKCA into which these funds were transferred. Such other bank accounts along with the existing bank accounts were later used for laundering funds of JKCA,” ED had alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-national-conference-chief-farooq-abdullah-in-j-k-cricket-association-scam/story-FqIBkDDgt4Nn8rYKZ3hsYM.html

19-10-2020||India||MP Police’s cyber cell arrests 6 for defrauding companies of export promotion benefit||The cyber cell of the Madhya Pradesh police in Indore on Sunday arrested six people for fraudulently transferring duty credit scrip (DCS) to different companies in export-import business during the lockdown. The cyber cell police said they had received complaints from a few companies in Indore that their DCS, an export promotion benefit given by Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) which can be used for payment of customs duty, have been transferred to someone else by using digital signature. In the investigation police found that the fraud was executed by 12 agents of certain companies. Six of them have been arrested while six are absconding. Efforts are on to nab them, police said. In the investigation police found that agents transferred DCS to 13 companies based in Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra and Bareli in UP.Jitendra Singh, superintendent of police of the cyber cell in Indore, said, “In September and October, directors of a pharma and automobile companies lodged complaints that their DCS worth Rs 2 crores were exploited by some other companies by using their digital signatures fraudulently. “In the investigation, cyber cell police suspected the role of two Indore-based companies. Police arrested the directors of the companies Ashutosh Shrivastava, 36, Himanshu Jain, 42, Manoj Lunkad, 34, and Abhishek Thakur, 24, all residents of Indore,” said the SP. “They confessed to the crime and said an agent Rajesh Jagtap, 52, a resident of Pune, used a digital signature of the complainant companies to sell the DCS to other companies. He came to know about the details of DCS through the website of DGFT. Jagtap transferred the commission in the accounts of the two Indore-based companies,” he added. Jagtap was arrested from Pune. Singh said it was a big nexus and mainly being operated from Maharashtra. “Many renowned companies purchased DCS issued to some other companies to save customs duties on import. We are investigating the matter to know the worth of customs duty was saved by these companies by using DCS,” said the SP. The cyber cell police have sent notices to all the 13 companies which purchased DCS from the agent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-police-s-cyber-cell-arrests-6-for-defrauding-companies-of-export-promotion-benefit/story-wqv8JSPehwqa6mPmpoxN2H.html

19-10-2020||India||Dalai Lama and Tibet card hold key in future India-China border escalation | Analysis||The myth of India’s Tibet card is finally shattered with the rare recognition of a secretive Indian military unit with Tibetan soldiers called Special Frontier Force (SFF). The public display of solidarity during the Tibetan soldier’s funeral ceremony, killed on the front lines of deadly clashes with China on 29 August, has virtually ‘revealed’ the secretive force raised by India through a lot of visibility to the event. Nyima Tenzin, a Tibetan soldier from the SSF was given a funeral with full military honours, wrapped in the Tibetan flag and the Tricolour, in Ladakh.The ceremony was telecast across India and conveyed a solemn acknowledgment of the role ethnic Tibetans, descendants of those who sought refuge in India after China invaded and occupied Tibet in 1950, have played in India’s elite SFF border units.The event was more significant was the suggestion that India questioned China’s sovereignty over Tibet, a red line for China. There was no response from the government if the publicity for the funeral was a policy shift or a signal to China that their current border standoffs at eastern Ladakh could be extended across the Himalayas, a strategic ace up the sleeve some analysts refer to as India’s Tibet card.According to Jayadeva Ranade, a retired official of the external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), “the recognition is a clear message to China that your countrymen are fighting alongside us.”“I don’t remember this force being acknowledged like this earlier,” added Ranade, who heads the Centre of China Analysis and Strategy, a research group in New Delhi.ALSO WATCH | Message to China as Tibetan soldier killed at LAC gets public funeral India has been reticent about the nation’s secretive SFF forces and their ethnic make-up. But the SFF is part of the RAW, India’s external intelligence agency. But when it is deployed with the army, it is under the military’s operational control. However, the army prefers to keep the relationship under wraps. Akin to the US Special Forces, every member is trained as a para-commando and operates undercover in conjunction with the Indian military. In fact, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) helped India train Tibetan refugees to become part of a special force, the forerunner to today’s SFF, after the 1962 war.The SFF and its Tibetan fighters have a valiant fighting record for India. The SFF played a crucial role during the Bangladesh Liberation Movement that helped defeat Pakistan in 1971 and create Bangladesh. SFF fighters also contributed to the 1999 war that dislodged Pakistani forces who had occupied heights in western Ladakh’s Kargil.Even though the Indian government hasn’t formally acknowledged the Tibetan forces, the open support for the unit has aroused emotional appeal among the Tibetan-in-exile community who aspire to see Tibet as an independent nation.According to Gonpo Dhundup, President of the Tibetan Youth Congress, a body that has more 30,000 members and is fighting for the region’s freedom acknowledged “I strongly feel that the younger generation will join the SFF in larger numbers as the event has sent out a message that our contribution will be recognised.”Over 100,000 Tibetans live freely in different parts of India. Tibetans in China’s Tibet Autonomous Region, however, face a high degree of state control over their lives and livelihoods, increasingly akin to the situation faced by ethnic Uighurs held in vocational camps in China’s western Xinjiang province. Over the decades, Indian leaders have avoided being seen as supporting or aligning with the cause of Tibet, despite hosting the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama for over 60 years.China considers the Dalai Lama, a darling of the West and Nobel Peace Prize recipient for his non-violent resistance to China’s annexation of Tibet, as an enemy of the state. But some wonder if Tibet’s peaceful resistance could begin to take a harder tack, particularly as Western powers including the US articulate new support for Tibet’s cause in the context of a wider new Cold War against China.Analysts suggest that peaceful struggle could shift after the next Dalai Lama is selected, particularly as China is expected to attempt to prop up a successor chosen by it. The Dalai Lama, who has been based for decades in Dharamsala, has said any candidate handpicked by Beijing would be illegitimate. Geographically and strategically, India could be key in funnelling support to any new Tibetan resistance.Tibetan disaffection has grown coincident with Chinese repression and forced Sinicization of Tibetan-Buddhism culture, according to Lobsang Sangay, President of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), who spoke recently during a webinar held on September 28. Chinese President Xi Jinping has said the stability of China depends on the stability of Tibet. As recent as 2008, China’s Central Military Commission ranked Tibet as its most critical sovereign challenge, ahead of even Xinjiang and the self-governing island Taiwan, said Sangay.It’s not clear if or how India may opt to play its Tibet card, but taboos on mentioning Tibet are breaking down. Analysts suggest New Delhi could start to lend its voice to calls for Tibetan autonomy and democracy, echoing Western critics, after remaining reticent for years to avoid irking Beijing. Indeed, India is now signalling to China for the first time in years that playing its long-held Tibet card is at least a strategic possibility. Perhaps, the time has come for a major foreign policy change in India’s position on Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tibet-card-holds-the-key-in-india-china-border-clash-analysis/story-9EovYJgqDcK8HObqd8l7EJ.html

19-10-2020||India||Doctors in MCD-run hospitals withdraw indefinite strike on assurance of pay||Over 2,000 doctors in hospitals and dispensaries run by the North corporation of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi who were to go on an indefinite strike from Monday for non-payment of salaries for three and a half months have called off the protest. The doctors withdrew the strike on Sunday after an appeal from the Mayor of North corporation that they needed time to arrange funds. “In order to avoid inconvenience our strike will cause to patients and considering the appeal of the Mayor North MCD to the senior doctors to give him some time to arrange funds, this association has reconsidered its decision to proceed on the scheduled strike,” read the letter by the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association to the commissioner of the north corporation. The letter further adds, “It has been decided to defer the indefinite strike for the time being in general public interest with the hope that in the meanwhile corporation will find permanent solutions of the salary issue.” The hospitals that would have been affected by the strike are Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis, Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Disease hospital, Kasturba Hospital, and Giridhari Lal hospital. The fifth Hindu Rao hospital was a designated Covid-19 treatment centre, but was removed from the list of Covid-19 facilities as the hospital did not see as many patients with the infection. The non-Covid services at the hospital are yet to resume as the junior doctors continue their strike. The association had earlier suggested to the authorities that the MCD hospitals be handed over to the central government, as the selection and appointment of doctors for MCD-run hospitals is done by them. This is because the doctors have been facing delays in salaries since 2015, with the problem becoming more acute this year due to the pandemic. The Delhi government, on the other hand, has suggested that they can run the hospitals if MCD is incapable of doing so. The MCD doctors had also written to the lieutenant governor to file an FIR against “authorities” for non-payment of salaries as per the order by the Union health ministry that said not paying healthcare staff involved in Covid-19 work timely would be a punishable offence under the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-in-mcd-run-hospitals-withdraw-indefinite-strike-on-assurance-of-pay/story-Wn4ujRfZkKCaIf3D3OETqJ.html
19-10-2020||India||Correct modalities of Covid-19 death reporting have been shared with States: Harsh Vardhan||The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) has shared a standard format for reporting coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related deaths with states and union territories (UTs) in a bid to avoid any discrepancy in maintaining records.“There is no discrepancy in the reporting of Covid-19-related deaths. States are using certain parameters. The ministry has taken up the issue with states and UTs on multiple instances. We have shared a modality of reporting of Covid-19-related deaths to ensure consistency across the country,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare. Experts from the country’s apex biomedical research body, the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), have drafted a template to report Covid-19-related deaths and states and UTs need to fill up details in a bid to maintain pan-India consistency in maintaining records. All hospitals have been mandated to submit their Covid-19-related death summaries to the committee within 24 hours.Also Read: Serum Institute has begun manufacturing intranasal Covid vaccine: Harsh VardhanMost states have formed a dedicated panel, which is an autonomous body, to audit Covid-19-related deaths.For example, the Delhi government has a death audit committee to analyse mortalities related to Covid-19 patients in the national capital. Death audit committees go through case sheets, investigations, and summary of the deceased before classifying it as a Covid-19-related fatality.Covid-19 has to be recorded as the underlying cause of death, when a patient dies of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury, and clotting throughout the bloodstream that the viral infection is known to cause, the ICMR guidelines suggested.Comorbid conditions such as asthma, heart condition, diabetes or cancer cannot be considered as the underlying cause of death for a Covid-19 patient, according to the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/correct-modalities-of-covid-19-death-reporting-have-been-shared-with-states-harsh-vardhan/story-YWBlkqYCs9N5TDX6IEZz8J.html
19-10-2020||India||Serum Institute has begun manufacturing intranasal Covid vaccine: Harsh Vardhan||While there are three vaccine candidates against Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) being tested on humans in India, there is no intranasal vaccine candidate under trial currently, said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday. However, he also said that Serum Institute of India was manufacturing an intranasal vaccine candidate. “Flumist nasal spray is a vaccine that is sprayed into the nose to help protest against influenza; it is not a Covid-19 vaccine. At present in India, there is no intranasal Covid vaccine which is under clinical trials. However, Serum Institute (of India) has begun manufacturing Codagenix CDX 005, which is an intranasal live attenuated vaccine candidate for Sars-Cov-2,” he said. Also read: Start of the fourth global Covid-19 wave“Pre clinical animal studies have already been completed and Codagenix expects to initiate a phase 1 clinical first in humans trial in the United Kingdom by the end of 2020.Further, Serum India plans to undertake clinical developments of this vaccine candidate in India.” The minister was responding to queries on his social media accounts as part of the 6th episode of Sunday Samvaad. He also said that India’s Bharat Biotech has also entered in an agreement with Washington University School of medicine as part of which it will conduct trials to produce and market an intranasal vaccine for Covid-19. “The phase 1 trials will take place in the US in St. Louis University’s vaccine and treatment evaluation unit, on getting regulatory approval, Bharat Biotech will pursue further stages of clinical trials in India,” he added. On being asked if the Covid-19 vaccine will also be for the paediatric age group, the minister said Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate was being tested on subjects between 18 and 55 years in phase 1, while for phase 2, it was extended to ages between 12 and 65 years. Cadila Healthcare’s phase 1 clinical trial had also included subjects between 18-55 years, and for phase 2, it was extended to 12 years and above. Serum Institute is conducting phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of their vaccine in subjects 18 years and above, till the age of 99 years. Experts, however, say that at this stage it will be difficult to predict which of the vaccines will work. “It is too early to predict as the number of participants enrolled in phase 1 and 2 trials is too small and only gives us safety profile of a vaccine candidate. Anything concrete can be said only after we get results of phase 3 trials that takes place in larger group of people and determines the efficacy of the candidate. Phase 1/2 trials show promise, while phase 3 is about knowing the performance,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-has-begun-manufacturing-intranasal-covid-vaccine-harsh-vardhan/story-QkGbcK7g0c3zrAJrATYdlL.html

19-10-2020||India||After Kerala smuggling racket, NIA probes international terror links in 2 more gold seizure cases||The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has been probing the Kerala gold smuggling racket, is on to investigating a foreign terror link in two more similar cases. Earlier, Rajasthan Police had seized gold, weighing 18.5 kilograms (kg), on July 3 and another racket involving illegal transportation of gold bars, weighing over 83 kg, was uncovered by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) in New Delhi on August 28, people familiar with the development said. NIA has taken over both the cases, as it suspects there is a larger international conspiracy, involving terrorists and gold smugglers, to use the fund for anti-national activities. Investigators are not ruling out the role of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan’s spy agency, behind these separate organised cases of gold smuggling. Also read: Kerala gold smuggling accused have links with Dawood Ibrahim’s gang, says NIAHowever, officials cited above said that Jaipur and New Delhi seizures have no connection with Kerala gold smuggling case, in which over two dozen people have been arrested to date and the alleged key conspirators are based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). NIA informed a Kochi court last Wednesday that the two accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case – KT Ramees and M Sharafuddin – have links with underworld fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim. Ramees and Sharafuddin had also visited Tanzania in east Africa several times to meet a contact of Ibrahim known as Feroze Oasis and had discussed ways to smuggle firearms to India, NIA has claimed. It is for the first time that the terror act – Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 – has been invoked in gold smuggling cases in the country. Initially, the Act was enforced in the Kerala gold smuggling case and later both Jaipur and New Delhi seizures came under its ambit. An official from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said: “The intelligence agencies are working together for the first time to identify the masterminds based abroad, who are involved in gold smuggling. There appears to be a larger conspiracy to fund terror activities and damage the country’s financial stability by bringing in such huge quantities of gold.” NIA has arrested two persons last Tuesday. They have been identified as Chuna Ram and Aizaz Khan, who belong to Rajasthan’s Nagaur district. NIA has also raided four locations in connection with the Jaipur gold smuggling case. Gold bars, weighing 18.5 kg, were seized at Jaipur international airport from 10 people, who had arrived from Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, by an Indian low-cost carrier’s flight on July 3. Sonia Narang, deputy inspector-general (DIG) and NIA spokesperson said, both Ram and Khan knew the couriers arrested on July 3. The duo had established a network for smuggling of gold from Riyadh to India, she added. DRI officials had confiscated 504 gold bars, weighing 83.6 kg, which is worth Rs 43 crore, on August 28 in New Delhi. The haul gave the impression that the syndicate is bigger than the Jaipur gold smuggling racket. The gold bars, said another officer cited above, was smuggled from Myanmar through the international land border at Moreh in Manipur, while the syndicate had its base in Guwahati, the biggest city in the north-east. “They were planning to sell the gold bars to their contacts in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai,” said the official. A DRI official said that the Myanmar syndicate recruited poor people from across the country to act as carriers of smuggled gold by luring them with quick and easy money. “The smugglers used air, land and rail routes to transport the smuggled gold,” said the DRI official. NIA will investigate the Myanmar link behind the smuggling ring, which may have been active in the past as well. “Myanmar doesn’t have its own large scale production of gold. The consignment is likely to have come from a third country,” he added.Neeraj Kumar, a former commissioner of Delhi Police, who had also probed 1993 Mumbai serial blasts during his stint with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), told HT: “The gold smuggling has always been an organised business and poses a great threat to national security. Ibrahim and his aides also used to smuggle gold to Mumbai from the UAE and Pakistan through their contacts in ISI. Later, their gold smuggling route was used for smuggling explosives for the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai. It’s a welcome change that UAPA empowers probe into such gold smuggling cases for terror conspiracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-kerala-smuggling-racket-nia-probes-international-terror-links-in-2-more-gold-seizure-cases/story-MoTEOeT1oEGAu3BPfXab7K.html

It is likely to become more marked during the next 24 hours. An east-west trough is likely to develop from east-central Bay of Bengal to coastal Karnataka across west-central Bay of Bengal and peninsular India on Tuesday. The weather condition is likely to persist over the next three-four days. Under the influence of these weather systems, isolated heavy rainfall is likely to occur over south India, except for Kerala and Lakshadweep, during the next five days.Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur at many places over Telangana and Tamil Nadu on Monday. Coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP) and coastal and northern interior Karnataka may experience a similar weather condition on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. The withdrawal line of monsoon is passing along Faizabad, Fatehpur, Nowgong, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Vallabh Vidyanagar and Porbandar. Due to consecutive development of low-pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal and rainfall in many parts of the country, the withdrawal of monsoon is delayed. Usually, monsoon withdraws completely by October 15, which is followed by the onset of north-east monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-poor-air-in-parts-of-n-w-india-heavy-rain-warning-for-telangana-coastal-andhra/story-EoViZqiPNhcF7UuUOqryuL.html

Reacting to it, Raut said Shah is the country’s home minister and speaks with responsibility and caution.The Raj Bhavan and the office of governor is a constitutional institution and falls under the jurisdiction of the ministry of home affairs, he said.“The governor’s letter followed by the chief minister’s reply was an avoidable controversy and we haven’t started it. But, we are satisfied with the Union Home Minister’s stand and thank him for understanding the reason of our anger,” said Raut.With Shah’s statement, the Shiv Sena has put the issue to rest, the party’s chief spokesperson said.Raut dismissed speculation that Shah was being soft on the Shiv Sena, a year it snapped its ties with the BJP. “There is nothing political.

19-10-2020||India||BJP raps party MLA Surendra Singh for defending Ballia shooting accused||The BJP leadership in Uttar Pradesh called party MLA Surendra Singh to the state capital on Sunday and disapproved of his statements and his act of defending the main accused in the Ballia shootout case. The development came hours after the Special Task Force (STF) arrested the main accused, Dheerendra Pratap Singh, from Lucknow.In the evening, the lawmaker met UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal at the party office in Lucknow and was rebuked by the leadership, said party leaders requesting anonymity. Before meeting the party leaders, Surendra Singh maintained that he had come to the party office to present his side of the story. Singh is known for making controversial remarks.However, after the meeting, Surendra Singh wasn’t reachable. “He is doing his puja and won’t be reachable for the next one hour. Please call after that,” one of his aides said while confirming that the meeting had happened. The aide, however, refused to disclose the details. Earlier in the day, Surendra Singh said over the phone, “Yes, I have been called to Lucknow. I will present a true account of the incident. I will tell him (UP BJP chief) about a series of incidents which led to the chaos during the meeting (at Durjanpur village in Ballia) and the unfortunate incident.”He claimed that the true account of the incident was not being presented by the media. “If the media presented a true account, the women would get justice,” he said.On Thursday, Dheerendra Pratap Singh allegedly shot a 46-year-old man dead in an open meeting in the presence of officials after a dispute over allocation of two fair price shops in Durjanpur village of Ballia.On Friday, the BJP MLA, who represents Bairia assembly constituency in Ballia, had said that Dheerendra had fired in self-defence. He had claimed that had Dheerendra not opened fire, dozens of women of his family would have been killed in the incident.On Saturday, Surendra Singh visited Revati police station in Ballia and demanded that an FIR should be registered based on the application moved by Dheerendra Singh’s female relatives who, he alleged, sustained injuries in stone-pelting during the Thursday incident. He also took them to the district hospital and got their medical examination done.“I am carrying with me the medical reports of five women (Dheerendra’s relatives) who were injured in the stone-pelting incident,” the MLA said before his meeting with the state BJP leadership on Sunday.Meanwhile, family members of Jaiprakash Pal who was allegedly shot dead by Dheerendra Singh, said that supporters of the accused were trying to frame them in a case.Pal’s elder brother Suraj Pal said, “Some people are trying to implicate us in a case. Be it the local MLA, or the supporters of the main accused, they are trying to implicate our family in a case. The government should help us. Jaiprakash used to manage the expenses of the family. The government should give a government job to a member of the family or should provide monetary assistance.”Suraj Pal also said that the family members heaved a sigh of relief as the main accused was arrested and demanded exemplary punishment for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-raps-party-mla-surendra-singh-for-defending-ballia-shooting-accused/story-AK9zuhvw0HAiv67XtstegK.html

19-10-2020||India||India-China prep for 8th round of border talks. Accident is the big concern||India and China are expected to hold the eighth round of military-diplomatic talks next week on disengagement in the Ladakh theatre even as their armies prepare for winter deployment along the 1,597-km Line of Actual Control (LAC).Neither side is impatient over resolution at the friction points in Ladakh, but have decided to keep the dialogue channels open at both the military commander level and diplomatic levels, senior officials said. The talks are also aimed at preventing any vertical escalation at the friction points either because of accident or the aggressiveness of an individual commander.While the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has proposed that both sides withdraw armoured and artillery units as part of de-escalation first and then go for disengagement of the infantry, the Indian side is very clear that armoured units cannot be withdrawn because it will give an advantage to the adversary due to terrain and capability.Also Read | No one can take away Indian land: Amit Shah says amid border row with ChinaAs a senior military commander explained, the issue is that the Indian Army’s approach to both the north and south banks of Pangong Tso is through two very high mountain passes---the 17,590-feet-high Chang La and 18,314-feet-high Marsimik La. While Chang La lies between the road from Leh to the contested south bank of Pangong Tso, Marsimik La lies between the contested north banks of the lake and Kongka La. “ If India were to withdraw its armoured units from south of Pangong Tso to beyond Chang La or beyond Marsimik La, then they will never reach back to the contested points in a worst-case scenario as both the passes are blocked by heavy snow till April every year. The PLA on the other hand has an advantage as they have a six-lane Kashgar-Lhasa highway just 10 km from both Marsimik La and Kongka La with roads running right up to their posts,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.There has been no snowfall yet on the peaks on the north and south banks, but the water in the lake is starting to freeze and the wind speed is very high. The PLA launched aggression on the Galwan valley, Gogra-Hot Springs and north bank of the Pangong Tso in April-May this year; the Indian Army was able to pre-empt its moves south of Pangong Tso to occupy the Rezang La -Rechin La ridgeline in the last week of August. The situation continues to remain tense as the PLA is deployed in full in occupied Aksai Chin as well as in the depth areas up to Chengdu and Kashgar. The PLA air force is continuing its combat patrols in the area with nearby air being bases active.Given the circumstances, the Indian Army and the PLA are deployed on the contested points with distance being maintained so that any chance of an accident is ruled out. Indian medical facilities have come up along the LAC so that victims of high attitude sickness get immediate treatment and not wait for heli-lift to a specialised hospital at Hundar in Partapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-prepare-for-next-round-of-lac-talks/story-8BEMcjW17brK9uw37Y2XBJ.html
19-10-2020||India||Big IT firms acquire small cos with eye on cloud business||Top software services companies are acquiring smaller technology firms to expand their cloud computing business, which has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of businesses having to push activities online because of Covid.These smaller specialized firms bring in ready talent and tech capabilities that complement the existing expertise of larger companies such as Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which have seen a spike in digital revenues, especially from cloud computing.“Acquisitions are helping IT services companies jump-start and quickly bulk up their cloud capabilities to capture market share,” said Nitin Bhatt, technology sector leader, EY India. “Building in-house capabilities would be time-consuming, and the opportunity cost would be too high. In addition, such acquisitions are helping infuse and grow the cloud DNA in areas that the legacy software companies have been lacking.” Infosys has already made three cloud-related acquisitions this year. In March, it acquired Simplus, a leading Salesforce consulting and advisory firm in the US and Australia, for up to $250 million. Earlier this month, it acquired European cloud company GuideVision to strengthen its Cobalt portfolio, an umbrella offering for everything related to cloud, and one of its biggest organic investments in recent times. It also entered into a deal to buy digital customer experience firm Blue Acorn iCi for up to $125 million. In August, Wipro Ltd completed the acquisition of Belgium-based 4C, one of the largest Salesforce partners in the UK, Europe, and West Asia for €68 million (₹585 crore) to strengthen its cloud business. 4C has now been consolidated as part of Wipro’s Salesforce practice, which provides solutions globally around multiple Salesforce clouds and its ecosystem of products. This month, Wipro said it will buy Eximius Design for $80 million. Eximius Design provides solutions to build connected products in cloud, internet of things, 5G and artificial intelligence (AI). Global tech firms have also been betting on acquisitions to make their mark in the cloud space. The most significant one among them is possibly IBM Corp’s $34-billion acquisition of Red Hat last year, to further its hybrid cloud agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-it-firms-acquire-small-cos-with-eye-on-cloud-business/story-D7CdrdFy8DJgFQZDuR8KqL.html
19-10-2020||India||Ambit of economic census to be wider||The next Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) is likely to take a broader view of deprivation parameters to include outreach of public welfare schemes and progress in nutrition, housing, drinking water, sanitation, electricity and connectivity to identify the country’s poor, senior officials indicated on Sunday. The centre is also considering a dynamic registry, which would be updated regularly, in an attempt to make the state’s targeted interventions more effective, the officials said. A concept note on “poverty measurement in India” was prepared by the Union rural development ministry last month while the government set up a high-level panel with the mandate of updating the SECC and minimising “exclusion and inclusion errors”. The panel is made up of the Registrar General of India, director general of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), chief of the National Statistical Organisation (NSO), the urban and rural development ministry secretaries and a member of the policy think-tank Niti Ayog. The move comes as the first SECC becomes nearly a decade old. And since the SECC’s results were announced in 2011, several new welfare schemes to provide free connections of cooking gas, power and water for the poor have been rolled out; other schemes such as free housing or skill development programmes have been allocated higher budgets. “There is definitely a need to take a new look into determining poverty. In the first SECC, kuchcha houses were a parameter but now, the government has completed 11.7 million houses under the Awas scheme for the rural poor. And aspirations for the poor have also changed. We may need to look into the delivery of benefits such as Ayushman Bharat, improved education facilities and Ujjwala {scheme of free cooking gas connections} and observe change in socio-economic status apart from the basic needs,” a member of the panel said on condition of anonymity. To be sure, the second SECC will take some time for completion; the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed work on the 2021 census, which had been due to get underway. Preparations are underway for the launch of the exercise. The concept note prepared by the rural development ministry highlights how the C Rangarajan Committee, in its report in 2014, had pitched for a separate all-India rural and urban poverty line baskets to include “food items that ensure recommended calories, protein & fat intake and non-food items like clothing, education, health, housing and transport.” The note, taking a wider, multi-dimensional view of poverty also highlighted that “the deprivations faced by poor in various fields such as education, health, sanitation etc are not accounted for in the below-poverty line approach. Further, public expenditure on social services like education, health and food security had increased substantially in recent years, which was not captured, by design, in the NSSO’s Consumer Expenditure Surveys and the poverty line derived from these is thus lower than the services actually consumed.” From a national planning committee in 1938 to the Bombay Plan of 1944 to the 1962 Working Group and in the later stages, the Suresh Tendulkar Expert Group in 2009 has provided ways and means of estimating and addressing poverty. The sweeping Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown that caused a record 23.9% contraction of the economy in the quarter ended June will also be kept in mind by policymakers when they come up with a new plan for the next SECC. “Here the role of a dynamic registry is important as we can see how one pandemic or illness is capable of pushing families back to acute poverty. In will help in inclusion of intended beneficiaries,” said the official cited above, noting job losses caused by the pandemic that had forced households to pare expenditure on education and food. “A dynamic registry would help us include families from the protection of public welfare schemes, depending on their current situation.” The 2011 SECC showed that 107.4 million Indian households are considered deprived of certain basic needs. It also showed about 30% of rural households were landless and depend mostly on manual labour to earn a living. Himanshu, an associate professor with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), believes that it is not advisable to plan social welfare programmes on the basis of people’s spending habits. “SECC doesn’t take into account any expenditure data. Also, it is very difficult to collect expenditure data in the country as it varies from season to season or on a monthly basis. So, it is not advisable to plan social welfare programmes on the basis of expenditure pattern of people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambit-of-economic-census-to-be-wider/story-ZJBRbAmsUMIuuYbisELMgO.html

But even this key position does not sufficiently capture the breadth of his experience, the duration of his engagement, and the importance of his interventions in India’s public life and policymaking – as an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer who served in key positions at the Centre and in Bihar; a core member of Manmohan Singh’s economic policy team which ushered in the 1991 reforms; secretary to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee; a member of Planning Commission; a member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha from Bihar; as the head of a committee that determined the contours of India’s fiscal framework; and as an elder statesman in Indian public policy world with friends across India’s political, corporate, cultural, and intellectual spectrum. Portraits of Power: Half a Century of Being at Ringside, Singh’s autobiography to be released on Monday, captures this remarkable life. In an interview with HT, Singh examines his early socialisation in Bihar, the economic doctrines that governed India in the 1960s and 1970s and its subsequent evolution, the current political moment, and the structural challenges faced by India. Excerpts: You come from a landed family in Bihar, which was also interested in educational excellence. Your father was a top bureaucrat. You married into a former royal family. How did this confluence of factors – of wealth, intellectual engagement, and public service – shape you? The principal challenge for any civil servant is how you reconcile adherence to rules, responsibilities, processes and systems often with the inevitable expectations of popularly elected governments which may have different priorities. It is about reconciling contradictions. My life, too, has been about these reconciliations. My paternal grandfather came from a poor, rural background. He was among the earliest to receive a degree from Presidency College in Calcutta, and under a system prevalent then, could directly become a deputy collector. Instead, he chose to become a teacher and then headmaster. He was an austere man who deeply believed in the necessity of formal education. My father went to the same school. On the other hand, my maternal grandfather was among the richest zamindars of north Bihar. Fable has it that the seeds of Bihar’s land reforms were maybe embedded in the fact that he had sometimes driven Jawaharlal Nehru in his Pontiac car for long hours, and wherever they went, Nehru was startled to discover that the land belonged to my maternal grandfather. As far as I was concerned, the affluence and comforts of spending time with my maternal grandfather were vastly more enjoyable than my paternal grandfather would have liked. So, how was one to reconcile this contradiction during my initial years of schooling? This carried forward in multiple ways even in my civil service career – how could one combine the virtues of rectitude with compliance with the rules and regulations in a democratic, popular framework. Undoubtedly, this was a challenge. I experienced this even in higher echelons of responsibilities. My years in Parliament enabled me to see a fuller interplay of combining the virtues of sensible economics with sensible politics. The reconciliation of what was rational with what was popular was inevitable in India’s economic strategy — a strategy, thus, of balance and reconciliation.You have worked with political dispensations across the spectrum, and have been, in some ways, the eternal survivor in India’s power corridors. How did you reconcile these conflicting political strands?I may not have been the only one. There were others who would have achieved this objective even more successfully. I am not saying that they are role models but, for example, Dr Manmohan Singh has been a part of a multiplicity of regimes of different hues. He remains the quintessential survivor. His self-effacing manner, his rectitude, and his sincerity have been his forte. As far as I am concerned, the important thing is to understand the dominant psyche of the time. For instance, when I was working during the period of Professor DP Chattopadhyay (commerce minister under Indira Gandhi), India had embraced a trade policy regime where tariffs were high, quantitative restrictions were debilitating, foreign exchange paucity severe and we had barter trade agreements with many countries. In such an atmosphere, it would hardly have served any purpose in preaching the virtues of free trade or cautioning against the adverse consequences of barter trade agreements. You need to see what can be done within the limitations of a dominant psychology and that framework. Or take another example. There was no point, while negotiating the quarterly performance criteria or structural benchmarks during Dr Singh’s time as FM, in preaching the virtues of sovereign decision-making or importance of taking Parliament in confidence when the compulsions were to seek access to resources to obviate debt default. As civil servants, one must recognise that ultimately, the basis of governance is embedded in a social contract, the core of which is that those who govern do so based on the consent of the governed. Therefore, it is important that one must understand that framework and seek flexibility within the limits and carve out advice which would be relevant to minimise damage, achieve practical outcomes, and in an overriding way, be driven by forces of morality. A fascinating chapter in your book is on the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), and you trace its increasing power to Lal Bahadur Shastri appointing LK Jha as his secretary. Could you tell us about the evolution of PMO and its implications, and what you make of the current moment – when Narendra Modi’s PMO is seen as all-powerful? I have mentioned that in a letter written by Lord Wavell, he said that he had deliberately ensured that the secretary to the cabinet is also the principal private secretary to the Prime Minister. Wavell writes that this was to ensure that Jawaharlal did not go “astray” and to preserve the sanctity of the cabinet office. That was the position till it was changed by Lal Bahadur Shastri, the diminutive but purposeful man who took an audacious step, and appointed Laxmi Kant (LK) Jha, who was a batchmate of my father, as the first secretary to the PM. My father had then asked me to accompany him to congratulate Jha, and he told Jha that I felicitate you for two reasons – one for reaching an elevated office, and two, for destroying a certain edifice of governance. LK asked him how. They were friends and this was a frank conversation in Maithili. My father then told LK that till the previous day, the last note the PM would have read was that of the cabinet secretary, but from now, that last note would be yours. This changes the balance of equations. This turned out to be prescient. But there are two broader points here. Dr Singh once mentioned to me that compared to the powerful PMO of Vajpayee, where Brajesh Mishra and I worked, his PMO was a more modest one. This partly reflected his modest and self-effacing nature. The well-known proverb that all PMOs only bask in the reflected glory of the PM comes to mind. It has no innate glory of its own. I also argue in the book that the Westminster model of democracy is being replaced permanently by a de-facto Prime Ministerial model; if not in form then in practice. What ultimately matters is the preferences expressed by the electorate. Elections are fought and votes are garnered in the name of the PM, not necessarily his likely council of ministers. Of course, in a way, this dramatically enhances the accountability of the central leadership. Going forward, one must ask, in the realm of political science, whether the Westminster system is losing its contemporary relevance.You were closely involved with the 1991 reforms, leading the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. One, were these reforms Indian reforms or externally imposed reforms? And, two, were India’s reforms transparent or done in stealth? First, it would be naïve to believe that borrowers are fundamentally free to choose any course of action other than those encouraged and acceptable to lenders. Even more so, if borrowers were in distress. Our lenders were multilateral agencies. They were not making a new policy for India. There was a normal practice that all borrowers had to accept dual conditionalities – on the macroeconomic framework by the IMF and on structural reforms by the World Bank. There were usually two letters of intent addressed to the IMF and the Bank. These letters were written on our own volition and signed by the authorities, often by the finance minister. In that sense, they are not externally imposed. But the content of the letters, however, are carefully deliberated and negotiated and the contours of measures imposed in the letters of intent, so to say, voluntarily are the outcome of these negotiations. In practice, it was, thus, a mix of our volition and practices and processes determined by the conditionalities inherent in such borrowing arrangements. To your second question, reforms were both by stealth and design. Stealth because of certain procedures of, let us say, not having open debates in Parliament, and yet laying documents in the library of the Parliament, being considered a form of compliance. Or often, some of these measures being contained in some government document like a Five Year Plan or in the contents of speeches made on several occasions lend credence that these were not externally imposed. The adequacy of compliance must be viewed in the context of extraordinary times. They were extraordinary times needing innovations in practice and procedures. You talk about the pandemic in your last chapter. Let me focus on two themes. How do we recover from the economic consequences of the pandemic? And how do we reconcile the quest for Aatmanirbhar Bharat with India’s globalist outlook and export-orientation, which has served the country well? I ask because you do warn against the perils of excessive protectionism. The way forward is deepening and diversifying the reform momentum initiated during the pandemic. Very far-reaching reforms, which have major consequences and a multiplier effect on growth, have taken place, whether in power or on taxes or agriculture or health systems. These reforms, once implemented, will greatly push the G-curve in the northward direction. This will help not only in accelerating the recovery process, but also improve macroeconomic management in terms of debt and fiscal deficit profile, necessary for long-term macroeconomic stability. On protectionism, Aatmanirbhar Bharat is not an isolationist Bharat. The philosophy of Aatmanirbharta (self reliance) is about improving domestic production, domestic capabilities, and domestic employment. Protectionism implies that not only are we making imported goods very expensive but we are making no other efforts. The path forward is to seek synergy between Aatmanirbharta and a competitive trade regime enabling us to take advantage of trade as an engine of growth. Countries that grow at 8% plus – and India must grow at 8% plus – have to use trade as an engine of growth. We have traversed a long way from the era of quantitative restrictions to a more competitive landscape and we cannot lose this competitive advantage, and lose the benefits of trade as an engine of growth. Your current role as Finance Commission chair involves close consultations with both the Centre and states. Do you think India’s federal compact is more robust today than the past, or is it fraying, and there are concerning signs, as we have seen this in the recent controversy on the Goods and Services Tax (GST)? The Indian federal structure is robust and well-functioning. Nothing demonstrates this better than the way the pandemic has been addressed. In the initial period, central leadership was inevitable, but thereafter it was followed by the PM’s successive meetings with chief ministers. The states were expected to take decisions autonomously on their implementation and measures to address the pandemic. It was a federal compact which combined both the importance of a central focus and decentralised decision making. This was also an example of the philosophy of federalism going beyond mere fiduciary obligations on either side. I want to return to Bihar at the end. A telling anecdote in your book is how you drafted Nitish Kumar’s note splitting from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2013 – but you joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) soon after yourself. Was that personally a difficult decision? And what is your dream for Bihar?My last book, which was edited by both Lord Nicholas Stern and myself, was an ensemble of essays on Bihar. It brought out the interplay between identity politics and development politics in the evolution of Bihar’s economic and social policies. Nitish Kumar in the Janata Dal (United) was pursuing the development matrix with great sincerity. He was doing so in partnership with the BJP. The decision thereafter to break the alliance with the BJP in 2013 marked a break from the focus on development politics to vote bank politics in a somewhat narrow sense of the term. It was around this period and under the circumstances which I have describe in the book, that I decided to leave the JD(U) and join the BJP. It was a difficult decision because, as I have explained in the book, it was Nitish Kumar who brought me into politics and I am grateful for the unique opportunity he gave me. It is somewhat ironic that having broken away from the NDA, he again became an integral part of the NDA in 2017. It was a full circle. This was more or less the circle of my own political engagement of being part of the JD(U) when it was part of the BJP and thereafter moving to the BJP. Political choices invariably combine expediency and moral compulsions as inescapable hybrids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-life-has-been-about-reconciling-contradictions-nk-singh/story-SuzNBF0DZtGpPJ6NANBD7K.html
19-10-2020||India||Centre plans crackdown on NGOs over violation of norms||Surprise inspections conducted by students and alumnae of institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Delhi University (DU) and Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) on government-funded organisations that claimed to be working for public welfare have thrown up evidence of widespread and systemic abuse.The Union ministry of social justice is now planning a crackdown on over 100 such entities after the inspections, which were carried out under the guidance of officials from the National Institute of Social Defence (NISD).Nearly 130 or 19 % of the 700 organizations surveyed in the novel exercise were either non-functional, had violated regulator norms, did not maintain records or simply could not justify the government grants they sought or had received.HT has accessed details of the surveys carried out on organizations across the country; they reveal how lax oversight has led to a large number of organizations managing to get government funds, but not maintaining records and not investing in either infrastructure and staff. Many were simply non-functional.Upset by the results of the survey and in one of its biggest drives for accountability, the social justice ministry is now planning to blacklist around 130 organisations which received government funds; it is also considering tightening regulatory norms.“This was a unique effort in which bright and conscientious students from institutions like the IITs, DU, TISS etc, working with the government as young professionals, were involved to carry out the surprise inspections fairly and with the required secrecy. They were guided by officials from the officials from NISD,” said a person aware of the development.The surprise element paid off.“The crack team of young professionals with which the PMU has been constituted, has been inspecting the grant-in-aid institutions of the ministry and found many a fraud. The ministry is now blacklisting these institutions and deleting them from the list of those eligible for grants,” said the person cited above. On average, these institutions received grants of upto Rs 25 lakh a year.According to the details accessed by HT, in many cases, the organizations appeared to have brought in beneficiaries or even staff on a temporary basis. Non-maintenance of proper records was common. Many had creaky or deficient infrastructure. Some blamed the absence of staff on the Covid-19 problems.When contacted, social justice ministry secretary R Subrahmanyam confirmed that the ministry had carried out surprise checks and would take appropriate action against organizations that had violated regulatory norms.In some cases, functionaries were evasive of did not cooperate with those making enquiries. In many cases, people inspecting the premises of beneficiaries of government grants raised doubts about the purpose for which the premises were used.Some entities that had moved from their addresses didn’t update their records.A drug de-addiction centres in Sangareddy district of Telangana didn’t keep a record of visits by doctors. Local residents had no idea of the services provided by the centre.Another organization in Mahisagar in Gujarat had received a grant, but hadn’t started any work; it was yet to decide on the location of its centre.Many organizations were found to be charging high fees for their services.Among the organizations that were checked, 336 were engaged in rehabilitation of drug addicts and related work and 253 in the welfare of senior citizen; over 100 organisations were engaged in supporting underprivileged scheduled caste communitiesFifty-two organisations that claimed to be working for rehabilitating drug addicts, 51 for the welfare of senior citizens and 26 for the upliftment of scheduled castes were found wanting.State-wise, over 20 organisations in Maharashtra, 13 in Karnataka, 11 in Rajasthan and eight in Uttar Pradesh were among those that have come under the social justice ministry’s scanner.The ministry runs a gamut of schemes for the welfare and empowerment of sections ranging from the scheduled castes and other backward classes to the elderly, transgenders, and differently abled sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-crackdown-on-ngos-over-violation-of-norms/story-iS9Rg9BeJhpEpmkCGjpXwL.html

Officials said the Bhima river continued to remain in spate in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura and Yadgir districts, while the surging Krishna river has affected villages in Raichur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-dead-after-fresh-rain-batters-hyderabad-karnataka-braces-for-floods/story-OQt7eXd9P4lh8o1Ys8KMwI.html
19-10-2020||India||In Bihar, Purnia range IG dies of Covid-19, death toll close to 1,000-mark||Inspector General (IG) of Police of Purnia range, Vinod Kumar, 59, died of Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna in the early hours of Sunday. This is the first death of a senior police official due to Covid-19 in Bihar. Nodal officer, Covid-19, AIIMS-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said Kumar was diabetic and had hypertension too. “He was admitted to AIIMS on Saturday, but he died at 1.17 am on Sunday,” he said, adding three other patients of Nalanda, Muzaffarpur and Gaya died at the hospital. Kumar joined Bihar police in 1986 and was allocated IPS in 2001. Senior police officials besides the Election Commission of India mourned the death of Kumar. Meanwhile, with 1,152 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, the total cases in the state rose to 2,04,212, while with six deaths, the death toll rose to 996—four short of the 1,000 mark. The highest number of 316 cases was reported from Patna. Besides this a positive patient also died at NMCH. The recovery rate in the state remained static since yesterday at 94.31%. Giving the break-up of six deaths, the health department bulletin said while two positive patients died in Patna in the past 24 hours, one each died in Aurangabad, Begusarai, Saran and Vaishali. The bulletin said in the past 24 hours 1,079 patients recovered while 1,19,456 tests were conducted in the same period. Till now the health department has conducted 91,34,927 tests. So far 1,92,594 patients have got negative reports, while there are 10,621 active cases. Nodal officer, Covid-19, NMCH, Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, said a 56-year-old positive patient of Madhubani passed away in the last 24 hours. Of the 1,152 cases, 72 were reported from Araria, Purnia 69, Bhagalpur 62, Muzaffarpur 60, East Champaran 47, Madhubani 37, Saran 36, Katihar 33, and Rohtas 32 among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-purnia-range-ig-dies-of-covid-19-death-toll-close-to-1-000-mark/story-DIso5YyttuqTmKqc4ry6HM.html
19-10-2020||India||On Day 200, chicken, rice served at Bengal’s longest-running community kitchen set up amid Covid-19||Running since April, West Bengal’s first community kitchen set up during the Covid-19 pandemic entered its 200th day on Sunday with not just young CPI(M) workers, who run it, but members of the civil society and film industry taking part in a small celebration. It is the state’s longest-running community kitchen. Some CPI(M) members opened the kitchen at Jadavpur in south Kolkata to offer free cooked lunch to poor people. It became so popular that around a thousand people visited it every day at the height of the lockdown. It got the name ‘Shramajibi Canteen’ (canteen of the working class). Impressed by the turnout, the party decided to work out a viable model. After the lockdown ended, the kitchen started offering cooked food at Rs 20 a packet which includes 2-3 items such as chicken, egg, fish or paneer curry besides rice. On some days people get sweets. Incidentally, Sudip Sengupta, the CPI(M) Kolkata district committee member who conceived the idea and has been running the kitchen, tested positive for Covid-19 a few days ago and is now in hospital. “The kitchen has proved that people can achieve something as long as they work as one towards a goal,” Sengupta wrote on his social media page. The kitchen has a page as well. Film director Anik Dutta, actor Badshah Moitra were among CPI(M) leaders, such as state secretary Suryakanta Mishra, who took part in a small procession that the volunteers took out at Jadavpur. Video messages were sent by many eminent people including Srijit Mukherjee, director of successful movies such as Gumnaami. The community kitchen has now become a model of sorts. Thousands of people get their food either free or for Rs 20 from more than 20 kitchens in north and south Bengal districts, said Sengupta. At some of these kitchens, the price is less than Rs 20, he added. The CPI(M) workers, however, do not use the word price. They say it is ‘anudaan’ (contribution). It is a takeaway service only. A specified number of poor people are served free. The kitchens have provided permanent employment to the cooks and other staff. The daily cost of running the kitchens vary between Rs 10,000 and 20,000 (on days when chicken and desserts are served) and the money comes entirely from donations, said Sengupta. The sale proceeds do not cover the cost on all days but the kitchens have worked out to be a successful reach out programme of the CPI(M), party leaders feel. Impressed by the service, many eminent people such as doctors, actors, singers have been celebrating their birthdays or anniversaries by donating money for the food and physically serving the packets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-day-200-chicken-rice-served-at-bengal-s-longest-running-community-kitchen-set-up-amid-covid-19/story-3cvf1DZGYbjYjSICfQ6ctL.html
19-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The second wave of the coronavirus disease in Europe, and the third in the US, comes as the number of cases nears 40 million (it was 39.1 million on October 17, according to the World Health Organization) around the world. Around 9 million (23%) of these are active currently, with a third of these in the US alone. India has just under 9% of active cases around the world. France has 8.1%, an indication of just how badly that country has been hit by the second wave. It isn’t just France; Europe, according to WHO, accounted for almost 40% of daily cases on Saturday. Russia, the Ukraine, the UK, Spain, Italy, even Poland are all seeing a sharp surge in cases.The Americas (powered by the US, but also by Brazil and Argentina), accounted for around 35% of cases. That number is likely to increase in coming days as the third wave in the US gathers momentum. Already, the country is seeing daily case numbers back at levels last seen in July. The second wave in the country was worse than the first. Some experts believe that coming as it does, at the onset of winter, the third wave could be still worse. Or maybe it won’t.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIndia accounted for 16% of daily cases on October 17, almost a third off peaks seen in early September.At 392,471 (according to WHO), the daily global case number was at a record high on Saturday, and nearing the 400,000 mark. With 4,630 cases on Saturday — this translates into a mere 1.18% of the total — Africa is a clear outlier, and in a good way. This, despite the recent surge in cases in the region from late September. There’s been some research on Africa’s relative immunity — 1.3-1.6 million cases and 28,000 to 40,000 deaths, according to various agencies — and while all of them have focused on the relative youth of the continent’s population, climatic conditions, and previous exposure to other viruses (including coronaviruses), none of the findings are conclusive. Interestingly, there are two schools of thought on the future course of the pandemic on the continent: one, that the coronavirus disease should have peaked by now, and the fact that it hasn’t means that Africa is unlikely to see a surge in the future; two, that it is only a matter of time before Africa sees a surge because, barring a few exceptions, the pandemic has shown similar trajectories across geographies.The onset of a fresh wave in Europe and the Americas roughly coincides with the end of WHO’s solidarity trials last week on four drugs or drug combinations that showed promise, at various times over the past seven months, as a possible therapeutic (or prophylactic) for Covid-19. Of the four, HCQ, hydroxychloroquine, a widely used anti-malarial drug and the combination of retrovirals lopinavir and ritonavir, used to treat HIV, had already been shown to be ineffective by credible research. The results of the solidarity trials released last week by WHO also proved that antiviral Remdesivir did not reduce mortality or benefit those with severe conditions; nor did interferon-beta, widely used to treat autoimmune disorders. It’s still not clear whether Remdesivir or interferon-beta could help those with mild infections if given early. A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine (but whose results were previously known) showed that in a study of over 1,000 patients, Remdesivir shortened the recovery time, although it did not reduce mortality. But as the authors of the solidarity trial, which covered around 11,000 people in 400-plus hospitals around the world (including in India) put it after comparing their own findings with previous studies on Remdesivir (including the one referred to above), the findings rule out the chance that the drug “can prevent a substantial fraction of all deaths.”The Solidarity trials — they measure the effect of treatments on three parameters, “mortality, need for assisted ventilation and duration of hospital stay”, according to WHO — will continue, though, and will likely study the effectiveness of other treatments such as monoclonal antibodies. The trials are yet to study corticosteroids which other studies have shown, and WHO accepted, as effective in the treatment of severe cases of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know/story-uEF8rKlNxJ1qxWcIbCjfIK.html
19-10-2020||India||Timely EMI payers may be rewarded||The government plans to waive compound interest on equated monthly instalments (EMIs) of loans valued at up to Rs. 2 crore, extending the benefit to all types of loans, including home mortages, and to borrowers who paid their EMIs during the duration of the moratorium, two officials aware of the plan said. The plan to waive interest on interest during the moratorium between March 1 and August 31 is a work in progress and a formal announcement is expected before Diwali, the officials said, requesting anonymity.“There should not be any sector-specific discrimination. It is not prudent to exempt interest on interest for personal loans only and deny the same for home loans. It will be extended to all those who have taken loans up to Rs 2 crore, which is a reasonable limit,” said one of the officials, who is in a senior position in the finance ministry.On March 27, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced a three-month moratorium on terms loans from March 1 to enable borrowers to tide over the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. On May 22, it extended the moratorium period by another three months until August 31, 2020. “The compound interest exemption during the moratorium period will be equally available to all borrowers – those who availed the six-month moratorium and those who continued paying [their EMIs] even during the six-month period,” the official said. The government has committed to the Supreme Court that “interest on interest” will be waived during the six-month moratorium period for loans up to Rs 2 lakh crore, the second official said. “As the move has significant financial implications, details are being worked out with a target to provide the relief to borrowers soon, latest by Diwali,” the official said. The compound interest waiver will ensure that the government’s decision will not have any adverse financial impact on commercial banks, which is in line with the suggestion of an expert panel chaired by formal Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Rajiv Mehrishi. Based on the report, the government has decided to reimburse banks for their losses on this account, the official said.The finance ministry on September 10 set up an expert committee under Mehrishi to assist the government in assessment of relief to bank borrowers. The panel was formed after concerns were raised during the proceedings of a hearing in the matter of Gajendra Sharma versus Union of India and others, where an Agra-based petitioner had sought waiver of interest during the moratorium The other members of the committee were Ravindra H Dholakia, former member of the Monetary Policy Committee of RBI and B Sriram, former managing director of State Bank of India (SBI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-emi-payers-may-be-rewarded/story-BZ712cTUpy96gzexFfX4WJ.html

According to officials, the accused, Pulkit Saini, raped the girl in a car that bore the sticker of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Goraksha Samiti. The party has denied any connection to Saini. Officials said that the girl and the accused used to practice judo at the same college ground. On Friday, when the girl was riding her two-wheeler to the college ground, the accused stopped her and convinced her to ride in his car. He then drove the car to a secluded area and raped her, the officials said. He also threatened to harm her if she told someone of the incident, the officials added. The girl informed her family on Saturday and was rushed to the hospital as her health deteriorated, the officials said. “A case of rape was registered against the accused and he was arrested on Saturday night,” said Dinesh Kumar, station house officer of TP Nagar police station. The accused has been booked under Sections 376 (Punishment for sexual assault) and 420 (Cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Pocso Act.

19-10-2020||India||Share of farm fires in PM2.5 forecast to rise||Stubble fires that continued to burn in northern India, aided by north-westerly winds that blew the fumes in Delhi’s direction, worsened air pollution in the capital at the weekend. Over 1,000 fires, the highest for the season, had been recorded on Saturday by the air quality early warning system of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES).But an estimate of the contribution of stubble fires to Delhi’s particulate matter (PM )2.5 level wasn’t updated on Sunday by the MoES. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Research (SAFAR) model under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (used by the Central Pollution Control Board for pollution analysis) showed 17% contribution to Delhi’s PM 2.5 load on Sunday. It was 18% on Saturday; MoES data showed that stubble fires contributed 22% to pollution in the capital on Saturday.The highest number of fire points of the season were observed over Punjab (966), Haryana (167) and UP (38) on Saturday which are likely to have an adverse impact on air quality of the national capital (NCR) region centred on Delhi, the MoES website said. The impact was restricted because of better mixing height, the height at which pollutants mix in the air, and ventilation. Contribution of stubble fires to PM2.5 pollution is likely to rise on Monday and Tuesday. On Friday and Saturday, the MoES website had shown that the fires contributed 11% and 22% to Delhi’s PM 2.5 load.“We are assessing the performance of the model. The forecast based on models for fire contribution will be updated,” said Sachin Ghude, scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Wind direction remained north-westerly on Sunday, with calm winds until 8 am and then moderate winds of 13 to 15 kmph in the afternoon. The minimum temperature on Sunday night was 16.6 degrees C, 2 degree C below normal. “Wind direction is north-westerly and will remain so for the next two to three days. Wind speed is picking up in the afternoon, going up to 15 kmph but nights are calm so dispersal of pollutants is impacted,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre of the IMD. The ventilation index on Sunday was around 11500 m2/s. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.Additional chief secretary (development) Anirudh Tiwari said action was being taken immediately to extinguish fires when any are noticed. In Gurdaspur district of Punjab, for example, 50 squads have been formed, each squad consisting of four to six persons has been allocated 30 villages. “The squad visit all 30 villages daily from 2 to 6pm. As pre-emptive action, fires are extinguished as soon as they are detected using fire brigades or tractors,” he said.“As per our analysis, fire points are increasing and wind direction is also north-westerly but local surface winds in Delhi are not letting the contribution from fires increase to severe levels,” a senior CPCB official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/share-of-farm-fires-in-pm2-5-forecast-to-rise/story-VZWTB2LyNEPuFuBfxQaOpM.html
19-10-2020||India||Centre may acquire land for mining in protected area||The coal ministry plans to acquire 1,760 hectares of land in Surguja, Chhattisgarh, for mining, 98% of which is protected forest area, according to a notice by the ministry published in a Raipur-based newspaper on October 15.The ministry plans to acquire the land under sub-section (1) of section 7 of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, which allows the central government, if it is satisfied that coal is extractable from the whole or part of a tract of land, to acquire it for mining within two years of notifying that it intends to prospect for coal in the area. The notice states that the notification intending to acquire the land was issued on May 11, 2020 following which some corrections had been made in the area to be acquired, which is being published as a notice in the newspaper, Daily Chhattisgarh.The Supreme Court on September 30 had observed that if an area falls in an eco-sensitive zone, neither the Centre nor the state government will have the right to mine it. The apex court made this observation on a plea by the Jharkhand government challenging the Centre’s decision to auction coal blocks for commercial mining. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had asked the Centre to file an affidavit on whether the coal blocks being auctioned are in eco-sensitive zones or not.Kente extension, the coal block in question, is in the Hasdeo-Arand coalfield and has total coal resources estimated at 200 million tonnes, according to the coal ministry. “There should be no mining in Hasdeo Arand because it is a contiguous stretch of very dense forests. Why is the Centre then planning to acquire this land? More importantly, the state government should have conducted gram sabhas and sought the people’s opinion before taking any decision on mining in dense forests. It can devastate the lives of local people,” said Alok Shukla, convenor of the the Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan.Hasdeo Arand is one of the largest contiguous stretches of very dense forest in central India spanning 170,000 hectares and has 22 coal blocks. In 2009, the environment ministry had categorised Hasdeo Arand to be a “No-Go” zone for mining because of its rich forest cover, but opened it again to mining because the policy hadn’t been finalized.“No one can mine coal without an environmental clearance and forest clearance. The specifics of this case would be known to Coal India Limited,” said a senior coal ministry official, responding to a query from HT’s on why land with dense forest cover was being acquired for mining.Following resistance by the Chhattisgarh government, Pralhad Joshi, Union minister for coal and mines, had accepted a proposal by the Chhattisgarh government to exclude five coal blocks in Hasdeo Arand which were among 41 coal mines being auctioned. Those excluded from the auction include Morga -2, Morga (south), Madanpur (north), Shyang, and Fathehpur (east).“It appears from the notice in the newspaper that their gazette notification was issued on May 11 but was not put in public domain. Neither us nor villagers are aware of the development. It is only when this notice was seen in a much less circulated newspaper published on October 15 that some of us got to know that the coal ministry is in the process of acquiring this land,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, a Chhattisgarh-based environmental lawyer.“This is in complete violation of the Supreme Court’s recent observations on eco-sensitive areas. This area has very high crown density. It’s also the catchment of Hasdeo river. The Centre can acquire land for itself under the Coal Bearing Areas Act, but not for a state PSU which has a mine developer and operator (MDO) agreement with a private company,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, a Chhattisgarh-based environmental lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-acquire-land-for-mining-in-protected-area/story-UZMhmlSENuBUAcmS2oz1qL.html
19-10-2020||India||No proof of Covid-19 spread through newspapers: Health minister||The Union health minister, Harsh Vardhan, said on Sunday that there was no scientific evidence to prove that Sars-Cov-2 virus, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), was transmitted through newspapers and that it is “totally safe to read newspapers”.“Call your hawker now as newspapers spreading the virus is a baseless rumour; it is a respiratory virus and spread through droplets suspended in the air. There is no scientific evidence before us that tells us that newspapers spread the virus. It is totally safe to read newspapers even during Covid-19 pandemic as they are not a source of novel coronavirus transmission,” he said.While talking about credibility of newspapers, Prime minister Narendra Modi had earlier also said that it was completely safe to read newspapers and that newspapers were vital in spreading correct information.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNone of the experts, internationally or nationally, studying Sars-Cov-2, have established so far any cases of Covid-19 infection from newspaper or package, with scientific research showing that the virus does not survive on porous surfaces.“It is not true that newspapers can be a source of Covid-19 infection, there is no evidence to suggest that. If it was happening, we would have said so to stop infection. What we know about the virus for sure right now is that it spreads largely through droplets and fomites (infected surfaces), not newspapers,” Sujeet K Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), had earlier told HT.A study published earlier this year in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, which is the world’s most cited research journal with an impact factor of 70.6, on the varying stability of the coronavirus on different surfaces had found that the lowest transmission possibilities were copper because of its atomic makeup and cardboard because of its porous texture. The transmission was highest as aerosols, and higher on plastic and stainless steel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-proof-of-covid-spread-through-newspapers-health-min/story-Ft8pcvcZv5jTKs1TTJ7VPN.html
19-10-2020||India||Assam-Mizoram border: 7 injured in clashes, huts set afire||Seven persons were injured and several huts were torched on the Assam-Mizoram border on Saturday night in a flare up of border dispute between the two states. According to Mizoram information department, seven persons from Mizoram side were injured when villagers of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam clashed with residents of Vairengte in Kolasib district of neighbouring Mizoram. The clashes reportedly started after some people from the Mizoram side torched some huts made by Lailapur residents on a disputed portion of the border between two states. Assam forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya along with senior bureaucrats and police officers reached the spot on Sunday and took stock of the situation there. Blaming the incident on “miscreants from other side of the border”, the minister urged everyone to remain calm and assured the state government would provide necessary security to the residents. “We got report last night that some temporary huts were burnt. Police were immediately rushed to the spot and the situation brought under control. Security has been beefed up in the area and we are engaged in talks with counterparts on the Mizoram side,” said Cachar SP, Bhanwar Lal Meena. Saturday’s incident comes a week after a similar flare up between both states on the border along Karimganj district of Assam and Mamit district of Mizoram. In Mizoram, the state cabinet held a meeting on Sunday and “expressed regret at the unilateral and provocative acts of disturbing peace and harmony in the border areas at three locations”. The cabinet blamed the Karimganj and Cachar district administrations in Assam responsible for the flare up and urged the Assam government to take urgent measures to restore normalcy in the border areas. “The government of Mizoram appeals to all persons not to attempt to use the present crisis to further their personal or collective motives,” said a statement issued by Mizoram’s home department. On Sunday, Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal called up offices of the Prime Minister and union home minister and apprised them about the situation. He also talked with Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga and both agreed to resolve the issue through talks. Both Assam and Mizoram have approached the Centre to intervene in the matter and resolve the long standing border dispute between the two states. Chief secretaries of both states will have a meeting through video conference with union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Monday to discuss the present flare up. Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km long boundary. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972 when it became a union territory and a state in 1987. Border disputes between the two states keep occurring intermittently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mizoram-border-7-injured-in-clashes-huts-set-afire/story-97dN6e2a6rMTIjfmFHqcSM.html

19-10-2020||India||PM Modi has abdicated his responsibility in tackling Covid-19 pandemic: Sonia Gandhi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the alleged atrocities on women, Dalits, passing three “anti-farmer black laws” and “demolishing” the economy while claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “abdicated his responsibility” in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. “Atrocities on Dalits have reached a new zenith. Instead of honouring the law and granting adequate protection to India’s daughters, BJP governments are siding with the criminals. The voice of oppressed families is being suppressed by the agencies of the state. Is this the new ‘Raj Dharma’?” Gandhi asked. The remarks came in the backdrop of an incident at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh in which a 19-year-old Dalit girl died of injuries in a Delhi hospital after she was gang raped last month. Addressing a virtual meeting of newly-appointed general secretaries and in-charges of states after an organizational reshuffle last month, Gandhi also exhorted the party leaders and workers to join hands in defeating the “anti-democracy, autocratic designs and the sinister conspiracy” of the BJP and its governments. “Your responsibility is even more onerous and important as our democracy is passing through its most tumultuous times. There is a designed attack on our Constitution and our democratic traditions. Our country is ruled by a government, which is systematically bartering the interests of our citizens at the altar of profiteering by a handful of crony capitalists,” she said. The meeting also set the tone for the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar and by-polls in other states, including Madhya Pradesh. A comprehensive nationwide agitation programme to raise the alleged atrocities on women, Dalits and farmers was also approved at the meeting. Apart from the alleged atrocities on Dalits and women, Gandhi also took on the Modi government over farm laws, the Covid-19 pandemic and the decline in the GDP. “The current BJP government has attacked the very foundation of our resilient agrarian economy by bringing in three anti-agriculture black laws. A conspiracy has been hatched to defeat the gains of the Green Revolution,” she alleged. “Lives and livelihoods of crores of farm labourers, leasehold farmers, small and marginal farmers, toiling labourers and small shopkeepers are under attack. It is our solemn duty to join hands to defeat this sinister conspiracy,” she said. Alleging the “mismanagement” of the Modi government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Congress president said the country witnessed the “biggest unplanned, unmanaged and cruel migration” of crores of migrant labourers during the lockdown period. “The country was pushed into the abyss of coronavirus pandemic by sheer ineptitude and mismanagement of the Modi government. All this happened as we witnessed the biggest unplanned, unmanaged and cruel migration of crores of migrant labourers as government remained a mute spectator to their miseries,” she said. Attacking Modi, she said the “stark truth” is that a Prime Minster, who promised to defeat coronavirus within 21 days, has “abdicated” his and his government’s responsibility towards the citizens. “There is neither a plan nor any strategic thinking, or a solution or a way ahead in the fight against Corona,” she said. Gandhi said the BJP has simultaneously “demolished” the economy, built painstakingly by the hard work of fellow Indians and the vision of successive Congress governments. “Never has the country witnessed such a free-fall in GDP as also all other economic indices. Today, the young have no jobs. Nearly 14 crore jobs have been lost. Small and medium businesses, small shopkeepers and other small enterprises are shutting at an unprecedented pace, yet an uncaring government remains a mute spectator,” she added. “So much so, the central government is now failing to honour even its constitutional responsibilities. The share of GST compensation is being denied to states. How will state governments help our people, if the central government was to renege on its constitutional obligations? This must be a first example of economic anarchy being spread by the central government,” Gandhi said. BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said,” Rather than substance, her comments seem to be an attempt to divert attention from the internal turmoil within her party over the foisted leadership imposed for purely filial reasons.”The Congress party’s nationwide agitation programme includes observing a day-long fast on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and martyrdom day of Indira Gandhi on October 31. The day will also be observed as “Kisan Adhikar Diwas (farmers’ rights day). There will be tractor rally on every day from November 1 to 10 and nationwide protests over the alleged atrocities on women, Dalits and farmers on November 5. An online campaign – ‘SpeakUpForPSUs’ – and symposiums on Nehruvian ideology and nation-building will be held on November 14, the birth anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. On November 19, the birth anniversary of Indira Gandhi, Congress leaders will submit two crore signatures to President Ram Nath Kovind against the new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-has-abdicated-his-responsibility-in-tackling-covid-19-pandemic-sonia-gandhi/story-dZQ1Z17dwv2PFi9zo8MJ7N.html

No public function is scheduled during the three-day visit but he will attend a review meeting called by the Malappuram collector on Monday and later proceed to Wayanad. Besides Wayanad district, many areas of Kozhikode and Malappuram districts form a part of his constituency. On Tuesday, he will also attend a Covid-19 review meeting in Wayanad Collectorate. He will visit Mananthawady Government Hospital on Wednesday before leaving from Kannur airport, the DCC said. Last week there was a controversy after Wayanad district collector Adeela Abdulla denied permission to inaugurate a new block of the state-run Munderi School built with his MP fund. The online function was cancelled by the district administration at the last minute saying the state government was not informed and health protocols were not met. The Congress had criticised the decision saying it was a politically-motivated move. His presence in the last Lok Sabha election helped the Congress-led United Democratic Front to win 19 out of 20 seats in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-to-visit-his-north-kerala-constituency-of-wayanad-tomorrow/story-wVb98hn1WJuThphZbFMq2I.html
19-10-2020||India||India’s proposal against covid vaccine nationalism gets WHO backing||Amid resistance from developed countries to India and South Africa's joint proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to ensure universal access to coronavirus vaccines, World Health Organization (WHO) has voiced its support for the proposal.“WHO welcomes South Africa’s and India’s recent proposal to WTO to ease international and intellectual property agreements on covid-19 vaccines, treatments and tests in order to make the tools available to all who need them at an affordable cost,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted.“Ending the pandemic starts with collaboration. WHO launched the covid-19 Technology Access Pool (CTAP) in May, inviting countries to share data, knowledge and intellectual property on vital, life-saving health products in the fight against the coronavirus,” Ghebreyesus added.In a submission before the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Council of WTO on 2 October, India and South Africa urged WTO members for waiver of certain rules of TRIPS agreement to ensure that intellectual property rights such as patents, industrial designs, copyright and protection of undisclosed information do not create barriers to the timely access to affordable medical products including vaccines and medicines or to scaling-up of research, development, manufacturing and supply of medical products essential to combat covid-19.The proposal was taken up for discussion at the TRIPS Council meeting on 15-16 October where developed countries including the US, European Union, Canada, Japan, UK, Australia and Switzerland rejected the proposal while African group countries, least developed countries, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal among other countries supported the proposal. Countries like China, Turkey, Philippines, Colombia sought more information on it. The proposal will now be discussed informally among member countries and may be taken up again later before the year end.During the discussion at the TRIPS Council, India’s ambassador to the WTO Brajendra Navnit argued that the often-repeated argument that monopoly rights are needed to allow inventors to recoup their investment do not apply in case of development of health products and technologies required for handling the ongoing covid-19 crisis. “We would like to remind the members that in a global pandemic where every country is affected, we need a global solution. And our waiver proposal represents an open and expedited global solution to allow uninterrupted collaboration in development, production and supply of health products and technologies required for an effective covid-19 response,” he added.Countering arguments by some members that voluntary licenses are the most appropriate solution to scale up manufacturing in response to covid-19, India said that not a single patent holder has shown willingness to commit to the covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) initiative launched under the aegis of WHO. “In fact, the representative from WHO in this Council yesterday (15 October) admitted in response to a question that no pharmaceutical company has committed to sharing its IP (intellectual property) and technologies in the C-TAP pool since its launch more than five months ago. Given the refusal by pharmaceutical industry to routinely offer non-exclusive licenses with worldwide coverage to facilitate global access, clearly the solution to ending the pandemic does not lie in voluntary licenses,” he said.As many as 379 civil society organisations including Oxfam, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Access Campaign MSF, People’s Vaccine Alliance have written a letter to WTO members welcoming India and South Africa’s proposal citing existing supply-demand gaps in accessing medical products for covid-19, including access to diagnostic testing. “With entire health systems already overwhelmed by covid-19 and with governments facing a looming economic crisis, the health budgets of many countries simply cannot sustain highly priced covid-19 medical products. These realities will also hinder production by any competent manufacturer and impede the full freedom to collaborate, in developing, producing, importing and exporting the needed medical products,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-proposal-against-covid-vaccine-nationalism-gets-who-backing/story-KuLPeW4taALn8dorfndvnK.html
19-10-2020||India||Ahead of polls, all Congress members of Mizoram autonomous council join BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has got a shot in the arm in Mizoram with all 13 members of the ruling Congress in Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC) switching sides and joining the saffron party on Friday. The development comes ahead of next month’s polls to the LADC located in Lawngtlai district. The LADC has 25 total members of whom 8 are from Mizo National Front (MNF) and 4 former Congress members who resigned from the party last week. “All ruling Congress members of LADC led by chief executive member (CEM) T Zakunga have joined BJP and formed a government of our party. The LADC is headed for election in last week of November,” Vanlalhmuaka, Mizoram BJP president told HT. With this development, two of the three autonomous districts council in Christian-majority Mizoram, which is ruled by MNF, are under BJP rule at present. MNF is in power in the Chakma ADC while the Mara ADC is under BJP rule. “This is a significant boost for our party as all the three ADCs were Congress strongholds earlier. With the developments seen in the last years, Congress has been systematically removed from the ADC areas by BJP,” Vanlalhmuaka said. Political battles in Mizoram are usually two-sided affairs between Congress and MNF with the latter routing the former in the 2018 assembly polls. But BJP managed to enter the state assembly in 2018 when BD Chakma became the first MLA from the party in Mizoram. Although MNF is a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at Centre, the party doesn’t have any tie-up with BJP in Mizoram. “The development in LADC is good for us as our main rival Congress has been decimated. The Congress is a spent force in Mizoram and MNF will come to power in LADC after the next polls,” said a senior MNF functionary on condition of anonymity. The BJP is hoping that if senior party leaders visit the state ahead of the next polls and announce suitable packages for LADC from the Centre, the party would be able to retain its hold over the autonomous council. “Like all ADCs, LADC also comes under 6th Schedule of Constitution and receive funds directly from the Centre. If the party leadership announces some special benefits we will sweep the polls next month,” said Vanlalhmuaka. “The Congress members joined BJP en mass after they were promised that LADC would get direct funding from Centre and not through the Mizoram government. We are not affected much by the development as now we can choose the best candidates for the next polls there and are hopeful of coming back to power,” said former chief minister and Congress state president Lal Thanhawla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-ousts-congress-from-3rd-mizoram-autonomous-council-looks-at-centre-to-consolidate/story-aq9WKODpefZw98QvLeok2O.html
19-10-2020||Editorials||The real battle in Bihar | HT Editorial||The political contours in the Bihar election are now clear. On one side is the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), of the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a range of smaller forces, with Nitish Kumar as the chief ministerial face. On the other is the Grand Alliance of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and smaller Left parties. Then, there is the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) under Chirag Paswan — which is contesting against JD(U) and asking for support in the name of PM Narendra Modi. Despite strenuous denials by the BJP, the speculation that it encouraged the LJP refuses to fade away. And in small pockets of the state, a fourth force — of the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), in alliance with Bhaujan Samaj Party and a small regional force led by Upendra Kushwaha — will pose a challenge.This may come across as a rather fragmented political landscape, especially since Bihar has been largely bipolar. But one way to understand the situation is focusing on broad social groups. The ticket distribution patterns of all the forces in play indicate that they are primarily guided by identity-based political mobilisation with two objectives — consolidating their own social base, and expanding this base by sending a signal to communities outside their respective traditional umbrella.Take the BJP. It has given more tickets to upper castes than any other party, and reached out to extreme backward classes (EBCs); but it has also given a high number of tickets to Yadavs, hoping that it would be able to make a dent in the Yadav base. The one constituency conspicuously absent in the BJP’s outreach is Muslims. The JD(U) has focused on consolidating its EBC base, but also given tickets to Muslims — hoping that despite its alliance with the BJP, segments of the minority vote will still be loyal to Mr Kumar. Or take the RJD. Acutely conscious that its core base is Yadavs, it has given members of the community a high number of tickets — but it is also conscious that its inability to expand its base has limited its prospects, which is why it has given tickets to a large number of EBCs in a bid to create a broader Other Backward Classes (OBC) alliance with Muslims. The outcome of the Bihar election, thus, will depend on which party is most successfully able to retain its older social base and win over traditionally adverse social groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-real-battle-in-bihar-ht-editorial/story-2rSCtJJJkCyfgCSqeMBrIN.html
19-10-2020||Editorials||The significance of the Malabar exercise | HT Editorial||Australia is set to join the Malabar naval exercises, finally making it a drill which will see the participation of all four Quad countries — India, United States (US), Japan and Australia. While this was expected — especially after a sharp dip in China-Australia ties and a greater degree of convergence between all the four Quad countries on the need to signal determination against any Chinese attempts to impose its hegemony — it is testament to how quickly the international order is evolving.There is now a consensus, among every major liberal democracy in the world, that China is a threat — to political systems and open societies, economic self-reliance, and a rules-based regime, particularly in the international seas. India has traditionally sought to hedge its bets in larger geopolitics, but it does not have the luxury to do so anymore, because of its geography. The fact that India today faces Chinese aggression makes it incumbent on New Delhi to explore and deepen every international alliance which can serve as a source of symbolic and substantive support, including in the maritime domain where China has obvious vulnerabilities. There is a view that cementing the Quad, including through naval exercises, will alienate China even more — and make reconciliation difficult. But India’s experience shows that Beijing tends to respect power and strength. It is not a coincidence that as India-US ties improved in mid-2000s, China was better behaved. It is only with economic strength and partnerships such as the one that will be manifested in the Malabar exercise that India can broaden its options with China. The road to peace in the mountains may lie through the sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-significance-of-the-malabar-exercise/story-GtJRK9jo4kpKiyb5TswbaI.html
19-10-2020||Editorials||Don’t undermine SC on Char Dham plan||The Supreme Court (SC)-appointed high-powered committee (HPC), which was formed in 2019 to review whether the Centre’s ambitious Char Dham Highway Project (CDHP) needs to be revised to minimise the ecological damage of the fragile Himalayan region, met on October 17 to decide the “future course of action” on the project. But what is surprising — and wrong — is that the meeting happened without HPC chairman Ravi Chopra’s approval and participation. The Rs 12,000 crore-CHDP aims to build an 889-km all-weather road, connecting Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri. According to a report in this newspaper, some HPC members have alleged that holding the meeting reeked of political interference. The allegation cannot be rejected completely because there have been several instances in the last few months when certain members of the independent 26-member panel have not only undermined Mr Chopra’s authority, but tried to weaken HPC so that the construction of CDHP continues as planned despite environmental costs. The panel is divided over how wide the highway should be — HPC recommended that the width of the road should be 5.5 metre tarred (MTR) instead of 10 MTR to SC in July. On September 8, SC upheld the recommendation and asked the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways to reduce the width of the road for the full project. Mr Chopra alleged that the Uttarakhand Public Works Department is not implementing the SC order. Government officials who are uncomfortable with the prescriptions of the SC-empowered panel must realise that undermining Mr Chopra means undermining the court itself, and putting the ecology and citizens of the state at risk. As this paper had said before, the Char Dham project needs to be reviewed, and the SC needs to take a strict view of those undermining its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/don-t-undermine-sc-on-char-dham-plan/story-PaIdwfVOddz2kPz9LMLfhN.html
