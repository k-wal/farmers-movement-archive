12-10-2020||News||Mission Karmayogi: An ambitious plan to bolster State capacity||One of the many lessons that Covid-19 has brought to fore is the primacy of governments in providing their citizens effective means to deal with the impact of the crisis on lives and livelihoods. As the pandemic adds new complexities to education, income, food, and health systems, it is natural to look to the biggest players in development — the central and state governments — to increase expenditure and the quality of programme implementation.An important lever for improving public administration during and beyond the crisis is improving the quality of decisions made by officials at each level of government. The Centre recently launched Mission Karmayogi, a new initiative for civil service capacity-building. By providing training opportunities that map the competencies required for different jobs, this initiative has the potential to radically upgrade the management capacity of public officials, and, in turn, strengthen the capacity of the State to deliver. At the heart of the mission is the recognition that providing training opportunities to senior bureaucrats by sponsoring them to attend elite institutions has not been enough. Instead, India’s 20 million government officials need to be trained and retrained many times over during their career. For these trainings to have the desired effect, they need to be customised into thousands of highly relevant modules. The initiative aims to harness the potential of digital, face-to-face, and blended learning to create dynamic, highly customised learning systems with world class instructors. Achieving this ambitious vision will require collaboration among a range of institutions, including government training institutes, top universities in India and abroad, and multilateral agencies and development organisations. The department of personnel and training (DoPT) laid the foundation for Mission Karmayogi in 2018 when it launched the innovative Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT) platform to offer online training courses from leading global institutions to officers. Among the courses available on the iGOT platform is the MITx MicroMasters credential in Data, Economics, and Development Policy, an online course through which faculty from MIT have trained scores of government officers to incorporate cutting-edge economics research into the design, evaluation, and scale-up of social programs. The expanded iGOT-Karmayogi platform will provide officers the opportunity to select courses that best suit the skills required in their current role, and study at their convenience. For example, secretaries can take short custom courses on cutting edge practices in their sector, while section officers in their ministries can hone their management skills. For Mission Karmayogi to succeed, therefore, its training courses must speak to the needs of each officer’s specific job functions and must be designed with the most innovative pedagogical models available. To achieve this, a new initiative known as Creating Learning Opportunities for Public Officials (C-LOP), a partnership between DoPT, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and J-PAL South Asia, is working with ministries and departments to map the competencies required for specific jobs and match these requirements with new and existing online courses from top faculty in India and abroad. C-LOP will also work with government training institutes to redesign courses. With the right budget allocation and the active participation of line departments and training institutes in reimagining how our government officers learn, the potential of Mission Karmayogi is nothing short of transformative. Effective governance from a highly skilled bureaucracy is essential not only for recovery from the Covid crisis, but in grappling with the enduring challenges of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

12-10-2020||News||The fears about farm reforms are misplaced||The three bills enacted into law recently have been farmer-centric and far-reaching. Agricultural growth, in independent India, has passed through many phases. The new laws are in sync with input subsidy, minimum support price, government procurement and distribution of foodgrains, introduction of contract farming through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act. The share of agriculture workers in the total workforce of the country has come down from 69.9% in 1951 to 54.6% in 2011, according to the Census. In the corresponding period, the share of agriculture as part of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) output has declined from 51.9% to 14.4%. The fall in employment share is not commensurate with the decline in the GDP share. The agriculture sector uses a workforce which far exceeds its economic value. The average income of an agricultural household as against its average monthly consumption is nearly on par. India’s agricultural policy right from Independence was geared towards food sufficiency. Remunerative crop pricing was never a priority. The standard approach towards increasing farmers’ income was always about devising supplementary means in the form of animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries and bee-keeping. This continued as a matter of policy even after we moved from food scarcity to food surplus.The Green Revolution is seen as the success of new technology, which brought with it high-yielding crops. However, what is often overlooked is the role of farmers. Since 1955, foodgrain imports from the United States (US) under the PL-480 scheme, in excess of market requirement, kept the prices artificially down. This resulted in farmers becoming demoralised. However, when imports were reduced to realistic levels, farmers felt the incentive to produce more. This is what we need today. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has advocated “doubling farmers” incomes by 2022 from the levels of 2016. He spoke of remunerative pricing in this regard.On April 13, 2016, the government set up a Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income chaired by Dr Ashok Dalwai. The committee, after consultations, came up with 14 reports. The farm laws were based on the insights provided by this committee. There are 23 crops, including 14 kharif, seven rabi and two calendar-year crops for which the government notifies the minimum support price based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. There is no legal prohibition to a farmer selling his/her produce in an open market in pursuit of a better price. What, however, was missing was a legal and marketing architecture to protect and incentivise the farmer.The minimum support price, since its introduction in the 1960s, has remained focused on the wheat belt of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. In the rice belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Assam distress sales were often reported. Today, the wheat belt farmers is agitating, based on the misperception that the minimum support price will be withdrawn. The fact is that the government has provided a better minimum support price over the last six years, and will continue the policy as witnessed by the recent procurement through the minimum support price. The new laws will provide better choices with adequate safeguards to the farmers. The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, provides farmers with a choices that have been denied to them so far. It does not replace the system of Agricultural Produce Market Committee-run mandis, government procurement, or minimum support prices. The 62nd report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture — Agriculture Marketing and Role of Weekly Gramin Haats — highlighted the mess the Agricultural Produce Market Committee-run markets are in.There has clearly been a political usurpation of a democratic institution. In some states, the market fee is levied even for trade transactions taking place outside the market yard, whereas in some states transactions outside the market yard are illegal. A farmer cannot go to a mandi other than that with which he/she is registered. In reply to my unstarred question (No.328 dated February 4), the minister for agriculture said that the government has decided to develop existing 22,000 gramin haats into full-fledged gramin agricultural markets. The fear that market yards will disappear is unfounded. If we continue to do things as before, we will continue to get the same results. We have been hearing of farmer suicides and distress.The prime minister is bringing in positive changes and trying to empower the under-privileged. Let us be part of the solution and not the problem.Rajyavardhan Rathore is Lok Sabha MP from Jaipur Rural constituency and national spokesperson of the BJP The views expressed herein are his personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-fears-about-farm-reforms-are-misplaced/story-4vtuLDCDYo1LQ5vkVEGRNM.html
12-10-2020||News||The crippling effect of sedition and UAPA on dissent in India||A journalist from Kerala was accused of sedition and various offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, (UAPA) and arrested on the way to Hathras on October 7. In recent years, sedition and UAPA have been weaponised and used routinely against critics of various ruling governments. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau’s recently-released Crime in India statistics for 2019 confirm these observations. Ninety-three cases of sedition were filed in 2019, a 165% jump from 35 in 2016. In 2019, 1,226 UAPA cases were filed, a 33% increase from 2016.Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) defines sedition as any signs, visible representations, or words, spoken or written, that can cause “hatred or contempt, or excite or attempt to excite disaffection” towards the government. Sedition has a chequered colonial legacy of being used by the British against critics of the British administration. In Independent India, it has become a tool to curb freedom of speech and expression.Although the Supreme Court has stated in the Kedarnath case that the offence of sedition is not made out unless the accused person incites people to violence against the government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder, the police are either not aware of this requirement or willfully ignore it. People have been accused of sedition for staging a school play which criticised the prime minister, for saying that “Pakistan is not hell” and for writing to the prime minister about mob lynchings.UAPA is an anti-terror legislation, crafted for exceptional circumstances, that has become routinised. UAPA permits detention without charge for up to 180 days, making i a convenient tool to silence dissidents. Such long periods of pre-trial detention circumvent safeguards in the criminal justice system such as evidentiary requirements and burden of proof, and permit the state to punish those suspected of committing crimes without proving these allegations.The definition of a terrorist act in UAPA is vague. Amendments to UAPA in 2019 have given the Union government the power to notify an individual as a “terrorist” without a trial. Police custody under UAPA can also be extended to 30 days, increasing the possibility of custodial violence.The progress of sedition and UAPA cases reveals that the police are invoking these offences indiscriminately. In 2019, in 9% of the sedition cases (pending from previous years and filed in 2019), the police closed the case because of insufficient evidence or because the accused was untraceable. Eleven per cent of UAPA cases (pending from previous years and filed in 2019 in the same year) were closed for the same reason. Charge-sheets were filed in only 17% of the sedition cases and 9% of the UAPA cases. The conviction rate in sedition cases in 2019 was 3.3% and for UAPA cases it was 29.2%. India has low conviction rates (average conviction rate in 2019 for crimes committed under IPC was 50.4%) but these are abysmal even by that bar.However, low conviction rates for these offences are no reason to celebrate. Given the prevalence of indiscriminate arrests and pre-trial detention in India, for persons accused of sedition and offences under UAPA, even if they get acquitted, the process itself is punishment. Persons arrested for these offences will invariably spend long periods in prison. Judges are reluctant to give bail to people accused of sedition. UAPA prohibits a judge from granting bail to an accused unless that judge has “reasonable grounds to believe” that the accused is not guilty. These cases usually attract media attention and so the persons accused are also subject to trials in the pugnacious arenas of 24-hour news channels.Despite the criticism of sedition and UAPA, there are no signs that the government is planning to repeal or curtail them. An increase in the number of cases filed under these provisions has a chilling effect on any form of dissent, a trend that does not look like it will abate in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-crippling-effect-of-sedition-and-uapa-on-dissent-in-india/story-QBCPtSpVcYgbdnavysc8UL.html
12-10-2020||News||The growing threat of cyberwarfare||A couple of weeks ago, the government set up an expert committee under the National Cyber Security Coordinator to look into revelations that a Chinese technology company with links to China’s government had been monitoring Indian citizens and organisations. India is not the only country concerned about such cyberattacks. The United States (US) department of defence (DoD) last week exposed an information-stealing malware, SlothfulMedia, which they said was being used to launch cyberattacks against targets in India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Russia and Ukraine. While the DoD did not identify the cyber actor responsible for this particular malware, certain countries — China, Russia, North Korea, Iran — have consistently been accused of cyber warfare. The most notorious example is, of course, that of the misinformation campaign conducted by Russian bots during the 2016 US presidential elections, a campaign that is said to be active again in the upcoming US elections. This brings us to the question of what cyberwarfare is, who conducts it, how it is waged, and the ramifications of what seems to be an opaque shadow war conducted behind screens.Cyberwarfare is a strategic competition conducted between adversaries in cyberspace. It allows countries to conduct covert operations on a large scale, cheaply, and anonymously. These latter three attributes are particularly important to understand. Cyberwarfare is broad because it can occur in at least five different spaces — economic, societal, cultural/intellectual, military, and political. Economically, in the US, 85% of cyberattack targets are in the private sector — small banks, for example, can face over 10,000 attacks per day. US government agencies recently released a joint advisory warning that BeagleBoyz, a North Korean hacking group, has once again started robbing banks worldwide, including in India, through remote internet access to fund Kim Jong-Un’s cash-strapped regime. Societally, sowing disinformation through social media disinformation is also cyberwarfare. Russia has been particularly savvy in this field but recently, China has stepped up its game. Intellectual property (IP) rights are another avenue of strategic competition — in 2014, the US justice department indicted five Chinese military hackers and accused them of stealing secrets from US Steel, JP Morgan, Alcoa, Westinghouse Electrical Co., SolarWorld and United Steelworkers. Military cyberattacks are perhaps the most associated with cyberwarfare — the “Sandworm Team”, a group associated with Russian intelligence, has conducted attacks on government sectors in the US, Ukraine, Poland, and on the European Union and NATO. Cyberwarfare is both cheap and anonymous because the nature of the game has changed radically over the past two decades. The internet is today an essential critical infrastructure. Any country that is heavily reliant on it is at a relative disadvantage — the threats range from IP theft, to small businesses, to elections, to even the electricity grid. And it is exceedingly cheap – training videos are easily available online so all that is needed is a motivated group of people with an inexpensive laptop and an internet connection. It is also difficult to trace. A well-documented and game-changing cyberattack occurred in 2010 when a malware “Stuxnet” was released that was designed to damage Iran’s nuclear capability by making Iranian scientists and government think there were a series of internal engineering mishaps at their enrichment facility. It was a clever and sophisticated attack. Stuxnet was reported to be a result of US-Israeli collaboration and showed that governments can use malware to achieve covert intelligence objectives. But malware is not necessarily in need of government collaboration. Individuals are just as capable of launching such attacks, abetted and encouraged by their governments. Malware is often simple, low-cost and difficult to trace. A lot of malware, for example, is manufactured in China, and there is reported collaboration between the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Chinese universities to train hackers. But when a cyberattack is actually launched by either the government or individual, there is often no real consequence because of the anonymity it offers.This brings us to the question of combatting cyberwarfare. On one hand, the attributes of cyberwarfare make it difficult for governments to deter it. On the other, governments no longer have a choice but to confront it. The US recently released a report from its Commission on Cybersecurity with recommendations to shore up defences. One of the most important recommendations is to build relationships of trust between the government and private sector. In addition, governments must maintain priority investments in technology, science, and research and development (R&D) in the cyber sector. Innovation is of paramount importance given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the attacks — the US has been investing heavily in new Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to be able to automatically identify cyber threats and also launch cyberattacks against adversaries. India activated a Defence Cyber Agency last year. But much more needs to be done. Cyberwarfare is here and given that it poses a fundamental threat to both institutions and individuals, there has to be a concerted government-driven long-term strategy to counter it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-growing-threat-of-cyberwarfare/story-iiGha9WpqIKkQmPDdOLEHO.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||State has authority to restrain schools from collecting hiked fees: Maharashtra government to Bombay high court||The state justified the May 8 government resolution which restrained private unaided schools from collecting additional hiked fees for the academic year 2020-21 from parents and students by stating that the fee hike recommended by the PTA executive committee in January 2020 was for the academic year 2019-20 and hence the schools cannot be aggrieved by the restraining GR. The counsel for the state argued that though there was a reasonable restriction in the Fee Regulation Act, under the peculiar circumstances it was well within its right to restrain the schools from collecting additional hiked fees. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the response of the state to the petitions filed by various private unaided schools and school groups challenging the May 8 GR was informed by senior counsel Anil Anturkar for the state that the GR was valid. He submitted that nowhere in their petitions had the schools explained the provisions under which they were claiming a right to collect additional hiked fees. While responding to the contention of the schools that the fee hike for the academic year 2020-21 was approved by the Executive Committee of the Parent Teachers Association (PTA) that was duly appointed by the school managements, Anturkar submitted that it was not possible for an EC of a previous year to approve the fee hike for the next year and the same would be applicable for the academic year it was approved in. He further submitted that the claims of the school that they had declared the fee hike under provisions of section 6 (1) (a) and (b) of the Fee Regulation Act of 2011 could not be valid as the amendment was introduced only in August 2019 by which time the academic year had started. Anturkar submitted that as the amendment expected schools to declare fee hike over a period of five or ten years, the schools could not take benefit of the same as it had to be implemented either at the time of admission of a student to Class 1 or Class 5. Anturkar further stated that the restriction in the GR was valid as parents had lost their jobs or their salaries had been cut, hence paying additional hiked fees would not be possible for them. After hearing the submissions, the bench sought to know from the schools under which provision of the Fee Regulation Act they were claiming the hiked fees for the academic year 2020-21 and posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-has-authority-to-restrain-schools-from-collecting-hiked-fees-maharashtra-government-to-bombay-high-court/story-h6hsWT0NkUzYB1S1YGP50J.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||TRP fraud probe: Mumbai crime branch makes fifth arrest||The Mumbai crime branch investigating the manipulation of television rating points (TRPs) by three channels on Monday arrested Vinay Tripathi, a former employee of Hansa Research Group, from Mirzapur district in Uttar Pradesh. Tripathi is the fifth person to be arrested in the case. He will be produced in the local court at Mirzapur, which will take his transit remand and bring him to Mumbai on Tuesday evening. “Tripathi was a relationship manager in Hansa and left two years ago. He was in touch with Bhandari and used to pay money to Bhandari to distribute in households where barometers were installed. He is part of the TRP fraud and was in contact with some owners of channels or their employees,” said assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze. Earlier, the crime branch arrested four accused – Vishal Bhandari, 20, former employee of Hansa; Bompalli Rao alias Sanjiv Rao, 44 (on October 6); Shirish Shetty, owner of Fakt Maratha; and Narayan Sharma of Box Cinema (on October 9). They have been remanded in police custody till October 13. The crime branch also froze bank accounts of Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and their owners on Monday. They also seized Rao’s bank account, said Nandkumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (crime). The crime branch also issued a tender looking for firms to do a forensic audit. “A tender has been issued today for forensic audit because the transaction of TV channels run into a few hundred crores, so a forensic audit of all bank accounts related to the channels is necessary in the case,” said Thakur. Meanwhile, the crime branch on Monday recorded the statement of Praveen Nijhara, CEO of Hansa Research Private Limited, and deputy manager Nitin Deokar. “We have asked them to submit some documents to the crime branch for inquiry,” said Vaze. Vaze added CEO of Republic TV Vikas Khanchandani and the news channel’s distribution head Ghanshyam Singh were called at 5.30pm. “They have informed they are on their way,” said Vaze. Meanwhile, chief financial officer of Republic TV Shiva Sundaram informed the crime branch he would be coming to Mumbai on Tuesday evening, and join the investigation later in the evening on Tuesday. “He could not come because three members of his family were Covid positive. He has informed us that he is ready to cooperate in the investigation,” said Vaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-fraud-probe-mumbai-crime-branch-makes-fifth-arrest/story-3v5vEvd8Gytc1eLXXv4VnN.html

The action was met with protests from several shopkeepers in the area who demanded extension in timing for shops.Mitesh Shah, a member of Gokhale Road Traders Union, said, “If restaurants are allowed to be open till 11.30pm, why aren’t we permitted? Most people prefer shopping after work hours. If the corporation gave an extension to the hotel business, taking into consideration the losses they face, we should be given similar extension.”Shopkeepers association secretary of Thane, Chetna Dixit added, “Does the corporation believe that the virus will spread through shops which remain after 7pm and not spread by restaurants that are open till 11pm? We want similar rules for everyone. The present time limits are not convenient for the shopkeepers or the consumers.” Deputy municipal commissioner of TMC, Sandip Malvi said, “We are conducting meetings and discussions with the traders and soon a decision regarding the extension of time will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/allow-shops-to-remain-open-till-11pm-in-thane-traders-tell-tmc/story-RWBX03Z9P9fI2efv3XaWgN.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Executive producer Kshitij Prasad moves NDPS court for bail||Kshitij Ravi Prasad, a former executive producer of a popular film production house, has approached the special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court for bail, pleading that he has been falsely implicated in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. The plea is scheduled for hearing on October 14. Prasad was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on September 26 for allegedly receiving contraband from the alleged peddlers who had supplied charas to actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik.NCB alleged that Prasad’s role was revealed during the interrogation of Sanket Patel, one of the alleged drug peddlers. Patel claimed that he had delivered ganja (marijuana) to Prasad at his residence in Andheri on the instructions of Karamjeet Singh, an alleged drug distributor with a local network catering to the Bollywood fraternity. Patel had further stated that he delivered ganja around 12 times to Prasad from May to July. Prasad has refuted all the allegations and claimed that during the interrogation, when Patel was first brought in to identify him, he failed. “When the applicant [Prasad] was confronted with the accused Sanket Patel during his interrogation, the said accused categorically stated that he did not recognise the present applicant. Thereafter, the respondents instructed the applicant to leave the room and when he was called back after a few minutes, the said accused Sanket suddenly purported to recognise the present applicant,” read the bail plea. The bail plea further claimed that according to NCB, Prasad allegedly bought 50g of ganja 12 times from Karamjeet through Patel between May and July and paid ₹3,500 per packet, totalling a sum of ₹42,000. “That total amount of ganja alleged to have been purchased by the applicant is 600g, which would still be a small quantity, which at the most would squarely fall within the ambit of section 20(b)(ii)(A) (relates to production, manufacturing, possession, sale, purchase, transport or uses cannabis), which is punishable with a maximum imprisonment of up to one year or with fine, or both. Hence, the allegations against the present applicant make out an offence for a small quantity at the most,” Prasad claimed in his plea. He has further claimed that NCB has mechanically booked him under section 27A (financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders). Prasad has alleged that during his interrogation, he was “coerced by the agency to falsely implicate Bollywood actors Ranbir Kapoor, Dino Morea, and Arjun Rampal”. He alleged that the NCB consistently threatened and coerced him to make statements against Karan Johar and other senior production executives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-executive-producer-kshitij-prasad-moves-ndps-court-for-bail/story-35dbX4HCd0kmGtVZHJvjxH.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||HSVP asks architects to focus on structural safety of buildings||To prevent structural damages to residential buildings, particularly like one that happened after the rains on August 19 and 20, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has asked architects to focus on the structural safety of buildings and implement the design submitted at the time of obtaining completion certificate.The decision comes after a HSVP-appointed technical committee, probing the damage and tilting of three houses in HSVP sectors, found that the structures had a weak foundation, leading to the damage.HSVP officials said that it was observed that submission of structural safety certificates was not being taken seriously by architects and that there were discrepancies in what was being submitted on paper and what was taking place on ground.To prevent repeat of such incidents, HSVP officials held a detailed meeting with architects and asked them to ensure that the structural safety certificate are submitted as per the plan and implemented as per the approved design. The architects have also been directed not to apply for occupancy certificates(OC) before the building is complete.Vivek Kalia, estate officer, HSVP, said that action would be initiated against architects if it is found that OC had been sought for incomplete building or false pictures were uploaded, as was found in some cases in the past. “To ensure structural safety, it has been decided that the architects will also have to upload the detailed structural design while applying for a building plan. They will also have to ensure that the building has been constructed as per approved design,” he said.Another decision taken by the HSVP is that at the time of applying for an occupation certificate, the allottee will have to submit an undertaking duly attested by 1st class magistrate that the premises shall not be used for any other purpose other than the allotment conditions. The allottee shall not raise any extra covered area after receiving the OC.While applying for the OC, architects will also have to submit the plot size as per the verified demarcation plan, the authority said.Kalia said that the objective of this decision is to prevent the commercial use of houses, which are in residential sectors. “We want to ensure that commercial activities are not carried out in residential areas,” he.said.The committee formed by HSVP had submitted in its report that the foundation of the buildings that tilted in August was not laid at hard form strata and that the construction was not done under technical supervision of an architect or structural engineer. It is due to this reason that HSVP has now decided to obtain structural safety certificate from architects to ensure such incidents are not repeated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-asks-architects-to-focus-on-structural-safety-of-buildings/story-1PZpfMBWiMXD3tZd2f2UHO.html

The deceased was identified as Sundar Pandit who owns a tile manufacturing business. The police said that he was a resident of Barola under Sector 49 police jurisdiction, but also had a house in Sector 107 which comes under Sector 39 police jurisdiction.According to police officials, they came to know about the incident on Sunday night. “The family did not inform anyone about the death, and it was through social media that we came to know about the incident,” said Sudhir Kumar, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.According to the police, Pandit’s body was found in his car by his brother after which the family called a doctor who declared him dead. The family, however, did not inform the police about the incident and went on to perform his last rites. By the time the police found out about the incident, the cremation was done, the officials said.“The family members have alleged that he would often consume alcohol. According to them, he must have done the same on Saturday night and then fallen asleep in his car. They further claimed that his death must have been caused due to suffocation in the vehicle whose AC was running,” said Kumar.The police officials said that the circumstances surrounding Pandit’s death are mysterious, but the family has not filed any complaint and without an autopsy the exact cause of death would remain unclear.However, a spokesperson for the Noida police said that a probe in the matter is underway despite the family’s reluctance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-35-year-old-businessman-found-dead-in-his-car/story-BYdYKKFHjEp2V7FLYocPYJ.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Three children including siblings go missing from Greater Noida||Greater Noida: Two minor siblings went missing from their home in the Surajpur industrial area on October 6, the police said.According to officers, 11-year-old Sanam and his nine-year-old brother Aryan had gone missing while playing outside their house. Their family members had launched a search but failed to trace them, after which they had filed a complaint in Surajpur police station. The children’s father, Ashok Singh, said that the two had jumped off the boundary wall on October 6 at 7am. Singh worked as a security guard in a factory in Surajpur, which has been closed for some time. He used to live with Aryan inside the factory premises, while his wife and elder son Sanam had come from Mainpuri a month ago. “The children were playing in the factory compound and we were inside the house. After sometime, when we came out, they were nowhere to be found. We checked the main gate but it was locked from inside. We checked the CCTV footage and found them jumping over the boundary wall, which would be about three-four feet high,” he said. The family launched a search in the nearby areas but could not find them. Police said that they scanned the CCTV footage of nearby areas and found the children were last seen walking towards Pari Chowk in Greater Noida. Harish Chandar, DCP (Central Noida) said a police team has launched a search for the missing children. “Primary investigation shows the two siblings were seen walking on their own. We have shared their pictures with neighbouring police stations, railway stations and bus stop coordinators. We are trying to recover them,” he said.Meanwhile, a three-year-old boy has been missing for three months from Greater Noida, police said. The child’s father Shahid Ali said that his son, Shadab, has been missing from Haldoni village in Ecotech 3 area.

12-10-2020||Chandigarh||After aide shot dead in Chandigarh, Lawrence Bishnoi gang threatens bloodshed||A day after Lawrence Bishnoi’s aide and former student leader Gurlal Brar was shot dead outside a mall in Chandigarh, a Facebook page in the jailed gangster’s name threatened a bloodshed on streets, while another of his aides, Monty Shah, was booked for making a murder bid on a rival in Burail on Sunday night. A case was registered against Monty Shah on Monday on the complaint of his cousin Praveen Shah and bouncer Tirath, who are both witnesses in the murder case of property dealer Rajveer, alias Sonu Shah, who was shot dead at his office in Burail, Sector 45, on September 28 last year. According to the chargesheet filed in January, Bishnoi was the one who had ordered the hit.According to the police complaint, Tirath spotted Monty Shah approaching his office holding two pistols on Sunday night. Tirath then ran inside the office where Praveen was also present, and they hid themselves. CCTV footage shows that later, Monty returned to his vehicle, in which two more people were waiting for him. Though the footage also showed Monty brandishing weapons, police have found no evidence of firing yet. However, a case under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code besides the Arms Act has been registered at the Sector-34 police station. Praveen, who is Sonu Shah’s brother, and Tirath in their complaint to police alleged that Monty wanted to eliminate them as they are main witnesses in the property dealer’s murder in which Bishnoi is the main accused. After Sonu’s murder, Praveen had even demanded police protection.“As of now, we are looking into personal enmity angle owing to business rivalry. Our prime focus is to arrest Monty,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. However, senior police officials privy to the case said the gang war angle cannot be ruled out though it is too early to say anything. ‘Rules of the game have changed’Meanwhile, on Monday, a post shared on a Facebook page in the name of Lawrence Bishnoi threatened retaliation for Gurlal Brar’s murder. HT could not independently verify antecedents of those running the social media page.Brar, 26, former state president of the Students’ Organisation of Panjab University, was gunned down in his Toyota Fortuner SUV after he came out of Playboy Nightclub at City Emporium Mall in the Industrial Area, Phase 1, on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday.Three motorcycle borne assailants had fired at Brar, known to be Bishnoi’s close associate. Soon after, slain gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group took to social media, owning responsibility for the killing “to avenge” the murder of their associate Lavi Deora at a fair in Faridkot’s Kotkapura in 2017, in which Brar had reportedly played an active role.The Facebook post, which also carried a photograph of Brar with Bishnoi, declared the beginning of a “new war”, while issuing a warning to those who are “not with us”. The post in Hindi then went on issue threats of a bloodshed on the streets, adding that the “rules of the game have changed”. Another post shared on behalf of Bishnoi’s aide Bhola Shooter carried the picture of Brar’s dead body and warned the perpetrators of retaliation. “We are verifying the veracity of these threats,” said SSP Chahal, adding that police have got some leads in Brar’s murder case.The shooters are yet to be identified, though an abandoned motorcycle has been recovered from near the Transport light point. Police are verifying whether it is the same motorcycle used in the crime that took place just one-and-a-half kilometre away. Brar’s postmortem has been conducted, though the details are awaited. According to initial reports, he had received six bullet wounds on the head, chest, neck and arm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-aide-shot-dead-in-chandigarh-lawrence-bishnoi-gang-threatens-bloodshed/story-HkBkgQqh2vNRww79OE2cbM.html
12-10-2020||City||Survey in Gurugram district identifies 800 severely malnourished children||Gurugram: At least 800 severely acute malnourished (SAM) children have been identified in a recent survey conducted by the district women and child development department. Covering more than 51,000 kids (from infants to five years of age), the survey has been conducted in the district for the first time, especially to identify severely malnourished (low weight- for-height) and stunted (low height-for-age) children, according to officials. Survey data shows that out of the 51,923 children, 3,619 were stunted, 803 were severely malnourished and 1,377 were moderately malnourished. Among them, about 52% are male kids. Of the 803 severely malnourished, 298 were traced in Sohna block, followed by 211 in Gurugram block, 149 in Pataudi, and 64 in Farrukhnagar. At least 81 from other rural pockets. Sunaina Khatri, district programme officer, women and child development department, said the team is analysing the reasons behind the malnourishment — the socio-economic status of the family, hygienic condition of the home, awareness about balanced diet among other factors. “We have tried to cover maximum rural areas where we have an existing anganwadi. The figures are likely to change as due to migration, people who left Gurugram might come back again. Since it is for the first time that such an extensive survey has been conducted, it is difficult to say anything on the complexity of the problem for a district such as Gurugram,” said Khatri. The new survey was conducted over the last two months by the department under the Poshan Abhiyan or the National Nutrition Mission. Until then, the department was taking data of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16 for all policy-related matters, where the sample size of the survey was less, according to Khatri. “Although the Poshan Abhiyan was rolled out in 2018, it kickstarted in Gurugram in September 2019. The survey under it had to start in February this year. It had to be put on hold due to the outbreak of the Covid-19,” said Khatri. In February, the department received all the equipment required to measure the exact height and weight of the infants and those below five years of age. “Earlier we had only one lifting weighing scale. There was no equipment to measure height and find stunted or wasted kids,” said Khatri. Therefore, to trace malnourished children, the department received proper baby weighing machines, infantiometre to measure the height of an infant and stadiometer to check the height of children above one year who can stand. “Due to Covid-19, it was a challenging task for the team to take measurements of the child as parents did not allow to touch the kids. In rural areas, it is difficult as villagers have inhibitions. The ground team managed to do it as they carried machines with them and sought help from parents in taking the measurements,” said Sushma, one of the supervisors. Taking the issue on a priority, the district administration is trying to take assistance from private hospitals. Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner, said it is critical to identify malnourished kids in the district for they are not missed out. “To address the situation of malnourishment, the district administration has reached out to private hospitals to help our teams. We are yet to get confirmation but the issue will be taken on a priority,” said Panwar.Anganwadis where children used to get hot cooked meals at the village level and in urban slums under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) have been closed for several months due to the Covid-19 situation. “Since Gurugram block is mostly urban, there are hardly any anganwadis except in areas near slums. In other blocks like Sohna, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar, there are proper anganwadis where cooked meals were served to the children and lactating mothers before Covid-19,” she said. Presently, the department is only providing fortified milk powder to the families of the affected children registered under 1333 anganwadis of the district.Basanta Kumar Kar, who has worked for more than two decades on malnutrition in South East Asia, said, “The numbers are high if stunting and SAM figures are combined. Severely malnourished children should be sent to the nutrition rehabilitation centre for proper monitoring and care, while steps should be taken to prevent moderately malnourished kids from getting severely undernourished. These kids should be monitored regularly, ensuring they get proper nutritional supplement along with maintaining basic hygiene and sanitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/survey-in-gurugram-district-identifies-800-severely-malnourished-children/story-3BOrbTKpbXb5FZIt0FtndP.html

The driver lost control of the vehicle, but had enough time to crash it into a tree so as to not cause a bigger accident. Due to the crash, the tractor stopped and all of us sustained injuries. But we were lucky not to have suffered too much damage,” said Mahesh Singh, one of the passengers who is a resident of JJ Colony.The police said that they received a call on the police helpline about the incident after which a team was rushed to the spot.“There were 21 people on the vehicle and all of them had some injury or the other. They were taken to the district hospital, from where all of them, except one, were later discharged after treatment. One woman in her twenties had serious injuries, and she is still undergoing treatment,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.“It seems that there was a malfunction with the steering wheel of the tractor that led to the crash. No other cause has been found. No complaint has been filed in this case yet,” said the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/21-injured-as-tractor-rams-tree-in-noida/story-LJBZTql0o5SwtDV6Ti320L.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Noida’s urban villages await property ownership cards under SVAMITVA scheme||NOIDA: Even as the Uttar Pradesh government has begun giving property ownership cards to beneficiaries in several villages of the state under the Centre’s Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas (SVAMITVA) scheme, the urban villages in Gautam Budh Nagar await for their turn. According to officials, the scheme is yet to be implemented in the district due to some legal complexity. The state government is yet to decide as to when this scheme that empowers farmers will be executed at the ground in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas, where the UP Industrial Development Act-1976 is into effect in most of the villages, the officials said. At least 274 villages in the district -- 54 villages in Noida, 124 in Greater Noida and 96 in Yamuna Expressway areas -- are notified, while 88 others are not notified, said officials. The term ‘notified villages’ means the industrial authority of the area takes care of civic amenities and handles the developmental works in such villages and village head (Pradhan) elections do not take place. While the villages which are not notified are governed by the ministry of panchayati raj, the officials said. Out of the 88 villages that are not notified and have elected village heads under the Panchayat Raj system, six are in Bisrakh block, 48 in Dadri area and the remaining are in Jewar. “So far the scheme is meant for villages, which are not notified by the three industrial authorities. The survey work is underway with drones in 10 villages of the district. The villages which are notified in the district will be able to get the benefit under this scheme only after a decision taken by the UP government,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. The legal complexity may affect the interests of thousands of the farmers, who have given their land for the development of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas.“We were the first one to start an agitation in 2013 demanding unique property title to houses located in urban areas so that farmers are empowered. But due to legal complexity, this scheme is not being implemented in the district that defeats the purpose. We hope the UP government will address this issue at the earliest,” said Raghuraj Singh of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti. The Noida authority’s chief executive officer, Ritu Maheshwari, said they do not have any ‘idea’ on this issue. The Greater Noida authority is also not aware as to how this will be implemented in villages here. However, the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority CEO Arun Vir Singh said, “District magistrate may be working on this.”If the SVAMITVA scheme is implemented, the house owners in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas will be able to take loan from the banks and will have a sense of security.“The scheme is a great step because it will solve legal disputes over the property and redefine the character of urban villages in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas,” said Ajaypal Sharma, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union -- GB Nagar. Meanwhile, Noida MLA Pankaj Singh on Monday discussed the issue with villagers and the Noida authority CEO via video conference. “Giving a unique title to property in villages is a progressing and historic move. And we are taking steps so that it can be implemented in villages at the earliest. We want the villages must get all the civic facilities at par with sectors. And we are working in that direction,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-urban-villages-await-property-ownership-cards-under-svamitva-scheme/story-hj2g5Jzawirpp78zAKXy0K.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks actors Richa Chadha and Payal Ghosh to settle the issue by October 14||The Bombay high court (HC) directed actors Richa Chadha and Payal Ghosh on Monday to arrive at a settlement and file the consent note by Wednesday. The observation was made after Ghosh alleged Chadha’s comments to the media had led to Ghosh being trolled on social media, which Chadha has denied. While hearing the defamation suit filed by Chadha against Ghosh, actor Kamaal R Khan and a news channel, the bench of justice AK Menon was informed that both actors needed more time to finalise the terms of consent. Chadha had claimed damages worth Rs 1.1 crore. Advocate Nitin Satpute, representing Ghosh, alleged that after last week’s hearing, Chadha had told the media she’d won the case whereas the court had asked Ghosh if she was willing to apologise to Chadha and withdraw her allegedly defamatory statement. Ghosh had said she is willing to tender an apology to Chadha. On Monday, Satpute sought directions asking Chadha to refrain from making such statements and to apologise to Ghosh. Chadha’s legal counsel, Saveena Bedi, denied her client had made any such statement and said there was no question of Chadha apologising to Ghosh. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “If you are settling the matter, is it not better that you avoid making public statements? Rather than talking to others, talk to each other.” Satpute informed the court that Ghosh needed time to prepare the consent note after consultation with Chadha, which the court permitted. He also reiterated that his client is willing to withdraw her statement and apologise to Chadha, subject to certain conditions including the agreement that Chadha will not file any criminal case against Ghosh after this matter is settled. The court also continued the injunction on channels and media portals against sharing and airing the statements made by Ghosh about Chadha till the next hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-actors-richa-chadha-and-payal-ghosh-to-settle-the-issue-by-october-14/story-JoyUdFXMrRSNfYQfvH0GPP.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Noida NGO helps 100 visually impaired students learn through online classes||Noida: As schools remain closed due to the Covid lockdown, learning has become a difficult task for students, especially for visually impaired students. To overcome this problem, a Noida-based NGO is helping more than 100 visually impaired students continue the learning process through online classes. The NGO – Saksham Resource Centre – has also provided laptops and mobile phones to students to enable them to join online classes from home. Brij Bartwal, principal of Saksham, located in Noida Sector 51, said the lockdown had stopped the teaching and counselling of students in March. “We had over 100 special students and they stopped coming for classes. Some of them returned to their native places in Bihar, Bengal and other states with their parents after the coronavirus outbreak. This badly affected their studies,” she said. The officials then held a meeting with NGO management and decided to launch online classes. The NGO, which works for inclusive education with assistive technology for the visually impaired students free of cost, provided mobile phones to 14 students and laptops to six students. Other students had managed mobile phones on their own. “We provide education using sign language and braille to children. We provide computer classes for them using a special software, Non Visual Desktop Access (NVDA), which allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with Windows. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions, and life-skills training programmes, are also held to make them self-reliant,” she said.The NGO first resumed classes on WhatsApp video call. “Later, we shifted to Microsoft Teams, which facilitates recording of live lectures, and joining of multiple persons in the group,” Bartwal said. The online classes have helped the students immensely. The resource centre caters to children in the age group of six months to 20 years. It has 25 teaching staff and 15 non teaching staff. It runs batches in two shifts 9 am – 2.30 pm and 2.30 pm to 5 pm. The students attending regular schools join the second shift while others join the first shift. “We get students mostly from the villages belonging to the low income group. We sometimes recharge their mobile phone internet bills to ensure they join online classes,” she said. The NGO is supported by different companies through their CSR initiatives.Suraj Thapa, a class VI student in a private school in Noida Sector 27, has been associated with Saksham for over six years. “I have learnt braille and computer basics at the NGO. I study in a private school with normal students. Saksham has empowered me. It has a conducive learning environment for blind students,” he said. Suraj lives with his mother, who is single parent, in Hoshiyarpur village.Saksham was founded by Dipendra Manocha and Rummi K Seth in Delhi in 2003 and the Noida centre was started in 2006. The school provides free education to students. So far it has trained over 500 special students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ngo-helps-100-visually-impaired-students-learn-through-online-classes/story-NVws0VmEEOPnmez8Uo1aKI.html
12-10-2020||City||Brace for heavy rain in Mumbai and suburbs tomorrow: IMD||Mumbai: The city and suburbs can expect heavy to very heavy rain on Thursday and heavy rain on Wednesday and Friday owing to intense rain-bearing weather systems over the east coast.The weather bureau has issued alerts for localised flooding across isolated areas between Wednesday and Friday. This has also delayed the withdrawal of the season so far.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar for Thursday and the next three days for south Konkan and central Maharashtra. A yellow alert (heavy rain across isolated areas) has been predicted for Wednesday when thunderstorms accompanied with lightning and gusty winds can be expected while heavy rain has been predicted for Friday in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar.IMD officials said Mumbai, Thane and Raigad could receive heavy rain spells between October 14 and 15. “Maharashtra is already witnessing an enhancement in rain activity with thundershowers over interior parts of the state. This is likely to enhance further with a deep depression located over the Andhra Pradesh (AP) coast moving land from the Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, a trough from the cyclonic circulation (weather system) associated with the depression over south-central parts of the country (AP, Rayalaseema and north interior Karnataka). These factors are likely to enhance rainfall for Maharashtra and the Konkan coast,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD.According to IMD’s state-wide warning, the entire state is under a yellow-alert warning while an orange alert has been issued for Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Osmanabad, Solapur, Latur and Nanded districts. On Wednesday, warnings are in place for all south Konkan and south-central Maharashtra districts.Meanwhile, no rain was recorded on Monday but air quality improved. The air quality index (AQI) dipped to 87 (satisfactory) on Monday. It was 90 (satisfactory) on Sunday, 121 (moderate) on Saturday, the worst since March this year. An AQI of 77 (satisfactory) has been predicted for Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brace-for-heavy-rain-in-mumbai-and-suburbs-tomorrow-imd/story-xE8RSx9cDdcfp6sEBZ1DPL.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||MCG to survey internal roads for setting up cycle tracks||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will undertake a survey of internal roads with the aim of setting up cycle tracks across the city. A direction in this regard was issued by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh during the civic body’s House meeting in Sukhrali on Monday.At the meeting, Mahesh Dayma, MCG councillor of Ward 30, had proposed an agenda for constructing cycle tracks on the Golf Course Road (GCR) and Golf Course Extension Road (GCER). With both the stretches falling under the ambit of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) jurisdiction, MCG commissioner directed officials to conduct a survey of stretches falling within MCG’s jurisdiction where cycle tracks can be set up.“Following the success of city’s first cycle track along Netaji Subhash Marg, we realised that such a project is a must on all civic roads, provided there is adequate space to ensure all safety measures. Hence, a direction has been sent to MCG officials to survey the municipal roads across the city and identify stretches where establishing such cycle tracks is feasible. We want to design our roads in such a manner so that along with vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians can also be catered,” said Vinay Pratap Singh. He said that the survey will be started with immediate effect.All master roads, stretches that carry intercity traffic such as GCR, GCER, MG Road, fall within the jurisdiction of GMDA while stretches carrying intracity traffic such as sector roads and village roads are under the MCG.GMDA has plans for constructing 650 kilometres of cycle tracks across the city, including tracks on Sohna Road, GCR and GCER in the second phase.In the first phase, cycle tracks originating from Huda City Centre (HCC) towards nearby areas such as Subhash Chowk, Signature Towers, IFFCO Chowk, DLF Phase 1/DLF Phase 4 crossing, Kanhai traffic lights will be built by GMDA. In this regard, GMDA has already launched a 10km cycle track between HCC and Subhash Chowk — the first cycle track in the city on October 2.“A minimum of 30 metres of road width is required for setting up cycle tracks. Most municipal roads in Gurugram are 12-20 metres wide. It would be more feasible for the MCG to regularise speed limits on such stretches as per the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) guidelines so as to ensure safety of cyclists, and to build cycle tracks on the few internal roads which are more than 30 metres wide,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, associate director, Nagarro, which is assisting GMDA with setting up cycle tracks on master roads across the city.Bhatt said that as per the IRC guidelines, the speed limit on municipal roads is 30 kmph, which further reduces to 20 kmph when passing hospitals and schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-survey-internal-roads-for-setting-up-cycle-tracks/story-HT3LqtuK6o3T7GmheKQ1sM.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||Over a dozen Bhondsi Jail inmates to be questioned in drugs smuggling case||A day after a 52-year-old jail warder deputed at Bhondsi Jail was arrested for allegedly supplying drugs to the inmates, a probe has revealed that he was promised ₹15,000 per delivery by one of the inmates, said the police. The police suspect that the arrested jail warder was supplying drugs to the inmates for the past 10 days and had plans to allegedly smuggle mobile phones inside the jail as well. However, he was caught before he could do so.According to the police, the jail warder, Prem Chand of Mahendragarh, retired from the Indian Army and joined the prison department on a contract, said the police. Chand was arrested from Bhondsi Jail crossing, while receiving drugs from a Rewari-based drug peddler. The police had recovered 110 grams of sulfa and 24 grams of smack packed in a packet from his possession. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Chand came in contact with Deepak alias Deepu alias Churari of Rewari, who offered him to pay ₹15,000 for smuggling drugs inside the jail and ₹20,000 for supplying four mobile phones. “The inmate used to pack the drugs in smaller packets and sold them further for ₹1,000 per 10 grams of drugs and a mobile phone for ₹50,000,” he said. Sangwan said the arrested warder’s plan was to smuggle drugs and mobile phones at least four times a month and earn at least ₹1 lakh through these illegal means. He had prepared a list of inmates who were dealing in drugs and mobile phones inside the jail to earn quick money. “We are investigating if he has any links with the former deputy jail superintendent Dharambeer Chautala, who was arrested on July 23 for smuggling drugs and mobile phones to inmates,” he said. The police have also prepared a list of over 12 inmates who are suspected to be in touch with jail officials and former deputy jail superintendent Dharambeer Chautala. They will be questioned by the crime investigation unit and senior officers to know more about the drug trail inside the Bhondsi jail, said the police. A team was formed on Monday to question the inmates and the police are suspecting that more jail officials might be involved in this racket. Jail officials are under the police scanner as the cases of smuggling drugs and mobile phones are increasing despite strict surveillance, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-a-dozen-bhondsi-jail-inmates-to-be-questioned-in-drugs-smuggling-case/story-Z8xsOeAl1ao0eaxSrBh80L.html
12-10-2020||City||Gurugram air quality enters ‘poor’ zone for first time this season||Gurugram: For the first time this season, air quality entered the ‘poor’ category in Gurugram with the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily evening bulletin recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 259, a significant rise from Sunday’s AQI reading of 187. Neighbouring Delhi recorded an AQI of 261 in the ‘poor’ category, the worst this season.Experts and officials said this was to be expected as the city has consistently recorded pollution levels in the upper end of the ‘moderate’ category since October 6, coinciding with a dip in temperature and a reduction in wind speed. They, however, said Gurugram may see cleaner air days over the next week before the full impact of stubble burning in paddy-growing states, mainly Haryana and Punjab, is felt around Delhi-NCR.The maximum temperature recorded was 34.8 degrees Celsius while the minimum was 16.8 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD website.Higher concentrations of PM2.5 (recorded as the primary pollutant in Gurugram on Monday) were felt in the early hours of the morning, peaking around 8am, with concentrations of PM2.5 exceeding the 300ug/m3 mark in the vicinity of at least three official air quality monitoring stations in the city. “North-westerly winds are prevailing, and they are fairly calm. While there may be some small impact farm fires, the reason for Monday’s spurt in AQI is not actually stubble burning. Rather, negligible wind speeds and a nip in the air have allowed pollution from local sources to accumulate. The IMD has predicted a change in wind speeds and directions this week, so we can hope for some improved air quality, but not for very long,” said Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality scientist based in Gurugram, adding crop fires are likely to peak next week, mid-way through this season’s harvest.Elaborating on this, Sumit Sharma, director of the earth science and climate change division at TERI, said, “As of October 8, there were only about 250 farm fires visible in a 400km x 400km quadrant around Delhi. So the intensity is not so much as of now. What has likely happened in Gururgam is that emissions from local sources — vehicles, diesel generators, biomass burning and so on — have been subject to two meteorological adversities: a drop in temperature and a drop in wind speed. So there is no horizontal diffusion of pollutants taking place (by wind) or vertical diffusion (by temperature).” The ministry of earth science’s early air quality warning system for Delhi, issued daily, also noted on Monday, “The wind speed has slowed down, particularly in evening and night, which will help in accumulation of pollutants over Delhi-NCR and deteriorate air quality.” However, as per CPCB’s forecast, Gurugram is expected to see ‘moderate’ air over the next two days, between 160 and 190 on the AQI bulletin. During this period, the India Meteorological Department has predicted an increase in wind speeds over Delhi-NCR, from 4kmph on October 12 to about 8kmph on October 14. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, corroborated the experts’ accounts. “This is not a stubble burning issue yet. Over the past week, the atmospheric temperature has dropped by more than degree and there has been a fall atmospheric pressure all across north India due to the onset of winter, leading to extremely slow winds. We will begin measures for local dust control once we have received directions from the Environment Pollution Control Authority in Delhi. The directions are awaited. The Graded Response Action Plan will be put into effect by the end of this week,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-air-quality-enters-poor-zone-for-first-time-this-season/story-RIzLBDYHa8BvotEUWjqV2M.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||HSVP rakes in ₹250 crore from auctions of plots||The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has managed to earn ₹250 crore in the last four auctions held since July. The authority managed to sell both commercial and residential properties at these auctions at a premium. HSVP officials said that due to the strong response from buyers, the authority has now identified several large properties in the city for a mega auction to be held on October 23. In this auction, properties in the commercial sectors of the city will primarily be auctioned. Vivek Kalia, estate officer, HSVP, said that in the previous auctions, the authority managed to earn over ₹250 crore by selling both commercial and residential properties despite market sentiments being low. “The reason for the enthusiastic response is that HSVP properties have premium locations and offer good value for money to the investors. The properties were of different sizes and were rightly priced which helped in their sale,” he said. To offset the large amount of loan burden, the authority has been on a spree to identify its properties and sell them to raise funds. Since last month, the authority had also started an exercise to get its plots measured so that these could be listed in auctions. As per the details shared by the authority, the auction held on July 15 generated a total revenue of ₹15 crore, the one on August 14 generated ₹49 crore. Similarly, the auction on August 28 generated ₹127 crore, while the one on September 29 generated a total revenue of ₹66 crore.

12-10-2020||City||Delhi entrepreneurship university may begin first academic session next year||New Delhi: The first academic session of Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University is expected to start from next year, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday.Addressing a digital press briefing, Kejriwal said the board of the university has been constituted and its members held the first meeting on Monday. “The Delhi skill and entrepreneurship university has been established through an Act of the Delhi legislative assembly. I am glad to announce that the university has started functioning today. The first academic session is expected to start next year. It will be done in close consultation with companies who will be treated as customers in this endeavour, so that courses are in tune with industry demand. The courses which will be taught in the university will be designed in a manner that the students get jobs based on the design and curriculum of the course,” Kejriwal said. The government has appointed Dr Neharika Vohra, the head of the Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE) at IIM-Ahmedabad, as the vice-chancellor of the university.The board members include Pramath Raj Sinha, founding dean of the Indian School of Business and founder of Ashoka University; Genpact founder Pramod Bhasin; Naukri.com founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani; entrepreneur Shrikant Sastri and IP University founding vice-chancellor KK Aggarwal.Kejriwal said the sole objective of the university is to ensure a conducive environment for those seeking to become entrepreneurs.“Students will be imparted skills and training at the university so that they can easily get a job as soon as they pass out from the institute or can pursue business by getting hands-on business training,” he said. A senior official in the education department said the university will have multiple campuses or centres across Delhi and the admission process along with its schedule will be prepared by the board in the coming months. “The main campus will be located in southeast Delhi, even as there will be multiple centres in different parts of the city. The admission schedule will be rolled out next year, 2-3 months before the start of the academic session,” the official said. The chief minister said that those designing courses will show the curriculum to industry bodies and companies and seek their feedback on who job-oriented it is. “The university should also address the qualitative gap that exists in the skilling sector. This was seen when all industries, businesses, shops, and markets were shut down during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, and people lost their jobs. With the easing of lockdown restrictions, I met people who did not have jobs, and those who had businesses but did not have people to work for them. It means that both were available, but they could not come together on a platform. We then started a job portal and created a common platform for both job-seekers and job-providers. As a result, there were lakhs of jobs available for job-seekers in Delhi. This is the same concept,” Kejriwal said. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said the university will focus both on quality and quantity — providing high-quality courses in the entire spectrum of skill training, from traditional skills to those of the future, and ensuring that the intake of students is large enough to cater to the existing demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-entrepreneurship-university-may-begin-first-academic-session-next-year/story-ftexHsp7GOPUPNZmC3xqPK.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Yeida close to finalising layout of its township for farmers in Jewar Bangar||GREATER NOIDA: As the farmers are set to get more land for residential purpose in new township to be developed in Jewar Bangar, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority is likely to finalise the layout for the same this week, officials said on Monday.Earlier the farmers were supposed to get 50% residential land of covered area in their respective village houses. But now, as per the revised scheme, each farmer who has given his land/house for the proposed international airport at Jewar will get 50% of the plot area.“Due to this change, we are revising the layout of the township planned on 48 hectares for those farmers whose land and houses are coming in way of the airport project. Once the layout is finalized, we will issue a tender to select an agency that will develop this township,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.The UP government has already sanctioned Rs 350 crore for the development of the township that will be one of its kinds for multiple reasons, said the officials, adding that the township will be having a temple and a mosque catering to both the community members.Apart from this, the proposed township will have all the basic facilities such as schools, primary health centre, parks, sewage system, among others, at par with an urban area, the officials said.“We have decided to develop the best township for the farmers at Jewar Bangar, which will have all modern facilities that an urban area can dream of. We will keep in mind while developing it that the farmers do not face any hassle living in it,” said the Yeida CEO.The authority increased the plot size after demands from the farmers. “Many farmers have small built-up area covered between walls whereas their plot sizes in villages are larger. If the government had calculated on the basis of covered area, many farmers would have suffered. But now with bigger size of plots, our children may manage living in it,” said Trilok Kumar from Banwaribas village whose land was acquired for the airport project.On Monday, the authority took a meeting with Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh and town planning officials on this issue and expedited the work so that it can make way for the airport project. On September 7, a concession agreement was signed with Switzerland company Zurich Airport International AG that is scheduled to start work at the airport project site by mid-2021. Therefore, Yeida wants to develop the township at Jewar Bangar village well on time so that the farmers shift into this new township and vacate their houses in villages, which will be demolished paving the way for the airport work to be started at the site.“It will be one of its kind townships for the farmers in the country,” said a Yeida official, not authorized to speak to media.The authority has also decided to compensate the farmers adequately so that they remain happy as they have given their land for the development of the airport project. “We have requested Yeida that they should do justice with farmers, whose houses, shops and other buildings have to be demolished to make way for the airport site. We want that farmers should not feel cheated once they leave their houses for the airport and shift into the new township,” said the Jewar MLA after the meeting.Out of 8,971 total farmer families, houses of 3,627 families will be destroyed completely, the officials said.The administration has acquired 1,334 hectares of land in six villages -- Rohi, Parohi, Ranhera, Kishorpur, Banwaribas and Dayanatpur. A total of 8,971 farmer families will be affected as they have given their agricultural land and houses paving the way for the development of the Noida International Greenfield Airport project at Jewar along the Yamuna Expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yeida-close-to-finalising-layout-of-its-township-for-farmers-in-jewar-bangar/story-lBKBysuG5yvAaIw9WEKTtO.html
12-10-2020||Chandigarh||Bullets replace all that’s beautiful in Chandigarh as gangs hold sway over city||The murder of Gurlal Brar, a former student leader and close associate of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi outside a mall in Industrial Area in the early hours of Sunday, again highlights how Chandigarh has, from Le Corbusier’s planned and organised city, become a haven for gangsters.The mushrooming of high rise buildings and housing societies in the periphery areas helps criminals find hideouts easily without tenant verification as strict police checks have stopped being the norm. Paying guest accommodation and even university and college hostel rooms are, therefore, safe areas for gangsters.“People renting out their houses skip the tenant verification process so it’s easy for gangsters to camp in the tricity without being noticed. Porous borders, too, make it easy for members of various gangs to flee without fear of being caught,” says a senior Chandigarh police official. “The anonymity factor is attracting criminals to the tricity and markets and pubs in the periphery operate without any checks. The apartment culture too facilitates movement of gangsters. No one notices as neighbourhood ties are not as strong as before,” says Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP). Stressing on the need to strengthen basic policing, Satinder Singh, Mohali SSP, adds: “Active night life attracts both youngsters and criminals alike. Co-ordination for quick sharing of information will help block escape routes.” Terming the tricity a “Centre point for gangsters wanting to maintain a low profile and hide,” a senior Punjab police official posted in Mohali, says, “Many gangsters now active in Punjab and Haryana have studied in Chandigarh and have taken to crime during their student days.”The macho image propagated on social media by some criminals, flaunting guns and pistols and showing off bulging muscles and sculpted bodies, has a fan following among youth.“These criminals lure youngsters who for a ‘kick’ get hooked to crime, little realising the repercussions. Many students help them by getting them accommodation, updating their social media accounts and arranging for logistical support,” shares a Chandigarh police officer. Gangsters of ChandigarhLawrence Bishnoi Born in 1992 in Ferozepur district, Bishnoi was a Punjab police constable’s son and once considered close to Neeraj Bawana, a gangster active in the Ferozepur area. Currently lodged in a jail in Rajasthan, Bishnoi is in touch with his gang members and is still active on social media. Named in a number of murder and attempt to murder cases, he is wanted by Haryana, Punjab Rajasthan and Chandigarh police. In 2015, while in Punjab police custody, he made an unsuccessful escape attempt in Banur, Punjab. Sampat Nehra Nehra, born in 1990 in Rajgarh in Rajasthan, is the son of a retired assistant sub-inspector of Chandigarh Police. A national level athlete, he studied at Chandigarh’s Sri Guru Gobind Singh College in Sector 26 and led Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang after his arrest. Nehra was booked in two cases in Chandigarh, including an extortion attempt against the owners of chemists Kumar Brothers. Wanted in a number of cases, including murder, by various police forces in the region, Nehra was arrested by Haryana Police’s special task force from Hyderabad in Telangana. Deepak Tinu A sharpshooter for the Nehra gang, Tinu is notorious for never missing a target. He is currently lodged in jail after his arrest by Bhiwani police. Tinu escaped police custody from the Sector 6 Civil Hospital in Panchkula in 2017. Among the murder cases he was involved in, one of his victims included the member of a rival gang, Lavi Deora, in Kotkapura. Bharat Bhushan alias Bhola shooter Involved in many criminal cases in Chandigarh, Haryana and Punjab, Bhola used to provide money, logistic support and manage communications between Bishnoi’s gang members. Bhola came into the limelight for his involvement in a robbery at the Sher-e-Punjab Gun House at Kotkapura in Punjab. Ankit Bhandu A Bishnoi gang sharpshooter, Bhandu was shot dead in an encounter in Zirakpur in February 2019. From Sherewala village in Abohar district of Punjab, Bhandu was president of Students’ Organisation of Panjab University, Rajasthan, even though he was a school dropout. He had taken over the operations of the gang after Bishnoi’s arrest and was arrested by Fazilka police in July 2015 and jumped bail from Kapurthala jail in October 2017. Arrested again, he escaped during an encounter by a joint team police from Sriganganagar in Rajasthan and Haryana in August 2018. Davinder Bambiha Gangster Davinder Bambiha, 25, was shot dead in a police encounter at Gill Kalan near Rampura in September 2016. He has been “virtually” kept alive by his gang members who post his pictures regularly on social media. From Bambiha Bhai village in Moga district and wanted for six murders, Bambiha studied up to Class 12 and his gang gained notoriety in 2013 after a shootout at Paonta Sahib. A man named Lucky now manages the gang’s operations from abroad. Dilpreet Singh Dhahan He gained notoriety after taking responsibility for shooting and injuring Punjabi singer Parmish Verma at Mohali in April 2018 as part of an extortion racket targeting such celebrities. Soon after the attack on Verma, singer Gippy Grewal too lodged an extortion complaint with the police. On April 9, 2017, Dhahan was caught on camera shooting at a Hoshiarpur sarpanch outside a gurdwara in Sector 38 (West), Chandigarh. He was arrested after he sustained injuries during an encounter in the city.Kali RajputRavinder alias Kali Rajput’s name cropped up in an extortion case following the kidnapping of a Burail hotelier in December 2017. A resident of Balongi in Mohali and a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Kali, police sources say, helped Bishnoi escape police custody in January 2015 from Banur. There are about five cases of extortion, murder and attempt to murder registered against Kali in the tricity. Bhupesh Rana In April 2018, Bhupesh Rana, a Monu Rana gang member active in Haryana, was murdered in broad daylight a few metres from the police station at the busy Barwala market in Panchkula by a rival gang. Rana was allegedly involved in the murder of a member of the Bhupi Rana gang in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bullets-replace-all-that-s-beautiful-in-chandigarh-as-gangs-hold-sway-over-city/story-Br68dVCB2Km7Od130kG7oN.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Noida: An online interactive community that is helping netizens relieve their stress during Covid times||NOIDA: Till July 5 this year, Noida-based Divya Shah, 32, followed the ‘mind your business’ mantra in her life. But when stories of depression and suicides started pouring in amid Covid-19 outbreak and helplessness started increasing, someone suggested this former TV journalist to kick off a community interactive online platform. And from there, began the unique journey of her online interaction on the zoom platform, and by Tuesday – the 100th day of its inception – it had over 300 visitors. Divya has christened this platform as Radio Diva. Divya said after kicking off the interactive programme, there was literally no looking back. “Gradually for me, and many others, it became a habit of sorts. These 100 days of being our own true self and falling in love over and over again, is really a unique experience,” she says. Radio Diva, Divya says, is an online platform where she connects everyday – mostly on audio – through a link shared on WhatsApp to its members. “On this platform, we talk about everything under the sun except the C, i.e. Corona – which is ‘THE’ virus for all of us,” she said. According to her, topics in this community radio range from anger, to the right usage of words, body shaming to virtual trips to mountains and beaches. “Everyone gets an opportunity to express their opinions and vent out their emotions, and many times just agree to disagree. The highlights of this programme is that we have dedicated days for real heroes, counsellors, singing, mushaira and story telling,” says this former TV journalist. Delhi-based psychologist Gareemaa Sehgal, who is also an active member of this community interaction, said what you wish to ignite in others must first burn inside of you. “This programme is one such platform that has pulled out people from the uncertain dark Covid-19 nights and installed hope and possibilities, love and compassion, friendships in everyone who has come across it,” she said. Echoing similar views, Guwahati-based mental counsellor Dr Varghese Mandapathil, said it was during the lockdown that Divya started this community platform, changing setbacks into a comeback. “The love spread through this programme has struck deep roots into the hearts of people who are part of this community interaction. It helped people to realise the power of their dream and come out of their comfort zones to live a happier life,” he said. Visitors to this platform, which caters to cross-sections of society, say that during the pandemic, especially during the complete lockdown, it helped them to remove negative thoughts in their minds. “A few friends and acquaintances joined and friends of friends pitched in and the community kept growing. People talk of isolation and loneliness as the side effects of lockdown. I can vouch with confidence that all the ones who attended the show on a regular basis surely feel fortunate to be part of this happy community that each one has together created and contributed to,” Divya says. About the future of Radio Diva, she said that like RWAs, every society must have a radio platform like this also. “Why can’t two strangers be friends without judgements? I want every society to make a platform to meet and greet and learn from each other’s wisdom even if it’s just for half an hour. Let the happy community grow, let good things also go viral,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-an-online-interactive-community-that-is-helping-netizens-relieve-their-stress-during-covid-times/story-tP9K9t80IEFlegQIL6Oh2J.html
12-10-2020||City||DDA to review ‘pay for preferred flat’ scheme||New Delhi: New Delhi: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is going to review its recently announced plan to allow applicants to select the location of their flat on payment of Preferential Location Charges (PLC). The matter was discussed in the recent on October 9 authority meeting in which BJP and AAP MLAs, who are members of the DDA, raised concerns about the scheme, said a senior DDA official.The DDA is headed by the Lieutenant Governor.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “The matter was raised in the meeting. We will hold a meeting with the two representatives and review it.”The land-owning agency, for the first time, had come out with the scheme to ensure better response to its housing schemes. As per the plan, an applicant can give his/her preference of the location (floor level, corner house, facing the green area, etc) by paying an additional charge of between 1.5-3% of the total cost of the house, if he/she is successful in the draw of lots conducted by the DDA for the housing scheme.The DDA had approved a PLC of 3% of the total cost of the flat for ground floor, 2.5% for flats facing green areas, 2.5% for flats on the first floor, 2% for corner flats and 1.5% for second floor flats. An applicant can opt for multiple preferences and will have to pay accordingly, said a DDA official aware of the development. For instance, for a first floor flat facing green area, an allottee will have to pay 5% of the total cost of the house as PLC.BJP MLA and DDA member Vijender Gupta, who raised the matter in the recent authority meeting, said, “The maximum a person has to pay is 3% to book a location of his/her preference. This way a lot of people would apply and draw of lots have to be held. Moreover, those who can’t afford to pay PLC will be deprived of an opportunity to own a flat on the ground or first floor, or a corner flat. There is a need to review the scheme. I had asked for a committee to be formed to review it.”AAP MLA and DDA member Somnath Bharti said the DDA’s mandate is to provide “affordable housing”. “DDA is supposed to provide affordable flats. Unlike private builders, it is not in for making profits. Moreover, on one hand we are trying to lower the rates of flats to dispose them of, and on the other hand we are trying to increase the prices by allowing PLC. We have to evaluate the scheme,” said Bharti.The decision to allow PLC was taken in the authority meeting chaired by Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal last month.Currently, the DDA has close to 10,000-15,000 vacant flats and close to 40,000 flats in various stages of construction. The agency has flats either ready or nearing completion in Dwarka, Jasola Vihar and Narela. In the next housing scheme, DDA plans to offer 400 MIG in Jasola Vihar and 200 HIG flats Dwarka.While DDA officials say that this is to help applicants, Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner with DDA, said, “DDA’s mandate is not to make profit but to provide affordable housing to people. By allowing people to select the location by paying PLC, they are denying opportunities to those who don’t have money to pay such charges. Under the previous allotment, all applicants had equal opportunity to get a first or a ground floor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dda-to-review-pay-for-preferred-flat-scheme/story-TtcVt0fuNDIwO0K7Jw86iM.html
12-10-2020||City||Construction worker sleeping on roadside crushed to death by crane||New Delhi: A 31-year-old worker employed by a private firm constructing a drain along GT Karnal Road in outer Delhi’s Alipur was crushed to death, allegedly by a crane hired by the same contractor, while he was sleeping on the roadside early Sunday, police said.The crane driver allegedly abandoned the vehicle about a kilometre from the spot and fled. “We have identified the crane driver and are trying to find him,” Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), said.The victim, Manoj Saini, is a native of Akbarpur in Uttar Pradesh and was among a group of workers camping at the site since over a month to build the drain. “The work had been outsourced to a private firm,” the DCP said.According to one of his colleagues, on Saturday night, Saini had gone off to sleep on the roadside while the others found it a little bit cold and preferred the tents.Around 3.30 am, one of the workers woke up and checked on Saini. “He wasn’t responding when I called out to him. He was covered in a blanket and I thought that he must be sleeping. But when I checked again sometime later, I found him to be crushed and dead,” said the worker who didn’t give out his name.The worker alleged that the way the blanket was placed on top of Saini’s body, it indicated the crane driver had placed it to avoid an immediate detection of the death.But the DCP said the workers themselves covered the body with a blanket until the police arrived.The workers informed their contractor about the death after which the police were alerted around 7.45 am.While the cause of the death wasn’t immediately clear at that time, the police found tracks of a large vehicle leading away from the body.They followed the tracks to find an abandoned crane about a kilometre away. “There were blood stains on the tyres of the crane, confirming the vehicle had crushed him,” said another investigator who didn’t want to be identified.The police registered a case of causing death due to negligence and seized the crane. “The crane was being used to drop pipes for drainage construction at the site and belongs to the same firm that employed Saini. It appears that after dropping the pipes, the crane crushed the Saini,” the DCP said.While the driver is yet to be nabbed, investigators suspect the presence of dust along the roadside due to the construction work affected visibility, leading to the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/construction-worker-sleeping-on-roadside-crushed-to-death-by-crane/story-HvFdrHr1KiRlMR1PTLYugM.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Discom fines billing agency ₹10 lakh over wrong meter readings, faulty power bills since March||NOIDA: Taking serious note of the instructions given by Uttar Pradesh energy minister Shrikant Sharma, power distribution company Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) said that it has imposed a fine of ₹10 lakh on a billing agency since March.Officials of the PVVNL, which caters to Noida and some parts of Greater Noida, said that the fine has been imposed for incorrect meter readings and untimely disposal of electricity bills by meter reading company Inventive Software Solutions Private Limited.The imposition of the fine on a billing agency by discoms, however, is not a new phenomenon in the state.“According to the agreement, in case of any fault in metre reading or billing, the billing company is bound to pay the penalty. The fines are imposed if the company prepares the electricity bills without taking proper meter reading, or issues bills against surrendered connections. Discoms can also fine agencies for issuing bills based on false meter reading of closed meters,” PVVNL chief engineer (Noida) Virendra Nath Singh said.Singh further said that nearly 5,000 consumers in Noida have complained about wrong bills or indiscriminate meter reading since the outbreak of Covid-19. “The billing company has been asked to correct the bills and meter reading without any delay. The officials concerned have also been warned to deliver the monthly electricity bills to consumers on time,” he said.The chief engineer further said that at present, meters of over 12,000 consumers in Noida are not working properly. “As a result, consumers are facing difficulties in depositing their electricity bills on time. Necessary guidelines have been issued to replace these faulty meters and they will be replaced within a month,” he said. When contacted, Lokesh Kumar, the in-charge of the Noida office (Sector 67) of Inventive Software Solutions Private Limited, said that as per the agreement with the discom, the company has no option other than to face the penalty. “Whatever fine is imposed on us, we will immediately clear it,” he said.The state energy minister, on a number of occasions, had expressed anguish over the dilly-dallying approach of the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) in executing agreements finalised with billing agencies. Last week, he had pointed out delays in arrangement of downloadable bills in urban and rural areas. “If electricity bills are not provided to consumers for more than three months then the recovery of unpaid meter readings will be done from billing agencies,” he said, while expressing concern over the billing agencies not being able to collect mobile numbers, meter numbers and GPS location of meters within the stipulated time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-discom-fines-billing-agency-10-lakh-over-wrong-meter-readings-faulty-power-bills-since-march/story-tJ49hc7ayJS6GMEbcB5KiJ.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: High-rise societies far from ready for DG set ban under Grap||Ghaziabad: Ahead of October 15 when the ban on diesel generator (DG)-sets comes into effect in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Ghaziabad district magistrate, during a review meeting of pollution abatement measures, asked resident welfare associations (RWA) to install smaller sets for emergency services such as lifts, among others. The Environment (Pollution and control) Authority (Epca), in its communication to the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary on October 8, had directed for a ban on DG-sets.Ghaziabad district has about 300 high-rise societies, a majority of which have multiple residential towers which are dependent primarily on DG-sets for power backup. The Epca on October 8 had exempted essential/emergency services from the ban. “We have suggested to RWAs to install smaller capacity generator sets wherever possible for operation of lifts and other emergency services. Otherwise, the directions of Epca will be complied with and there will be strict implementation of measures under the graded response action plan (Grap),” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said. “We will ask the electricity department to ensure that there are no power cuts. We have also asked RWAs to provide heaters in the guard room so that instances of wood-fuelled fires are fewer,” he added.According to officials of the electricity department, Ghaziabad has a base of about eight lakh domestic electricity consumers, 90,000 commercial establishments, and another 13,000 industrial connections which primarily depend on DG-sets. Residents of high-rises, meanwhile, said that electricity connections run on DG-sets are common for lifts, lighting in common areas and apartments as well.“So far we have not received any notice about a ban on DG-sets from October 15 otherwise we would have given our representation. Use of smaller diesel generators will not be possible as many societies have multiple towers, where a huge investment and separate electricity cabling will be required for the smaller sets. Further, in many societies, the wiring for these is underground and in-built and cannot be separated so easily for lifts, etc,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners. The residents said that there is an average of about two hours of power cut in trans-Hindon areas and that use of DG-sets must be allowed. A common connection from DG-sets to apartments and essential services is common in high-rise societies in areas like Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara, where implementation of the ban will become tricky for the administration. On the other hand, in areas such as Kaushambi, RWAs said that they have separate connections for running essential services and power supply to apartments. “We have 22 high-rise societies in Kaushambi where connections from DG-sets for essential services like lifts, water pumps, etc are separate from those for flats. After Grap comes into effect, we will run only essential power supply from DG-sets while households will run on their individual power backups,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments RWA. The electricity department officials, on the other hand, said they are supplying an average of about 23.45 hours of electricity supply daily. “On our part, we have a lesser number of faults and none of our transmissions or distribution substations is overloaded. In the coming winter season, the demand will further go down and there will be no issues of outages, etc. Further, there is no building in the city which is without an electricity connection,” said RK Rana, chief engineer of Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited. The DM has directed officials to keep a tab on restaurants, hotels, dhabas, eateries, etc., to ensure that they stop the use of tandoors which use wood or coal as fuel. “Officials will ensure that such establishments use PNG or LPG instead of coal or wood. Different directions have also been given for mechanical road sweeping, water sprinkling, etc. The chief secretary, in a video conference on Monday, asked us to keep strict tabs on stubble burning,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-high-rise-societies-far-from-ready-for-dg-set-ban-under-grap/story-VDJ4VBN8yTR2UVuWaclv6H.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad air plunges to ‘very poor’ after seven months||Ghaziabad: For the first time since February, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Ghaziabad deteriorated to the ‘very poor’ category, on Monday. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the primary reason for the rise in pollution levels is the increasing instances of stubble burning in states such as Punjab and Haryana. Going by the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) figures on Monday, AQI levels in Ghaziabad stood at 302, just under the ‘very poor’ category. According to the records of CPCB, Ghaziabad AQI was observed in the ‘very poor’ category last on February 26. That same month, the city saw 11 days of ‘very poor’ category AQI. On Monday, the city was among the only four – Baghpat, Kurukshetra and Panipat – across the country to have ‘very poor’ air quality. “The AQI levels are being affected primarily by the trend of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. They are also aided by the north-westerly winds which are bringing in pollutants. Further, wind speed has plunged to five-six kilometre per hour (kmph), which has further led to slower dispersal of pollutants. Apart from these, local pollutants have also aided to the deterioration of air quality,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, New Delhi. Official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agro-Ecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (Creams) Laboratory – a Division of Agricultural Physics, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, in New Delhi, show that from October 1 to 11 Punjab recorded at least 1,804 instances of stubble burning, as compared to 508 during the same period last year. In Haryana, such instances during the same period this year have been 488, while 546 were recorded during the same period last year. “We are expecting a change in wind direction – from north-westerly to easterly – with high wind speed in the next two-three days. This will lead to a spike in pollution levels but thereafter, it will become better,” Srivastava added. Meanwhile, the two neighbouring cities of Noida and Greater Noida stood under the ‘poor’ category, with AQI levels at 274 and 292, respectively, on Monday. According to the official records of the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB), Ghaziabad recorded 67 days in 2019 under the ‘very poor’ AQI category, while it reeled under the ‘severe’ category on a total of 31 days. AQI under the ‘poor’ category was recorded on a total of 112 days last year.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. Experts, however, stressed on the need for a uniform pollution abatement policy for the entire National Capital Region (NCR), not just for Delhi. “For instance, if we implement the odd-even system only in Delhi, it will not have much impact on air pollution prevalent in other areas of NCR. So, there is much need for uniform pollution abatement policy for the entire NCR, which should cover at least 100km of area. If the various districts implement different policies at their local level, it will not have much impact on the reduction of pollution,” said Ashish Jain, founder and director of Delhi-based Indian Pollution Control Association.“In cities such as Ghaziabad, and further in western UP, we have issues related to operation of diesel vehicles and brick kilns, which aide pollution,” he added.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the conditions are better this year, as compared to the previous year. “The rise in AQI levels is due to localised conditions prevailing at Loni and Sanjay Nagar. There are some construction activities going on in Loni which we will tackle, while a team was sent to Sanjay Nagar where there is a bus stand and loose soil close to an air quality monitoring station. Last year, we had requested the CPCB to allow us to shift the Sanjay Nagar station elsewhere but they had denied. So, our teams are taking up resolution of issues and will get these resolved in a couple of days,” the DM said.Two of the monitoring stations, out of a total of four, which largely affected the AQI level of Ghaziabad, are the ones at Loni and Sanjay Nagar. These two stations recorded high levels of AQI under ‘very poor’ category, with 326 for Loni and 337 for Sanjay Nagar according to the figures of CPCB on Monday.Meanwhile, the AQI for the other two stations in Ghaziabad, located at Indirapuram and Vasundhara, was 286, and 265, respectively, on Monday, according to the CPCB’s daily 4pm bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-air-plunges-to-very-poor-after-seven-months/story-fxKG1Ttf8C0hB9OmEkIboO.html

12-10-2020||City||Railway ticket-booking gang busted; five held with 42 mobiles, 13 ATM cards stolen from migrants||New Delhi: Police on Monday said they had busted a gang of cheats and thieves who impersonated passengers, railway employees or ticket agents and duped migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh by promising them confirmed train or bus tickets to their hometowns during the festive season. Five members of the gang, including two brothers, were arrested with 42 mobiles, 20 travel bags, 13 ATM cards and several other items – all stolen from migrants in the recent past, the police said. “A total of 27 cases of cheating and theft, all registered at four different police stations in northwest Delhi in the recent past, have been solved with the arrest of the five men, who are part of an organised syndicate named “ticket booking gang”,” said deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Vijayanta Arya. The arrests were made by the district’s special staff team following investigations into the cases registered in Mahendra Park, Adarsh Nagar, Subhash Place and Keshavpuram police stations. The arrested men were identified as Sanjay Yadav, Lal Babu Sahni, Santosh Kumar, Rakesh Mandal and his brother Rajeev Mandal. All five arrested men are themselves migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and had come to Delhi some years ago in search of jobs. Since they were not satisfied with the wages they earned by working in factories or private companies, they collaborated to dupe other migrants returning to their home towns during various festivals, a police officer associated with the probe said, requesting anonymity. Explaining the gang’s modus operandi, the officer said that each member of the syndicate has a different role to play during any crime. One or two would position themselves at Singhu border in outer Delhi and would target migrants working in factories in Sonepat, Karnal, Rohtak and other places in Haryana but coming to Delhi to board trains or buses to their hometowns. The suspects would board buses, sharing auto-rickshaws or e-rickshaws that the victims would take to reach any interstate railway station or bus terminal in Delhi. During the journey the suspects would pose as co-passengers and claiming that their destinations were the same, the officer said. “On the way, the suspects would trick the victims into believing that they would help them get confirmed train or bus tickets through ticket booking agents or using their contacts in the railway department. They would convince them to de-board the bus or auto in the mid-way,” the officer said, adding the suspects would introduce the victims to their associates who impersonate travelling ticket examiner (TTE) or ticket booking agents. The second set of racketeers who impersonate TTE or ticket agents would trick the victims into giving them their ATM cards and secret codes on the pretext of booking their tickets. “Since the impersonators would deliberately delay their return, the first group of racketeers would steal the valuables of the victims and leave on the pretext of going and checking on the TTE or agent. The suspects would then withdraw money using the stolen ATM cards and passwords,” the officer added. On October 6, the suspects using the same modus operandi had duped a father-son duo belonging to Uttar Pradesh of over R68,000 that they withdrew after tricking them into giving them their ATM card and its password for obtaining confirmed train tickets, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/railway-ticket-booking-gang-busted-five-held-with-42-mobiles-13-atm-cards-stolen-from-migrants/story-BSGyomQa5cJA3gMpg67MrI.html
12-10-2020||Chandigarh||HC puts Punjab govt on notice for illegal felling of Khair trees||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday put the Punjab government on notice on a public interest litigation (PIL) for the alleged illegal felling of Khair trees in the Siswan forest area.The petition filed by Mohali resident Akbar Khan alleges that only 333 killa (acres) out of 3,300 acres in Siswan village are privately owned and the rest is under forest area. However, some private contractors with power of attorney from these land owners are cutting and uprooting trees on private land as well as the forest area in connivance with the forest officials.According to the petition: “This is a clear proof that the forest mafia is using all illegal methods in the garb of permits and cutting trees (falling) under the area of Panchayat land and forest land, which is a clear violation of the Indian Forest Act and Punjab Preservation of Land Act.” If this trend is not checked the day is not far when the forest mafia will cut the all forest area trees which will have serious consequences for the ecosystem, reads the plea.Landowners involved in the racket should be questioned and made responsible for illegal felling of the trees, the petitioner demands, adding that government and local officials should be directed to initiate investigations into the matter.Khair or Acacia catechu has commercial value because it is used for making rollers for crushing oilseeds and sugarcane, knife handles and for charcoal. A white substance called katha derived from it is used as a medicinal remedy for body aches and other ailments. The bark has use for relief in asthma, indigestion and eczema. Katha is also used for paan or betel leaf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-puts-punjab-govt-on-notice-for-illegal-felling-of-khair-trees/story-pZhT2h9g6xcxdGfE2tiPEJ.html
12-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh private schools not in favour of reopening from October 15||The ministry of home affairs (MHA), in the Unlock 5.0 guidelines issued at the beginning of the month, had permitted the schools to reopen from October 15 but most private schools of the city are not in favour of it.The UT education department had sent forms to each recognised private school in the city to get response regarding the same. The response has come back negative as per the department.Confirming this, UT district education officer (DEO) Ravinder Kaur said, “Private schools are not willing to partially reopen for academic consultation October 15 onwards. The parents are not on board with this, and the schools, which had reopened for board classes from September 21 onwards, have witnessed low attendance.”PARENTS UNWILLING TO SEND KIDS TO SCHOOLHS Mamik, president of the independent school association and chairman of Vivek High School in Sector 38, said, “Out of the 75 schools in our association, most have reported that only 10-17% of the parents will give consent to send their kids to school as per surveys conducted by them. We have relayed this information back to the department and, what the parents want should be taken into consideration.”Kavita Das, principal of St Johns High School in Sector 26, said, “Less than 10% of parents are interested in sending their kids to school and we have to take our staff’s health also into consideration so we have replied that it is not feasible to reopen the school from October 15.” Das added that the school is only conducting practicals for students of board classes in a staggered manner. The practicals started in October after the half-yearly examination.Atul Khanna, director of Strawberry Fields High School in Sector 26, added that ever since the school had opened for board classes, not even a single student had turned up.“If students of board classes aren’t showing up for academic consultations, then we can’t expect younger students to show up.”SOME SCHOOLS YET TO SUBMIT RESPONSESDEO Ravinder Kaur added that some schools haven’t submitted their responses yet so, calculating the percentage of parents in favour of reopening is not possible yet. Even teachers in their feedback have asked for the date of reopening of schools to be delayed. Meanwhile, around 2,000 students have been going to the government schools daily since September 21. Director of school education (DSE) Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “Government school children are still willing to go to school and we have seen higher numbers especially in the schools in the periphery of the city.” Brar added that the final call regarding the reopening of schools will be taken by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-private-schools-not-in-favour-of-reopening-from-october-15/story-LAGylwvuX5166Ufa9Q0HvO.html

BSP’s district secretary, Naresh Basra, said, “Residents are bearing the brunt of the lackadaisical approach being adopted by civic body officials. Sewer water has now accumulated in the residential area and residents have also been complaining against contaminated water supply. The entire road is in bad shape and accidents take place daily due to deep potholes. The authorities are working to install new lines in the area, but should atleast fill the potholes at points where lines have already been installed.”On October 2, residents of Jain Colony in Rahon Road had also staged a protest over the same issues.Gurcharan Singh, a resident of Jain Colony, said they are continuously living under the threat of an epidemic as sewer water is accumulated on the streets and vacant plots in the area. “Foul smell spreads throughout the entire area and sewer lines have been choked, but the authorities are not paying heed to the problem,” he said. MC superintending engineer, Rajinder Singh, said that a new sewer line is being installed to resolve the problem. “The work to install the sewer line is almost complete and residents will see a visible change in terms of sewer water accumulation in around 10 to 12 days.

Shikara died on the spot. Later, the accused fired at least five more rounds in the air and threatened the factory personnel not to come in his way. He had been hiding in the factory for the past 39 hours,” said Lalit Shakyawar, superintendent of police, Katni. During interrogation, the jawan told the police and Army officials that he was hiding in a ladies toilet on the factory premises. During this period, he claimed to have guava from a tree and water from the tank over the toilet, the police said. Also read: India generated over 18,000 tonnes Covid-19 waste since JuneIn a statement registered with police, Shakar Singh said he killed the JCO as the latter used to publicly humiliate him and he was also depressed due to frequent change in his duty timings, according to the police. “Shakar Singh told police and Army officials that on Saturday evening too, the officer scolded him in front of all other jawans. He couldn’t control his anger and committed the crime. Next morning, he realized that he had committed a blunder and that he should also end his life,” said a police officer.

He spent the night on the roof of the toilet. The police officers and DSC officers kept on pursuing him the entire night by using a public announcement system. In the morning, he surrendered.” “It was one of the toughest situations as we couldn’t have used physical power to arrest him because he could have attacked us or killed himself. We dealt with him psychologically and we are happy that we succeeded in our efforts,” said Shakyawar. He said Singh was being interrogated by the Army and the police.Factory workers’ manager and administrator, Ajay Kumar, said, “The work operations in the factory have been resumed after two days.

Aggarwal alleged that the municipal corporation (MC) does not even have a road roller for taking up road repair work and there is no mason to take up other repair works in the ward. Leader of BJP councillors, Sunita Rani’s son Deepak Sharma and BJP councillor Surinder Atwal also participated in the protest. Former BJP councillor Inder Aggarwal said, “The largest MC in the state with a budget of around ₹1,200 crore, does not even have ₹5 lakh to purchase new road rollers. The MC rents a road roller for ₹4,000 per day, which is also wastage of public money.”The protest was lifted after getting assurance from the mayor. Sandhu said, “I have directed the superintending engineer (SE) to immediately commence the road repair works and if no road roller is available then the MC should get it on rent. Also, the other material including cement and sand would be made available in a few days. No pick and choose policy is adopted by the civic body.” Former Congress councillor Parminder Mehta staged a protest on Monday against the alleged corruption prevalent in the civic body near the MC’s Zone A office. He said that no action is being taken against contractors even after road samples have failed quality tests. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Action has been taken against officials and contractors in the past. No payment has been made to contractors after road samples failed the quality test.”Yuva, an NGO, also staged a protest on Monday against the alleged corrupt practices of the MC’s building branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-councillor-protests-against-ludhiana-mc-s-failure-to-repair-roads/story-H8lClAzlSr6NEpLY7aN2gL.html

The party leadership is doing the right thing in dispelling the confusion. The onus is also on the LJP to clarify on its issue,” said former Union minister and BJP MLC Sanjay Paswan.“NDA has only four parties. No other party is with us. We do not have any alliance with the LJP and Nitish Kumar is the leader of the alliance,” deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said. “Today, Nitish Kumar has become synonymous with development,” he added.Also read: Andhra HC orders CBI to act against YSR leaders, others who attacked judgesA similar statement was made by party state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal at a rally in Bodh Gaya on Sunday.A senior BJP functionary, on condition of anonymity, said, “This is being done to thwart any possibility of damage before it is too late as various conspiracy theories are doing the rounds on social media.”On Monday, at Banka and Jamui, BJP leader in-charge of Bihar elections, Bhupendra Yadav, clarified the party’s stand. “The BJP has only one plan in the election and that is to fight it along with the JD(U). We have spelt out that plan. But in case there is some confusion, I am spelling it out again. The BJP will contest 121 of the 243 seats, the JD(U) will fight on 122. The LJP is not a part of this arrangement because the party chose to fight alone. The NDA is fighting for the development in Bihar under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and vision with Nitish Kumar as the undisputed chief ministerial candidate of the alliance,” said Yadav.The JD(U), however, does not see any threat from the LJP. “The BJP has done the right thing by clarifying its stand at every possible level. There is little confusion among our cadres,” said party spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan.DM Diwakar, former director at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, however, is of the view that it may backfire on the BJP. “They (BJP) first backed them (LJP). They maintained silence when the LJP announced to field candidates against the JD(U). But now suddenly, they have realized that this was causing more damage than benefitting them. So they have to issue clarifications at every stage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-polls-bjp-faces-hard-time-clearing-air-about-ljp-s-status-in-nda/story-BspnxII5lDkkJOmZoD7rVO.html

The increase in farm fires has been deteriorating the air quality in several cities of the state. The air quality index (AQI) in Panipat at 329 and Kurukshetra at 315 was categorised as “very poor” on Monday. The AQI in both these districts was worse than Delhi at 261.The air quality in Jind (294), Karnal (279), Gurugram (259), Charkhi Dadri (253), Ambala (226), Faridabad (224), Yamunanagar (217) and Manesar (213) was categorised as “poor”. Health department officials say the rise in farm fires is likely to have a very bad impact on air quality in the coming days.As per the HARSAC, with 25 new farm fire incidents, the number of AFLs in Kurukshetra has reached to 226, followed by 216 in Karnal, 150 in Ambala, 139 in Kaithal and 94 in Fatehabad, 83 in Yamunanagar, 75 in Jind, 36 in Hisar, 21 in Sonipat, 15 in Palwal, 14 each in Sirsa and Panipat and 10 in Panchkula. No new cases of farm fires have been reported in Mahendergarh, Nuh, Charkhi Dadri and Faridabad districts.The government has issued strict instructions to the district administrations and village panchayats to take immediate action against the erring farmers. Few incidents of stubble burning now due to farmers’ rising awareness: CMChief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday said there were very few incidents of stubble burning in the state now due to the increased awareness among farmers on the issue. “Very few incidents of paddy stubble burning have been reported during the present season as also borne out by the satellite imagery,” he said.“There have been very few incidents of stubble burning as Haryana farmers have become aware (about the harmful effects of this practice). Farmers collect stubble and tie them in bales and later give it to those who put it to different usages,” Khattar told reporters here.“Farmers can collect stubble and tie them in bales, for which we have kept a rate of Rs 50 per quintal and we send them where they can be put to use. “We are transporting stubbles to industries like those involved in power production or cardboard manufacturing,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-sees-further-rise-in-farm-fires-aqi-plunges/story-dQ9cG3nhUsZg8qA4Tcp7PP.html

A security guard, who was injured, has been admitted at a hospital in Hisar,” he added.He said eight of the juveniles were facing charges of murder, three attempt to murder, two were booked under the POCSO Act and four were facing other charges.“Eight of them hailed from Jhajjar district, two each from Rohtak, Hisar and Delhi and one each from Bhiwani, Dadri and Karnal. Eight of them are troublesome,” the official added.Hisar superintendent of police Balwan Singh Rana said, “We have sealed all roads and directed police officials to arrest them. We are taking details from the superintendent of the observation home.”Police officials said there has been negligence by the observation home as proper security measures were not followed. In January 2017, six juveniles had escaped from the same observation home while an employee was opening barracks to provide water campers to inmates after dinner.A senior functionary in Hisar administration, who is also associated with the observation home, said a team of the Juvenile Justice Board was scheduled to hold inspection on Tuesday. The inspection was deferred due to Covid-19 and some of the inmates had contracted the infection.In March, there were 126 inmates in this observation home and some of them were given bail after they had tested positive, a source said. “The facilities are good at the observation home, which often remains crowded. A member of the district juvenile justice board will inspect the observation home on Tuesday,” a source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/17-juvenile-undertrials-flee-observation-home-in-hisar/story-jFCSGtdAzOWwBiuO8OL9OJ.html

On the first day, among many other issues, students reported delays at the offline examination at centres, irrelevant questions, and various other problems. According to students, the SPPU administration failed in operating and managing the exams well. A total of 2.5 lakh final year students are appearing for the exams conducted by SPPU, among which 2 lakh students have chosen the online option while 50,000 students appeared offline at 113 examination centres. On Monday, 29,236 students were expected to appear for the online exams and 4,881 students for offline exams among which 17,118 students successfully completed the online examination and 1,811 students appeared for the offline exams at various centres. Meanwhile, several offline subject papers were delayed at the centres in Pune city. The first paper which was scheduled at 10am actually began at 12.30pm. While another scheduled paper at 1pm began at 2.30pm at various examination centres in the city. “Today’s paper was quite tough, initially there was a problem in reading the questions as they were not clear. Only four options of the questions were seen on the screen, but the question was not there. Then the issue got resolved and I solved the questions, some of them were easy but some were tough,” said Sandeep Mandave, a final year bachelor of arts student who gave the exam online. For the offline exams, 113 centres have been identified where physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik, and Ahmednagar districts. The mock test and question paper sets for practice were released on October 8. The exams are of 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for a duration of one hour. Ketaki Rathi, who appeared for the exam offline at the SP college said, “Our paper was scheduled at 10am in the morning and so I reached the college at 9am, whereas we had to wait till 12 noon when the actual process of the test started. There was complete mismanagement seen and it was already risky for students to come and give the exams in such a crisis situation. The SPPU should resolve all the technical and other issues for further exams.” SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “There was no issue in the online exams and in the first half more than 5,000 students successfully appeared for the exam. But for the offline exams at some of the centres there were some technical issues due to which it got delayed.

The incident happened when Sharma was on way to Pathankot from Jalandhar. Sharma said he was travelling through Jalandhar-Hoshiarpur highway when two cars started following them. There were around 25 people carrying kisan union flags and they attacked Sharma’s car and broke the front and back windshields. The security personnel ensured that there was no physical harm to Sharma. “They were not farmers but miscreants in the garb of farmer unions,” Sharma said. Sharma said they went to the office of deputy superintendent of police, Dasuya, to lodge a complaint. “It was a state-sponsored attack as I never faced any situation during my visits even as farmer union protests were on. Protests are going on outside BJP leaders’ houses under police protection. It is the duty of state government to ensure law and order and safety of people. There is an attempt to disturb the peace in the state,” Sharma said. Following the attack, BJP supporters blocked the national highway in Dasuya, demanding action against the culprits. Earlier in the day, farmer unions also staged the protest in Jalandhar where Ashwani Sharma chaired a state-level meeting of the party. Hoshiarpur SSP Navjot Singh Mahal visited Dasuya to pacify the protesting BJP workers and leaders. “We will take legal action against those behind the attack,” the SSP said. Till the filing of the report, no FIR had been registered. Former minister and senior BJP leader Manoranjan Kalia said the attack was the handiwork of Congress workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-damage-ashwani-sharma-s-car-bjp-chief-calls-it-state-sponsored-attack/story-bg4R30eiSKZk8vWYnsq3OO.html

The MC’s move agitated shopkeepers who later met Mayor Balkar Sandhu at MC’s Zone D office demanding that the sealing drive should be stopped. Shopkeepers said that the MC is levying CLU charges even on those shops which were established even before the CLU norms came into existence in 1995. They said that different rates are being charged against the shops situated on the same road. President of Ghumar Mandi shopkeepers’ association, Pawan Batra said, “We have asked the MC officials to stop taking alleged illegal action against shops otherwise traders would be forced to raise an agitation. Legally, the MC cannot recover CLU charges from shops that were established before 1995. We will not allow them to seal more shops in the market and if required, we will also move court.”Earlier the members of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal had also announced that they would move court against the civic body. MC joint commissioner, Kulpreet Singh said, “No illegal action is being taken against shopkeepers and shops are also being sealed in other markets of the city due to non-payment of pending charges. Shopkeepers have the right to raise their issues, but we are not taking any illegal action against them and they will have to pay the pending charges.”Earlier, chairman of Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC) and Congress councillor, Gurpreet Gogi had also raised objection against the action being taken by the MC. Last week, shopkeepers had also staged a protest against the civic body after they had sealed two shops in the market. The MC has served around 2,300 notices for recovering the pending CLU charges from shopkeepers. . MC seals six shopsTaking action against shopkeepers who failed to deposit CLU charges, MC sealed six shops situated in different areas on Monday. As per the information, one shop was sealed in the Ghumar Mandi area, three at Pakhowal road, and two at Satsang road (near Bindraban road).

12-10-2020||City||GADVASU all set to conduct research to identify purity of dog breeds||After several incidents of residents being fleeced by dog breeders came to light, GADVASU has decided to conduct lab-based research to identify the purity of dog breeds. The research will be carried out on three popular dog breeds in Punjab—German Shepherd, Labrador, and Pug.The expert said that the lockdown and travel restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic led to a rise in the unethical practice of selling mixed breeding and inbreeding among dogs. Due to a spurt in demand for some dog breeds, breeders indulged in such practices in order to sell them at a premium.Dr JPS Gill, director of research said that the training has been sponsored by the project monitoring unit of Canine Research Centre and Networking (CRCN-GADVASU) under the DBT network research project titled ‘Parentage Determination and Cytogenetic Profiling in Dogs’.The principal investigator Dr CS Mukhopadhyay, and the co-ordinators of the training Dr PP Dubey and Dr Anuj Tyagi mentioned that this training is focused on fundamental aspects of bioinformatics and biocomputational analyses.Dr Mukhopadhyay said that lab-based research will help them create a DNA profiling of the particular breeds of dogs and their traits. “Purity of dog breed and its identification has always been an issue in the state. People always complain that they were given mongrels or mixed breed dogs. To begin with, lab tests will be conducted to check the three breeds of dogs popular in Punjab namely German Shepherd, Labrador, and Pug to identify their markers on the basis of DNA profiling, also known as DNA fingerprinting which establishes a genetic code for individual dogs of every breed.”A dog breeder from Mandi Ahmedgarh Ravinder Sharma said that the pandemic led to the unethical practice of breeding and mixed breeding. “Some breeders cash on the emotions of people. Even after coming to know that the pet sold to them was a mixed breed, the owners do not desert it. In the case of inbreeding the pet suffers from infection and congenital disease,” said Dr Sharma.He said that German Shepherd, Labrador, and Pug that rages between ₹5,000 to ₹20,000, were sold at a premium. German Shepherd pups were sold between ₹30,000 to ₹35,000.Four-day training on bioinformatics heldThe department has organised four-day e-training on bioinformatics in this regard.This training was sponsored by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), a government-funded project on parentage determination in dogs and aimed to promote online learning and to impart proficiency in bioinformatics to trainees from diverse academic backgrounds.As many as 100 trainees from 18 states and two international participants were apprised about the different aspects of molecular data analysis.GADVASU’s vice-chancellor Inderjeet Singh emphasised that capacity building in bioinformatics and analysing parentage data using molecular methods is the need of the hour.Dr Arun K Rawat, senior advisor to DBT emphasised on identification and exploring the possibility of canine-parentage based markers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gadvasu-all-set-to-conduct-research-to-identify-purity-of-dog-breeds/story-Hkbfx50b1bIGl4sxzHUsSJ.html

People in Leh trust BJP and they want to support us because under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi various developmental works have been taken up. From making Ladakh a UT to the speedy development of the region, these works should not stop,” he told mediapersons.Congress’s campaign is being led by its leader and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora.A local said nothing can be said as of now and both the arch-rivals appear neck-to-neck in the race.“There was resentment among the people of Leh against the BJP government for not providing safeguards under the sixth schedule of the Constitution but then home minister Amit Shah promised a delegation of Apex Body of People’s Movement (ABPM), led by Thupstan Chhewang, that the same will be extended to us. So, how voters react to the verbal promise will be seen in the ensuing elections,” the local said.On October 7, Union minister Anurag Thakur had said the people of Leh will get much more than Sixth Schedule only because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Thakur had assured them that land, culture, ethnic values and everything shall be safeguarded.The Leh council has 30 seats with a provision for nominating four members, while 26 get elected through votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-of-leh-trust-bjp-will-back-us-in-council-polls-rijiju/story-FZ82fZumY3YNzp2mrw5xTO.html

Similarly, in 2014 five security officials were killed and 16 were injured in separate attacks.Also read: India generated over 18,000 tonnes Covid-19 waste since JuneGiven the sensitivity of the situation, the Election Commission had called a meeting to review the situation. Apart from the top brass of police, district magistrates and SPs of all the sensitive districts attended the meeting held in Bodh Gaya.“Land mines are the biggest challenge in Maoist areas as they cause heavy damage and are difficult to detect. The prime focus is to ensure free and fair polls and safe movement of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF). In Bihar, 16 districts are Maoist affected but Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada, Jamui and Lakhisarai are the most vulnerable,” said a police official.Sources said several SPs had sought satellite phones, additional CAPF and deep search metal detectors.Another challenge for Bihar is the vulnerable districts sharing border with Jharkhand. Several meetings have been held between senior police officials of both states to work in coordination during the polls.“The biggest worry for the administration is to provide security to candidates and ensure that people come out in large numbers to vote. While security at polling booths is usually adequate, the route that voters undertake is highly vulnerable,” said another officer.Also read: ‘Timely moves’ - PM Modi after Nirmala Sitharaman’s Rs 73,000 crore stimulusAn IG rank police officer, involved in the force deployment strategy, said adequate officials of forces such as the SAP, the STF, the CRPF and COBRA jawans had already been deployed in Gaya-Aurangabad districts.“Barachatti, Amas, Dumaria, Immamganj, Bankebazar, Sherghatti, Dobhi, Madanpur, Kutumba, Deo, Lemua are known to be worst Maoists affected areas in Gaya and Aurangabad,” he added.Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra said, “Landmines are the biggest challenge during polls. The city SP along with the ASP (operation) are camping in Dumaria forest, a hotbed of Maoists.”Munger range DIG Manu Maharaaj said the district police have formed surveillance teams to check for mines in all possible places.“In Aurangabad and Nawada, the district police adopt the strategies of area domination, cordon-and-search operations, conduct flag marches and random frequent vehicle-checks,” said IG Rakesh Rathi, Magadh range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-land-mines-ieds-pose-huge-challenge-to-security-forces-during-first-phase/story-N8EwG5jTBr5g3Gc3PhTnYM.html
12-10-2020||Kolkata||Bengal gears up for spike in Covid-19 cases during festive season, 24X7 control room set up||With Durga Puja, the biggest festival in West Bengal, starting next week, the Mamata Banerjee government is gearing up for a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases of which doctors have already warned. While leaves of government officials associated with the tacking the Covid-19 crisis have been cancelled, the government has also decided to set up a control room which would operate round-the-clock during the puja days. Meanwhile, the state government on Monday also slashed the cost of RT-PCR tests in private labs from Rs 2,250 to Rs 1,500. The test is done for free in government laboratories. “As the state government further caps the cost of Covid detection test at Rs 1,500, we will be implementing it as per the government directive given that these are pandemic times,” said Rupak Barua, president of association of hospitals of eastern India. Banerjee also announced that she would virtually inaugurate the pujas which have sent invitations to her. Every year, the Trinamool Congress supremo inaugurates dozens of pujas, including those patronised by the party’s top guns. On Monday, she inaugurated one such puja. “If I visit the pandal to inaugurate the puja, there would be crowding. I can do so virtually from the state secretariat. On October 15, pujas of north Kolkata would be inaugurated while south Kolkata pujas would be inaugurated on October 17. The pujas of west Kolkata and Behala would be inaugurated on October 16,” the CM said. While Kolkata is already witnessing a spike in Covid-19 numbers and daily cases have almost doubled in the past month, a doctors’ forum has warned that there could be a three to four-fold rise in Covid-19 cases if there is any laxity during the puja period. Urging people to wear masks and maintain distance, the chief minister warned that community spread has started and cases are spiking because of inter-state movement. Flooded with complaints of ambulance drivers demanding exorbitant rates from family members of covid-19 patients, the state government has also urged the regulatory commission to fix prices of ambulances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-gears-up-for-spike-in-covid-19-cases-during-festive-season-24x7-control-room-set-up/story-JM9swpvBg7l8scY07ZEG8M.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s millions get their power back after massive outage||Millions went without power in India’s financial capital Mumbai and surrounding areas for hours on Monday, after a grid failure triggered its first major blackout in more than two years.The outage stranded thousands of train passengers, disrupted online college exams and affected mobile telephone services before power was restored to most parts of the city of some 20 million.The grid failure was caused by “technical problems” during maintenance work, the energy minister of Mumbai’s home state of Maharashtra said. In mid-2018, a fire at a transformer sparked similar power cuts in the city and its suburbs.Throughout Monday’s breakdown, Mumbai’s international airport and the country’s two main stock exchanges located in the city, the National Stock Exchange and BSE, operated normally, their spokespeople said.“Power supply to all essential services in Mumbai, suburbs ... have been restored. Non-essential services will also be restored shortly,” Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut said on Twitter.The government-run Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport agency, Adani Power Ltd and Tata Power Co Ltd - the three main suppliers to Mumbai - had all been affected by the outage that extended to hospitals, many of which are treating Covid-19 patients.Hospitals and other institutions in India have over the years banked on emergency diesel power generators as a backup due to frequent outages caused by demand outstripping supply. The situation has improved in the big cities but the countryside still has to live with frequent power cuts.Mumbai’s trains, which are generally packed and move more than seven million people a day to their offices and factories, have resumed operations after more than two hours of inactivity due to the power failure.Train services in the city have been curtailed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and they are carrying far fewer passengers than usual. Still, social media was splashed with pictures of people stranded inside lightless trains and in railway stations.The Times of India said final-year online exams across Mumbai colleges have been postponed due to the blackout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-millions-get-their-power-back-after-massive-outage/story-DyJQgFUxoghAwxDHSFWKuI.html

A lot of people will come under the scanner if we were to talk about who follows laws to what extent,” the editorial said.It also asked that if industries are to operate at 50 per cent of their capacity, “will the government arrange for the children of the remaining 50 per cent of the people?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-forcing-white-collar-people-to-take-to-crime-shiv-sena-in/story-7Y6G4HD7wokAjKbMNYCEeI.html

The power supply was not resumed in a few areas even by 6 pm on Monday.With the schools going online during the pandemic, most school students got the day off following the black out.Yukti Rajan, 37, whose son is in Class 2 of Reliance Foundation School, said, “My son Prithvi has online classes from 11.30 am to 12.30 pm. At around 11.20 am, we got a message from school about the cancellation of classes due to power failure. The kids were overjoyed as this was an unexpected holiday for him.”Gouri Bhattacharya, vice-principal of Podar International School (CBSE), Nerul, said, “We had to cancel the online class owing to the power cut. The message was sent to the parents via our internal communication system.”  At Ryan International School, Sanpada, the exams had to be postponed. “Since students can’t submit the online forms, the exam has been postponed. The later dates have not been declared yet,” a parent said.Professionals working from home since the lockdown had to juggle between laptops and mobile phones. “The power cut had all the hues of the Monday morning blues. It was like a half day for offices and schools. Laptop and mobile batteries were dead. Electrical appliances switched off, and there was not much to do during this forced lockdown,” Vashi resident, Nikita Rode, an Assistant VP, Human Resources with an insurance company, said.The duration of power cut ranged from one hour to several hours in different areas in the city.While the private clinics were hit due to the power cut, the hospitals were mostly unaffected. Dr Mehrunisa Khan, 39, who runs dental clinic at Sector 10, Vashi, said, “I start at 10 am and finish by 1pm. After all sanitisation, I reach home by 1.30 pm. On Monday, everything got delayed. I reached home only by 3pm, that too after cancelling a few appointments as all my equipment works on power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surprise-holiday-for-students-half-day-for-professionals-mark-power-cut-in-navi-mumbai/story-Vyt29NJwiFVUsdPJOLWJTK.html

12-10-2020||City||Booked for abetting suicide by couple, accused woman cop goes underground||Amritsar A woman sub-inspector (SI) of the Punjab Police, who is accused of abetting the suicide of a 35-year-old jeweller and his wife, has gone underground even as she was on duty when the man had taken the extreme step on Saturday.The jeweller, who hanged himself from a ceiling fan in a hotel room at the Batala road in Amritsar city, had left a suicide note blaming SI Sandeep Kaur for blackmailing and driving him to end his life.In the suicide note, the jeweler claimed that he was being blackmailed and threatened by the SI, also a resident of Navan Pind and posted at the Mehta police station.His suicide note read, “Sandeep had taken ₹17-18 lakh from me and was demanding more. She threatened to kill me through her friends if I failed to pay the money. There are screenshots of messages in my phone that will make it clear that she was pressuring me to kill Baljit Singh, her former friend. She also tried to pressure me to kill one Navdeep Sandhu and his wife. Navdeep was living with Mandeep with the promise to marry her.”On Sunday, 33-year-old wife of the jeweller had also hanged herself.Two separate cases under section 306 (attempting the suicide) were registered against the SI at Mohkampura and Jandiala police stations on Saturday and Sunday respectively.Mehta station house officer (SHO) Satpal Singh said Sandeep was on a duty and was sent to Chawinda Devi village for a case on Saturday when the jeweller had ended his life. “From Chawinda Devi, she didn’t report back at the police station,” he said.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-headquarters) Riputapan Singh said they have been conducting raids to arrest the accused. “We have also sought a report from the Mehta SHO to know if she was on duty when the incident had taken place?” he said.Meanwhile, a video clip of the jeweller has surfaced, which appears to have been made before he ended his life in the hotel. In the clip, the jeweller has blamed that the SI was also threatening him in the name of an SHO and a Congress MLA. He also sought help for getting justice from former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) minister Bikram Singh Majithia by claiming himself a supporter of the SAD.The victim’s father has alleged that the police were supporting the accused. He said they would opt for blockades if they failed to get justice. The victim’s only daughter has also demanded “strict punishment” for the accused woman cop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/booked-for-abetting-suicide-by-couple-accused-woman-cop-goes-underground/story-BJBCKpqbfbtuUwcwmGbmIM.html
12-10-2020||City||Sidhu’s conduct an issue, heshould form his own party: Bittu||Ludhiana Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu has claimed that Amritsar East MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu’s on-stage argument with cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa in Moga during Rahul Gandhi’s visit had diverted attention from the core issues of farmers.On Sunday (October 4), Sidhu had taken a dig at the party organisers, when he breached the time limit during his speech. “Bhaji aaj na rok... Pehlan vee bithaye rakhya see (Brother, don’t stop me today, you have had me waiting for long),” he had bluntly told Randhawa, when asked to wind-up his speech.“Ultimately, it was the loss of farmers and no one’s gain. It is high time Sidhu forms his own party,” Bittu said, adding that due to this attitude, the Moga rally was reduced to a controversy around Sidhu’s conduct with other party leaders.“Sidhu has a fair share of controversies, all related to his conduct. Whether in the cricket field or as a commentator, when he was in the BJP, and now while he is in the Congress, it is his conduct that has proved to be counterproductive. It lands him into one controversy after another,” Bittu told HT.He added that with such an attitude it would be difficult for Sidhu to adjust in any particular party.“I am speaking as a younger brother to Sidhu and have high regard for him, both as a person and as a former professional cricketer. However, what happened in Moga and afterwards could have been avoided. People had gathered to listen to Rahul and not Sidhu, who went on rambling with his speech,” claimed Bittu.He said it would not be wrong to presume that Sidhu’s misconduct with Randhawa in Moga was the reason for his exclusion from the list of 30 star campaigners for Bihar assembly polls. “Punjab Congress in-charge Harish Rawat is a thorough gentleman. He must have invited Sidhu to infuse positivity in the state unit,” Bittu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sidhu-s-conduct-an-issue-heshould-form-his-own-party-bittu/story-jOTgfT37JYl6YknYf4XTDP.html

Police say Mehar, who was arrested from Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh on October 9, based on call records and phone location murdered another resident of his village and tried to pass it off as his own to get ₹1.6 crore claim from insurance companies to repay his debt. Sadar SHO Kashmiri Lal, “During investigation, all his relatives’ claims were found to be false. They told us that he had gone to Hisar on October 6. His mobile location, however, confirmed that he had spent most of his time before the incident in areas near under village. After the incident, his phone was switched off and we did not get the same phone in the burnt car. Mehar’s nephew claimed that his uncle had called him half an hour before the mishap, but the car was found burnt with diesel poured on the rooftop. The car’s handbrake was pulled, which was suspicious,” he added.A police official said they had traced two contacts of the trader, with whom he had been in frequent touch before the incident. “Suman, who was working at his factory, said Mehar had left for Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh with two others for some work on October 6. Mehar was in her touch through WhatsApp calls after the incident,” the cop added.Lal added Mehar had killed another villager, Ram Mehar, alias Ramlu, before burning his body in his car near Bhatla village in Hansi on October 6. “Mehar offered drinks to Ramlu and strangulated him to death, keeping his body on the seat adjoining to the driver’s seat. Ramlu was illiterate and is survived by six children, mother and wife and is a from a poor background,” the SHO added.Police have got five-day police remand of Suman. “Mehar had given ₹4 lakh to her before fleeing to Chhattisgarh in her car along with two others. The trader had shared his plan with the woman three months ago, telling her that he will purchase someone’s body and will burn it in his car so that his family can get ₹1.6 crore from insurance companies and will then shift outside Haryana,” a cop said.The SHO added DNA samples of Ramlu’s mother had been taken to match with the samples from the body to confirm the identity. “The trader hatched a conspiracy to kill Ramlu. The role of the other accused in under scrutiny,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hansi-trader-killed-namesake-burnt-body-for-1-6-cr-insurance-held-from-chhattisgarh/story-V7RitGU0TZAI0aZgT6LkNM.html

An irate mob, mostly comprising tea garden workers, had assaulted Dr Dutta on August 31, 2019, holding him responsible for the death of a patient in Teok TE. He was rushed to the Jorhat Medical College, where he was declared brought dead. The pictures of the assault, which soon went viral on social media, created a sense of terror among doctors posted in tea gardens across Assam. At least seven doctors, who were working in tea gardens, had resigned within a week of Dr Dutta’s murder. Police had arrested 32 people, including three brothers of the deceased patient, following the attack under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Assam Medicare Service Persons & Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2011.

Escorted by UP police, they reached Uttarakhand Bhavan a little after 11am. Citing security issues, the local police put up barricades and stopped all traffic leading towards the Bhavan. The family was taken inside right away and was not allowed to meet the press outside.Senior officials like Lucknow district magistrate Abhishek Prakash, commissioner of police Sujeet Pandey and deputy commissioner of police (DCP) East, Charu Nigam, also inspected the security arrangements outside the Bhavan. Pandey said, “The family has been kept under security as per court orders. We have made arrangements to ensure that they are safe before their appearance in court.”Seema Kushwaha, a Delhi-based lawyer who fought the Nirbhaya case, is representing the family in the case. She reached the Bhavan at 1pm and interacted briefly with the family.Also read: Centre asks states to act on rape law“The family has three demands which we will put before the high court bench. First, we want security for the family. Second, the trial of the case must be shifted to Delhi or Mumbai and aspects of the investigation must not be made public by the investigating authorities,” Kushwaha said.Taking a dig at the Special Investigation Team (SIT) for revealing call details between the accused and the victim’s brother, Kushwaha said a ‘perception’ was being created to take the focus away from the case.Almost an hour later, the family was taken from Uttarakhand Bhavan to the high court located less than a kilometre away. The court proceedings were under way at the time of filing of this report.Earlier in the morning, when the family set off for Lucknow, it was accompanied by subdivisional magistrate Anjali Gangwar, Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar, and superintendent of police Vineet Jaiswal. The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court had taken suo motu cognizance of the case on October 1. It had asked the woman’s parents for their version of the incident and had also ordered the Hathras district administration to arrange for their travel to the court and facilitate their appearance before it.

12-10-2020||Kolkata||‘Will target 4 TMC leaders for every BJP leader attacked’: Bengal BJP talks ‘Kerala-style retaliation’||Talking revenge in unequivocal terms, the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday said it will target four leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) to avenge the attack on one leader from the saffron camp. The warning was sounded by Bengal BJP vice-president Biswapriyo Roy Chowdhury during a press conference at the party’s state headquarters in Kolkata. He made the statement in reference to an alleged bomb attack on the car of the BJP Murshidabad district president on Saturday. Though nobody suffered any serious injury, the windows of the car melted in the explosion, alleged Roy Chowdhury. Also Read: TMC legislator’s ‘nepotism’ comment puts party in BJP’s line of fire“Democracy is in peril in West Bengal and we need restoration of peace. Our workers and leaders are being targeted every day. We saw the same situation in Kerala. When Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and BJP workers were being killed in Kerala in repeated attacks (by the Marxists) they decided to retaliate. They targeted four people for every RSS and BJP worker killed. If proper investigation is not done into yesterday’s incident and the guilty are not arrested we will follow the same path here,” said Roy Chowdhury. “We do not believe in the politics of violence. But if people think that we will silently watch our men being attacked and killed, they are wrong. We are workers of a political party. We protest against injustice and we resist injustice but if that does not work we do not hesitate to avenge injustice. If this situation continues we will target four people for every single attack on us. And let me specify that we will selectively target district and state leaders. If TMC can handle that, let it do so,” Roy Chowdhury said. Though Bengal BJP leaders such as state president Dilip Ghosh and general secretary Sayantan Basu have made vitriolic statements in the past, this is the first time a warning of this nature has been sounded from the BJP state headquarters. Roy Chowdhury is known for his organisational skills and he has never made statements of this nature, party leaders said. Reacting to this, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “I would not like to seriously consider what a leader of Roy Chowdhury’s stature is saying but if the Bengal BJP really takes the path of violence then TMC is ready to handle it. But one must remember that people of the state will not tolerate any violence. I hope the BJP central leadership takes note of what Roy Chowdhury has said.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/will-target-four-tmc-leaders-for-every-bjp-leader-attacked-bengal-bjp-talks-kerala-style-retaliation/story-x0H4skdK86it5DhafCoQUO.html

While taking steps towards fulfilling the dream of a healthy society, it is important to reach out to urban as well as rural areas.”Mukta Puntambekar, director, Muktangan Rehabilitation Centre, said adolescents get influenced by content shown through various media and assume that addiction brings happiness and reduces stress.“It is necessary to dispel the doubts among youngsters and provide them with the right answers. It is important to implement awareness-building activities like ‘Saiyam’ all over the country. We need to focus on the availability of positive addictions rather than negative ones,” she said.Accordingly, the Jnana Prabodhini Institute of Psychology had prepared a module and a curriculum through its volunteer group called ‘Samvadini’ which carried out pre-tests and post-tests on the subjects on addiction through sessions in each school in Pune district over the past one year.As per the report, out of 7,297 students, 59 per cent children showed a positive change in their level of awareness regarding myths and misconceptions regarding addictions, while 61 per cent children showed a positive change in their level of awareness regarding knowledge and attitude about sexuality issues including gender sensitivity. Accordingly, about 57 per cent of children showed a positive change in their assertiveness, level of frustration tolerance, delay in gratification and loss of control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/anti-addiction-drive-connects-with-over-7-000-students-in-pune-district/story-mIuatp93opih8olkXS9WeK.html

The civic body has set itself a target of booking 20,000 offenders daily and has deputed 960 staff for the same. The city has been witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases for over a month, with an average 2,000 new cases reported daily. With lifting of some restrictions, more people stepping out for work which coincided with festive season, there has been a spurt in cases which has the city authorities worried. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “A large number of citizens do not wear face masks which could lead to situation getting difficult in future thereby delaying opening up of the city.”He added, “The BMC is initiating a mass drive of penalising approximately 20,000 citizens per day found without masks in public spaces...this drive will continue for a month at least, and it will be monitored personally by me every evening.”The BMC had made face masks compulsory in the first week of April and has also announced a fine of Rs 200 on violators.However, between April and October 1, 2020, only 18,118 citizens have been booked for not wearing a face mask and the BMC has collected around Rs 60 lakh as fine. Last month, the BMC booked 852 citizens for spitting in public place and collected a fine of Rs 1.46 lakh. According to BMC officials, till now officials from the Solid Waste Management (SWM) department were given the task to penalise those not wearing masks as an additional assignment, apart from their regular eight-hour duty, but now, all 24 administrative wards in the city have appointed agencies for the same.A BMC official from the SWM department said, “A team of 960 people, which comes to around 40 people in each ward, will have the task to daily book anywhere between 800-850 citizens for not wearing masks. The detection is very much possible, considering our survey on ground has reported that a large number of citizens do not wear masks.”Meanwhile, on the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, Chahal said, “The situation is under control. In the last one month, as cases have gone up, bed vacancy has also gone up. Tests have increased and the doubling rate has risen to 69 days in October compared to 58 days in September.”On Sunday, Mumbai reported 2,170 new cases, taking the total number of cases so far to 229,336.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-bmc-starts-month-long-face-mask-drive-violators-to-be-booked-penalised/story-hQF66awYtq0po2Lkb2Hz1K.html

There’s no confirmation as yet on the cultural festivals and arrival of traders for setting up stalls.The Kullu district administration has also sought guidelines from the state government on organising the festival.“Dusshera will be celebrated according to state government orders and preparations are being made for the festival as well as Lord Raghunath’s Rath Yatra,” said Maheshwar Singh, chief priest of the Lord Raghunath temple. “Due to the pandemic, however, people will have to take care of a lot of things,” he warned.Every year, more than 300 deities congregate at Kullu’s Dhalpur ground to honour Lord Raghunath, who is the presiding deity of the town, during the festival, which attracts four to five lakh people from across India and abroad.In 2020, things are definitely going to be different because of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-puts-the-breaks-on-lord-raghunath-s-chariot-only-200-to-pull-it-at-kullu-dussehra-fest/story-38BirCcbGgxhBRZo9cEzmM.html

12-10-2020||Delhi||Farm bills 2020: CM Kejriwal joins AAP protest at Jantar Mantar||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday joined the protest by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders at Jantar Mantar against the Centre’s three new farm legislations.AAP’s Punjab unit organised the protest, which was attended by ministers from the Kejriwal Cabinet, other party leaders from the national capital and members of Delhi legislative assembly (MLAs).Kejriwal said his party is opposed to the anti-farmer laws and called for their abolition. He suggested that a law should be introduced, where minimum support price (MSP) would be applicable to all farm produce. Also read: All you need to know about the economic arguments in favour of the three farm billsHe reminded the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government that the party had promised before the parliamentary elections in 2014 about the implementation of the Swaminathan Committee’s report. “They (the BJP) had promised to implement the 1.5 times increase in MSP recommended by the committee, but nothing came of it,” said the Delhi CM. “The Centre has said 6% of the farmers’ produce is sold through MSP. If this figure holds good, then shame on the (NDA) government. The Centre should have ensured that MSP is applicable to 100% farm produce. However, they have abolished the concept of MSP altogether,” he added.He gave the example of his party’s ascent to power in 2015. “In Delhi, when the AAP came to power, the condition of government schools was pathetic. But, we did not shut down these schools. We improved their condition in a big way. The Centre should have addressed the problem this way. Hospitals were in a bad state, but we did not shut them. We improved the healthcare facility,” he said.“The Central government has backstabbed farmers,” he alleged. He claimed that some parties are indulging in doublespeak. “They say one thing in Parliament, but something else outside,” he alleged. “In Punjab, there is a leader, who was a part of the committee that had drafted these anti-farmer legislations. He got the bills passed in both the Houses of Parliament. However, he took up the farmers’ cause outside Parliament,” he further alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farm-bills-2020-cm-kejriwal-joins-aap-protest-at-jantar-mantar/story-dqTYXB2AbeXaDAsaRbknRL.html

Both of them have been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau for allegedly dealing small quantities of ganja, mostly for the consumption of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Justice Dangre granted pre-arrest bail to Sakat primarily on the grounds that seized the contraband material was not of commercial quantity.Also Read: Mumbai power outage: Tweeple use humour to deal with situation, post rib-tickling memes“Though it cannot be disputed that the offence is serious, it is to be noted that the quantity seized is not commercial,” said justice Dangre while granting pre-arrest bail to Sakat. “The custodial interrogation, in my considered opinion, is not warranted in view of the fact that the contraband is now seized and nothing remains to be recovered from the present applicant.”The judge said Sakat was entitled to protection from arrest, also because he had no criminal antecedents.Baramati city police had raided Sakat’s house in July 2020, following a tip. Sakat and his brother had fled the spot after noticing a police party approaching their house. His mother did not cooperate with the raiding police team, but the search resulted in the seizure of a container, in which there was 3.225kg ganja or cannabis, worth Rs 75,100 in the domestic market.The police then booked Sakat, his brother and mother under sections 8(A), 20(b)(ii)(B) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.Also Read: Delay in lodging rape complaints can’t be appreciated in abstract, says Bombay high courtSakat had moved the high court after his anticipatory bail application was rejected by the sessions judge at Baramati. He had claimed that he was unaware that his mother was consuming drugs and she had the contraband for commercial purposes.He, however, contended that, in any case, the alleged recovery of the contraband was not of commercial quantity. Besides, the investigation was complete and therefore his custodial interrogation was not necessary.The high court accepted his contentions and granted him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-man-booked-for-possession-of-3-225-kg-ganja/story-ty7e8xNz2SFfDzINohVcEN.html

Shikara died on the spot. Later, the accused fired at least five more rounds in the air and threatened the factory personnel not to come in his way. He had been hiding in the factory for the past 39 hours,” said Katni superintendent of police Lalit Shakyawar. “He was hiding with an INSAS rifle and several live cartridges and also threatening to end his life. Army and police both launched a joint operation to pursue him to surrender without harming himself or others,” said Shakyawar. “As he was available over the phone, the DSC lieutenant colonel connected him with his family to convince him to surrender. Throughout the night, we kept requesting him, with the help of a public announcement system, to surrender. He surrendered with his rifle at 10 am today,” said the SP. According to the police officer, Singh was upset over Shikara’s behaviour. “There was some communication gap over approval of his leave application for his daughter’s marriage, which will be held in November. Singh claims that Shikara did not approve his leave but the DSC officer has denied this claim,” said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-army-jawan-surrenders-39-hours-after-killing-jco-at-katni-ordnance-factory/story-3NeaKCPdkCHVAyiSKCM9hJ.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai power outage: Civic-run hospitals affected, minor surgeries cancelled||Health services, especially in civic-run hospitals, were affected as a result of a power outage across the city on Monday morning. Most civic-run hospitals cancelled minor surgeries. As per medical requirements, hospitals have emergency power backup. All the emergency wards like casualty, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Covid-19 centres did have adequate supply of electricity. However, civic-run hospitals like Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known Sion Hospital, BYL Nair, King Edward Memorial hospitals stopped power supply at their OPDs and general wards. Resident doctors had to examine patients in out-patient departments (OPD) in personal protective equipment (PPE) suits in darkness.Also Read: Mumbai power outage: City comes to a standstill as grid failure hits supply“We don’t know how long there will be a power shortage. So, we had to stop the supply at OPDs, which don’t require emergency services. But as we had already received a large number of patients, we completed their checkup in the dark with torches and phone lights,” said a resident doctor from Nair Hospital. Around 12pm, Sion Hospital cancelled a few minor surgeries to avoid unnecessary complications during the procedures. “We have spoken to the electricity department of our hospital which informed us that we have power backup only for two hours. So, we are trying to arrange for more fuel to provide electricity in emergency wards longer,” said a resident doctor from Sion Hospital. Doctors said working in PPE suits in non-emergency wards was exhausting. “Once we wear the PPE, we can’t remove it until our duty is over. So, we have no option but to continue working in the suit even though the power outage made it worse. We are perspiring profusely in the OPDs but we can’t ask the patients to go away,” said a doctor from KEM hospital.Also Read: Mumbai power outage: Jams across the city after 700 traffic signals stop workingHowever, private hospitals have been less affected by the outage. “Our medical services haven’t been affected in any way. We have a power backup pf upto 12 hours. The OPDs and surgeries are going on smoothly,” said Dr Ravishankar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Lilavati Hospital. Authorities from Nanavati and Bombay hospitals also assured uninterrupted electricity supply to their staff in all the wards. Jumbo Covid Care Centres (CCC) in the city have adequate supply of electricity for their ICU beds due to automated power backup. Taking note of the power cut, IS Chahal, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner, instructed all hospitals to contract transport garages of BMC’s solid waste management department to arrange adequate supply of diesel for the next eight hours to run generators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-power-outage-civic-run-hospitals-affected-minor-surgeries-cancelled/story-fBgHGzAAnp1kze08Kq7mZJ.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Delay in lodging rape complaints can’t be appreciated in abstract, says Bombay high court||The aspect of delay in lodging complaint in rape cases cannot be appreciated in abstract, nor can it be considered dehors the attendant circumstances, Bombay high court observed while upholding the life term handed down to a 58-year-old slum dweller from Vasai for raping his minor daughter for about a year.“In a prosecution for rape, delay in lodging the report by itself is not fatal to the prosecution,” said the bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NJ Jamadar last week, adding “nor can the delay in lodging the FIR be used as a ritualistic formula to throw the prosecution overboard.”The bench said if an explanation for delay (in lodging FIR) is offered, the court has to examine whether it is satisfactory or not. It refused to accept the argument on behalf of the Vasai resident that the belated complaint belied the survivor’s testimony that she was sexually assaulted by her own father.The court said in the case at hand, the girl had affirmed that she was threatened of death and though she tried to reason with her father, he continued to exploit her. “The victim was a girl of tender age,” said the bench. “Apart from the accused, there was nobody in her life to whom the victim could look up to.”On November 7, 2014, the survivor, who was 15 old at the time, had approached the local police in Vasai with two local women. Her mother, she told police, had left them and she was residing in a slum pocket in Vasai west along with her father and a six-year-old brother. She alleged that her father had been raping her for about a year after tying her hands and legs and gagging her mouth by a cloth. She claimed she could not reveal her ordeal to anyone as her father had threatened to kill her and her brother as well.On December 20, 2016, an additional sessions judge convicted the 58-year-old and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He had then moved the hight court, challenging his conviction and the life term handed down to him.It was also argued on his behalf that in the absence of corroboration to the testimony of the survivor, the conviction was legally unsustainable. In this regard, it was argued that the prosecution could have examined some immediate neighbours, who would have had the opportunity to notice the ordeal allegedly faced by the survivor for almost a year, or the women who accompanied her to the police station for lodging complaint.The court refused to accept the contention, observing that where testimony of the victim inspires confidence, that, by itself, can be the sole basis for convicting the accused.“The failure of the prosecution to examine immediate neighbours is of little significance,” said the bench. “The victim has deposed to her helpless condition and the methods adopted by the accused to prevent her from raising alarms. To her misfortune, her prime protector preyed on her as sexual predator. The neighbours would hardly suspect that the accused would ravish the victim in the manner deposed to by the victim.”The high court also ruled out the possibility that the 58-year-old could have been falsely implicated at the behest of a slum lord -- one of the women who accompanied the minor to police station for lodging the complaint -- in order to grab his shanty.“The tussle over occupancy rights of a room in a slum area, in a metropolis like Mumbai, is not uncommon,” the bench said. “It does not, however, appeal to human credulity that the victim would depose against her father at the instance of third person, who was bent on grabbing her house.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/delay-in-lodging-rape-complaints-can-t-be-appreciated-in-abstract-says-bombay-high-court/story-NY2kfBt8W6F9LBAmSLY4GN.html

12-10-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 doubles troubles for Himachal’s single women||Raj Kumari, 36, had a broken marriage and worked at a beauty parlour in Shimla till the Covid-19 lockdown claimed her job. In six months, she says she has spent her savings and is struggling to survive. The past few months have been tough for 50-year-old widow Veena Kumari from Kakrighat in Chamba, too. “With no work under MGNREGA for four months, ration supplies have dried up till villagers came to the rescue,” says Veena, who lost her husband to diabetes-induced health complications 15 years ago. “I raised a loan of Rs 40,000 to build a house but now it’s difficult to repay the instalments,” she says. Raj Kumari and Veena Kumari are among the over 3 lakh single women of Himachal Pradesh grappling financial constraints as the slowdown has snatched their livelihoods. The Ekal Mahila Vikas and Kisan Kalyan Samiti, a branch of Ekal Nari Shakti Sangathan that was set up for empowering single women, has urged chief minister Jai Ram Thakur to reduce bus fares and waive electricity dues for such women. “Covid-19 has slowed down the world economy and the common man is the worst hit. Industries have closed down, unemployment has gone up, small and medium businesses have been ruined,” says Ekal Nari Shakti Sangathan head Nirmal Chandel. “Instead of offering financial relief to people during this health crisis, the state government has increased their burden by hiking bus fares and electricity charges,” she says. SPEEDY JUSTICE SOUGHT Single women of the state also want autonomous nyaya panchayats to be set up so that their cases can be taken up on priority and they get speedy justice. They argue that even though the law provides them maintenance and inheritance rights, the court cases drag for years and by the time the verdict is pronounced, their children’s future is already compromised with. During the lockdown, many divorcees are facing difficulty in getting monthly maintenance fixed by the court. “With no work and many of us not getting the maintenance during the lockdown, our woes have doubled,” says Brij Bala, who was abandoned by her husband. Though she completed post-graduation in political science after her marriage broke down, she is yet to get a job to secure the future of her children. The 2011 Census shows the state has 3.04 lakh single women, including widows, divorcees and those abandoned by their husbands. There are 2.94 lakh widows, while 6,956 women have been deserted by husbands and 4,549 are divorcees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-doubles-troubles-for-himachal-s-single-women/story-RX6xYVz6EwrCFoSqSUUO0K.html

12-10-2020||Mumbai||After MVA decision on Metro-3, citizens to submit a holistic plan for all metros||Citizen groups will be submitting a plan to the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government demanding integration across Metro corridors after the latter took the decision to shift the phase three of the project, which stretches from Colaba to Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (Seepz) via Bandra. The state government seeks to shift the corridor from Aarey to Kanjurmarg, an eastern suburb of Mumbai. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced that the Metro-3 car depot would be constructed in Kanjurmarg along with the Metro-6 project, which stretches from Swami Samarth Nagar to Vikhroli. Citizen groups had submitted a plan to the government last year to scrap the Metro-6 project. They had proposed an extension of the Metro-3 project by another six kilometres (km). Nitin Killawala, a Mumbai-based architect, has suggested the route via Marol Naka, which crosses Saki Vihar and Chandiviki until Vikhroli on the Eastern Express Highway. Citizen forums have been opposing the Metro-6 project over the Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road, as it faces massive traffic snarls. “We have made similar plans for all the Metro projects that are under construction. The Metro-4 project, which stretches from Wadala to Kasarwadavali, can also connect until Kanjurmarg and the key locations can be covered via city buses,” he said. “All Metro projects are being constructed on arterial roads leading to utter traffic chaos. All these projects are also facing inordinate delays. Our plan is more holistic,” he added. Killawala, along with resident groups from Powai and other architects and activists, will be presenting the plan in a webinar next week following which the MVA government will be approached. Several citizen groups were active during the protest against the proposed Metro car shed at Aarey Colony in western suburbs. They were demanding scrapping of the project since Aarey Colony is one of the last surviving green belts in Mumbai. On Sunday, Thackeray announced that the car shed would be shifted to Kanjurmarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-mva-decision-on-metro-3-citizens-to-submit-a-holistic-plan-for-all-metros/story-RERDB5SUaBD3YmXEswqQGL.html

About 25-28 armed commandos accompany him at all times when he is mobile. His convoy has pilot and escort vehicles armed with jammers.“In further enhancement of the security cover, security personnel to be deployed from UP police have to undergo a strict training schedule before being inducted into the CM’s security.Recently, two personnel were removed from the shortlisted group of security personnel after they failed to qualify during shooting practice,” the officer quoted above said.He also said the process of selection of fit security personnel had been going on for the past two years. A pool of such personnel had been prepared so that the entire security team could be replaced anytime, if required, he added.On Friday, additional director general (ADG), Security, Binod Kumar Singh had stated that the changes were along the lines of the Prime Minister’s security.On September 25, a man from Etah district from Uttar Pradesh was arrested for allegedly issuing a death threat to the CM while seeking the release of jailed politician Mukhtar Ansari. He had sent multiple messages on the WhatsApp number of UP112, police officials said.On June 12, two brothers from Gonda district were arrested for sending messages on the WhatsApp number of UP112, threatening to blow up the chief minister’s residence and 50 other places in the state. On May 21, a similar message threatening to target the CM was sent on the WhatsApp number of UP112. A Mumbai resident, Kamran Ameen Khan, was arrested in this connection on May 23.

Brar was gunned down in his Toyota Fortuner SUV outside Playboy Nightclub at City Emporium Mall. Soon after, rival gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group took responsibility for the killing and announced on social media that it was done to avenge the murder of its member Lavi Deora. The Bishnoi gang had killed Deora at a fair in Faridkot’s Kotkapura on July 15, 2017, in which Brar had reportedly played an active role. Brar was booked for outraging the modesty and threatening a group of women outside another nightclub on September 27. Police failed to arrest him though he had been moving freely in the area and the assailants were aware of his movement. Besides Brar, his accomplice, Mohit, and another woman had been booked for misbehaving with the women outside Para nightclub in Industrial Area Phase 1. A 30-year old woman from Panipat district had lodged a complaint with the police that she had been slapped and threatened along with her sister and friends.

This decision will increase the cost of the project by at least Rs 4,000 crore and this cost escalation is assessed by the committee appointed by this Government,” Fadnavis tweeted.These remarks come after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that the State government has withdrawn cases registered against people who were protesting against the proposed metro car shed in Aarey.He said the proposed car shed has been shifted from Aarey to Kanjurmarg.“We have withdrawn cases registered against people who were protesting against the proposed metro car shed in Aarey. The proposed car shed has been shifted from Aarey to Kanjurmarg,” Thackeray said in a virtual address on Sunday.Responding to chief minister Thackeray’s announcement, Fadnavis said, “This means that the Metro project, which would have been in the service of Mumbaikars just next year, has now been postponed indefinitely. Rs 400 crore was already spent for Aarey car shed, Rs 1,300 crore wasted due to staying of the project and additional cost escalation of Rs 4,000 crore.”Also Read| Aarey shed moved, no extra cost: Govt“Rs 2,400 crore cost burden if in case the Kanjurmarg land dispute remains as it was.

If there is any violation of the rules, the organisers of the Ramlila will be booked under the Disaster Management Act. Many organisations don’t have the manpower to keep a check on the crowds,” said Gaur.‘Permission unlikely to come before Oct 15’“We have been told that permissions are unlikely to come before October 15, the first day of the Ramlila. With no time to rehearse, associations will not perform this year,” added Gaur.Ashok Chaudhary, adviser of the Joint Ram Leela Sangh, who plays the character of Ravana, said the Sector-20 Ramlila were set to perform. “We are already planning on organising the stage and the seating area in such a way that rules can be followed. If we are able to get permissions by October 15, we should be able to perform.”Senior assistant director of the Shree Ramleela Committee, Parade Ground, Sector 17, Sunil Sharma, said their association was sitting on the fence: “The delay in permissions will make things difficult for us as we still have to book the venue, the lights and tents. Even those who wish to perform might not be able to because of this delay,” he said.The Sector-29 Sanskritic Manch is one of the Ramlila associations that have finally decided not to perform. General secretary Rajiv Sharma said, “Since there is no clarity on rules and permissions, it would be hard to ensure social distancing, so we have decided to sit it out this year.”‘Permission will be granted if safety criteria fulfilled’DC Mandip Singh Brar said, “The Ramlila associations have been asked to give details regarding the additional steps they will take to ensure social distancing.” Permissions will be granted once the safety criteria were fulfilled, he added.The final decision on organising Ramlila and Dussehra functions in the city will be taken in the war room meeting with the UT administrator in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-shadow-permission-delays-force-ramlila-bodies-in-chandigarh-to-call-it-quits-this-year/story-K1zUmZIjn5SIQdj4IlXjyO.html

12-10-2020||City||Mohali Industrial Area is now ‘a no man’s land’||The maintenance of the Industrial Area Phases 8A and 8B that began a year ago has been caught up in a bureaucratic maze yet again.The condition of the area, which has around 800 industrial units, has gone from bad to worse with damaged roads and poor upkeep. This, despite the fact that MC collects a property tax of around ₹16 crore, but has so far only released ₹1 crore for development work. For the last two decades, the area was under Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC), but last year, its maintenance was handed over to the civic body. At present, however, neither PSIEC nor the MC are maintaining the area.PSIEC chief engineer Ramtesh Singh Bains said, “We are in the final stages of transferring the maintenance work of industrial areas to the municipal corporation, as they are collecting the property tax each year. We have to pay them around ₹2 crore and hopefully, it will be done in a week’s time. The delay was due to the pandemic.”Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar said, “I fail to understand why they have not transferred the work, when we have already given them the consent.”Though PSIEC has already undertaken patchwork of roads, laying of paver blocks and building of boundary walls at a cost of ₹1.83 crore, it will now deposit the balance of ₹2.2 crore with the MC for work on water supply, sewerage, storm, drainage and waste disposal.Issues galoreYogesh Sagar, president of Mohali Industries Association (MIA), said, “We have lodged several complaints regarding maintenance work, but authorities have not done anything. Streetlights are non-functional, drains are choked, and heaps of garbage dot the landscape, attracting stray dogs and cattle.”Vivek Kapoor, vice-president of MIA, said, “The authorities are testing our patience. We don’t even feel like going to our units because of all these issues. Even the central government scheme of depositing all funds under a special purpose vehicle to be used for improving infrastructure here remains on paper. The tragic part is that it has been almost two decades now and we are still asking for basic amenities.”Industry in Mohali began in 1978 with just 10 units, but today, it boasts 10,000 units, including the manufacturing and IT/service industries. These industrial units fall under three heads–Phases 1 to 4 are under the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA); Phases 7, 8A and 8B are under PSIEC; and Phase 9 Industrial Area falls under Punjab Infotech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-industrial-area-is-now-a-no-man-s-land/story-4TnirTigtF9LI4wHTV7qpM.html
12-10-2020||City||Several departments worked together since June to protect Aarey: Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray||State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said that several departments have been working jointly since June to protect Aarey as a forest. “We salute the efforts of all those who campaigned to save Aarey. Meticulous work has gone into ensuring a balance, where the city gets a metro corridor but not at the cost of the rich biodiversity that could have been lost at Aarey. On the one hand, we have ensured that all the charges were dropped against citizens protesting to save the trees, while on the other, 328.9 hectares (ha) of Aarey has been declared a reserved forest. No other city in the world has declared a forest within city limits especially for a metropolis like Mumbai. At the same time, protecting this green lung has an overall impact in improving Mumbai’s air quality. We must learn to live in harmony with nature,” he said. The minister added that the land for the new depot at Kanjurmarg was availed free of cost. “The 102-acre land was handed over free [to the authorities concerned for the car shed] and the soil testing has already begun. It was always the state government’s land. The existing money spent on Metro-3 line till Aarey will not get wasted, as the corridor will come out of a tunnel and climb and merge with Metro-6. Metro-3 and 6 will have same technical specifications. The metro rail headway time also does not change. Metro-3 would get more footfalls as it will get connected directly to the eastern suburbs,” said Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/several-departments-worked-together-since-june-to-protect-aarey-maharashtra-environment-minister-aaditya-thackeray/story-oPl6URw1h75c12HvFFzabM.html
12-10-2020||City||Citizens, activists welcome decision to shift Mumbai Metro-3 car shed from Aarey||Citizens and activists hailed the state’s move to shift the Metro car shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg, ending one of the longest urban forest protection battles on Sunday. “It is a game changer for the climate change narrative for Mumbai, and building a reinvented perspective towards conserving the city’s green spaces. Territorial areas in Mumbai have not seen reserved forest declaration in almost 60 years. It is remarkable,” said Pankaj Joshi, conservation architect. Wildlife biologist Anand Pendharkhar said, “The decision goes to show that if managing politicians have the intention, even a badly designed infrastructure project can be changed to safeguard local ecosystems and could be sent back to the drafting tables.” Since November 2014, Aarey Milk Colony, Goregaon had been a bone of contention ever since proposals to build a car-shed across 33-ha for the Metro 3 line (Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ) were proposed by the state. What started out with just one notice stuck on a few trees alerting citizens about felling 2,298 trees gathering local protests, the years that followed saw agitations multiply to mammoth proportions and even arrests. Citizens and environmentalists were at loggerheads with the state before the National Green Tribunal, Bombay high court (HC) and the Supreme Court (SC), all opposing the car-shed construction while demanding overall protection of Aarey as a forest, claiming it was one of the last green lungs in Mumbai and home to a large biodiversity of flora and fauna. “The idea of protecting Aarey completely and pushing out the car shed is a good and necessary move to protect Mumbaiites from increasing air pollution,” said Rajendra Shinde, botanist and principal of St Xavier’s College. Amrita Bhattacharjee from Aarey Conservation Group, said, “As the final decision has come, there is an immediate need to restore the degraded car-shed plot at Aarey.” Over six years, recurrent petitions before courts were dismissed, numerous protests and human chains were witnessed as state and central committees deliberated on alternate sites for the car-shed. A 2015 technical committee that suggested it would not be suitable for constructing the car depot in light of ecological damage at Aarey and had proposed the 41-ha Kanjurmarg plot for the depot. “Despite Sunday’s decision, the felling of trees at the Aarey plot that happened in 2019 will remain a serious loss to Mumbai’s environment,” said one of panel members requesting anonymity. The Aarey movement saw campaigns by artists, musicians, tribals, lawyers, children, youth, senior citizens, researchers, ecologists, architects, planners, all proposing the declaration of Aarey as a forest. “There were people who had gone on indefinite fasts for Aarey trees to be protected. Mumbaiites really understood what a forest, flood plains, and biodiversity was all about only after joining this movement,” said Biju Augustine, Aarey resident. On October 4, 2019, as the HC dismissed petitions challenging tree felling at Aarey then state bodies began felling trees amid huge protests from citizens. Twenty-nine activists were arrested and charged under sections of the Indian Penal Code after clashes with police. The charges were dropped after directions from Thackeray and the charge sheets were rendered null and void recently by the state. “This is a very happy day for us as our efforts have not gone in vain,” said Ashish Patil, the first person to be arrested among the protestors. According to the CM’s announcement on Sunday, the state intends to club the car-shed site for the Metro 6 and 3 project by merging Metro lines for smoother connectivity from the eastern suburbs to south Mumbai. Though the Aarey station too has been deleted, an existing ramp area is expected to still be in Aarey to connect the underground Metro-3 line to the overhead Metro-6 project. “Citizens will get the priceless benefit of better metro connectivity. The state will benefit from lifelong cost savings from merging depots, and Mumbaiites will forever benefit from the protection of Aarey as a forest. It is a win-win for everyone,” said Zoru Bhathena, activist and one of the petitioners before the SC. Some academicians said there were many unanswered questions about why only one-fourth of Aarey had been selectively declared as forest, the impact of that on the local tribal residents, and plans to protect the remaining three-fourth of the green lung was still unclear. “Aarey as a whole is an important catchment area of the Mithi and Oshiwara river systems, any large project there will have serious downstream impacts. But it also provides livelihoods and shelter to communities who live there. The rights of inhabitants as well as the ecology need to be safeguarded,” said Hussain Indorewala A qualitative study using maps had shown how Aarey had lost its green cover periodically since the late 1940s, and that proposed projects would lead to an overall proposed loss of 40% of Aarey, according to a study by Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture and Environmental Studies (KRVIA), Mumbai. These developments were likely to sever the contiguity with SGNP affecting wildlife movement, disrupting hydrological processes and the natural drainage pattern of the green lung, the report said. Aarey is home to 48 species of reptiles, 12 amphibians, 77 bird species, six species of venomous snakes, leopards, deer, rusty-spotted, jungle and civet cats, and even a rare snake-like amphibian caecilian among other wildlife. There have been six new discoveries and five rediscoveries of spiders, scorpions and geckos over 10 years. “These discoveries at Aarey have not happened randomly. It is a natural process which has taken millions of years for the coming up of this forest,” said noted herpetologist Varad Giri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/citizens-activists-welcome-decision-to-shift-mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-from-aarey/story-id9ktsegI451j8ikjrikeM.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro-3 car shed: Petitioners in case welcome Maharashtra government’s decision but say fight to go on until entire Aarey is declared forest||Petitioners who were distressed by the Bombay high court’s (HC) refusal to stay the felling of trees at Aarey last year have hailed chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray’s decision of not only shifting the Metro car shed to Kanjurmarg, but also declaring Aarey a forest, which was one their demands. The CM said that around 800 acres of Aarey has been declared a forest. Environmentalist Zoru Bhathena, who is one of the petitioners in the case, said that though the demand to relocate the car shed has been accepted by the state, their fight will go on until the entire 2,500 acres of Aarey is declared a forest. Soon after the CM made the announcement over the car shed, Bhathena said, “We are delighted that the government has finally accepted each and every proposal put up by citizens. This is indeed a victory for Mumbaiites.” Referring to HC’s refusal to stay the felling of 2,200 trees last year for the car shed at Aarey, Bhathena said, “Constitutional courts that are obliged to uphold the protection of environment have sadly, time and again, let Mumbai down. Let us hope Aarey shows the light ahead for our courts too.” Bhathena added that both his petitions – seeking the shifting of the car shed to Kanjurmarg and restraining the filling up of the flood plains at Aarey – had succeeded in light of the announcement by the CM. Environmentalist Kunal Birwadkar, who had filed an intervention application with regards to trees being transplanted for the Metro project, said that the hue and cry about the loss of large funds by the shifting of the car shed was baseless. “A 2004 order of the Supreme Court has categorically stated that ‘protection of environment would have precedence over the economic interest,’ when a decision has to be taken between development and environment,” said Birwadkar, citing the Apex court order. However advocate Zaman Ali, who along with senior advocate Gayatri Singh appeared in the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by non-governmental organisation (NGO) Vanashakti said that though the announcement by the CM was a victory for those concerned with safeguarding the environment, the PIL would still remain pending in the HC as the larger issue of declaring the entire 2,500 acres of Aarey as forest was pending. In all four petitions had been filed in HC on the car shed issue, which sought a stay on the felling of trees as well as declaring the entire area a forest. On October 4, 2019, the HC bench of chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog and justice Bharati Dangre had dismissed all the petitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/petitioners-welcome-maharashtra-government-s-decision-to-shift-mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-from-aarey/story-8NTKRw59cp1s79m429MMuN.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro 3 project: Realigned priorities, but at what cost?||Sunday’s announcement by the Maharashtra chief minister (CM) to relocate the car shed of the upcoming Metro-3 line from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg has evoked mixed responses. While many see this as an environmental victory, there are others who view it as a pure economic blunder. As in any other case, each incident can be and should be, viewed from various facets before we condemn or praise it. The impact of this decision to shift the car shed to Kanjurmarg along with the Metro-6 car shed will have multiple ramifications. Such major alignment changes are unacceptable even during the final planning stages, leave alone when the project is nearing completion. The Union cabinet had granted clearance to Metro-3 line on June 27, 2013, and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) presented its plan for the corridor to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on February 13, 2014. After the technicalities were resolved, the project execution began around 2015. Earlier this year, 80% of the entire tunnelling work and 57% of the overall works were completed. Till the Covid-19 lockdown halted its progress, Mumbai Metro-3 project was cruising at a speed that is usually unheard of in such huge infrastructural government projects. While the lockdown has impacted the timelines of all ongoing global projects, Metro-3 car shed’s controversy added to the delays. The Aarey car shed was soon becoming a bitter pill, which the government had to take sooner or later. By the time work was halted last year in November at Aarey, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRC) had spent over ₹100 crore on the car shed. Also, it was incurring a daily loss of ₹4.3 crore, of which the loan interest component alone was ₹1.5 crore. Given the above backdrop, how fair is the decision to shift the Metro-3 car shed to Kanjurmarg from Aarey Colony? In his announcement on Sunday, the honourable CM said: “The land will be available at a zero rate. The building which has come up at Aarey forest will be utilised for some other public purpose. About ₹100-crore expenditure was incurred for the purpose and it won’t go waste.” If the government is serious about its ‘environment-friendly’ image, the whole area should have been reconverted into a forest as it was before the trees were hacked down on October 7, 2019. The announcement doesn’t reveal any details about how the decision would affect the mega public transportation Metro-3 project, either cost-wise or time-wise, or even in terms of technical feasibility. The cost of such an extension and delay in terms of money is one of the direct implications that we need to understand from this decision. The approximate 9-kilometre (km) extension will have huge cost over-runs for this project. This 32.5-km project started with an estimate of ₹23,136 crore and was revised in last year in March to ₹30,000 crore. Sunday’s announcement talked about the “zero rate land” but didn’t mention anything regarding the revised cost estimation of the project due to the change in car shed alignment. Also, the statement is highly misleading, as there is no such thing as ‘zero rate land’ in any classical or neo-classical economics. And especially in terms of Mumbai, how can there be any piece of land which comes for free? The increase in the timeline for which the government has to bear the burden of interest on the loan taken for this project should also be considered before considering “zero rate land”. Also, one fails to understand as to what good use can you put a ₹100-crore infrastructure, specifically designed to serve the purpose of a metro rail terminal, so that the money “won’t go waste”. Another major direct impact of this decision is that it will further push the deadline of this project by several months. This extension can be translated in terms of prolonged troubles for the commuters. The tagline of Metro-3 is Connecting the unconnected. The irony is that this decision will ensure that they stay unconnected a bit longer. The opportunity cost of not getting Metro-3 implemented will be huge and should be worked out by economists. Commuters in Metro-3 (Colaba-Seepz) zone heavily depend on private vehicles and this decision would force them to continue doing so for some more time. The environment benefit of public transportation over private vehicles needs no evidence, and the lost opportunity cost in terms of environmental benefits should also be calculated by environmentalists. Metro-6 line, with which this line plans to merge, has barely completed 20% work and hasn’t even finished the phase of soil investigation yet. Already, there have been objections raised on the technical feasibility of Metro-6 line, and the merger of Metro-3 line with it will further implicate the completion of the Metro-3 project. The economic and environmental trade-offs are done and have to evaluated on a case-to-case basis. One fine example of such a trade-off can be the coastal road, which raises far more serious environmental concerns than one small car-shed at Aarey. In my view, the alternative arrangements to mitigate the environmental impact of Aarey car shed should have been explored, instead of an alternative site. To conclude, I would say that Sunday’s announcement would spell disaster for the already over-burdened public transportation system in the city. The need for a robust public transportation alternative to the highly over-burdened suburban system will take a backseat due to this decision.

12-10-2020||Mumbai||Metro-3 car shed: Current government in Maharashtra has shown sustainable development can be achieved||It has rained after many years on a parched, drought-hit land. The land is happy, the farmer is grateful. Nature plays its music again. That’s what happened to the #SaveAarey cause today! We had always maintained that Aarey is a forest. The proof was always there as all ecological indicators of this green lung pointed to it. Instead, the previous government chose to rely on documents which did not have any connection with ground reality to deny the status of a forest to Aarey – an area contiguous to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) – with over five lakh trees, grasslands, three lakes, two rivers, marshlands and wildlife in it. With its thriving leopard population of at least eight resident leopards and a host of other wildlife – some of which is endemic – it is nothing short of a biodiversity heaven. The five lakh trees, thanklessly for decades if not centuries, have kept delivering ecological services such as lower temperatures, cleaner air, recreation and educational value and providing a wildlife habitat. Forests are frontline defenders in the battle against global warming. A city like Mumbai grappling with air pollution needs its trees and forests to keep the city liveable. Aarey forests are huge carbon sinks that contribute in keeping air pollution and global warming under check. Aarey is a place for social bonding, a heaven for children deprived of natural spaces. The fertile lands cultivated by the indigenous forest dwellers provide sustenance and food security to the underprivileged. Ecosystems evolve over decades and are closely interlinked. Forests are not only about trees. Planting saplings elsewhere can never compensate for loss of ecology in another area. The hollow claim of 25,000 saplings being planted in SGNP – where actually less than 4,000 saplings were seen (most of them dead) – could never cover up for the loss of Aarey’s natural forests. Mumbai is chaotic and bustling, yet blessed with green areas like Aarey. To sacrifice a forest to construct a polluting industry is not something that can be passed off. Citizens had researched and given at least eight other options that were less damaging. Let us take Kanjurmarg as an example. The land is barren since the past 15 years and is rapidly getting encroached by slums. The land belongs to the Maharashtra government, and is free from all encumbrances. It does not have a single tree on it. The grass on the land is cultivated illegally by diverting sewage water onto it. Directions by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to stop this activity have gone unheeded. Before the land becomes another sprawling slum, it should be put to use for a larger public cause. We have often heard the word ‘sustainable development’ being used at all forums along with the word ecosystem, without the speakers understanding its true meaning. When you destroy without a conscience for projects that don’t need the ecological lamb to be sacrificed despite having the option to save it, it cannot be called sustainable development. Mercifully, Aarey has escaped annihilation. The fateful night of October 4, 2019, when 300 trees were chopped down in the dead of the night saw despair, disgust and anger in people’s minds. People courted arrest, hugged the trees and stormed the site. It shook the nation’s conscience and instilled a sense of responsibility in youth. Students from Noida went to the house of the then Chief Justice of India, and got the matter heard on a Dussehra day. It deserves a special mention. The sacrifice of the 300 trees has not gone in vain. We are so used to criticising governments for destruction of nature but rarely in a lifetime do we get to thank a government for protection of nature. The decision by the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray, is one that is filled with compassion for nature, coupled with economic wisdom. Instead of 80 hectare (ha) land used for two car sheds (actually it is 100ha or more considering that Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd was given 66ha when they demanded only 30ha), now only 40ha will be used for both the Metro lines 6 and 3. This has resulted in a net saving of over 60ha land. I leave it to the imagination of the people to put a value or cost on 60ha of land in Mumbai and then decide if the decision was a wise one or not. Further, by extending the utility of the route, by incorporating east-west connectivity, it is a logistical masterstroke. Mumbai for long had been blackmailed that it could have either the Metro or Aarey. The present government has shown that sustainable development can be achieved. So let Mumbai savour the moment. On this historical day, let the celebration of nature continue in the hearts and minds of all nature lovers. Take a bow, all the warriors who participated in this ‘satyagraha’ as described by the CM today. Cheers!

12-10-2020||City||Punjab buys power from national grid as thermal plants run at minimal capacity due to coal crisis||The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is banking on electricity purchase from the national grid with the thermal plants in the state running at a minimal capacity due to a severe coal shortage in the wake of the farmers’ ongoing rail roko agitation. Of a total demand of 8,200 megawatt (MW) on Sunday morning, the state bought 6,700 megawatt (MW) electricity from the national grid, the highest ever till date. Against an installed thermal power capacity of 5,200 MW, the state plants are generating 1,100 MW power due to shortage of coal. “We are facing a crisis as the state got no coal supply for the last 20 days. We are managing the situation by purchasing power from the national grid. The chief minister has appealed to the protesting farmers and I hope that they will allow the passage of coal rakes for power generation,” said director (distribution) DS Grewal. “Usually, we sell electricity in October or transfer power to the electricity banks with other states. For the past one week, apart from borrowing power from other states’ banks, we are making a daily purchase 600-800 MW power at around Rs 3 per unit,” said Grewal. It would be difficult to meet the demand in the next few days if the situation does not improve as Punjab has the permission to get maximum 6,500 MW from outside, as an overload may result in a breakdown, he said. “The state has to generate power to meet the balance from the central pool to meet the grid norms. The power generation at hydel power plants has also been increased to meet the demand. The power demand is likely to decrease in the next few days but it would go up in the third week of October when the festival season will kickstart,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-buys-power-from-national-grid-as-thermal-plants-run-at-minimal-capacity-due-to-coal-crisis/story-c57jR5gLRB7gnahjhJKRvK.html

This comes amid speculations on the gurdwara body polls in the wake of the appointment of chief commissioner for the same. SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal was also present in the meeting. Sukhbir, who was accompanied by his wife and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and children, met the jathedar after attended a bhog (concluding) ceremony of akhand path organised by the family and paying obeisance at the shrine. The SAD chief, jathedar and Longowal remained in the Akal Takht secretariat for nearly half an hour. Later, during an interaction with mediapersons, Sukhbir said, “The SAD is ready for the elections whenever these are conducted. I welcome the appointment of Justice SS Saron as chief commissioner. The Sikh community elects the SGPC house. The SAD has been tasked with this for the last 100 years. Again, we will reach out to the sangat to garner their support. Other groups also have the right to be part of this democratic exercise.” Also, an attempt by members of some Sikh bodies to show Sukhbir and Longowal black flags on the issue of missing saroops of Guru Granth Sahib was foiled. The protesters carrying black flags and placards stood at the Golden Temple entrance but the two exited from another gate. The SAD president took a jibe at its erstwhile alliance partner, BJP, over an announcement that the saffron party will contest the 2022 Punjab assembly elections on its own and will come power as well. “They are having this dream for long. Let them continue having it,” he said. Slamming Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh over the new farm laws, he said, “He should go to Delhi to convey all the concerns to the Central government and persuade it to revoke these legislations. But he does not step out of his farmhouse. I fail to understand why he is running away from his duty to protect the interests of the people of Punjab?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sukhbir-meets-akal-takht-jathedar-over-sgpc-polls-takes-jibe-at-bjp/story-wHx7ErK4PZLTVafbU0zBnI.html
12-10-2020||City||Mumbai Metro-3 car shed: Maharashtra government shifts its ground, set for rough path||The Uddhav Thackeray led-Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) decision to shift Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car depot from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg may be a political win, but it comes with new challenges and financial burden.The 33.5-km underground corridor will now go back to the drawing board, as the line will have to be extended from Seepz to Kanjurmarg by about seven-eight km, officials said. Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, urban development department, said, “It will be an extension from Seepz, but the authorities will work out the technicalities. The Kanjurmarg land has been allocated to the metropolitan authority.” Another official, who did not wish to be named, said an area of around 43 hectares, free of any litigation, was transferred by the state’s revenue department to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in the first week of October. “Around 18 hectares will be used for the Metro-6 depot and around 25 hectares for the Metro-3 depot. Both lines will be integrated after Seepz. It is a huge area in Kanjurmarg which gives scope for expansion in the future also,” the official said. “After Seepz, Metro-3 will also be elevated and be integrated with line 6, till Kanjurmarg, but a detailed project report (DPR) will be done for Metro-3 extension,” the official added. While Thackeray said the land will not come at any additional cost as it is owned by the state, the laying of additional track as well as cost overruns for the project will be substantial. Consider this. On an average, cost of laying per km of elevate rail track, as is being considered by planners for the extension, is around ₹200-250 crore per km. The construction of the depot is expected to take around two years, so the deadline for the phase 1 for the corridor (Aarey-Bandra-Kurla Complex), initially slated to be 2021, is likely to get pushed to 2023. A 2017 estimate by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is executing Metro-3, had said per day delay costs around ₹4.2 crore. Back of the paper calculations show the time delay will cost the exchequer an additional ₹3,066 crore. MMRC will also have to seek approvals from the Centre and Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the extension. While the Centre holds a stake in MMRC, JICA is funding the entire project worth ₹32,000 crore. Nitin Killawala, an architect who has been demanding underground Metro corridors in the city, had also submitted a plan to the government in 2019 to scrap Metro-6, and instead extend line 3. “The state must consider our plan on Metro-6 too as it is only going to worsen the traffic situation in JVLR. If Metro-3 is extended till Kanjurmarg, it will benefit people from the eastern suburbs and Thane anyway,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-maharashtra-government-shifts-its-ground-set-for-rough-path/story-gCq7Yn9N9lNdVAk0gU3CSI.html

The jeweller (35), who hanged himself from a ceiling fan in a hotel room at Mehta Road in Amritsar city, had left a suicide note blaming Sandeep Kaur, a Punjab Police sub-inspector (SI), for driving him to taking the extreme step.The jeweller claimed in the suicide note that he was being blackmailed and threatened by the SI, also a resident of Navan Pind and posted at the Mehta police station. His suicide note read, “Sandeep had taken Rs 17-18 lakh from me and was demanding more. She threatened to kill me through her friends if I failed to pay the money. There are screenshots of messages in my phone that will make it clear that she was pressurising me to kill Baljit Singh, her former friend. She also tried to pressurise me to kill one Navdeep Sandhu and his wife. Navdeep was living with Mandeep by promising to marry her.” The jeweller’s father said justice would be done only if the SI, who was booked under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of Indian Penal Code, was hanged to death.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gurjinder Singh, investigating officer in the case, said the accused SI was at large and they are searching for her. Proceedings have been initiated under Section 174 of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CrPC) at the Jandiala police station over the death of the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wife-commits-suicide-a-day-after-amritsar-jeweller-ends-life-over-blackmail-by-woman-si/story-GaFF9Z7TnZCAAXM7qj5qiO.html

The accused had also circulated the video clip of the crime among the residents of the child’s housing society. According to the 13-year-old survivor, the accused lives near her house. Last year in October, he took the girl to his house and sexually assaulted her. However, she did not reveal the incident to anyone. A few days ago, the girl discovered that the accused had recorded the crime and circulated the video clip among her society members. She then revealed the incident to her parents and approached the police.The accused has been booked under sections 376 (3) [commits rape on a woman under sixteen years], 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the Indian Penal Code and section 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault), 8 (punishment for sexual assault) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.

12-10-2020||City||Mild sections invoked in FIR, book 2 more officials, says family of Bathinda girl infused HIV+ blood||The family of a seven-year-old thalassemia patient, who was infused HIV+ blood early this month, has taken exception to the police’s move of invoking ‘mild’ sections of the Indian Penal Code against an accused medical laboratory technologist.On Saturday night, the police registered a case against laboratory technologist Baldev Singh Romana under Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was lodged on the complaint of the Bathinda civil surgeon.In various instances across the country, these two sections were invoked against persons defying quarantine orders for containing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. If held guilty under Section 269 of the IPC, a person can get a maximum punishment of six months whereas a court can sentence a punishment of up to two years for conviction under 270 of the IPC. Also, a guilty may also face penalties in both cases.The girl’s father said as per the internal report, Romana had a strained relationship with colleagues at the blood bank and he allegedly let blood transfused to the seven-year-old to settle scores with coworkers on October 3. Citing two inquiry reports, he said infusing HIV+ blood to the child was done in a planned manner and thus it amounts to attempt to murder.“The fact-finding panel stated that Romana had called the HIV-infected person from his personal mobile phone on October 1, and two days later, the person donated blood that was issued my daughter. It was a deliberated and a planned attempt by Romana with an ulterior motive. Also, we demand case against two other blood bank officials, then in-charge of the blood bank at the Bathinda civil hospital and blood transfusion officer Dr Karishma Goyal and laboratory technician Richu Goyal,” he said.Chandigarh-based activist and high court lawyer HC Arora said, “The case is fit for trial under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC. If blood bank officials are found guilty of deliberately concealing HIV+ infection status from a donor and his blood was infused to two patients, the matter needs urgent attention. Also, by keeping a person in dark about his HIV+ status for five months, the department concerned deprived him of treatment for a prolonged period and put so lives at risk,” said Arora.Naujawan Welfare Society (NWS), a Bathinda NGO, extended support to fight a legal battle for the thalassemia patient and the 47-year-old blood donor. Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Bhupinderjit Singh Virk said legal opinion is being sought from experts in the case. “Case was registered against Romana on the basis of a complaint received from the civil surgeon. On the basis of investigation, we can invoke relevant sections of the IPC and include other persons involved in the crime,” said the SSP.Civil surgeon Amrik Singh Sandhu said his office is yet to get any communication on the status of Dr Karishma outsourced under the National Health Mission and a woman lab technologist working with the Punjab Health Systems Corporation.Health secretary Hussan Lal said both officials have been dismissed and the departments concerned are handling the cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mild-sections-invoked-in-fir-also-book-2-more-officials-says-family-of-girl-infused-hiv-blood/story-SshOWyDbfh4BlTaB9EVbJM.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Constable booked for raping, cheating interior designer from Mumbai||Pant Nagar police on Thursday registered a first information report (FIR) against a 42-year-old police constable for allegedly raping a Ghatkopar-based interior designer. Senior inspector Suhas Kamble from Pant Nagar police station said, “We have registered the offence and are investigating the matter. The accused has not been arrested yet.” The case was registered after the police received a written application that the accused had sexually assaulted the 40-year-old complainant on multiple occasions on the pretext of marrying her. A year ago, she delivered his child. It was then that the constable told her that he was already married. He also said he could not marry her because if he did, the police department would sack him for consummating two marriages. He then told her that he would divorce his wife and marry her, but didn’t do so, her complaint to the police stated. He also asked her not to disclose to anyone that the child is his and that it was a test tube baby. The woman then approached the police. The constable also holds a post in Brihanmumbai Police Karmchari Pagardar Sahakari Patsanstha. In her statement, the complainant said she met the accused in 1998 while working at a private company in Andheri. Over time their friendship turned into love and he promised her that he would marry her. “He also introduced her to two developers and asked her to undertake their interior decoration work. The accused used her expertise as a designer and earned money but didn’t pay her anything,” stated the complaint. Her statement further alleged that the accused took money from her multiple times on various pretexts and owed her around Rs87 lakh. The accused has been booked under sections 376 (rape), 420 (cheating), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/constable-booked-for-raping-cheating-interior-designer-from-mumbai/story-EjYus0AXTZbZwUKu52ZZRO.html

Addressing his ‘Sunday Samvaad’ programme, the minister said: “Maharashtra (42.5%), Chandigarh (47.8%) and Delhi (75.4%) are worst performers in Covid-19 grant utilisation.” In the first phase, the Government of India has released ₹3,000 crore to all states and UTs to battle the pandemic, he said. With the country gearing up for festive season, the minister cautioned that the fight against Covid-19 was not over and “we need to unite and follow all precautions”. UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “States spend money on reimbursing private hospitals and ambulances, publicity campaigns, setting up temporary hospitals and purchasing extra medical equipment. We did not require these things, as we already have adequate infrastructure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chandigarh-among-worst-performers-in-using-covid-grant/story-SsNoYu9p2x8Pz3nwp8P2pK.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||20 held for travelling in Mumbai local trains with fake IDs||40-year-old man was arrested by the Mumbai Central Government Railway Police (GRP) on Saturday for allegedly travelling with a fake identity (ID) card. According to GRP officers, this is the fifth such arrest in October where an employee of a private office has been caught travelling with a fake ID card. From June to October 10, GRP has arrested more than 20 people for travelling with fake IDs. In this recent case, the accused Deepak Pandhrinath Khedekar, a resident of Jogeshwari, was caught at Mumbai Central railway station. Shailendra Dhivar, senior inspector of Mumbai Central GRP said that Khedekar, an employee of a private security agency, was caught by the ticket checker at Churchgate railway station. Dhivar said that Khedekar was arrested and booked under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Khedekar. At present, only emergency and essential service employees along with those working at banks and some other Union government bodies like MbPT and dabbawalas are allowed to travel in local trains during the period of the lockdown. When Khedekar was asked for his ID card, he showed one with the seal of the station master’s office and QR code along with a fake signature. Police are now investigating from where Khedekar obtained the fake ID card. “We are also investigating to find out whether there is a bigger nexus or gang involved in making fake ID cards,” said Dhivar. In a drive to curb unauthorised commuters on local trains, the commercial department of Western Railway (WR) nabbed a man last Wednesday. Andheri government railway police (GRP) too, arrested a woman for using a fake identity card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/20-held-for-travelling-in-mumbai-local-trains-with-fake-ids/story-MRtwdELQDAC6JtEJmrqXCK.html

As per the directions under the circular, schools have to participate in the ‘clean hands for all’ initiative between October 12 and 17. “Under the initiative, students need to be told about the importance of washing hands especially in the current context of the ongoing pandemic. Schools should demonstrate the right way of washing hands and encourage students to raise awareness about the same in their respective localities,” states the circular issued by the BMC education department. October 15 is observed as the Global Handwashing Day. “As part of the initiative, students can be asked to make short videos demonstrating the right ways of washing their hands. Schools that are able to create the best campaigns will be rewarded by the civic body. “While the event is held every year, this year it is more significant because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

12-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body shuts 55% units for asymptomatic patients||In the past two months, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has temporarily shut, or what they called deactivated, 55% of the quarantine centres meant for asymptomatic Covid-19 positive (CCC2) patients in Mumbai. By the end of July, the city had 61 such quarantine centres; the number has now dropped to 27. These 27 centres have a bed capacity of 3,444, of which 52% or 1,637 beds are currently occupied. Currently, 57 of the 335 Covid care centres (CCC1) meant to quarantine high-risk contacts of positive patients are active, with a bed capacity of 19,865, while 278 such facilities with a bed capacity of 26,812 have been put on reserve. This comes as more Mumbaiites, who are asymptomatic positive, or who are high-risk contacts of positive patients, are in home quarantine. BMC in May decided to allow asymptomatic positive patients to quarantine at home, as long as the home has a separate toilet and separate room. In slums, BMC moves up to 13 high-risk contacts per positive patient to institutional quarantine facilities. The trend of the spread of infection has been moving from slums to more residents of high-rise buildings, as Mumbai is opening up. Mumbai on Sunday recorded 2,170 new cases and 42 deaths due to Covid-19, taking the total number of cases to 229,446 and toll to 9,433. The number of active cases in the city is presently 25,768. While 59% of the total active cases are asymptomatic, 34% are symptomatic, and 6% are critical. As per data available as of October 10, BMC has shifted 156,554 high-risk contacts to quarantine facilities, and 517,010 high-risk contacts have been home quarantined. A senior civic official from the health department said, “Even though we have shut these facilities, they can be reactivated and used any time. Right now, we don’t need so many institutional quarantine facilities. We have enough beds now. As the virus has moved to non-slum population, we don’t need as many facilities.” BMC has partly attributed it to the increase in the number of beds in jumbo facilities at seven places across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-shuts-55-units-for-asymptomatic-patients/story-O3J7a2ZIiC8W7E4CT5fexN.html

The suspects — who are yet to be identified — asked the victim to submit a total of around Rs 6 lakh in various bank accounts over a period of six months, the complaint registered at Cyber police stations says. The victim was assured that the money will be refunded after a minimal deduction of one percent, said police. According to the police, they received a complaint from the daughter of the woman from Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh, who has worked in a government school for over 35 years. The daughter received a call on January 30 from a man who introduced himself as an employee of the ministry of finance, who wanted to discuss something regarding the provident fund of the mother after retirement. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that the man asked her to pay Rs 7120 as file charges initially and later asked her to pay Rs 23,458 which were to be deposited in a given account number. “Between February 15 and July 20 the victim was asked to pay Rs 606,028 in different bank accounts. She was promised that 1 % of the amount will be deducted and rest will be refunded in her bank account after the verification process,” he said.

12-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG sets 24-hour deadline to fix all non-functional streetlights||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has set a 24-hour deadline for its concessionaire, Energy Efficiency Services Limited, to repair all non-functional LED streetlights in the city, failing which the concessionaire will be required to pay a daily fine of ₹50 per streetlight until fixed, said officials on Sunday.Earlier this month, the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) had passed an order to all 10 municipal corporations across the state to start fining their respective concessionaires, if they fail to fix streetlights within a 24-hour period. The order was passed after repeated complaints were filed on the ULB website and the Swachh Haryana mobile application, said Raman Yadav, executive engineer, electrical wing, MCG.“Adhering to the directions of the ULB, we have conveyed to our concessionaire the information regarding the 24-hour deadline as well as the subsequent penalty fee. Setting up of mechanism and other related work on meeting this target has already started. During the non-monsoon months, we receive around 20-22 complaints per day of streetlights malfunctioning. In the monsoon season, often due to disruption in power supply, the daily complaints rise to 50 to 60,” said Yadav.MCG officials said that currently, there are complaints of around 900 LED non-functional streetlights in the city.In August 2017, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the civic body for installing LED streetlights in Gurugram. As per the MoU, EESL was also given the task of maintaining streetlights in the city for a period of 10 years.Over the last three years, more than 78,000 LED streetlights have been installed across the city, said MCG officials.“We have a complaint handling system, through which we track complaints which go beyond 48 hours. If complaints exceed beyond the 48-hour period, we have an agreement with our concessionaires to impose penalties on our own. In the case of Gurugram, the local municipal corporation, as well as residents, are extremely vigilant due to which our pending complaints about non-functioning streetlights tend to remain below 1% against the total number of streetlights installed in the city,” said Venkatesh Dwivedi, director (projects), EESL.Dwivedi further said that usually, across the country, EESL has an agreement with the local civic body of ensuring that 95% of the streetlights are functional at any given point.“However, as per our MoU with the MCG, in Gurugram the rate is fixed at 97%. Thus, with the current number of LED streetlights in Gurugram, at any point, we have to ensure that the total number of non-functioning streetlights remain below 2,000. We have so far been able to ensure that the non-functioning streetlights percentage remains below 3%,” said Dwivedi.Dwivedi further said that EESL is working on setting up a more advanced monitoring system in Gurugram, on par with the smart city parameters, which will enable the local municipal corporation to monitor the functioning of streetlights on a real-time basis.“We are working on more advanced technical approaches to ensure that the turnout time is less than 24 hours. Even if a resident does not raise an issue, our control system should be able to detect the total number of non-functional streetlights in the city at any given point, so that, on the following morning, the maintenance team has prior information regarding the total number of streetlights that needs repair,” said Dwivedi.Since last year, EESL and MCG have been working on linking all LED streetlights in the city with the integrated control and command centre (ICCC) of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) for keeping real-time surveillance on their functioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mcg-sets-24-hour-deadline-to-fix-all-non-functional-streetlights/story-6BJK4cI7x4DYx8ztpObwCK.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||‘Delayed diagnosis of malaria, dengue as Covid-19 co-infection may lead to miscarriage’||Late diagnosis of Covid-19 infection with dengue and malaria in pregnant women can lead to health complications including miscarriage, revealed a study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRH), Parel in association with BYL Nair Hospital. Covid-19 infection shares similar symptoms with mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria. In both cases, patients develop symptoms like fever, nausea, vomiting, body ache among others, which often lead to confusion and misdiagnosis. Often when a pregnant woman gets diagnosed with Covid-19, doctors don’t test them for dengue and malaria, which delays the diagnosis of the co-infection.Taking such incidences into account, the researchers conducted a study on three pregnant women infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 infection. Two of them had co-infection of malaria while the third patient had dengue. The study, Co-infection of malaria and dengue in pregnant women with Sars-Cov-2, has been published in the International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics journal on Saturday.“Co-infections of malaria and dengue or any other monsoon-related illnesses with Sars-CoV-2 infection can be misdiagnosed as all have similar kinds of symptoms and presentations. So all symptomatic Covid-19 cases with fever should be investigated for other common Infections in endemic regions, both in the general population and in pregnant women, to avoid complications,” said Dr Rahul Gajbhiye, a scientist at ICMR-NIRRH and principal investigator of the study, in response to an email.During their study, they found a case of a pregnant woman who had tested positive for Covid-19. Later, when her condition didn’t improve, doctors tested her for malaria and to their surprise, she tested positive for the disease. However, it was too late and she soon started bleeding and suffered a miscarriage. The researchers believe that if she was diagnosed earlier with malaria, her baby could have been saved.“Co-infection could be the reason for miscarriage, as malaria is known to cause miscarriages. Along with co-infection, she was suffering from hypertension in pregnancy, which also could be responsible for the miscarriage,” said Dr Niraj Mahajan, associate professor at BYL Nair Hospital and another principal investigator of the study.As Covid-19 infection is spreading to rural parts of India, the researchers cautioned doctors to be more vigilant for early identification of co-infections such as malaria and dengue to control fatality rate among pregnant women.“Dengue or malaria requires a completely different clinical management protocol to that of Covid-19. Delay in diagnosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), renal failure, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) among others,” said Dr Smita Mahale, director, ICMR-NIRRH.Dr Ashok Anand, head of the department, obstetrics and gynaecology at Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, said, “As a precaution, it is necessary to test pregnant women with Covid-19 along with other seasonal ailments. With timely diagnosis and treatment, we can control the cases of miscarriages among co-infected mothers.”ICMR-NIRRH, in collaboration with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has started a registry of pregnant women with Covid-19 called PregCOVID (https://pregcovid.com/) as a response to Covid-19 pandemic. The study has been conducted by collecting the required data from the portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/delayed-diagnosis-of-malaria-dengue-as-covid-19-co-infection-may-lead-to-miscarriage/story-67WcTzcewILZ8QJc4cpz5N.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||Around 1 lakh people to be impacted by diesel genset ban, power utility estimates||The Dakshin Haryana Bijli Curran Nigam (DHBVN), has submitted a status report to the environment pollution (prevention and control) authority (Epca) regarding the pending power connections in the city and the number of group housing societies which shall be impacted if complete ban is imposed on the operation of diesel generators after October 15. As per the utility, 26 condominiums are dependent on gensets to a large extent while three group housing societies in new sectors are completely dependent on diesel gensets. DHBVN officials said that they have informed the EPCA that a large number of residents, who live in these societies, will be impacted if a complete ban is imposed on operation of diesel gensets. Around one lakh residents in new sectors, who live in these condominiums and don’t have regular electricity connections will be impacted by the ban, the power utility estimates. DHBVN officials also said that they are = identifying societies where temporary power connections, which were taken for construction purposes by developers, are now being used for residential purpose. The ban is part of Epca’s graded response acton plan (Grap) to prevent pollution in Delhi and NCR from reaching severe levels. However, use of generators for essential services — such as hospitals, railways, Metro stations, water treatment plants and sewage treatment plans — is allowed.As per the pollution department, there are around 10,000 generators operational in the city, both in residential and industrial sectors. Around 6,000 generators of more than 100 KWA capacity are used to augment power supply as backup for outages.Vinita Singh, chief engineer, Smart Grid, who also holds the additional charge of chief engineer, Delhi circle, said that they have submitted the status report to Epca. “We have apprised Epca that residents of around 26 condominiums partially and three completely will get impacted if complete ban is imposed,” said Singh. DHBVN officials also said that not taking regular connections was the failure on part of the developers, as they had not built the requisite infrastructure and also not met compliances set by power utility. “We are identifying societies where regular connections have not been taken by developers and people are consuming electricity on the basis of temporary connections. This is against rules and we will ensure that such connections are regularised,” said another senior official of DHBVN based, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The residents, meanwhile, said that the government should encash the security deposit submitted by developers and create the missing power Infrastructure including missing substations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/around-1-lakh-people-to-be-impacted-by-diesel-genset-ban-power-utility-estimates/story-gYbA5hmJxVBSveBPPjkhDL.html

Bijarnia said that his two close aides were arrested on Saturday night with a truck loaded with 204 kilograms of drugs packed in 10 plastic gunny bags. “The drugs were bought from Orissa and were to be supplied to one of the drug peddlers, who used to sell the drugs in different areas and used to share profit with the suspects,” he said. According to the police, Dainy was allegedly involved in more than 100 criminal cases pertaining to organised ATM loot in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. He has been on the run for the last one year. “There are more than 100 gangs operating from Nuh that are actively involved in uprooting ATMs and cow smuggling. Teams have been formed to identify all the suspects involved. All the police records are being checked to get their details based on which raids are being conducted in their respective villages to arrest them,” said the SP.

12-10-2020||Gurugram||Economic survey resumes in the district after hiatus due to Covid-19 outbreak||The data collection for the 7th Economic Survey has resumed in the district after being put on hold for months due to Covid-19 pandemic, confirmed the district administration officials on Sunday. The survey, a nationwide data collection exercise that looks into various economic aspects of residential and commercial establishments across the country for devising public policies, started in August 2019 in the district.Officials said that nearly 95 percent of the data collection work under the census has been completed in Gurugram, while the remaining five percent would be completed in the next few months. The survey was last conducted in 2013.“The survey that has been pending for months due to Covid-19, will now be completed by 252 supervisors and 416 enumerators,” said Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner in his statement issued by the district administration. In August 2019, the field work for the survey started with nearly 2,500 enumerators and 400 supervisors.“The survey has to be completed in areas, such as Udyog Vihar, Sector 47 part 1 and 2, sectors 34, 52A, 53, 56, 57 and 49. Till now, 13,57, 371 residential establishments have been covered as a part of the survey. It includes 12,11,015 households in urban areas and nearly 1,46,356 in rural areas,” said Panwar.For the purpose of the survey, the establishments in the city have been divided into three categories – residential, commercial and others. In the residential category, the focus is on the source of income in a family, while the commercial category caters to questions, such as nature of the economic activity, number of employees, revenue collection, investment, turnover among others. This time, the survey is paperless, with details collected from the field being directly uploaded in the application created especially for the census.In all the four blocks of the district, the data has been collated from both urban and rural areas. The data available with the district administration shows that from urban parts of Gurugram falling under Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) nearly 11 lakh residential and commercial establishments have been covered, whereas only 4,316 establishments have been covered from rural areas.Likewise, in Sohna over 16,000 (rural) and 12,691 (urban) establishments have been covered, followed by Pataudi (25,186 rural establishments and 9,392 urban ones), Farrukhnagar (34,956 rural establishments and 5,306 urban ones). Additionally, more than 51,000 commercial establishments have been surveyed in Manesar. Other areas, such as Bhondsi, Garhi Harsaru, Hailey Mandi and Wazirabad, have also been covered by the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/economic-survey-resumes-in-the-district-after-hiatus-due-to-covid-19-outbreak/story-6bO0L2AVo0VSH6Lf8dpgbP.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||Portion of Ghamroj bundh excavated to create a rest area by NHAI||A portion of the Ghamroj bundh, which runs for about two kilometres along Sohna Road in Ghamroj village, has been excavated to make room for a ‘rest area’, being built as part of the National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) upcoming toll complex on NH 248A. While NHAI officials said that move has been made in compliance with required protocols, experts and activists warned that tampering with the structural integrity of the bundh — intended to arrest runoff from Aravalli hills which skirt around the village — may pose adverse consequences for flooding and may negatively affect the ground water recharge in the area.A visit to the location by an HT team on Sunday morning found that an estimated 500-metre section of the bundh, just ahead of the Mehendwara intersection on Sohna Road, has been demolished using earthmoving machines with the bundh having been entirely breached in one place. On the rear side of the bundh is a low-lying area where locals said small amounts of water sometimes collects during the rainy season. This depression, workers on site explained, will be reclaimed with earth in order to bring the ‘rest area’ slightly above the height of the carriageway. Construction work for the same is already underway at the site. Confirming these details, NHAI officials clarified that the decision to reclaim the bundh has been made after carrying out a drainage study of the area, in collaboration with the irrigation department. Vikas Mittal, technical manager, NHAI, said, “Members of the irrigation department as well as myself have carried out multiple site inspections during this past monsoon, and there is very little water which collects behind the bundh today. We are also building catch drains around the rest area, and will also install RCC pipes along the length of the bundh to channel any excess runoff, though we do not anticipate anyway.”However, Mittal also revealed that required permissions for the same are still being processed. “We received clearance from the forest department for diversion of forest land on the bundh in 2018, but that does not allow us to change the physical structure of the bundh. To do that, we require the irrigation department’s permission. Due to procedural delays, we have not received their official go ahead, but they have given us in principle approval and so the work has started.” He also added, “We will not be harming the function of the bundh in any way. The portion, which is being reclaimed lies at one end, the remaining length of the bundh will not be affected.”Activists, on the other hand, said the move is in contradiction of Sohna’s Master Plan 2031, which states that the bundh will be retained in its current state. An explanatory note issued in this regard by the town and country planning department on November 15, 2012), mentions, “Sohna Town is surrounded by Aravalli Ranges on eastern & western side. In the rainy season, run-off from these ranges passes through proposed urbanization through barsati Nallahs namely Mehandwara Nadi. Three bundhs namely Sohna bundh, Mohmmadpur bundh and Ghamroj bundh exist on the western side of the town to check the run-off and for recharging the underground water table. All the three existing bundhs and alignment of the tributaries of Mehandwara Nadi / Nallah have been retained as such in the Development Plan on the request of the Irrigation Department (sic).”Prem Mohan Gaur, a resident of Hajjipur village on Sohna-Palwal road, who frequents the area regularly, says he noticed the bundh being reclaimed almost three months ago. “Passing through the area in early October, I noticed that this entire section of the bundh has been removed. I am aware the removal of traditional bundhs in other parts of the district, like the one in Ghata village, which has resulted in excessive waterlogging in the area. I have written to the public information office of the NHAI and to the district administration on October 8. I am hoping they will look into the issue.”Experts, meanwhile, said that reclaiming traditional water harvesting structures is not advisable. Ranjana Chaudhuri, director, School of Regional Water Studies at TERI, said, “If they are building a rest house in a low-lying catchment area, it will definitely be prone to flooding. If not during a regular monsoon, then surely during extreme weather events like we witnessed earlier this year. Channelling the runoff through additional drains and RCC pipes will not help groundwater recharge.”A senior official, formerly of the forest department, said, “This sort of development sets a very bad precedent for groundwater recharge, which is the need of the hour. Moreover, one cannot puncture a bundh in one part and expect that it will remain effective. We will have to wait and see. Nevertheless, Gururgam and Faridabad have together lost close to 80 or 90 such bunds to development work in the past few decades. We need to seriously try and revive these structures instead of diverting them for to make way for more infrastructure and concretisation.”VS Lambha, district hydrologist, did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. However, data obtained from his office shows that the underlying water table in Sohna has dipped by 21 metres since 1974, when groundwater monitoring first commenced in Gurugram district. Currently at 25 metres below ground level, Sohna’s aquifers have lost an average of two metres of groundwater every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/portion-of-ghamroj-bundh-excavated-to-create-a-rest-area-by-nhai/story-EgQ3GHEWsz7Lq8gukpUt9L.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||255 Gurugram villagers get property cards under Swamitva scheme||At least 255 people from 11 villages in Gurugram have received property cards funder the Swamitva – survey of villages and mapping with improvised technology in village areas – scheme, which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi through video conferencing on Sunday.The Swamitva project is being implemented on a pilot basis in 763 villages across six states- Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttarakhand.Haryana is one of the six states selected by the Centre to run the pilot project that aims to demarcate the abadi (inhabited) land and provide ownership. At least 221 villages in the state are currently covered under the scheme, of which 11 are from Gurugram - Johlaka, Bilaka, Rahaka, Chuharpur, Tolni, Isaka, Ranika Singhola, Bhogpur, Khuntpuri and Khatrika. Over 536 beneficiaries have been identified in these villages to receive their property cards.The purpose of the property card is to reduce dispute over land ownership in villages by demarcating the abadi (inhabited) area in villages which are not mapped. Since the owner lacks proper legal document, these land parcels go missing from the revenue records. The scheme aims to update the ‘record-of-rights’ in the revenue registers. According to officials, this will help in increasing the property tax collection in panchayats and also help in identifying those public land which have been encroached upon.“Through mapping, the owner will get the valid legal property rights. With ownership, the person can use the land as a financial asset to take loans from the bank. Even the gram panchayat can also make better plans for development,” said Sushil Sarwan, director, state development and panchayati department. He added, “The survey and mapping of the land through drones has been completed in 11 villages of Gurugram, under which over 536 beneficiaries have been identified eligible for getting property cards. On Sunday, 255 received property cards in their respective villages, while the remaining 150 villagers will receive it on Monday.” The property holders were sent a soft copy of their property cards which they downloadedthrough an SMS link sent on their mobile phones.These villages are located in the Sohna block of the district. Out of the 255 beneficiaries, three people on Sunday received bank loan of Rs 5lakh on the same property.Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner said that survey and mapping work has been ongoing in Sohna village. “Of the 61 villages that are to be surveyed and mapped, work in 31 has been completed. The work in the remaining 29 villages will be completed soon. These are mostly rural areas as the survey team has covered the urban parts falling under the abadi land.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/255-gurugram-villagers-get-property-cards-under-swamitva-scheme/story-oQn9Beb8TaC5Q8ZKWiXGYO.html
12-10-2020||Gurugram||Bhondsi jail warden arrested for supplying drugs to inmates||The police on Saturday night arrested two men, including a jail warden, for allegedly supplying drugs to the inmates of Bhondsi Jail, said the police. According to the police, the suspects were identified as Ankit Kumar a drug peddler hailing from Dharuhera in Rewari and jail warder Prem Chand of Mahendragarh. The police said Chand was arrested from Bhondsi Jail crossing while receiving drugs from Kumar. The drugs included 110 grams of sulfa and 24 grams of smack packed in a packet. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that one of the inmates, identified as Deepak alias Deepu alias Churari of Rewari, who is lodged inside Bhondsi jail for over 10 cases of loot, drugs , assault and smuggling of mobile phones, was also part of this gang. “Deepu had contacted his brother, Dharambeer alias Mota of Rewari, via mobile from Bhondsi Jail to request for drugs through the jail warder. He had arranged for drugs to be sent to his brother through Ankit Kumar. However, the consignment was caught before the warder could enter the jail premises,” he said. Sangwan said the crime investigation unit (CIA) of DLF Phase-4 was keeping a close watch on the jail warder after the arrest of 53-year-old deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of Bhondsi Jail in July for allegedly smuggling drugs and supplying SIM cards to inmates over the last two years. A raiding party was prepared as soon as they received the information of the drug consignment.The police had recovered 240 grams of a narcotics substance (sulfa) and 11 SIM cards from his government accommodation in Bhondsi. “Chand was posted inside the jail premises 10 days ago. Earlier, he was posted in the surveillance room to monitor CCTV cameras but was transferred due to a change of staff to keep a close watch on inmates and their movements,” said Sangwan. The police said smuggling of drugs, mobile phones and SIM cards is increasing inside jail premises, and various means are being adapted for the purpose. The police said that inmates under the influence of drugs plan crimes and connect with their aides outside the jail to execute activities, such as extortion, murder, loot and dacoity. Sangwan said inmates contact their close aides outside the jail through mobile phones and are order drugs, for which they are coordinate with jail officials. “This practice is growing day by day. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, inmates are being produced to courts through video conferencing and are, therefore, unable to get drugs during their court visits.Further, visitors are also not allowed inside the jail premises any longer, forcing inmates to look for alternate means for their supply of drugs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bhondsi-jail-warden-arrested-for-supplying-drugs-to-inmates/story-Myv95WoQxkQFLDcHLFQ9SP.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||TRP fraud: 3 employees of Republic TV questioned by Mumbai Police||The Mumbai Police’s crime branch questioned three senior employees of Republic TV, namely CEO Vikas Khanchandani, COO Harsh Bhandari, at the Mumbai Police headquarters while the channel’s distribution head Ghanshyam Singh was questioned by another crime branch team in Nani Daman police station in connection with the TRP manipulation case. Khanchandani, Bhandari and Singh have been summoned again by crime branch for questioning on Monday. The police also served them notice under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPc) to come along with certain documents related to advertisement and modes of revenue generation. The summons were sent to Khanchandani and Bhandari on October 10. Khanchandani reached the Mumbai Police headquarters at 9am and left around 6pm after around nine hours of questioning while Bhandari he reached the headquarters at 1pm and left after 5 hours at 6pm. Singh was summoned for the second time as he had responded to the first summon sent to him on October 9 stating that he was out of the city till October 16. Citing that a writ petition has been filed before the Supreme court of India (provisional application number 7848/2020) and an early listing has been requested, he had also asked the police to defer the summoning till the Apex court hears his application. “The crime branch team traced his location to Sandy resort in Daman where he was staying. He initially refused to cooperate with the Mumbai Police saying he was in Daman. However, Daman Police was with us, so he could not avoid and was taken to Nani Daman police station where his statement was recorded for around seven hours,” said inspector Sachin Vaze, who is in-charge of the crime intelligence unit and also part of the investigating team. “Singh has been asked to come again on October 12 and produce certain documents such as cable operators’ details and contract with the DTH operators,” added Vaze. During inquiry, when Khanchandani was asked to share the working procedure of the channels, he replied that whatever is aired has nothing to do with him as that is an editorial concern. Vaze said, “Republic TV had shown a report on October 11 claiming they have a report which was submitted by Hansa Research Private Limited, which is responsible for installing and maintaining barometers of Broadcast Audience Research Council, to Mumbai Police but was leaked. But when we inquired, we found that it was undated and an unaddressed document which was shown as Hansa’s documents.” “Mumbai Police’s crime branch has initiated another inquiry on it. It [the document] appears to be fake, and during questioning, Khanchandani showed his inability to explain the report,” added Vaze. The channel’s chief financial officer (CFO) Shiva Sundaram was also summoned to the police headquarters for questioning under section 160 of CrPC on October 10. However, he wrote to Mumbai Police stating he would be available to join investigations by October 14-15 and asked the Mumbai Police to not proceed with the probe till a writ petition in the matter was heard by the Supreme Court. “On October 11, he intimated Mumbai Police’s crime branch that he and his mother are not well, as well as due to Covid-19 reason. He did not come but said he was ready to cooperate with the investigation and would come after October 14,” said Vaze. Sundaram in his letter stated, “I refer to the above summons issued by you on October 9, 2020 asking me to be present at your office on October 10, 2020 at 11am for the purpose of your investigation in the subject First Information Report. At the outset, I would express my commitment to cooperate in the said investigations.” The letter then goes on to request the Mumbai Police to halt investigations till the hearing of the writ petition filed before the Supreme Court was heard. “I wish to bring to your notice that a writ petition under Article 32 has been filed before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (Provisional application number 7848/2020) in relation to the above referred matter and we have requested for an early hearing and it is likely to be listed by next week. Given that the matter is to be listed soon before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, I request you to not proceed any further with the investigations in so far as Republic TV and its employees are concerned. We will join the investigations subject to the orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.” Sundaram further stated, “I would also like to inform you that on account of some personal commitments, I am scheduled to travel outside Mumbai for the next few days and accordingly, will only be available in Mumbai by 14-15 October, 2020.” The channel’s COO Priya Mukherjee, who was summoned on October 10 to be present in the crime branch office for questioning, informed the police that she was in Bengaluru and did not come due to the Covid-19 situation. “We have recovered a diary from the residence of the arrested accused, Vishal Bhandari. Apart from the three channels — Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Republic TV, there are several other names of channels mentioned in it. Bhandari has also mentioned details about households whom he had paid,” added crime branch officer. Bhandari is a former relationship manager of Hansa.“Police have also found a list of 1,800 households from Bhandari’s residence where barometers were installed. This is confidential data and should not be leaked to other relationship managers,” said Vaze. A crime branch team has left for Rajasthan to nab the wanted accused. “We have sought the details of bank accounts of Republic TV, and details of one of the bank accounts have come. We have also asked for bank details of all suspicious channels,” said the officer. Later in the evening, Republic Media Network (RMN) issued a statement pertaining to the questioning of Khanchandani by the Mumbai Police. The statement said that the police were trying to know the source from which it got the Hansa report, which Khanchandani did not disclose. RMN has reiterated that it will not disclose their source and will protect their democratic right as journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-fraud-3-employees-of-republic-tv-questioned-by-mumbai-police/story-sMcBrPARM4vrIh0YxpwuhL.html
12-10-2020||City||Even high-scorers left high and dry as DU cut-offs soar||New Delhi: Sixteen-year-old Vandana, whose father works as a driver and mother a domestic help, was elated when she scored 91% in the class 12 Central Board of Secondary Education exam this year. She wanted to enroll for the BA Programme in Hansraj College because of its “good reputation”. However, as per the cut-off released by Delhi University colleges on Saturday night, she is not eligible to apply in any of the five combinations offered by the college for the BA Programme.A day after a majority of DU colleges released their cut-offs — mostly between 95% and 100% in popular courses — students like Vandana are worried about their prospects, with many considering applying to non-collegiate courses offered by the varsity through the School of Open Learning and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board.According to an analysis done by a north campus DU college, of the over 57,000 applicants for the courses available in their college, over 44,000, or 77%, scored below 95%. However, several colleges have announced cut-offs above and beyond that mark this year, due to the increase in the number of applicants and CBSE top-scorers — a move that effectively makes only around 23% students eligible for these courses as per the first cut-off list.East Delhi resident Saloni Mishra, who scored a best-four subjects aggregate of 94% and wanted to pursue a BA (Honours) in English, said she was disappointed with the steep cut-offs. “I had worked very hard and wanted to go to a north campus college, since it creates more opportunities in the long-run. The classrooms are more diverse, and I would get to interact with a variety of people. The commute is easier as well. But it was disappointing to see the cut-offs so high this year,” said Mishra, who graduated from a government school in Mayur Vihar Phase 1.Though Mishra has prepared a list of south campus colleges where she will enrol to “secure a seat”, she said she will wait for subsequent lists, and hopes to get into a north campus college.Of the 46 colleges offering BA (Honours) in English, Mishra is eligible to apply in only 19, while Vandana will only be able to apply in three colleges. The situation is similar for popular courses across science, commerce, and humanities subjects. Applicants wanting to opt for BA (Honours) in journalism, for instance, need to have an aggregate in the range of 94-99.5% to be eligible for the course offered in seven DU colleges. For BCom (Honours) courses offered by 54 colleges, those who scored between 90-95% can apply to only eight DU colleges, of which three are all-girls institutions.For BSc (Hons) in Mathematics, of the 41 colleges offering the course, students scoring between 90-95% can apply in only 12 colleges.Students who scored below 90% in their class 12 board exams will not be eligible to apply in any DU college for several courses including BA (Honours) in English, BCom (Hons), or BSc Mathematics (Honours) under the unreserved category of the first cut-off list. Cut-offs for people eligible for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Economically Weaker Sections, People with Disabilities, or Kashmiri Migrants quotas drop 2-10 percentage points between categories for various courses. Additionally, over 20 colleges also offer a one percentage point relaxation for women applicants.Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College and president of the Delhi University Principals’ Association, urged students not to get disheartened. “Those who have not gotten a chance in the first list should wait, because cutoffs are likely to drop further in the subsequent lists due to multiplicity of applications. By the fifth list, other high-scoring students can also secure admissions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/even-high-scorers-left-high-and-dry-as-du-cut-offs-soar/story-4XPnOQEbeolAuJmwVbXIUL.html
12-10-2020||City||Second-year students at LSR asked to vacate hostel||New Delhi: At least 120 second-year residents at Lady Shri Ram College (LSR) for Women were on Sunday asked to vacate the hostel by October 31, as per last year’s regulations that hostel would only be allotted to first-year students.In June last year, the college had announced that its hostel will be available to only first-year students to ensure that more students from marginalised backgrounds could avail of hostel facilities. The issue had created a huge furore among the students, who demanded that the facility should be extended to all students.Several hostel residents said they had received messages on Saturday, saying that they needed to vacate the hostel by month-end. The residents then called for a general body meeting (GBM) with the warden and hostel union members on Sunday evening using a videoconferencing application.“We were told that we would have to vacate by October end. It came as a shock to us. At the time of joining the hostel last year, we had signed that it would be for a year but we had no option then. Throughout the year, we received several verbal assurances by college authorities on the matter. So we were not expecting this,” said a 19-year-old hosteller, requesting anonymity.“How can we travel at such a short notice during the pandemic and shift our belongings? It is extremely risky for us, plus everybody may not have the financial means to travel at this point,” said the second-year undergraduate student.Unnimaya P, a third-year student who is also a resident at the hostel, said, “The 2019 notification was opposed by the students and we had said that we won’t settle with any rule which puts the resident batch of 2019 at a disadvantage. There is no certainty pertaining to when the college will reopen. Why is the pretext of college reopening being used?”While second-year residents have been asked to vacate, there has been no such notice for third-year students so far. Hostel warden Ujjayini Ray said, “At the time of joining, the current second-year residents knew that the hostel was reserved only for first-year students. They were already aware that they had to vacate by term-end. The current third-year residents had not joined under this rule. So they won’t be asked to leave.”“A new batch of students will be coming in and we will need to follow social distancing norms as well as implement the constitutional reservation. So we have to prepare the rooms, which is why we have asked second-year students to vacate by October 31. However, if any student cannot travel from their hometown and do so by then, they can write to us,” she said.Ray also pointed out that the authorities had taken the decision keeping the reopening guidelines under Unlock 5 in mind. “Around 70 students who will graduate this year have already cleared out their belongings since August,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-year-students-at-lsr-asked-to-vacate-hostel/story-qwle65ztAWd0YaBPwYKqAO.html
12-10-2020||Delhi||DU admission process an online-only affair, students advised to stay off campus||The admission process to undergraduate courses across Delhi University (DU) colleges under the first cut-off list will begin from Monday at 10am, with the admission process completely online, and students advised not to visit colleges in person. Several colleges have also allowed their staff to work from home during the admission process this year, HT has learnt.DU dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said the University will answer all queries online. “The university’s admission department has got a lot of time between the registration and admission process this year due to the prevailing situation. In this time, we managed to fix a lot of issues that students could have witnessed while accessing the online admission portal. In case students have any queries, they can reach out to the nodal officers of each college or the member committee admission. We have made their email IDs and phone numbers available online,” she said.The admission process under the first cut-off will end at 5pm on Wednesday. “Unlike previous years, when there was a fixed timing for admissions, students can this year initiate and complete the process any time between Monday morning and Wednesday evening. I advise students to read everything carefully before starting the process, so that they do not end up making any mistakes,” Bagai said.The candidates will have to log in on their admission portal using the ID generated during registration. A list of eligible courses and colleges will be displayed on their dashboard, on the basis of their marks. The students may choose as many courses and colleges as they wish. According to the instructions shared with colleges by the university’s admission committee, the former will get to see the list of all applicants who have chosen a particular course in their institute. “The colleges will be allowed to filter the applicant list depending on their cut-off list. This will also allow them to remove spurious applicants. The course in-charge of all colleges will verify the minimum qualification, eligibility, cut-off requirement, and certificates uploaded by the candidates,” the instruction read.The convenor or admission committee of the colleges will then check the application, after which the college principal will approve the admission. The applicants will then have to submit the fee to complete the admission process. There will be a three-day admission window for all the cut-offs. “Applicants need to pay the fee and complete the process within that window under each cut-off. No admission will be entertained as per any cut-off after the completion of its admission window,” Bagai said. The second cut-off will be announced by October 19. Five cut-offs and a special cut-off are scheduled this year. The session for first-year undergraduate students is scheduled to begin from November 18.Officials at several colleges said they have allowed several staff members to work from home during the admission process. Vibha Singh Chauhan, principal of Kirori Mal College, said, “We have made elaborate arrangements in the college for those who want to come and work from the campus. We have prepared computer rooms with seating arrangements maintaining social distancing. We have already sanitised the campus. Since the process is completely online, teachers will have an option to work from home as well.”Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said the institution will allow up to two persons in a room for the admission process, to ensure social distance is maintained. “We are also ready with masks, gloves, face shields, and sanitisers. The teachers can also work from home and take prints of students’ details from the online portal. They can perform the calculations, verify the documents and send it to the college through email,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-admission-process-an-online-only-affair-students-advised-to-stay-off-campus/story-oVylLB1RCX4nvEpsVb9jeK.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Residents protest against the developer over maintenance||Residents of Mahagun Moderne housing society in Noida’s Sector 78 on Sunday protested against their society’s developer, who they alleged has imposed “unjustified” maintenance charges on them. At least 100 residents of this society gathered at the gate of the society holding a banner with slogans against the promoters of Mahagun Group, the builder who developed the society. They gathered around 11am and took a round of the entire society shouting slogans against the Mahagun Group’s promoters. They ended their demonstration at 12.30pm, after deciding to file an FIR against the promoters for cheating and fraud.Mahagun had started offering possession to buyers in 2018. An apartment owners’ association (AOA) was elected in 2018 for this society, which had 2,700 flats, spread over an area of 25 acres, however, maintenance has not been handed over yet.“According to the Uttar Pradesh Apartment Act, 2010 the developer should have handed over maintenance to AOA immediately after its election. However, it kept the maintenance work with itself so that it could continue making money off us. We approached all agencies seeking justice but the developer has not handed over the maintenance, so we decided to protest,” said Sandeep Chauhan, president of the society’s AOA. Residents alleged that the developer is delaying handing over maintenance work as they will have to pay around ₹20 crore Interest-Free Maintenance Security (IFMS) charges collected from the homebuyers. According to rules, a developer has to give IMFS, meant to be used to address urgent civic issues in society, to the AOA at the time of handover of the maintenance work. “The developer has increased monthly maintenance charges by ₹1,000 abruptly without any discussion, angering all residents. They ₹12,000 per flat with the assurance that Ganga water supply will be provided. However, we are still dependent on groundwater, which is salty. Also, the developer has not paid ₹32 crore to the Noida authority. As a result, 400 residents are unable to get property registry done,” said Mridul Bhatia, general secretary of the AOA. Residents also alleged that the developer got the AOA’s executive committee suspended and has not been letting the election take place, as this will pave the way for handing over the maintenance. The Noida authority had, on September 3, directed the builder to hand over the maintenance and resolve the dispute. However, this did not happen and residents met with Uttar Pradesh real estate regulatory authority (UP Rera) member Balvinder Kumar on September 27, and filed a case.“Residents met me and filed a case against the developer. We will get an inspection done to check the infrastructure and services provided by the developer at the society. Then we will take appropriate action,” said UP Rera member Balvinder Kumar. The developer, on the other hand, refuted all allegations.“We are ready to hand over the maintenance to AOA as per the rules. But this could not happen in the past as there is a dispute among the members of the AOA. And we have been charging the maintenance from residents as per the agreement signed with them. Their allegations are untrue and baseless and we will follow rules in handing over the maintenance work,” said Amit Jain, promoter of Mahagun Group. Residents said that if the police do not file an FIR against the developer, they will approach the court for justice. They alleged FIR is not being filed even though they met and requested Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh some time back. And the station house officer refused to file an FIR despite repeated attempts. However, according to Love Kumar, the additional police commissioner of the district, “We will look into this matter and take appropriate action as per the rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-protest-against-the-developer-over-maintenance/story-AVcna4npaavYVJoEmGZLEM.html
12-10-2020||Delhi||Why 100% is becoming a cut-off norm at Delhi University||The Delhi University cut-offs touched the 100% ceiling for the first time in 2011. Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) had set the mark for admission to B Com (Hons), attracting a raft of reactions from students, parents and academics. Since then, several colleges have demanded cent per cent marks for admission to various courses. This year, it was Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College that has set 100% cut off for three courses. Experts cited several reasons for the trend, most prominent of which is the way how the evaluation for the Central Board for Secondary Examination (CBSE) exams has changed over the years. PC Jain, the then principal of SRCC, said the college set the cut-off at 100% in view of the increase in the number of top scorers in the CBSE Class 12 board exams. “The number of students scoring above 90% and 95% was exceptionally high that year and it’s been increasing every year since then. In fact, students are scoring a percent of 100 in the most theoretical subjects like History, Political Science, and Sociology. It’s not just happening in CBSE but also in several state boards now. There is a possibility that more colleges will announce 100% cut-offs in the coming years,” he said.This year, while the number of CBSE students scoring 95% and above increased by 118.6% this year, those getting 90% and above went up by 67.48%. This is significant since a majority of applications (285,128) received by the university are from the CBSE board.The Delhi University announced its first cut-off list on Saturday with an average increase of 0.5 to 2 percentage points across colleges for various courses. DU officials also pointed out that colleges set very high cut-offs to prevent “over admissions”. According to the admission rules, any college cannot turn away a student who has made the cut-off. There is no first-come, first-serve. Many times colleges need to increase the number of seats to accommodate all eligible students.For instance, despite announcing 99% (highest) cut-off for admission to Political Science (Hons) last year, Hindu College had witnessed admissions double the number of available seats. College principal Anju Shrivastava said, “The number of top scorers is high and to limit the admissions we have to keep the cut-offs high.” The highest cut-off at the college is 99.5% this year for Political Science.Another official said the colleges did not have course-wise data for applications — an important metric while setting cut-offs. The application process was tweaked a little this year since the coronavirus pandemic delayed the board exams and their results, leading to an overall delay in the admission process. Since the entire process was online, the applicants were made to fill forms in which they didn’t have to specify courses. “Since the university did not seek course-wise or college-wise information this year, we were shooting in the dark. As many as 2,512 girl students with 100% applied for admission, as per the registration data. Over 13,900 were in the range of 95-99.9%. In the previous years, we were dealing with a much lower number of top scorers, and we had data on how many students have opted for a particular course. We don’t have that data this year. Even if 1% of these students apply for a course that has less than 25 seats, there will be over-admissions. This is why higher cut-offs were a safe option,” an official from a south campus college said, requesting anonymity. “Last year, in at least two courses in our college, including Political Science (Hons), admissions in the unreserved category were double the number of available seats. This also affects the admissions under other reserved categories as well,” the official added. Shrivastava said, “Since the registration was open for all courses we studied last year’s trends while deciding the cut-offs.” In 2015, two colleges – College of Vocational Studies and Indraprastha (IP) College for Women – had fixed their cut-offs at 100% for BSc (Honours) in Computer Science. Babli Moitra Saraf, principal of IP College, said, “Higher cut-offs are always based on board exam results and the number of over-admissions that take place in colleges. In 2015, there was a rush for BSc (Honours) in Computer Science. The previous year, we had to deal with extra-admissions in that course.”Vibha Sinha Chauhan, principal of Kirori Mal College, said, “In the first cut-off, the colleges are always very cautious due to the possibility of over admissions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-100-is-becoming-a-cut-off-norm-at-du/story-cvm96nNcMEiRlW2a1D3UXP.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad faces hiccups to conduct 6,000 tests per day||Ghaziabad: The district that had planned to conduct 6,000 tests per day in October is now lagging behind in terms of achieving the daily target. According to the district health department data, Ghaziabad conducted only 47,777 tests in first 10 days of the month with an average of 4,777 tests a day. The officials in the health department said that they are facing shortage of rapid antigen kits. As per the official data, the number of Covid-19 tests conducted using rapid kits in the district was 4,363 on October 6, which fell to 1,544 on October 10. The directions for conducting 6,000 daily tests were given to the district officials by the UP government-appointed nodal officer, Senthil Pandian C, when he took a review meeting in the last week of September. Following the directions, the health department roped in more lab technicians to complete the daily target and conducted more than 6,000 tests only on two days of this month -- October 1 (6,014) and October 5 (6,042). The 6,042 tests conducted on October 5 have so far remained the highest in a single day since March when the first Covid-19 case was reported in the district. “For conducting 6,000 tests, we have to conduct 4,200 tests with rapid antigen kits and another 1,800 through the RT-PCR method. For the past few days, there have been issues in procuring the antigen kits. Antigen kits are coming in as per the earlier target of 3,100 tests a day, which include 2,000 through rapid kits. However, we are trying to procure more antigen kits,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. “As per directions, we are conducting one-third of our daily tests through the RT-PCR method,” the officer said.Meanwhile, the overall testing has picked up in the district. During the period from September 1-10, the total testing stood at 33,599 while it increased to 38,982 in the next 10 days from September 11 to 20. It further increased to 44,261 from September 21 to 30 and went up to 47,777 during the period of October 1-10. Overall, the district has conducted about 362,212 tests till October 10 and the figure includes 217,384 tests conducted with the help of rapid antigen kits. This provides district with a test positivity rate of 4.46%. The district administration officials said that they will look into the shortage of rapid antigen kits and ensure that the daily target of 6,000 is met. “Our testing has increased over a period of time as we are doing focussed testing in areas where we expect more suspected cases. But we have instances of about 10 lab technicians who are either suffering health issues or have contracted Covid-19. So, there are some hiccups which we will resolve soon. Overall, the testing is increasing and we will increase it further,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Of the total 47,777 tests conducted from October 1 to 10, about 31,585 were conducted through the use of rapid kits while 16,192, about 33.89% which is about one-third of the total tests, were done through the RT-PCR method. The officials said that since the area of containment zones has also been shortened on the basis of revised guidelines, they will also be focussing on 100% testing in containment zones. In its advisory on Covid-19 testing in the country, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on September 4 suggested that 100% people living in containment zones should get tested by rapid antigen test particularly in cities where there has been a widespread transmission of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-faces-hiccups-to-conduct-6-000-tests-per-day/story-wsRchgYVydaDox40Qc0zwM.html
12-10-2020||Delhi||DDMA allows Durga Puja, Ramlila with Covid riders||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday allowed Navratri and Durga Puja functions to be organised in the national Capital with limited attendees, even as it prohibited all kinds of fairs (melas), food stalls, exhibitions, rallies and processions till October 31. However, despite the order some of the biggest and oldest Ramlila committees in Delhi have decided to skip organising any event this year, a first for them in several decades. With just five days to go for the festivities to begin, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued the order on Sunday in which the DDMA also lifted the ban on gatherings and large congregations for the first time since the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. “It may be noted that the restriction on gatherings and large congregations….stands withdrawn only to the extent of allowing gatherings /congregations for celebration of upcoming festivals till 31st October, 2020 only,” read the order.It stated that apart from the statutory permissions that need to be taken every year, this time owing to Covid-19, every organiser will have to take permission from the district magistrate. Delhi has 11 districts. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, who is a member of the DDMA, said the permission to allow Ramlila and Durga Puja functions has been decentralised this time with the power being given to each distirct administration to decide which ones should be allowed. “The organiser will have to apply to the DM. After the application is received, a team of district officials including those from the Delhi police and the municipal corporation concerned will inspect the venue. Parameters such as area and the number of visitors allowed inside at a time will be decided based on the inspection. Spaces which are too small may not be granted permission owing to social distancing norms,” said the minister.A senior revenue official said that it is likely that this time the number of functions that are held across the city would be far lesser than previous years. “A nodal officer has to be appointed by the DM for each function. In case of any violation, the permission granted to an organiser will be immediately withdrawn for the subsequent days. Videography of each pandal or venue will be a must and a soft copy of each day’s function will have to be submitted to the DM’s office, which in turn will be sent to the chief secretary,” said the official on condition of anonymity. Arjun Kumar, general secretary of Lav Kush Ramlila Committee which organises an 11-day event every year at the historic Red Fort said they are pulling out of the festivity this year.“This is the first time in 40 years that Lav Kush Ramlila will not happen this time. Usually we get the permission for the land from the Archaeological Survey of India around 60 days before the start of the event. The first day of Navratra this time is Saturday, October 17. But, Union culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel himself is getting treated for Covid, so our file is stuck. Also, our Ramlila plays involve 250 artistes who do each others make-up which means coming close to each other. If by chance anyone gets the infection, all the effort of making the arrangements for 11 days will go in vain because the venue will be sealed for sanitisation,” Kumar said. Ravi Jain, press secretary of Shri Dharmik Leela Committee also said they won’t be organising any function this year as did 11 other committees in Rohini alone. While Navratra will begin from October 17 to 25 (Dusshera), Durga Puja will be celebrated from October 22 to 26.Swapan Ganguly, general secretary of New Delhi Kali Bari, one of the oldest Durga Puja organisers in the city, said for the first time they will not offer bhog on site. “In a first, we will home deliver Durga Ma’s blessings to whoever gives donation for the bhog. Other visitors who insist on getting the bhog will have to make a nominal payment this time and will be given the ‘prasad’ in packed boxes as they exit the pandal,” he said. Ganguly said as per the order issued by the DDMA, they too have planned separate entry and exit with sanitising tunnels for visitors. “We are creating a proper route for visitors coming to see the Durga idol. Also, there will be no stage performances or food stalls this time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ddma-allows-durga-puja-ramlila-with-covid-riders/story-kvonqtTty31EA8qlArki0N.html
12-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi notifies waiver of road tax, registration fee for electric vehicles||The state transport department has notified the complete waiver of road tax and registration fee for battery-operated vehicles as mandated under the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy 2020.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the government is accepting feedback from the public on the scheme, and that final orders will be issued three days later. The gazette says, “..the said draft will be taken into consideration after expiry of a period of three days from the date on which the copies of this notification as published in the Gazette of Delhi are made available to the public. Objections or suggestions in this behalf should be addressed to Secretary-cum-Commissioner (Transport), Government of National Capital of Delhi, Transport Department..”Reacting to the notification, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, calling it “another crucial step” towards a pollution-free Delhi.“This incentive-based policy will encourage large scale adoption of electric vehicles, and bring us closer to fulfilling our dream of making Delhi the EV capital of India,” Kejriwal tweeted.Kejriwal had announced the policy on August 7, with a focus on increasing the adoption of EVs in the city by incentivising their purchase and use. The policy aims to register 500,000 electric vehicles in the city by 2024.Gahlot said this policy has come into force from the date of issue of the notification. “Road tax will not be paid on the electric vehicles starting October 10, 2020,” he said.He also took to Twitter and said, “Congrats Delhi! As promised by CM @ArvindKejriwal when announcing landmark EV Policy, Delhi govt has EXEMPTED road tax on Battery Operated Vehicles. With right incentives & supporting infra, we are determined to ensure Delhi leads the country in rapid transition to Electric Vehicles.”At present, road tax ranges from 4% to 10% of the cost of the vehicle, while registration could cost up to ₹3,000.In addition, a subsidy of ₹10,000 per kWh is to be given for the first 1,000 e-cars or electric four wheelers, capped at ₹1,50,000 per vehicle. A subsidy of ₹5,000 per kWh of the battery capacity up to ₹30,000 is also to be given on the purchase of each electric two-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, rickshaw and freight vehicle. To push people to shift to EVs, the policy also has a “scrapping incentive” for those who make the switch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-notifies-waiver-of-road-tax-registration-fee-for-electric-vehicles/story-EhhFPRqpals1L5ujsqjoYP.html
12-10-2020||City||NCRTC fined ₹50 lakh for violating dust control norms||New Delhi: Stepping up its action against polluters before the winters set in, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Sunday fined the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) ₹50 lakh for not taking dust-control measures at one of its construction sites. The minister, who inspected demolition sites at Netaji Nagar and Kasturba Nagar on Sunday, said the fine was issued after uncovered mounds of dust were found at an NCRTC construction site near Vikas Sadan, where a Rapid Metro building is coming up. Rai said they have flouted dust-control norms, despite directions from the government. “I have issued directions to impose a fine of ₹50 lakh against NCRTC. Such disregard for air pollution will not be tolerated,” he said. The minister said that if the transport corporation continues to violate pollution norms, the work itself will be banned. NCRTC did not comment on the violations. On Saturday, during another inspection of construction sites, the environment minister had imposed a fine of ₹20 lakh on the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) for violating dust-control norms at a demolition site on Tansen Marg in central Delhi. Directions were also issued not to carry out or restart any demolition activity without installing an anti-smog gun and taking other measures to prevent dust pollution at the project site. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had earlier asked FICCI and other bodies to stop work at six construction and demolition sites for not taking adequate steps to control dust pollution. At present, there are 39 sites in Delhi, covering an overall area of more than 20,000 square metres, where construction work is ongoing. Anti-smog guns have been installed at 33 of these sites. The government has also imposed fines ranging between ₹20,000 and ₹5 lakh on 31 RMC (ready-mix concrete) plants for not taking measures to prevent dust pollution. Work was ordered to be stopped at 11 of these plants, where violations were found to be serious. The environment department has set up 14 inspection teams to check violations of pollution norms this year. This anti-dust campaign will continue in mission mode till October 15 and strict action will be taken against the violators, the minister had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncrtc-fined-50-lakh-for-violating-dust-control-norms/story-QFWg1cn41ZRxOKT6GvAAXK.html
12-10-2020||Noida||UP asks hospitals to discharge Covid-19 patients with co-morbidities only after they are found negative||NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh government has directed all the Covid-dedicated medical colleges and hospitals in the state to discharge the infected patients with comorbidities only after they are found negative for the virus. The move is aimed at reducing the fatalities due to Covid-19, officials said.The government order, issued by additional chief secretary Dr Rajnish Dubey on Saturday night, said that such patients should be discharged only after getting tested negative through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and two-stage TrueNat tests. “If the patients having co-morbidities need treatment for other ailments, they should be admitted to non-Covid hospitals after testing negative. They must not be directly sent for home isolation by the hospitals and medical colleges concerned,” the order states. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that all the Covid-dedicated medical facilities have been asked to follow the recent government order about discharging the patients. “It will not only reduce the case fatality rate (CFR), but will also check any possibility of fatality among the patients with comorbidities. Almost all the hospitals have been doing so since long,” he said. Dr Rakesh Gupta, director of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), said that over Covid-19 1,500 patients have been successfully treated at this hospital. “We have never sent any patient with co-morbidities directly for home isolation. At the time of discharging the patients, team of our doctors prepares the database of these patients and refer them to other hospitals for their further treatment,” he said. Corroborating similar views, Ajit Kumar, joint registrar of School of Medical Sciences and Research, Sharda University, said that it is a good initiative by the UP government, as far as comorbid patients’ treatment is concerned. “Now, the district administration should talk to private hospitals for treatment of such patients at rates under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Sharda Hospital is treating Covid-19 patients which are admitted by government and has successfully treated about 2,000 patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-asks-hospitals-to-discharge-covid-19-patients-with-co-morbidities-only-after-they-are-found-negative/story-gZk0LDpdWS4MYhP3QapslM.html
12-10-2020||Delhi||Change of wind direction to bring respite from stubble burning smoke||: After five days of poor air, pollution in the national capital is likely to drop marginally Monday onwards, buoyed primarily by a shift in the wind direction, according to a Sunday forecast by the Union ministry of earth sciences.The ministry’s air quality early warning system forecast said Delhi’s air quality will improve and enter the ‘moderate’ category on Monday, where it is expected to remain till Tuesday at least, the forecast read. “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from Delhi’s east, with wind speeds up to 12kmph and mainly clear skies on Monday,” the early warning system said. On Tuesday, winds are expected to travel into the Capital from the southeast, while their speed will likely remain similar and skies may stay mainly clear, according to the system.The change in wind direction means the impact of crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana on Delhi’s air will be minimal on Monday and Tuesday. With the onset of the winters, the national capital, over the last two weeks, received winds from the north-west that carried plumes of stubble burning smoke from the rural pockets of the two neighbouring states. On Sunday, Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI) reading, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was 216, marginally better than Saturday’s 221. On Sunday, Delhi received north-westerly winds, blowing at a speed of 15kmph. The Union earth science ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also predicted that a shift in Delhi’s surface wind direction will help improve the quality of air “marginally”. Safar data shows that on Saturday alone, 448 cases of farm fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana through satellite monitoring. These cases have been increased regularly since September 12, when farmers started harvesting the early varieties of paddy and started setting their fields on fire to get rid of the stubble remains. “We are sharing these forecasts with the CPCB. Medical experts suggest air pollution may add to peoples’ miseries during the Covid-19 pandemic. With the government’s graded action plan [Graded Response Action Plan, also known as Grap], we hope to keep the level of air pollution very low this year,” said Madhavan Rajeevan, secretary, Union ministry of earth sciences. For the last five days, Delhi’s air has been in the ‘poor’ zone, dropping into the category with an AQI of 215 on Wednesday, after a long spell in the ‘moderate’ zone. The Delhi government blamed this spike in pollution on the increasing instances of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/change-of-wind-direction-to-bring-respite-from-stubble-burning-smoke/story-ScP5WguacxAXreHZpEJlyJ.html
12-10-2020||Noida||Leopard sighted at NTPC Dadri, forest department launches search operation||Greater Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar forest department has launched a search operation after a leopard was sighted at NTPC Dadri on October 7. Images of the animal’s movement were captured in CCTV cameras installed at the premises. A forest department team has been camping for four days in the NTPC area to catch the leopard, officials said.Pankaj Saxena, spokesperson, NTPC Dadri, said the leopard was sighted on the night of October 7. “We immediately informed the forest department and the police, who launched a search operation. We have alerted the NTPC staff and also issued an advisory to people in neighbouring villages to be on alert,” he said. In the footage, the leopard was seen crossing a small bridge and then slowly backing away into the dense forest beyond.The incident has scared local people, said residents. Ikhlaq Abbasi, who lives in Dadri, said that the locals are concerned for their safety. “We received the NTPC advisory on WhatsApp two days ago. People from neighbouring villages have restricted themselves indoors due to safety reasons. We request the police and forest department to launch an intensive search and catch the leopard before it harms any person,” he said. PK Srivastava, district forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said it appears the leopard had strayed into Dadri from the Aravali forest. “The team has been following the pug marks and is scanning the neighbourhood. We have also placed a cage and other equipment to trap and catch the leopard. However, it has not been found,” he said. He said that there are instances when leopards stray from their natural habitats in search of food. “They sometimes also jump over goods’ trains and reach residential areas from the forest,” he said.The NTPC Dadri is a coal and gas-fired thermal power plant located in Dadri area of Gautam Budh Nagar.

It was officially set up on September 9 and the first meeting of the panel is likely to be held in the next two weeks, the senior government official said.The document further read, “The government has been working with the values of inclusiveness, diversity, democratisation of knowledge and culture, expansion of cultural landscape, social change and decentralisation of government spending. It is important that the department realises the importance of its schemes. All interventions and programmes need to be thought through keeping this in mind.”“The deputy CM has further desired that the art, culture and languages department should use this time (i.e. the current period when field activities of the department have curtailed due to the pandemic) to draw up a comprehensive cultural policy for Delhi. For this, an advisory panel comprising industry experts, community leaders and officers should be formed,” said the document signed by Sanjay Jain, deputy secretary in the government’s art and culture department.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also in charge of the art and culture portfolio in Delhi, told Hindustan Times, “For the last few years, we have been working continuously on several aspects of Delhi’s art and culture policy — especially on funding, audience and artistes. During the Covid-19 pandemic, artistes have suffered and the government has not been able to organise programmes for them. This will change, and in the coming time, we are going to further expand the cultural landscape of Delhi by connecting art and culture with livelihood.”Sisodia’s office said this is the first such panel under the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. It will be chaired by a secretary-rank officer.“In the coming time, we will organise workshops for the art and culture community on a range of subjects — from sound engineering to use of social media to promote work,” said Abhinandita Mathur, an advisor to Sisodia and a member of the advisory panel.Pooja Sood, a Delhi-based art curator and member of the panel, said, “Our aim will be to make art and culture more inclusive and accessible to the people of Delhi. This is a good opportunity. For the next few weeks, we shall brainstorm over a number of issues to ensure that the vision of the panel is achieved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-gets-arts-and-culture-panel-as-govt-looks-to-set-up-cultural-policy-for-capital/story-kdZiDg4pYZeeNic7etfUWO.html

The driver of the tractor fled the spot, and police are on the lookout for him. The three were identified as 37-year-old Rajesh Sharma, who worked at a courier company in Mahipalpur, Charandeep (38), who worked with a company associated with a leading media brand, and Tarun Gupta (42), who owned a computer shop. All three were residents of B block in east Delhi’s Pandav Nagar. Parveen Singh (38), the owner of the car, is hospitalised and being treated.Sharma, who was at the wheel during the accident, is survived by his wife and their two daughters, Charandeep by a wife, daughter and son. Gupta, the police said, is survived by his wife and their daughter.Police said the incident took place around 1.30am on Sunday. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said Moti Nagar police station received a call reporting that a car and a tractor have rammed each other at Shadipur flyover, in front of the Kirti Nagar Metro Station.“The four men in the car were pulled out by passersby, after which police control room vans took them to a nearby hospital,” he said.A preliminary probe revealed that the car was speeding and rammed into the tractor, which police said was travelling at a slow pace.The three died were pronounced dead at ABG Hospital in Moti Nagar.

12-10-2020||Mumbai||BMC to hand over job of levying fine for illegal parking to Mumbai traffic police||Nearly 14 months after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started levying a fine of ₹10,000 for parking vehicles within 1-km radius of the civic body’s public parking lots (PPL) citing it to be ‘encroachment’, the civic body is set to hand over this job to the Mumbai Traffic Police (MTP). The fine amount for illegal parking was later brought down to ₹4,000 and it will remain unchanged, BMC officials said. Apart from this, BMC will also hand over towing of scrap vehicles on roads to MTP.A year ago, former municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had justified towing vehicles parked in ‘no parking’ areas by calling them ‘encroachment’. However, BMC now says it is overburdened owing to the Covid-19 situation and that it does not have dedicated staff for levying fines. Pardeshi had conceptualised the idea to bring down congestion on road and promote usage of BEST buses. A BMC official not wishing to be named said, “Our staff are overburdened since the last seven months owing to the duty relating to Covid-19. Hence, we are taking the decision to allow Mumbai Traffic Police to take over the same. The talks for the same are ongoing since last one month, and the official handover is expected to take place in the next 10 days.”A document prepared by BMC last month, putting on record the discussion with the Mumbai Traffic Police, reads, “It was observed that the manpower at ward level of BMC for effective enforcement against vehicles parked without authorisation is inadequate. There is no dedicated wing for executing said works at ward level. On the other hand, dedicated traffic police personnel are available with the traffic police department. The said traffic police department may be assigned for taking action against vehicles parked illegally.”BMC had started levying fine for parking within 1-km radius of civic-run PPLs and BEST bus depots in four major arterial roads including Link Road, SV Road, LBS Road and Maharshi Karve Road from July 7 last year. However, later the rules were relaxed to 500-metre radius of PPLs and the fine amount was brought down to ₹4,000. Owing to the levying of heavy fine amount, usage of PPL had increased drastically. HT had reported on January 11 that BMC’s implementation of heavy fines for illegal parking near the 26 public parking lots (PPLs) in the city was bearing fruits. According to the civic body data, the occupancy rate of these PPLs had increased by around 30-40% in December 2019, and in certain cases even doubled, after the imposition of heavy fines.Sunil Sardar, deputy chief engineer of BMC’s solid waste management department (transport wing), confirmed that the fine of ₹4,000 will be levied by the Mumbai Traffic Police and the handover of the responsibilities for the same is expected to take place in the next 10 days. Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from Matunga, said, “Citizens do not care much about which authority is levying a fine, but we expect that the implementation is done in true sense, and citizens are benefited at large.” He added, “I have been complaining about two bikes parked on footpath in my area, but BMC has not acted against them citing traffic police will do it. But handing over is not done yet. Hence, citizens will suffer until traffic police starts taking action after taking charge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-hand-over-job-of-levying-fine-for-illegal-parking-to-mumbai-traffic-police/story-SnIbWP2EQPPy7yh5Um240M.html

Following persons have been thus, sent a formal notice for appearance before the committee on 12.10.2020 with a view to carry out the relevant proceedings: 1. Prabir Purkaystha: Editor- NewsClick, engineer and a science activist in the power, telecom and software sector; 2. Pratik Sinha: Author and co- founder of the non- profit fact- checking website- Alt News,” the committee said in a statement on Sunday. This comes after the Delhi legislative assembly panel told the Supreme Court last Tuesday that it had summoned Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan as a witness to ascertain the social media platform’s views on whether it contributed in any way to the build-up of the February, 2020 communal violence in the Capital.The Delhi assembly’s committee wanted to elicit suggestions on how social media platforms could be used to strengthen unity among citizens in the future and Facebook executives were summoned as witnesses, not as accused, an affidavit filed by deputy secretary Sadanand Sah said, adding that no coercive action was intended.Mohan and Facebook moved the Supreme Court on September 22, challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the assembly committee.The summons stem from the committee’s decision to look into Facebook’s role following several foreign media reports that purported to show the social media company may have acted in a political partisan manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-assembly-s-peace-and-harmony-committee-panel-to-resume-proceedings-today/story-cdvYz1ykgo76h6KBYbqiZP.html

Advocate Satish Maneshinde, Chakraborty’s lawyer, on Sunday issued a statement saying: “I had said that once Rhea Chakraborty is out on bail, we will start going after people who defamed and tried to destroy her life and morale for a two-minute glory on electronic media carrying fake news…We will forward a list of people to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) who made fake and false claims on TV and electronic media, including carrying mobile recording and fake stories on SSR case with particular reference to Rhea Chakraborty. We will request CBI to initiate legal proceedings against them for misleading the investigation.” The lawyer specifically referred to Chakraborty’s neighbour Dimple Thawani who reportedly said someone told her that Rajput had dropped Chakraborty home on June 13. Maneshinde said CBI recorded her statement on Sunday. Chakraborty was last month arrested in connection with drug trail being probed after Rajput’s death. She was released on October 7. She was also questioned by the Enforcement Directorate over allegations of money laundering made by Rajput’s family and CBI over the allegation of abetment of suicide. Rajput’s family had alleged Chakraborty transferred close to ₹15 crore from Rajput’s account to unknown persons not linked to him. They also alleged that Rajput’s credit cards were with Chakraborty and that she isolated him from others. The actress and her family have been named by the CBI as accused in the suicide abetment case. CBI had taken up the case on the request of the Bihar government. The FIR was registered following a complaint by Rajput’s father KK Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-rhea-s-lawyer-says-will-go-after-those-who-tried-to-destroy-her/story-o0p7ej3IsALJbdlycNQWEO.html

But when the Covid crisis hit the economy, we were asked to go in March. The tourism industry is one of the worst affected. I was working with inbound travel which has taken a huge hit and there are very slim chances of the industry recovering any time soon,” said Kant.Kant is the only earning member of his family. “My parents are in their eighties and have medical bills. My children, aged 12 and five, are both studying in private schools while my wife is a homemaker. All of a sudden, we were in a financial crunch. So I had to step up. I had planned about opening up my own café down the line, but I never thought of going about it in this manner,” he said.Even with the stall that started 20 days back, the family’s earnings have taken a hit but they are optimistic. “We aren’t able to promote it too much in the current scenario, but I am planning to take it online with collaborations with e-food portals. The feedback so far has been good. The income is nowhere near my earlier salary, but we hope to have a steady income soon,” Kant said.The family was struggling for the past few months when Kant decided to do something. “Lakhs of people are losing their jobs, but we can’t sit idly by. We have to fulfil our families’ requirements and that is why I decided to do something about it instead of being upset by my loss,” he said.The stall, Round the Corner, serves continental foods like sandwiches, burgers and mocktails.Kant’s story is being shared on social media where people have not only appreciated the food but also the entrepreneurial streak. “He is an entrepreneur now. Rather than seeking a job, he can eventually give jobs to 2-3 other people,” said a user on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-former-assistant-manager-opens-food-stall-after-losing-job-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-i2ScZ4OHuaX7E8GVCywchL.html

12-10-2020||Mumbai||Not Aarey Colony, Kanjurmarg to house Metro-3 car shed: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||The Metro-3 car shed proposed at Aarey Milk Colony stands scrapped and will now be moved to Kanjurmarg in the eastern suburbs, announced Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday. The decision brought to an end, for now, a six-year battle of wills marked by political rows, citizen protests, court petitions, tree-felling by authorities in the dead of night and subsequent arrests of activists who protested construction in “one of the last green lungs of Mumbai”.“I am happy to announce that the Aarey car shed is now being moved to Kanjurmarg. The plot in Kanjurmarg is government land and it will be provided at zero cost for Metro car shed. The money used to construct a building, ₹100 crore, will not go to waste either. That building will be used for public purpose,” Thackeray said. The CM’s announcement, during his webcast address to the state, was on expected lines, given that his party, Shiv Sena, had been opposing the car shed at Aarey even when it was in power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Before the 2019 Assembly elections, Sena had announced it would not allow a car shed in Aarey Colony and had made this a part of its election manifesto.Meanwhile, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, of the BJP, called the move driven by ego, which would shoot the cost up by ₹4,000 crore and lead to indefinite delays.Thackeray, on Sunday, said that two Metro corridors — Colaba-Bandra-Seepz (Metro-3) and Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli (Metro-6) — will be integrated. With the decision to move the depot from the 33 hectares (ha) plot in Aarey to the 43ha site in Kanjurmarg, the underground Metro project is set to see cost overruns and time delays (see box)The CM on Sunday also reiterated that the government has decided to withdraw cases lodged by the police against citizens and activists who had protested against the car shed at Aarey Colony. On September 30, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray raised the issue of cases against those who protested the tree hacking in Aarey last year, in the cabinet meeting. Subsequently, the cabinet decided to withdraw the cases.The CM said the government had earlier declared 600 acres of Aarey land as reserve forest, but now it has been increased to 800 acres. He said that the will be no infringement of rights of tribals in the area.“Biodiversity in Aarey needs to be conserved and protected. Nowhere is there an 800-acre jungle in an urban set-up. Mumbai has a natural forest cover. We know that jungles are converted to cities, but here, the city is converted to a jungle. We need to preserve what we have and carry out development in the remaining area,” he said.Following the announcement, Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “Aarey Saved!”. While Sena leaders and functionaries hailed the government over “fulfilment” of the given word, the BJP slammed it. Fadnavis said the decision was made to “satisfy ego” and it would lead to serious cost escalations and indefinite delays. The shift will cost Rs4,000 crore, he said, in a series of tweets.“Unfortunate decision to shift Metro Car Shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg and that, too, just to satisfy ego. This decision will increase the cost of the project by at least ₹4000 crore and this cost escalation is assessed by the committee appointed by this Government. Why such a huge burden just to satisfy someone’s ego? Whom does government want to suffer and for what?” He added, “This means that the Metro project, which would have been in the service of Mumbaikars just next year, has now been postponed indefinitely. ₹400 crore was already spent for Aarey Car Shed,₹1,300 crore wasted due to staying of project & additional cost escalation of ₹4,000 crore”Fadnavis, who also held the urban development department portfolio while he was the CM, added that the previous government had studied the possibility of Kanjurmarg plot for Metro-3 depot, but decided against it as it was under litigation. “The Kanjurmarg site was earlier considered by the government. But it was under litigation and stayed by Hon HC. Some private individuals claimed their rights. The stay was requested to be withdrawn. But Hon HC wanted the amount to be deposited if the claims got settled in future,” he said.Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) welcomed the decision and said that the Sena kept its poll promise. A statement from AAP’s Mumbai unit said that “united citizenry always triumphs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-aarey-colony-kanjurmarg-to-house-metro-3-car-shed-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-4bHmoWX2Ct7plWNbOkaFwK.html

They were rushed to Kailash Hospital where doctors declared them brought dead. There were five people in the MUV. Out of them, three persons – Pankaj Garg, 34, Vipin Garg, 36, and Paras Jain, 36, were injured. The injured have been admitted to the same hospital in Greater Noida,” Pandey said. BK Sharma, spokesperson of Kailash Hospital, said, “Mumma and Maniya had received critical injuries in their heads and were declared brought dead. Pankaj and Vipin are admitted to the hospital and undergoing treatment. Paras escaped with minor injuries,” Sharma said.

A police team later reached the spot and removed the two vehicles using a crane. SHO Pandey said that they have not received a complaint in this regard. The two bodies have been sent for a post-mortem and medical reports are awaited, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-two-killed-three-injured-in-accident-on-yamuna-expressway/story-Q8JgheTqS9PuAeCXwAuprL.html

Officials said they held meetings with different industrial area associations and asked air polluting units to submit affidavits before October 15. “In the affidavits, the units have been asked to give undertakings that they will operate their air pollution control systems, as well as use only authorised sources of fuel. This year, we are taking every precaution against industrial emissions. During past years, there have been instances that some erring units were found using rubber, plastic, etc., as fuel. So, they have been asked to submit affidavits and comply, else they will face penalties which range from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore, once GRAP measures are implemented,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB.“Such penalties will be levied against units found not operating their air pollution control systems or found using unauthorised fuel,” he added.The Supreme Court had banned the use of pet coke and furnace oil as fuel in 2017 in NCR.Officials said that the penalty amounts have been defined under an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in August 2019, and that they will levy penalties as per the order. In its order under the heading, ‘Environmental Compensation to be levied on all violations of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in NCR,’ the tribunal had fixed the ranges of penalty between ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore for industrial emissions based on the state of air quality – ₹10 lakh for ‘moderate to poor,’ ₹25 lakh for ‘very poor,’ ₹50 lakh under ‘severe’ and ₹1 crore under ‘severe+/emergency.’The UPPCB had recently issued directions to construction sites to install CCTV cameras, whose control will rest with the board for monitoring. Besides, about 70 industrial units using wood and coal as fuel have also been asked to install chimney-facing cameras before October 15. Members of industrial area associations, meanwhile, said that the majority of the units are currently trying to recover from the economic effects of the lockdown, which were taken up in wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease pandemic.“To our estimate, we have about 70% units which are struggling to pay their bank instalments, besides meeting their fixed costs which include paying workers. About 80% of the industrial units have already started using alternate fuel by incurring heavy capital investment. However, there are others which have no huge funds left to invest for switching over,” said Anil Gupta, general secretary of the Ghaziabad Industries Federation. “There are units where CNG or PNG are not a viable source to operate furnace units. Considering the present state of the industrial units, there should be leniency shown by agencies. If we analyse the current scenario, pollution in the region is rising primarily due to instances of stubble burning in nearby states,” he added.The All India Metal Forging Association, Ghaziabad, meanwhile, demanded subsidies to cover the cost of the alternative fuels. “In Ghaziabad, forging units are using hammers which are run by electricity. Considering the electricity rates here in comparison to other states, such units are under burden. The departments want us to run on alternative fuel like PNG. But these require huge investments and our demand is already low in the wake of the pandemic. If 80% subsidy can be provided, it will bring relief to such units,” the association said in a statement. With regard to instances of stubble burning, the Ghaziabad district magistrate on Sunday fixed the responsibility of the sub-divisional magistrates of the respective areas to keep a check on the matter.“They have been asked to brief farmers in their areas to not to indulge in any instance of stubble burning. Besides, the tehsildars, lekhpals and gram chowkidars have also been sensitised to keep a watch in their respective areas. Further, directions have been given to the agricultural department to popularise the use of equipment among farmers which considerably reduces stubble. Farmers can individually purchase such equipment or even resort to community purchase from the agriculture department,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. According to statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agro Ecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory – a Division of Agricultural Physics, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, there have been no instances of stubble burning in Ghaziabad district from October 1 to October 9. There were no instances during the same period in 2019 as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-ahead-of-grap-implementation-pollution-board-gears-up-to-check-industrial-emission/story-orl7EbDppR3hpaJ6ZkzKAL.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Spain consulate staffer cheated of ₹5 lakh by Mumbai landlord||A visa official posted at the consulate general of Spain has filed a complaint with the Cuffe Parade police station against the landlord of a residential flat for duping him of ₹5 lakh. The complainant Haresh Bilani, 48, in his complaint to said that he entered into a 24-month leave-and-license agreement with Alen Franklin on October 22, 2018, for his flat in Jalkiran building at Cuffe Parade. It was decided between the two that Bilani would use the two-bedroom area in the three-bedroom flat, while Franklin would live in the third room. Bilani was paying a monthly rent of ₹60,000 and had also given Franklin a refundable deposit of ₹5 lakh. The complainant also paid to rent furniture in the house. Bilani has alleged that in April 2019, Franklin served him notice, asking him to vacate the flat as he had decided to sell it. Bilani vacated the flat on November 20, 2019, following which Franklin inspected the flat for damages but did not find any, stated the complaint, of which HT has a copy. “As per the leave-and-license agreement, the landlord was supposed to return the deposit money within seven days of the tenant vacating the property. However, Franklin defaulted in refunding the deposit. Bilani sent notices to the accused, but he did not respond to them,” said a police officer from Cuffe Parade police station. Franklin kept avoiding Bilani’s phone calls and the complainant later learnt that Franklin had not sold the flat. Bilani then approached the police, and on October 6, a case was registered under section 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Franklin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/spain-consulate-staffer-cheated-of-5-lakh-by-mumbai-landlord/story-83QY8Bdti1qZrqfkjjNO6I.html

After a steady fall for days, active cases rose to 221,174, a rise of 18 as 221,156 active cases were reported on Saturday. This works out to 14.47% of the total cases reported so far.The death toll went up to 40,349 after 309 casualties were reported. Of them, 169 were in the past 48 hours, another 42 were from last week, while the remaining 98 deaths were from the period before that, the health officials said.The trend of comparatively fewer fresh cases has continued even after three weeks. New cases have not crossed 22,000 a day since September 17 when 24,619 cases were reported. The highest single-day spike in the last month went up to 24,886 cases on September 11, whereas in the 11 days of this month, the sharpest single day rise was recorded at 16,476 cases on October 1.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his address to the state on Sunday said that the situation is changing in the state, but a lackadaisical attitude can reverse it again and thus they are going to be extra-cautious during festivals such as Navratri and Diwali. He said that the state government doesn’t want a situation where it has to re-impose lockdown restrictions just like it is happening in several countries. Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“There is a picture that fresh cases are reducing, as a result, beds are lying vacant in hospitals, but we cannot be careless. I don’t want to re-impose lockdown restrictions just like it is happening in many European countries, United States, Israel etc, where cases had reduced in the past. Britain has imposed fresh restrictions for six months. I don’t want the same situation to arise in Maharashtra,” the chief minister said in his live address on social media platforms.“You decide, you want to wear a mask or have a lockdown. You want all restrictions back or you will follow social distancing,” Thackeray asked.He said that the government will allow more people to travel in local trains. “We have started intrastate trains and have also asked the railways to increase the frequency of local trains.. Once it is done, more people will be allowed to travel in local trains… I don’t want crowding,” the chief minister said.On opening gyms, he said that a proper protocol is needed to ensure it doesn’t lead to a spread in infections. “A protocol has to be prepared before allowing gyms to operate because heart rate increases to maximum level only in gyms and if someone infected is present there, may infect many more people, an aspect that cannot be overlooked,” Thackeray added.He said that they are not opening temples as many festivals are nearing. “Navratri and Diwali are around hence I’m moving slowly towards opening temples. Some have raised a question that if so many things can be opened why not them (temples). Please wait, responsibility is on us and not on you. Moreover, we are doing this because we love our people. We don’t want to spoil the situation. We need to be extra cautious, this is the reason I’m moving ahead step-by-step,” the chief minister said.Also Read| 5 states with most Covid-19 cases contributed more than half of total recoveries: GovtMumbai continues to report the highest number of cases across the state as it recorded 2,170 cases on Sunday, pushing its tally to 229,446.

It has also recorded 42 deaths.The scenario in Mumbai has changed from September when the cases in the city went up and are growing up gradually.On October 7, the city recorded the highest single-day spike of 2,848 cases.The chief minister said he has observed people moving without masks in Mumbai. “In Mumbai, I have observed that many people don’t care about wearing masks. We will be giving a freeway to coronavirus if all the basic precautions are not followed. We will have to follow them strictly, do not ignore even for a moment,” he said.Pune district contributed second-highest infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 679 cases, taking its tally to 69,958, while Pune city became the third-highest contributor with 644 cases pushing its case count to 164,985. The combined total of Pune comes to 1,323 cases.However, Covid-19 casualties are not reducing as expected. Maharashtra still has the highest number of casualties across the country.The chief minister said that they are not getting enough cooperation from the people and pointed out two reasons behind. “Either people are irresponsible or they are scared. They are afraid that if found positive, don’t know where they will be taken by the local authorities. In reality, the situation is different. Check the experience of people who have stayed at Covid Care Centres for treatment. Trust me, there is no reason to worry. The earlier you will come for treatment, the earlier you will be cured. A delay will not only lead your life into danger, but also of your family members as they will also get infected.

12-10-2020||Mumbai||Rare two-headed juvenile shark found by Palghar fisherman||A fisherman from Satpati village in Palghar discovered a baby shark, about six inches in length, with two heads in his by-catch on Friday.Confused by the genetic anomaly, Nitin Patil took a few pictures and videos of the shark before throwing it back into the sea. When he shared the images with other fishermen, he was told that it was a rare anomaly. “We do not eat such small fish, especially sharks, so I thought it was strange but decided to throw it anyway,” said Patil.Another fisherman, Umesh Palekar said, “We have never seen anything like this before. We believe one of the larger sharks may have given birth to this double-headed shark baby. We shared the images with researchers from the Indian Council for Agricultural Research - Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (ICAR-CMFRI), Mumbai.”CMFRI scientists and other marine biologists confirmed it was a very rare documentation and could be the first along the Maharashtra coastline for a double-headed shark species. “Our records show that double-headed sharks are very rarely reported along the Indian coast. This species appears to be the embryo of the spadenose shark (Scoliodon laticaudus) from the Carcharhinidae family or a sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon species). Both are viviparous [birthing live young which have developed inside the body of the parent], and are common in Maharashtra waters,” said Dr Akhilesh KV, scientist, ICAR-CMFRI, MumbaiDr Akhilesh said the heads were joined behind the gills and such two-headed sharks were quite rare in the wild. “These are also called dicephaly. This phenomenon is reported in several animal species including sharks, possibly due to mutation or any other embryonic malformation, disorders, and these are very rare reports. Similar cases are reported elsewhere outside the northern Indian Ocean. These materials should be preserved out of scientific interest,” he said.According to CMFRI records, a similar two-headed milk shark (Rhizoprionodon acutus) was reported from Gujarat in 1964, while a two-headed spadenose shark was reported from Karwar in 1991, and a double-headed cownose ray was reported from Andhra Pradesh in 1984.In 2008, a fisherman discovered a two-headed blue shark embryo in the Indian Ocean, as reported by National Geographic.Marine biologist Swapnil Tandel said the recently documented species seemed to be a spadenose shark and could be the first record of this species in a dicephalic condition (double-headed) from along Maharashtra waters. “These finds are so rare that it is difficult to find a cause for the anomaly. Genetic or metabolic disorders, viruses, pollution or overfishing could be the possible reasons. If two-headed fetuses are more prevalent in nature, then overfishing is a strong culprit as it may cause the gene pool to shrink,” he said.E Vivekanandan, emeritus scientist, ICAR-CMFRI said these species have a very low survival rate. “There are hardly any documentations of this species as adults. This finding is purely an aberration. We cannot attribute it to any exact reason. It is regularly seen for snake species or conjoined or Siamese twins in humans. In maximum cases, they do not survive beyond the juvenile stage, but it definitely opens up an avenue for much needed research.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rare-two-headed-juvenile-shark-found-by-palghar-fisherman/story-KeeBtNOgY0WM9zdppCx6GJ.html
12-10-2020||Mumbai||8 beaches in India get international recognition for cleanliness, coastal development||Eight Indian beaches have been conferred with the blue flag certification, the Union environment ministry said on Sunday. The certification is a voluntary eco-label for the cleanest and most developed coastal areas in the world awarded by a Denmark-based jury of the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE). Until now, no beach in India had qualified for it, while only a few Asian beaches had been conferred the certification. The beaches are Shivrajpur (Gujarat), Ghoghla (Diu), Kasarkod (Karnataka), Padubidri (Karnataka), Kappad (Kerala), Rushikonda (Andhra Pradesh), Golden (Odisha) & Radhanagar (Andaman). According to the environment ministry, no blue flag nation has ever achieved tags for eight beaches in one attempt, while India is also the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to have achieved this feat within a time-frame of two years. “This is a proud moment for India as all eight beaches recommended by the government have received the coveted international blue flag certification. India is now in the league of 50 blue flag nations globally and we take pride in this superlative performance of our nation,” said Prakash Javadekar, Union environment minister. HT had reported September 19 that all eight beaches vying for the certification had witnessed and 82% reduction in marine litter and 84% reduction in plastic between June 2018 and May 2020, according to Beach Environment and Aesthetics Management Services (BEAMS) report based on efforts undertaken by the nodal agency for the certification - the Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM) under the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC). Sanjai Jalla, mission leader of the programme, said, “The international jury comprising eminent members United Nations Environment Program, UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), FEE, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) etc. have conveyed their decision in the jury meeting held on October 6 for awarding all eight candidate beaches as recommended by India.” In June, a national jury comprising scientists and environmentalists recommended these eight beaches to the international jury after examination that all blue flag criteria were being met by them. Jalla said apart from India, Japan, South Korea and United Arab Emirates were the only other nations who had been conferred the certification with a couple of beaches, however, in a time-frame of about five to six years. “India has also been awarded the third prize for ‘international best practices’ on pollution control in coastal regions,” he said. FEE initiated the certification process from France in 1985. Beaches have to meet 33 criteria to achieve the certification which include environment education and information (seven criteria), environment management (15 criteria), bathing water quality (six criteria), safety and services (five criteria). MoEFCC had originally identified 13 pilot beaches for the certification in 2018, but work is yet to commence for selected beaches at Lakshadweep, Maharashtra and Goa, while efforts are underway at Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. “These beaches have been planned to be taken up for certification next year under our vision agenda to develop and deliver 100 more beaches under the second phase of our Integrated Coastal Zone Management project over the next five years,” said Jalla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/8-beaches-in-india-get-international-recognition-for-cleanliness-development/story-AcxOjq1BvxC5VSQgguma9M.html
12-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Nitish’s virtual campaign through party’s dedicated platform kicks off from Monday||Before the ground campaign, chief minister Nitish Kumar’s virtual campaign will get underway from Monday through the party’s dedicated digital platform, JDUlive.com. It will also be available on Facebook.In three days, he will cover 35 seats where the JD(U), and not its allies, has put up candidates. However, many of those seats are such where the LJP has fielded candidates, including those who shifted from the BJP after the seats went to the JD(U), to create the possibility of a triangular contest. Kumar, who is also also the national president of the JD(U), will kick off the ground campaign from October 14, said a party leader, who did not want to be quoted. With Durga Puja also starting from October 17, the parties have very little time for rallies and public meetings this time.On Monday, he will get online at 5 pm and address workers and general public of 11 Assembly seats - Sultanganj, Amarpur, Dhoriya, Belhar, Tarapur, Jamalpur, Suryagarha, Sheikhpura, Barbigha, Nawada and Govindpur - spread across six districts.On September 7, Kumar had launched the party’s virtual platform with ‘Nischal Samvad’. The virtual election campaign has also been given the same name with a tag line ‘Saksham Bihar, Swablambi Bihar’ and slogan, ‘Nyay ke saath tarakki, Nitish ki baat pakki (development with justice, that is what makes Nitish’s words assuring)’.Also read: Raghopur, Hasanpur seats to decide fate of Lalu’s two sonsOn Tuesday, the chief minister will address people in another five districts and cover 11 Vidhan Sabha seats of Mokama, Masaurhi, Paliganj, Kurtha, Jehanabad, Ghosi, Sandesh, Avignon, Jagdishpur, Dumraon and Rajpur. On Wednesday, he will cover another 13 constituencies in four districts, this time in Chenari, Sasaram, Kargahar, Dinara, Nokha, Obra, Nabinagar, Rafiganj, Sherghati, Belaganj, Atri, Jhajha and Chakai. Kumar’s words will be significant as in 2020 he finds himself in a strange situation with new equations emerging and for the first time since 2005, he will be facing the attack not as much from the but from within. NDA’s ally at the Centre, the LJP, which hitherto was content enjoying the moment being on the right side, has suddenly got up to challenge Nitish’s authority, even though the BJP continues to back him and has announced him the CM candidate, irrespective of the number of seats it wins. BJP president JP Nadda also talked about the development Bihar has made under Nitish Kumar’s governance after the abysmal run under the RJD regime.With an open letter ahead of his campaigning earlier this week, Nitish made it clear that he would count on his work to seek people’s support. Through his letter, he gave a brief account of how his government has been able to bring about a positive change in Bihar since 2005 due to “development with justice, peace and amity” and that he is likely to stick to his development agenda, which party leaders say cannot be matched by the Opposition. “Better connectivity from all parts of the state to Patna, electricity to all, 10 lakh women self-help groups (SHGs) under Jeevika, 50 percent quota to women in panchayati raj institutions (PRIs), welfare schemes for minorities and weaker sections of the society, social campaigns against prohibition, child marriage and dowry, Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali campaign to reduce the impact of climate change, management of Covid-19 and return of Bihar labourers,” the CM said while listing out the work carried out by his government and also talked about the ‘Seven Resolves – 2’ of his new term.Political analyst and former head, department of economics, Patna University, Nawal Kishore Choudhary said it was quite natural for the CM to recount his work, especially in the prevailing political atmosphere, to deflect the pressure being built on him. “He knows this election may not be a cakewalk, though he may again get through. This is what politics is all about and Nitish Kumar knows it. He has his work to bank on and that is what he will rightly do,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-nitish-s-virtual-campaign-through-party-s-dedicated-platform-kicks-off-from-monday/story-eJ8WcyTuV6xd0buIPJaEPM.html

12-10-2020||Pune||Pune’s daily Covid tally remains under 1,000-mark for past one week||Pune’s tally of daily positive Covid-19 cases has been below the 1,000-mark for the past one week, bringing some respite to the civic administration battling the pandemic for the past seven months. This is for the first time after July, when cases have remained under the 1,000-mark throughout the week even as number of tests have been in the range of 4,000-4,600 barring Sunday, when it sees a drop due to it been the weekend. The city’s positivity rate, which was 30.5% in the first week of September and 23.9% at the beginning of October has dropped to 20.39% during October 2 to October 11 (see box). With the daily caseload falling at a time when the state government has increased the bed capacity in the city and rest of the district, the number of non-oxygen beds to remain vacant by October 15 are expected to be 13,020 while oxygen beds to remain unoccupied will be 763, according to the administration’s projection. The projection, prepared based on the statistical model by IIT Bombay and other experts, also indicates 243 ventilators and 1,185 ICU beds to be vacant by mid-October as the situation eases. The drop in the number of daily cases and positivity rate is being observed even after the state government has allowed restaurants and bars to operate their dine-in facility since October 5. With shop timings also increased and most sectors, including hotel industry and travel allowed, there’s increased crowd in the market, which has prompted the administration to ask the citizens to exercise caution. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of the Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “It is too early to say that the infection is coming under control. The government has only recently opened restaurants and bars and there are festivals planned in the future. It is true that the number of cases is falling daily, but we will know the exact situation only after Diwali.” Despite several attempts, the Pune Municipal Corporation additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal and Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao were unavailable for comment on the bed projections. “With most things open, many people are stepping out of their home. However, it has been seen that people are still not wearing masks,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said during his Pune visit on Friday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray too on Sunday asked people in the state to be careful and follow norms. “While the cases have dropped in the past few days, people need to be careful,” said Thackeray in his public addresses aired on social media. Thackeray’s caution came a day after Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday indicated that by the end of November, remaining restrictions under the lockdown will also be lifted in the state and all sectors will be allowed to reopen. Tope had said, that the government is now planning to give permission of reopening schools and religious places in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/city-s-daily-covid-tally-remains-under-1-000-mark-for-past-one-week/story-0XsVyquCKghDiF2uR6yVWI.html
12-10-2020||Pune||Maha state excise department imposes Rs 2.30 lakh fine on 23 hotels for Covid-19 norm violations||The Pune unit of the Maharashtra state excise department has taken action against 23 establishments, including 21 hotels, one wine shop and a countrymade liquor shop, for violating social distancing guidelines and endangering the lives of customers amidst the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the past 48 hours. An aggregate fine of Rs 10,000 each has been imposed on these establishments. The total fine is estimated to be worth Rs 2.30 lakh and it will be deposited in the state treasury soon, Pune excise department officials said.State excise SP Santosh Zagade said that the action was taken as per the directions of the district collector who had issued a set of safety guidelines to be followed by such establishments. “We will be taking more such action based on the state government public health and safety guidelines. The establishment owners must adhere to the law and ensure that necessary physical distance and other safety measures are in place while they are operating.”State excise department officials during their surprise raids on the establishments found that the norms were being flouted openly. The officials observed and recorded that the social distancing norms were being violated by all establishments which prompted them to take action.The state exercise department has issued a written notice to the hotel and bar owners stating that in the first instance they will be fined up to an amount of Rs 10,000, for the second and third instance the fine amount will be Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 respectively. If the violations continue after three warnings, then their licences would be suspended, said Zagade. Meanwhile, district collector’s office has backed the excise department and maintained that crackdown on violators must continue to protect citizens health.The Maharashtra government permitted hotels, beer bars, food malls and restaurants to reopen from October 5. The state government made it mandatory for these establishments to follow public safety norms related to the Covid-19 and accordingly issued guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection due to unnecessary crowding of citizens during normal business activities. All hotels and other hospitality units have been instructed to take suitable measures to restrict any further transmission of Covid-19 while providing the services. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) aims to minimise all possible physical contact between staff and guests and maintain social distancing and other preventive and safety measures against Covid-19.The Pune district administration officials issued guidelines on October 7 which state that the establishments have to ensure only 50 per cent customer seating inside the premises, strictly follow social distancing norms, wearing of masks, using sanitisers, hygienic housekeeping practices and temperature screening of all by using thermal guns and special care must be taken to ensure that the physical distance is maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-excise-department-imposes-rs-2-30-lakh-fine-on-23-hotels-for-covid-19-norm-violations/story-8Pkcu03rLofsZKqHayUaeN.html
12-10-2020||World||Coronavirus may stay for weeks on banknotes and touchscreens||The new coronavirus may remain infectious for weeks on banknotes, glass and other common surfaces, according to research by Australia’s top biosecurity laboratory that highlights risks from paper currency, touchscreen devices and grab handles and rails.Scientists at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness showed SARS-CoV-2 is “extremely robust,” surviving for 28 days on smooth surfaces such as glass found on mobile phone screens and plastic banknotes at room temperature, or 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit). That compares with 17 days survival for the flu virus.Virus survival declined to less than a day at 40 degrees Celsius on some surfaces, according to the study, published in Virology Journal. The findings add to evidence that the Covid-19-causing coronavirus survives for longer in cooler weather, making it potentially harder to control in winter than summer. The research also helps to more accurately predict and mitigate the pandemic’s spread, the scientists said.“Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious on surfaces for long periods of time, reinforcing the need for good practices such as regular hand washing and cleaning surfaces,” said co-author Debbie Eagles, the center’s deputy director, in an emailed statement Monday.The coronavirus is transmitted mostly through direct contact with an infected person, especially the virus-laden particles they emit while coughing, sneezing, speaking, singing and even breathing. SARS-CoV-2 may also contaminate surfaces when these particles settle, creating so-called fomites that the researchers said may play a lesser, though important role in transmission of the virus.“It does raise some critical issues around the need to keep on disinfecting surfaces, even when community cases are low,” said Trevor Drew, the center’s director and another co-author, in an interview. “We still need to carry out those disinfection regimes, both personally and at a public level, even when there don’t seem to be any cases around because theremay well be some residual virus that you’ve missed.”SARS-CoV-2 spread via fomites is plausible, researchers at Kansas State University said in a study released ahead of publication and peer review in August. They analyzed the coronavirus’s stability on a dozen surfaces and found it survived five-to-seven times longer under cooler, less-humid spring/fall conditions compared with the average temperature and humidity in summer.‘Big Surprise’The finding bodes badly for controlling Covid-19 during the Northern Hemisphere winter, said virologist Juergen Richt, who led the research. “If we couldn’t control it very well during the summer, we are in for a big surprise,” Richt said in an interview.Scientists at the Australian government laboratory have determined virus survival previously for hundreds of different viruses. They found in the case of SARS-CoV-2 that it survives longer on nonporous or smooth surfaces, compared with porous complex surfaces, such as cotton.The research received funding from Australia’s defense department. It involved drying the coronavirus in an artificial mucus on different surfaces, at concentrations similar to those reported in samples from infected patients, and then re-isolating the virus over a month. The study was also carried out in the dark, to remove the effect of ultraviolet light, as research has demonstrated direct sunlight can rapidly inactivate the virus.The time taken to achieve a 90% reduction in the amount of virus present on the surfaces studied under different temperatures is tabled below:“While the precise role of surface transmission, the degree of surface contact and the amount of virus required for infection is yet to be determined, establishing how long this virus remains viable on surfaces is critical for developing risk mitigation strategies in high contact areas,” Eagles said.Transmission RiskThe persistence on glass is an important finding, given that touchscreen devices such as mobile phones, bank ATMs, supermarket self-serve checkouts and airport check-in kiosks are high touch surfaces which may not be regularly cleaned and therefore pose a transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, the researchers said in the paper.They found the longer survival time of SARS-CoV-2 than seasonal flu on banknotes “of particular significance, considering the frequency of circulation and the potential for transfer of viable virus both between individuals and geographic locations.”Before SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic, China had started decontaminating its paper currency, suggesting concerns over transmission via paper banknotes existed at the time, the researchers said, noting that the U.S. and South Korea have also quarantined bank notes as a result of the pandemic.The survival of the coronavirus on stainless steel at cooler temperatures may help explain Covid-19 outbreaks linked to meat processing and cold storage facilities, the authors said. Their data support the findings of a study showing the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on fresh and frozen food as well, they said.A reduction in temperature to about 6 degrees Celsius correlates with about a 10-fold increase in the virus’s survival, Drew said. Blood and oils associated with fresh meat and fish processing and handling may also help to preserve the virus.“It’s going to survive for much longer in cooler conditions, and that’s irrespective of whether it’s on a surface or whether it’s in the air,” Drew said. “This may help to explain why the sort of environments, such as slaughterhouses, would be potentially a more hazardous area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-may-stay-for-weeks-on-banknotes-and-touchscreens/story-bca77EGNC8p6rr6J9Z3QEM.html
12-10-2020||World||Health care is focus as Barrett Supreme Court hearing opens||Senate Democrats branded Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett a threat to Americans’ health care during the coronavirus pandemic Monday at the start of a fast-tracked hearing that Republicans are confident will end with Barrett’s confirmation to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before Election Day.In a competing effort to approvingly define the 48-year-old Barrett, who sat silent and wearing a face mask, Republican senators called President Donald Trump’s pick a thoughtful judge with impeccable credentials.Barring a dramatic development, Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm Barrett to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. If she is confirmed quickly she could be on the Supreme Court when it hears the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, a week after the election.One after another, Democrats sought to tie her nomination to the upcoming court case.“They are trying to get a justice onto the court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act,” said Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Harris, speaking from her Senate office because of Covid-19 concerns, also said the confirmation should not go forward so close to the election, especially after millions have voted.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said the nomination is a “judicial torpedo aimed” at the law’s protection for people with pre-existing health conditions among its provisions. The Trump administration wants the court to strike down the entire law popularly known as “Obamacare” on Nov. 10. Barrett has criticized the court’s two earlier major rulings supporting the law.Among Republicans, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, dismissed warnings Barrett will undo the Obama-era healthcare law as “outrageous.”Trump himself seemed to be watching, tweeting several times about the hearing. In one message, he tweeted that he’d have a “FAR BETTER” health care plan, with lower costs and protections for pre-existing conditions. But he has not, as yet, discussed an actual health care plan.Republicans also warned against making Barrett’s Catholicism an issue in the confirmation debate, especially in regard to her stance on abortion, with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri lambasting what he called a “pattern and practice of religious bigotry” by Democrats. However, Democratic senators made clear in advance of the hearing that they didn’t plan to question the judge on the specifics of her religious faith.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, also a practicing Catholic, told reporters ahead of a campaign trip to Ohio that he doesn’t think “there’s any question about her faith.”The Senate Judiciary Committee, meeting on a federal holiday, kicked off four days of statements and testimony in an environment that has been altered by the coronavirus pandemic. Some senators were taking part remotely, and the hearing room itself was arranged with health concerns in mind.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., opened the hearing acknowledging “the COVID problem in America is real.” But he said, “We do have a country that needs to move forward safely.”Graham acknowledged the obvious: “This is going to be a long, contentious week.”Protesters rallied outside the Senate buildings with the hearing room largely closed to the public. Capitol Police said 22 people were arrested and charged on suspicion of crowding, obstructing or other violations.Barrett, a federal appeals court judge, was to tell senators that she is “forever grateful” for Ginsburg’s trailblazing path as a woman. But she is resolved to maintain the perspective of her own mentor, the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and “apply the law as written,” according to her prepared opening remarks for the hearings.“Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” Barrett says in the remarks, which The Associated Press obtained.Republicans are moving at a breakneck pace to seat Barrett before the Nov. 3 election to secure Trump’s pick, which would put her on the bench for any election-related challenges.Democrats are trying in vain to delay the fast-track confirmation by raising fresh concerns about the safety of meeting during the pandemic after two GOP senators on the panel tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, one of those who tested positive, was in the hearing room Monday after his spokesman said he was symptom-free. The other affected senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, was participating remotely, though he too is symptom-free, his spokesman said. Both tested positive 10 days ago.Trump chose Barrett after the death last month of Ginsburg, a liberal icon. It’s the opportunity to entrench a conservative majority on the court for years to come with his third justice.Outside groups are pushing Democrats to make a strong case against what they call an illegitimate confirmation, when people are already voting in some states, saying the winner of the presidency should make the pick. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential contest.The country will get an extended look at Barrett over the next three days in hearings like none other during the heated election environment and the pandemic limiting public access.Faith and family punctuate her testimony, and she said would bring “a few new perspectives” as the first mother of school-age children on the nine-member court.Barrett says she uses her children as a test when deciding cases, asking herself how she would view the decision if one of her children were the party she was ruling against.“Even though I would not like the result, would I understand that the decision was fairly reasoned and grounded in the law?” she says in the prepared remarks.A Roman Catholic, she says she believes in the “power of prayer.” Barrett’s religious views and past leadership role in a Catholic faith community pose a challenge for Democrats as they try to probe her judicial approach to abortion, gay marriage and other social issues without veering into inappropriate questions of her faith.Ordinarily, Barrett would get to show off her family and seven children. But the White House event announcing her nomination, in which most of the audience did not wear masks, has been labeled a “superspreader” for the coronavirus.More than two dozen people linked to the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event, including the two GOP senators, have contracted COVID-19 since then. Barrett and her family went maskless at the event. She and her husband, Jesse, tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, two administration officials have said.Democrats already were enraged that Republicans are moving so quickly having refused to consider President Barack Obama nominee in February 2016, well before that year’s election.Barrett is the most openly anti-abortion Supreme Court nominee in decades and her vote could provide a majority to restrict if not overturn abortion rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-care-is-focus-as-barrett-supreme-court-hearing-opens/story-nAFboaeNtODSjYhXkyRYZM.html
12-10-2020||World||Iran shatters single-day record for new deaths, coronavirus cases||For the second day in a row, Iran shattered its single-day record for new deaths and infections from the coronavirus, with 272 people confirmed dead among more than 4,200 new cases on Monday.Like in many other countries, the spiraling outbreak in Iran reflects the government’s contradictory virus response. This month, as the daily recorded death toll reached the triple digits, authorities announced tighter restrictions for the hard-hit capital of Tehran. Recently reopened universities and schools, as well as libraries, mosques, cinemas, museums and beauty salons, shut down. On Saturday, the government mandated that all Tehran residents wear face masks outdoors and in public places, warning violators would be fined. Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei promised those who tested positive would be closely tracked.And yet enforcement and measures like contact-tracing in the country of 80 million remain a challenge. Those who disobey face fines of just 500,000 riyals, or $1.60, roughly the price of a burger downtown. Many residents, tired of staying home, now ignore the rules about masks and social distancing to pack indoor cafes and restaurants. As residents defy coronavirus precautions and the government resists a lockdown to salvage its economy, Iran’s caseload is skyrocketing.Iran’s health minister Saeed Namaki made an appeal on Sunday for harsher punishments, according to the state-run IRNA news agency, noting the meager fines for maskless residents would do nothing to boost vigilance. Lamenting that the health ministry’s 7,000 inspectors couldn’t handle the sprawling city of over 10 million, he empowered the police and Basij forces, a paramilitary wing of the Revolutionary Guard used for internal security, to help enforce pandemic rules. In the coming weeks, Namaki added, authorities plan to extend the mask mandate to other major cities.Iran emerged early in the pandemic as a global epicenter of the virus and has since seen the worst outbreak in the Middle East, with more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 28,800 deaths. Leaders first played down the virus’s risks and, as hospitals filled up, international experts suspected Iran was hiding the true number of infections and deaths. Authorities have since admitted that the outbreak is more severe than reported, with a recent parliamentary report putting the number of infections at “eight to 10 times” higher than official numbers.Movement restrictions this spring somewhat checked the spread of the disease. Then the government swiftly reopened the country, desperate to boost its stricken economy. Since June, the case count has steadily increased — and spiked to new heights in recent weeks.Long before the virus hit, Iran’s economy was ailing, pummeled by U.S. sanctions after the Trump administration’s unilateral withdrawal in 2018 from Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers. As the death toll soared on Sunday, the nation’s currency plunged to its lowest level ever, following the U.S. administration’s decision last week to blacklist Iranian banks that had so far escaped the bulk of re-imposed American sanctions.As in the White House, where U.S. President Donald Trump and a growing circle of his aides and staff recently tested positive for the coronavirus, the disease has spread to the highest levels of Iran’s government, even killing a senior adviser of the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A number of Cabinet ministers have contracted the virus, as well as top officials including senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri and Vice President Massoumeh Ebtekar. The head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who had urged the public not to panic over its spread was among the first officials to contract the virus in late February. On Sunday, local media reported the head of the country’s atomic energy organization and the country’s vice president in charge of budget and planning had also tested positive for the virus.Iran’s initial outbreak coincided with major political events — the 41st anniversary of its 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought its clerical leadership to power, as well as parliamentary elections in which the government desperately sought to boost turnout. Religious considerations also played a role in the Shiite theocracy as authorities declined for weeks to close shrines where the faithful touch or kiss the tombs’ protective bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-shatters-single-day-record-for-new-deaths-coronavirus-cases/story-Hiqnd7mgKAnEBDNXoNN5jM.html
12-10-2020||World||More UK areas under new Covid curbs as cases surge||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday unveiled a new three-tier system of local Covid-19 restrictions in north England as the number of cases and hospital admissions surged beyond those in March, when the first nationwide lockdown was imposed.The three levels of the new system are: One baseline, minimum restrictions applicable to all of England, fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 population; Two, triggered when a rise in transmission cannot be contained, cases above 100 per 100,000 population; Three, triggered when level two measures have not contained the virus, or when there has been a significant rise in transmission.There were 13,972 new cases as of Monday evening – nearly three times the daily peaks of April and May – and 50 new deaths. Overall, the number of UK-wide cases touched 617,688, with 42,875 deaths.Johnson set out the measures in the House of Commons as top government advisers went on television to describe the surge in its various dimensions and announced that emergency hospitals set up earlier this year are being put on stand-by to deal with new admissions.Johnson said he did not agree with those who recommended another national lockdown, since it would deprive children and students of education, among other social and economic implications. Instead, the three-tier system will be implemented at local levels.The Liverpool city region has been placed in Tier Three due to high infection rates in recent weeks, while Nottinghamshire and Cheshire are in Tier Two. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality centres in areas under Tier Three will remain closed.“I must warn the House the weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country,” Johnson told MPs. “I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed.” Labour leader Keir Starmer said he remained “deeply skeptical” of the new plans announced, adding he was not convinced that Johnson had a strategy to deal with the disease. Public confidence in the government had been eroded, he said.Three emergency hospitals – called ‘Nightingale’ hospitals – have been asked to stand by in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate, ready to admit people with Covid-19 or other conditions to relieve pressure on the National Health Service.In a briefing described a ‘grim’, government advisers Stephen Powis and Jonathan Van-Tam outlined the scale of new infections, deaths and hospital admissions. Van-Tam said: “Unfortunately the virus thrives on what we like most, which is human contact…We have increasingly strong evidence about shouting and singing as pressure points on the virus, in terms of making the expulsion of virus-laden particles go further and the transmission therefore to become more intense.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-uk-areas-under-new-covid-curbs-as-cases-surge/story-d6faDBJdODsQEKGK9EB32J.html

It is also Facebook’s latest attempt to take action against conspiracy theories and misinformation ahead of the US presidential election on November 3.“We’ve long taken down posts that praise hate crimes or mass murder, including the Holocaust. But with rising anti-Semitism, we’re expanding our policy to prohibit any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust as well. If people search for the Holocaust on Facebook, we’ll start directing you to authoritative sources to get accurate information,” Zuckerberg said in a blog post on Monday.Also read | Facebook set to tighten rules on what its staff can discussZuckerberg said that he believes the new policy strikes the “right balance” in drawing the lines between what is and isn’t acceptable speech. “I’ve struggled with the tension between standing for free expression and the harm caused by minimizing or denying the horror of the Holocaust. My own thinking has evolved as I’ve seen data showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies on hate speech,” he wrote.“Enforcement of these policies cannot happen overnight. There is a range of content that can violate these policies, and it will take some time to train our reviewers and systems on enforcement,” he said.

12-10-2020||World||Pak former president Asif Ali Zardari hospitalised||Former Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari, who is out on bail after being charged in several corruption cases, was admitted to hospital in Karachi after he complained of feeling unwell. He was indicted last week in the Park Lane properties and Thatta water supply cases, and had pleaded not guilty.A spokesperson for Zardari said that doctors are conducting necessary medical tests in a private hospital in Karachi.Zardari is being tried in different corruption cases launched by the government through the anti-corruption watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).On October 5, an accountability court indicted Zardari in the Park Lane properties and Thatta water supply cases.During the hearing, the PPP leader pleaded not guilty. The court also indicted 19 other accused in the Park Lane and 15 accused in the Thatta water supply cases.On September 28, an Islamabad accountability court had indicted Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur, and other accused in a supplementary reference filed against them by NAB in a mega-money laundering scam.On September 23, the court had dismissed the ex-president’s applications seeking acquittal in the three supplementary references.Zardari’s hospitalisation comes ahead of a planned national agitation by a joint front of 11 Pakistani opposition parties, including his PPP, against the Imran Khan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-former-president-asif-ali-zardari-hospitalised/story-RqKIosA1yA0LFh62pSoDsM.html
12-10-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic leads to high level of stress, less employee engagement: Study||Researchers have suggested coronavirus pandemic may lead people to ponder their own mortality. This study suggested these people were the ones who showed the highest levels of stress and the least engagement at work. But the research also uncovered a bright spot: The right kind of boss helped reduce stress and increase engagement and pro-social behavior in their workers who were anxious about COVID-19.The researchers conducted three studies in China and the United States, which was published online recently in the Journal of Applied Psychology.“A global pandemic can lead some people to think about their own mortality, which will understandably make them more stressed and less engaged at work,” said Jia (Jasmine) Hu, lead author of the study and associate professor of management and human resources at The Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business.“But business leaders who are attentive to employees’ emotional needs and unite them behind a common purpose made a positive difference and helped workers stay engaged at work and contribute to their communities.”One study involved 163 workers at an information technology company in eastern China who filled out surveys twice a day over three weeks while cases of COVID-19 were surging in the country.The results projected that the employees felt more anxious on the thought about COVID-19 related deaths and the less engaged they were in their jobsBut the employees’ anxiety and engagement were influenced by the type of boss they had. Employees did better if their boss exhibited what is called ‘servant leadership.’ As the name implies, servant leaders prioritize fulfillment of others’ needs, attend to employees’ emotional suffering, work to empower employees, and emphasize serving the community.Employees in the study rated on a scale of 1 to 7 of how much ‘My supervisor makes my career development a priority’ and other statements that measured servant leadership.Those who rated their supervisors higher on servant leadership showed less anxiety and were more engaged with their jobs than other employees, Hu said.“Servant leaders care about their employees’ well-being and prioritize their personal growth and happiness at their jobs,” she said. “These types of leaders made it easier for their employees to deal with the anxiety associated with the pandemic.”But servant leaders did more than that, they helped their employees channel their stress into positive behaviors.The findings showed that employees who rated their bosses as higher on servant leadership were more likely to report that they engaged in pro-social behavior, such as volunteering for a charitable group in their community.“Servant leaders encouraged their employees to find meaning in the pandemic by channeling their anxiety into helping less fortunate people in their communities,” Hu said.These results were confirmed in two US studies in which participants were told to imagine they were consultants advising a retail company on how to increase sales. The researchers recruited Americans online who said they had full-time jobs.In both studies, the researchers had participants first read about COVID-19. Half read the information that was designed to make them think about how dangerous and deadly the disease is. The other half read less stressful information about COVID-19, such as how to prevent transmission.Half of the participants read a scenario in which their boss exhibited servant leadership and other half read a scenario in which their boss was less supportive.In one of the two studies, the researchers asked specifically about how much participants were worried about their own deaths.Results were similar to the study in the Chinese company.Those who read the more alarming news about COVID-19 reported more anxiety - general anxiety in study two and anxiety related to their own death in study three - than those who read the neutral news.But once again, in both American studies, those who had servant leaders in their scenarios showed less anxiety, even after reading about how deadly the disease was. Similarly, in Chinese employees, the type of leadership had an impact on pro-social behavior.Overall, the three studies showed that companies play an important role in helping their employees cope with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hu said, which benefits both the firms and their communities.“We found that the servant leaders who keep their employees’ well-being as a top concern can help their anxious workers stay engaged at work and encourage them to contribute to the broader community,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-leads-to-high-level-of-stress-less-employee-engagement-study/story-3gjqPM2rd5RmCU3RM3ZIyN.html

Lt Gen (retd) Asim Saleem Bajwa resigned as special assistant on information and broadcasting but will continue to be the chairperson of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority. Bajwa confirmed on Twitter that his request for stepping down as special assistant had been approved by Prime Minister Khan. The Pakistani premier had refused to accept the resignation when Bajwa put in his papers in August.“I requested the honourable Prime Minister to relinquish me from the additional portfolio of SAPM on Info & broadcasting. He very kindly approved my request,” Bajwa tweeted.On August 27, Facts Focus—a website run by local journalists—published a story claiming that Bajwa’s family had set up 99 companies spanning four countries, including a pizza franchise with 133 outlets.The website further claimed that Bajwa’s wife was a shareholder in at least 86 companies. Of them, 71 were set up in the US, seven in the UAE and four in Canada. In response, in an extensive statement shared on Twitter, Bajwa said all the allegations levelled against him and his family in the report were “materially false”.Bajwa has earlier served as director general of the military’s public relations wing –the Inter-Services Public Relations—from 2012 to 2016 and as commander of the Pakistan Army’s southern command before his retirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-s-close-aide-resigns-after-investigative-report-on-wealth/story-nDpi7e9ccZbsUSXHjEYVGM.html
12-10-2020||World||FATF regional group keeps Pak in ‘follow-up list’ as govt dials friendly countries||FATF’s regional group for Asia-Pacific has retained Pakistan in its ‘Enhanced Follow Up’ list due to the country’s poor compliance on terror financing and money laundering.Pakistan fully complied with only two of the 40 recommendations of Financial Action Task Force, said the 14-page follow-up report from the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) released on Monday ahead of the FATF plenary on October 21-23. That meeting will decide if Pakistan should be retained on the Paris-based watchdog’s ‘grey list’.Based on its review until February this year, the APG noted that Pakistan was non-compliant on four counts, partially complied with 24 recommendations, and was largely compliant on nine. “Whilst Pakistan published a National Risk Assessment (NRA) on Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing in 2017, the mutual evaluation report (MER) identified gaps in the process of developing and identifying threats, vulnerabilities and risks. The assessment of terrorist-financing risk was identified as ‘perfunctory only’,” the APG report said.“The MER also found that the 2017 NRA had not yet been widely circulated to private sector stakeholders and that sectors assessed as higher risk or higher vulnerability in Pakistan were not yet subject to comprehensive Anti-money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT) measures.” Pakistan will remain in “enhanced (expedited) follow-up” and will have to “continue to report back to the APG on progress to strengthen its implementation of AML/CFT measures,” it added.Ahead of the crucial FATF meeting, Islamabad is reaching out to friendly FATF member states to seek their support, local media reported.Over the weekend, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan would participate in the virtual meeting on the FATF to be held in Paris and hoped it would upgrade the country to its white list.Qureshi telephoned his Saudi, Turkish and Malaysian counterparts to brief them about Pakistan’s “significant progress” to implement the FATF’s plan of action, the reports said.Officials in Islamabad have said that Pakistan is unlikely to be placed on the FATF’s black list given that it has the support of at least three countries --China, Malaysia and Turkey-- to veto any such move.

12-10-2020||World||‘Will go in handcuffs’: PoK ‘PM’ accused of sedition pans Imran Khan||Pakistan-occupied Kashmir leader Raja Farooq Haider on Monday said the sedition case filed against him and leaders of the Pakistan Muslim Leage-Nawaz had “hurt” him and vowed to present himself in handcuffs if he is summoned by the Imran Khan government. The case was registered against Raja Farooq Haider, the so-called prime minister of PoK, as part of a crackdown on opposition leaders ahead of their planned joint rally and nationwide protest movement later this month. The protests are seen as the worst crisis being faced by Prime Minister Imran Khan.Last Monday, sedition cases were registered against ousted former premier Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and PoK ‘PM’ Raja Farooq Haider. The same day, a court in Islamabad charged former president Asif Ali Zardari in two corruption cases.The case against Haider had particularly riled political circles in Pakistan, as Khan often attempts to portray himself as the saviour of Kashmir and Kashmiris.Journalist Hamid Mir had said in a tweet that Khan “always claimed to be an ambassador of Kashmiris,” while slamming the move.Khan has repeatedly blamed India for the opposition’s moves against his government and their criticism of the overbearing role played by the country’s military leadership, which Nawaz Sharif had described as a ‘state above the state’.In an interview to Geo New channel on Monday, the PoK ‘PM’ specifically blamed Imran Khan for the case against him. A sedition case can only be filed on the instructions of the prime minister, Haider told the channel, noting that even Fatima Jinnah, known as Pakistan’s Mader-e-Millat (Mother of the Nation), had once been dubbed a traitor. That tradition continues, he said.Haider also lamented the statement by Khan, who branded most leaders of the 11-party opposition alliance, Pakistan Democratic Movement, as agents of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Imran Khan has also attempted to link New Delhi to the continuing sectarian violence in the country.Haider said Imran Khan’s move would weaken the ‘federation’ of Pakistan.“To file sedition charges against opposition party leaders or to brand them traitors is wrong and hurtful,” he said.Haider said that politics was being given precedence over Pakistan, adding people of PoK “had tremendous respect for the Pakistan PM but such statements create uncertainty.”Haider’s comments came even as the federal government continued to insist that the sedition cases were registered not at the instance of the state or its institutions, but on a complaint by a private citizen.Over the weekend, information minister Shibli Faraz said neither Khan, not his government were involved in the registration of the cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-go-in-handcuffs-pok-pm-accused-of-sedition-pans-imran-khan/story-JmgZ9R0CHIOHfUilGn0rLP.html

The commission said the whole city will be tested within five days.China, where the pandemic began in December, has reported 4,634 deaths and 85,578 cases, plus nine suspected cases that have yet to be confirmed.The last reported virus transmissions within China were four patients found on August 15 in the northwestern city of Urumqi in the far western Xinjiang region. All the cases reported since then were in travellers from outside the mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-test-all-9-million-people-in-qingdao-city-for-covid-19/story-3qaNqZp7LDVie9UhDPk6bL.html
12-10-2020||World||EU ministers agree to sanction Lukashenko: Report||EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed to impose sanctions on Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, as the bloc seeks to step up pressure over his regime’s crackdown on protesters.Two diplomatic sources said the 27 ministers meeting in Luxembourg had agreed Lukashenko’s name should join a list of 40 of his officials already sanctioned by the EU.The 40 already hit with travel bans and asset freezes are blamed for rigging an election in August that returned Lukashenko to power and for a brutal crackdown on mass protests that have rocked the country since the vote.The EU had held back from penalising Lukashenko himself, hoping to persuade him to engage in dialogue with opposition forces to resolve the crisis.But a fresh crackdown on protests in Minsk on Sunday, which saw police use water cannon and stun grenades to break up a protest in Minsk and make hundreds of arrests, prompted a change.As he arrived for the meeting in Luxembourg, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said it was time to expand the sanctions list to include the strongman leader.“The violence continues, perpetrated by the Lukashenko regime -- there are still arrests of peaceful demonstrators, so we have to consider how to proceed,” said Maas, whose country currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency.“I have suggested that we establish a new package of sanctions. And Lukashenko should be among the people who will then be sanctioned.”The EU has rejected the results of the August 9 election and said it does not regard Lukashenko as the legitimate president.- Novichok plot -After getting the political green light from ministers, the new sanctions listings will be processed in detail by the EU’s legal services before they enter into force.The ministers were also to discuss a joint French-German proposal for sanctions over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.Germany and France last week accused Moscow of responsibility for poisoning Navalny with the Soviet-developed Novichok nerve agent, saying “no credible explanation has been provided by Russia”.France and Germany said they would push for sanctions targeting “individuals deemed responsible for this crime and breach of international norms, based on their official function, as well as an entity involved in the Novichok programme”.The ministers on Monday extended the EU’s chemical weapons sanctions framework, under which four Russians accused of involvement in the Novichok poisoning of an ex-double agent in England have already been listed.Any sanctions related to the Navalny case would be made under this framework, which has also been used against Syrian officials for carrying out chemical weapons attacks on their civil war foes.The sanctions call came after UN chemical weapons watchdog OPCW confirmed Germany, France and Sweden’s finding that the Russian opposition leader was poisoned by a nerve agent of the Soviet-developed Novichok group.Monday’s meeting will also take stock of EU-brokered talks between Serbia and Kosovo, as well as the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-ministers-agree-to-sanction-lukashenko-report/story-Pma3FNinCGqkGdyVvc36DO.html

12-10-2020||World||Cloth masks may protect from Covid-19 only if washed daily, says study||Cloth masks may reduce the transmission of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, only if they are washed daily at high temperatures, according to a study. “Both cloth masks and surgical masks should be considered ‘contaminated’ after use,” said Professor Raina MacIntyre, from the University of New South Wales in Australia. “Unlike surgical masks, which are disposed of after use, cloth masks are re-used. While it can be tempting to use the same mask for multiple days in a row, or to give it a quick hand-wash or wipe-over, our research suggests that this increases the risk of contamination,” Maclintyre said. The researchers analysed data from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) they published in 2015. The latest study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is still the only RCT ever conducted on the efficacy of cloth masks in preventing viral infections, they said. The researchers did a deep dive into the 2011 data on whether the health workers in their study washed their masks daily, and if so, how they washed their masks. The team found that if cloth masks were washed in the hospital laundry, they were as effective as a surgical mask. Given the study was conducted over five years ago, the researchers did not test for SARS-CoV-2. Instead, they included common respiratory pathogens such as influenza, rhinoviruses and seasonal coronaviruses in their analysis. It is based on self-reported washing data and was conducted by health workers in high risk wards in a healthcare setting. “While someone from the general public wearing a cloth mask is unlikely to come into contact with the same amount of pathogens as healthcare worker in a high risk ward, we would still recommended daily washing of cloth masks in the community,” Maclntyre said. According to the analysis, handwashing the masks did not provide adequate protection. Healthcare workers who self-washed their masks by hand had double the risk of infection compared to those who used the hospital laundry, the researchers said. The majority of people in the RCT handwashed their masks, and this may be why the cloth masks performed poorly in the original trial, they said. “The WHO recommends machine washing masks with hot water at 60 degrees Celsius and laundry detergent, and the results of our analysis support this recommendation,” said Maclntyre. “The clear message from this research is that cloth masks do work -- but once a cloth mask has been worn, it needs to be washed properly each time before being worn again, otherwise it stops being effective,” said Maclntyre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cloth-masks-mayy-protect-from-covid-19-only-if-washed-daily-says-study/story-v2g2ZKF8drQvQObMFkrYtK.html

12-10-2020||World||AstraZeneca starts late-stage trials of Covid-19 antibody medicine||AstraZeneca Plc started late-stage trials for an antibody medicine against Covid-19 with a large investment from the U.S., after President Donald Trump credited a similar therapy with aiding his recovery.Two trials for more than 6,000 people are starting in the next few weeks looking at prevention, with plans for a further 4,000 adults to test the antibody medicine as a treatment, Astra said in a statement. The drug will be assessed for its ability to avoid infections for as much as a year in some people and as a pre-emptive medicine once patients have been exposed to the virus in others.Astra is one of a number of companies exploring monoclonal antibodies as a way to prevent and treat Covid-19, which could be key for high-risk populations who may not respond well to a vaccine. The U.S. has already secured hundreds of thousands of doses of the experimental treatments.Eli Lilly & Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. last week asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency-use authorizations but haven’t yet received clearance. Trump has said Regeneron’s antibody cocktail was key to his apparent recovery from coronavirus.Lilly, RegeneronEarly data from both Eli Lilly and Regeneron suggest the medicines are effective in keeping infected people out of the hospital. GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Vir Biotechnology Inc. also started advanced tests on a possible antibody treatment last week.Astra has agreed to supply as many as 100,000 doses to the U.S. by the end of 2020, with an option for the country to purchase one million additional doses in 2021. The U.S. previously gave the British pharmaceutical company $25 million for the discovery and evaluation of the monoclonal antibodies, and the phase I trial started in August.Astra shares were little changed early Monday in London.The company’s long-acting antibody “has the potential to provide immediate and long-lasting effect in both preventing and treating Covid-19 infections,” Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in a statement released Friday.(Updates with more detail on trials, U.S. agreement)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-starts-late-stage-trials-of-covid-19-antibody-medicine/story-jTo7kLXZI3kZbWe9QbAK6O.html

It’s essential for companies to keep working, and children to keep going to school, he said.Also Read: Soaring coronavirus cases put more French cities on alertFrance has emphasized local measures to combat a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks after a two-month national lockdown in the spring devastated the economy. With new infections spiking to fresh highs, there’s little evidence the piecemeal approach is working.Toulouse and Montpellier this weekend joined other French cities that have been placed on maximum alert as the number of coronavirus cases in the country rose by nearly 27,000 on Saturday. Bars, casinos and exhibitions in the cities will close while restaurants, cinemas and museums have to abide by stricter health rules starting Monday.New phone appThe government plans to release a new “stop-covid” mobile-phone app on Oct. 22 to help contain the virus, Castex said. The government is also considering additional unspecified measures if the situation doesn’t improve in the next 15 days, he said.Separately, President Emmanuel Macron will not be isolating after coming into contact with French Polynesia President Édouard Fritch, who has tested positive for the coronavirus, because Macron has followed sanitary protocols meticulously, with masks and social distancing, according to the Elysee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-must-avoid-general-covid-19-lockdown-by-all-means-says-pm-castex/story-9iJVNhWTuuah4xGSkUvGsI.html

Chief executive Carrie Lam had been due to make a key annual address on Wednesday outlining her administration’s plans for the politically restless city.But the speech clashed with a sudden announcement that Chinese President Xi Jinping would make a visit that day to the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen.Lam said she would also travel to Shenzhen, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a special economic trade zone, ahead of a visit to Beijing later in the month.Her speech, she added, would now be delivered in late November.“The best way forward is for the chief executive to go to Beijing and personally explain why these measures are important for Hong Kong,” Lam said of the speech.Hong Kong is ruled under a “One Country, Two Systems” model that allows it to retain a degree of autonomy and some freedoms that are denied to citizens on the authoritarian mainland.But last year’s huge and often violent pro-democracy protests prompted Beijing to ramp up control over a city it now sees as a national security threat.In June it imposed a sweeping new security law on the restless hub which criminalised a range of political offences.It also allowed mainland security agents to operate openly in the city for the first time, as well as grant Beijing jurisdiction over especially serious cases.The Chinese government has thrown its full support behind Lam, a pro-Beijing appointee, despite her dismal approval ratings.Millions hit the streets last year for seven straight months of protests calling for greater freedoms and police accountability.Both Beijing and Lam have rejected those demands and dismissed the unrest as part of a foreign plot.Businesses in the city would have watched Lam’s speech this week closely.The national security law and deteriorating US-China relations have raised doubts over Hong Kong’s future as a regional trading powerhouse, with the city mired in a recession even before the coronavirus outbreak.A lack of affordable housing in what is one of the world’s most expensive cities has also helped fuel resentment towards Beijing.Mass arrests and an anti-coronavirus ban on public gatherings have largely kept a lid on protests this year. But residents remain deeply polarised, with no reconciliation measures yet unveiled to bridge the divide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-carrie-lam-postpones-policy-speech-after-being-ordered-to-travel-to-china/story-TB9i5V8LP5Y7wmURL0QaaJ.html

12-10-2020||World||Covid-19: China launches mass tests in eastern city of Qingdao after local cases emerge||China has launched mass nucleic acid tests in the eastern coastal city of Qingdao after 12 Covid-19 infections including six asymptomatic cases, mostly related to a chest hospital, were reported in the past 24 hours.More than 9 million residents of the city, located on the Yellow Sea coast, will be tested for the coronavirus over five days, city officials said on Monday.Mass testing was launched on Sunday evening after reports of the new cases were confirmed.By Sunday night, photos were circulating online showing residents lining up for tests.Six confirmed locally transmitted cases and six more asymptomatic ones were reported on Sunday, triggering worries of a new outbreak.Local media reports said that as of Sunday night, all the cases were connected to Qingdao Chest Hospital, which was treating “imported” cases of the deadly disease.According to local health authorities, the hospital has been sealed and all doctors and medical staff were being tested.Buildings, where the families of the infected live, have been locked down; family members and relatives are being tested.The five districts of Shinan, Shibei, Licang, Laoshan and Chengyang, home to about six million people, will be fully covered in the next three days, health authorities said.The rest of the city’s population will be covered by the end of the week.A coastal tourism hub with a German concession area, millions of domestic tourists from across the country had come to the city in the first week of October during China’s National Day holidays before returning to their hometowns.“Data from the Qingdao municipal bureau of culture and tourism showed that Qingdao received 4.47 million passenger trips during the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays,” the tabloid Global Times reported on Monday.The number of daily Covid-19 cases in mainland China has fallen drastically from peaks seen in February this year. But the country and its health officials remain on high alert in order to prevent lockdowns that had led to a contraction of the world’s second largest economy for the first time in decades.Since the peak number of cases earlier this year, smaller outbreaks have been reported in Beijing in June, in the northeastern city of Dalian and in Urumqi, the capital of the remote northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stood at 85,578, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.More than 3,000 imported cases of Covid-19 have been reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-launches-mass-tests-in-eastern-city-of-qingdao-after-local-cases-emerge/story-TomLcd0hF6Le9HPI7HYWdM.html
12-10-2020||World||Covid-19: England to have 3-tier lockdown system amid ‘tipping point’||Millions of people in northern England are anxiously waiting to hear how much further virus restrictions will be tightened in coming days as the British government confirmed Sunday that it will be introducing a new system for local lockdowns.In response to the virus’ resurgence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce in Parliament on Monday a three-tier local lockdown system, formally known as “Local Covid Alert Levels,” for England, his office said.Under the new system, the country will be placed into “medium,” “high” and “very high” alert levels. Johnson’s office said the government is working with local leaders to decide which areas are covered by the very high alert level, and the appropriate interventions in those areas.Details of what is involved at each level haven’t been confirmed but the highest level is widely expected to involve the closure of pubs and restaurants and the banning of household mixing, both indoors and outside, among other measures.The new lockdown system, which is intended to simplify the process by which local restrictions are imposed, has been widely anticipated for a couple of weeks following a sharp increase in new cases. Following further discussions early Monday, Johnson will inform lawmakers of the new system before hosting a briefing along with Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and the government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, warned that the UK is at a “tipping point” akin to where the country was in March.“But we can prevent history repeating itself if we all act now,” he said . “Now we know where it is and how to tackle it — let’s grasp this opportunity and prevent history from repeating itself.”All across Europe including the UK, there have been huge increases in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks following the reopening of large sectors of the economy, as well as schools and universities. Infection levels — and deaths — in the UK are rising at their fastest rates in months.Without quick action, there are fears that UK hospitals will be overwhelmed in the coming weeks at a time of year when they are already at their busiest with winter-related afflictions like the flu. The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,825, up another 65 on Sunday.Although coronavirus infections are rising throughout England, northern cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen a disproportionate increase. While some rural areas in eastern England have less than 20 cases per 100,000 people, some major metropolitan areas have recently recorded levels above 500 per 100,000, nearly as bad as Madrid or Brussels.As a result, national restrictions such as a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants have been supplemented by local actions, including in some cases banning contacts between households. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have already closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.Liverpool’s local leader has said he expects his city to face the most onerous restrictions from Wednesday.Local leaders across northern England have vented their fury at the Conservative government over what they see as an “inadequate” wage support scheme that it announced Friday and for not properly telling them about the upcoming restrictions. The wage plan aims to help employees in companies that are forced to close because of virus restrictions, but mayors say it’s not generous enough in paying only two-thirds of employees’ wages and doesn’t compensate those indirectly hit by any business closures, such as drink suppliers to pubs.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick on Sunday sought to assuage concerns that the government was being overly hierarchical in its approach. He also indicated that local authorities will be given more control over the national test and trace program, which has struggled to live up to Johnson’s prediction that it would be “world-beating.”“In addition to the national infrastructure which is developing and increasing with every passing week, we’re also going to be making use of local councils to do contact tracing in particular, because there is clear evidence that local councils are good at that, as you’d expect,” he told the BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-england-to-have-3-tier-lockdown-system-amid-tipping-point/story-dQVKXnfb4ldmkBPxjYbYiM.html
12-10-2020||World||Supreme Court nominee Barrett faces Senate despite Covid-19 spread||Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett are set to begin as a divided Senate charges ahead on President Donald Trump’s pick to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and cement a conservative court majority before Election Day.Barrett, a federal appeals court judge, will tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is “forever grateful” for Ginsburg’s trailblazing path as a woman. But she is resolved to maintain the perspective of her own mentor, the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and “apply the law as written,” according to her prepared opening remarks for the hearings, which start Monday as the country is in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic.“Courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” Barrett says in the remarks, which The Associated Press obtained.Republicans, who control the Senate, are moving at a breakneck pace to seat Barrett before the Nov. 3 election to secure Trump’s pick and hear a high-profile challenge to the Affordable Care Act and any election-related challenges.Democrats are trying in vain to delay the fast-track confirmation by raising fresh concerns about the safety of meeting during the pandemic after two GOP senators on the panel tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., have not said if they will attend in person. Lee’s spokesman said the senator is symptom-free but would be making a decision on whether to attend Monday morning, per his doctor’s orders. A spokesman for Tillis did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Both tested positive 10 days ago.Key Democrats are staying away. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee and a committee member, plans to participate remotely from her Senate office due to coronavirus concerns, her spokesman said Sunday.The committee released a letter from the Architect of the Capitol on Sunday that says the hearing room has been set up in consultation with the Office of Attending Physician with appropriate distance between seats and air ventilation systems that meet or exceed industry standards.“We’re going to work safely,” said the committee’s chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” He said he took a coronavirus test last week and is “negative.”Trump chose the 48-year-old judge after the death last month of Ginsburg, a liberal icon. It’s the opportunity to entrench a conservative majority on the court for years to come with his third justice.Outside groups are pushing Democrats to make a strong case against what they call an illegitimate confirmation, when people are already voting in some states, saying the winner of the presidency should make the pick. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential contest.“The public is with them that this shouldn’t happen before the election,” said Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice, which advocates against right-leaning nominees.The country will get an extended look at Barrett over the next three days in hearings like none other during the heated election environment and the pandemic limiting public access.Faith and family punctuate her testimony, and she said would bring “a few new perspectives” as the first mother of school-age children on the nine-member court.Barrett says she uses her children as a test when deciding cases, asking herself how she would view the decision if one of her children were the party she was ruling against.“Even though I would not like the result, would I understand that the decision was fairly reasoned and grounded in the law?” she says in the prepared remarks.A Catholic, she says she believes in the “power of prayer.” Barrett’s religious views and past leadership role in a Catholic faith community pose a challenge for Democrats as they try to probe her judicial approach to abortion, gay marriage and other social issues without veering into inappropriate questions of her faith.Ordinarily, Barrett would get to show off her family and seven children. But the White House event announcing her nomination, in which most of the audience did not wear masks, has been labeled a “superspreader” for the coronavirus.More than two dozen people linked to the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event, including the two GOP senators, have contracted COVID-19 since then. Barrett and her family went maskless at the event.

Water cannons and stun grenades were used against the protesters,” Hanusevich said.She noted that the police had repeatedly asked residents to refrain from participating in the unsanctioned rally. According to Hanusevich, over 20 protesters have already been detained.In the meantime, security measures in the city have been stepped up, according to a Sputnik correspondent. Several special equipment units were deployed near the Central House of Officers located on the other side of Independence Avenue.Armoured personnel carriers, water cannons and vehicles with barbed wire in their trailers are parked at the Sapiorau Street in the immediate vicinity of the Independence Palace, which serves as the presidential residence.Earlier in the day, the A1 Belarus telecom provider said that the bandwidth of mobile internet in Minsk had been reduced.“In compliance with the order of the authorized state bodies on October 11, the bandwidth of the mobile Internet was reduced in Minsk. Fulfillment of this requirement leads to a deterioration in the quality of the data transfer service or temporary unavailability of the service,” the operator said on Twitter.Nationwide protests in Belarus are ongoing since the August 9 presidential election in which President Alexander Lukashenko was re-elected for a sixth term. The opposition did not accept the election result and has insisted its candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya won.

The employer has been contacted by the kidnappers and shown photographs as proof that the Indian nationals were safe and keeping well,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in his weekly press conference.In September 2015, an advisory had been issued for Indian nationals to avoid travelling to Libya in view of the security situation there.Later, in May 2016, the Government imposed a complete travel ban irrespective of the purpose in view of the much-deteriorated security situation. This travel ban is still in force.

Montoya said two guns were recovered from the scene.Richardson said on Instagram that the shooting victim, who she said was with the patriot rally, and the other man “exchanged heated words” before violence ensued.The “patriot hit the man in the face, then backed up to spray what looked like pepper spray at him,” Richardson wrote. “Literally in that split second the man who had gotten hit by the patriot pulled out a gun from his waistband and shot the patriot.”By all accounts, nobody from the side of the Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist counter-rally was directly involved in the deadly confrontation. Dolloff made his first court appearance on Sunday, where a magistrate judge ordered the arrest warrant affidavit sealed and ruled that the suspect be held without bond, local media reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-guard-held-on-suspicion-of-murder-in-shooting-at-denver-political-rallies/story-zCN6r7980miEPVgCrCi4OI.html
12-10-2020||World||Battered by Hurricane Delta, Louisiana vows to rebuild: ‘We can’t lose our momentum’||Back-to-back hurricanes in the space of six weeks left parts of Louisiana blanketed Sunday with tarpaulins, mangled metal and downed power lines — but not necessarily despair.Utility crews fanned out across the battered southwestern part of the state to restore electricity in the wake of Hurricane Delta, and residents began returning home along roads lined with debris and houses missing roofs. Some were grateful that the damage was not as bad as it could have been.A 70-year-old woman in Iberia Parish died in a fire likely caused by a natural gas leak following damage from Hurricane Delta, the Louisiana Department of Health said Sunday.Louisiana officials also blamed the death of an 86-year-old man on the hurricane. The St. Martin Parish resident died in a fire that erupted after he refueled a generator in a shed, Gov. John Bel Edwards said. He said it didn’t appear the generator had cooled down before the man refilled it.A third storm-related death was reported in Florida, where a 19-year-old tourist from Illinois drowned after getting caught in a rip current caused by the storm off Destin, authorities said.Roughly 350,000 customers in Louisiana remained without power two days after Delta blew ashore near the town of Creole with winds of 100 mph (155 kph), slamming a part of the state still recovering from Hurricane Laura’s 150 mph (241 kph) onslaught on Aug. 27. Laura was blamed for 32 deaths, many of them caused in the storm’s aftermath by carbon monoxide poisoning from generators.The remnants of Delta, meanwhile, dumped heavy rain on parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia.The storm was also blamed for washing out a railroad track and causing the derailment of a freight train in the Atlanta area that sparked a small fire and briefly forced some residents from their homes. Two crew members were taken to a hospital for observation and later released.Clair Hebert Marceaux lost her home in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, during Hurricane Laura and said the community was hard at work on rebuilding when Delta struck.“We can’t lose our momentum,” she said, though she added there was “utter devastation” in the area.Marceaux, who was born and raised in Cameron Parish, is the director of the community’s busy port, which hosts fleets of shrimp and crab boats and serves as a key link in the region’s oil and gas industry.Vessel traffic was halted until port authorities and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers could take stock of the damage. Sunken boats, utility poles and other flotsam filled waterways.“We are still in an assessment phase,” Marceaux said, “but we will be limping along as best as we can.”Lynn Nguyen and her four children fled to Fort Walton, Florida, ahead of the storm and returned home to Abbeville, Louisiana, on a circuitous route to avoid flooded roads. Her home was spared major damage, though a fence was flattened.“For the most part, I’m just glad I still have a job and a roof over my head,” said Nguyen, who works at a seafood market.Earnestine and Milton Wesley had decided to ride out Delta in their Lake Charles home, damaged by Laura. As the wind rustled the roof tarp above them, they grabbed it through the hole in the ceiling and held on tight. Water poured in, flooding their den.“We fought all night long trying to keep things intact,” Milton said. “And with God’s help we made it.”After blowing ashore, Delta moved over Lake Charles, a city where Laura damaged nearly every home and building. More than 8,000 Louisiana residents who evacuated because of Laura were still in shelters as of Sunday, Edwards said. Roughly 850 people were in shelters because of Delta.Before Friday’s storm, the streets of Lake Charles were already lined with mountains of debris from the previous hurricane — soggy insulation, moldy mattresses, tree limbs, twisted metal siding, ruined family treasures. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter estimated hundreds of already damaged homes took on water from Delta, which dumped more than 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain on the city over two days.Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, was the 10th to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a record set in 1916, Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach said.The floodwaters surged up the Wesley family’s front yard, and they were terrified it would pour inside, but it stopped short of the door. It carried with it bags of trash and muck, swept up from their neighbors’ piles of debris from the prior storm.“The water was something else last night,” Milton said. “We’ve never seen it flood so bad out here, to the point I could have swam out here last night, that’s just how deep it was.”___Calvan reported from Tallahassee, Florida; Associated Press contributors include Sudhin Thanawala and Sophia Tulp in Atlanta; Gerald Herbert in Lake Charles; Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge; Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battered-by-hurricane-delta-louisiana-vows-to-rebuild-we-can-t-lose-our-momentum/story-PdpXXJ6EcJTN5SlWqjajSM.html

The Armenian military has refuted Baku’s statements. The shelling, which reportedly left seven dead and 34 others injured, took place amid the ceasefire, which the two sides to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict had earlier agreed in Moscow.“We have treated 20 patients, two of them in severe condition. There are five children under three among the patients who are currently receiving psychological assistance and undergoing rehabilitation. The others have been discharged, they are under medical supervision,” Ibragimov said.The doctor added that a female traumatologist who worked for the hospital had been killed in the shelling.“This employee had two sons who are now at the frontline [in the Karabakh conflict] ... And she was in a peaceful and quiet city ... unfortunately, we lost her,” the chief physician said.Journalists had an opportunity to see two hospitalized men who had been injured in the attack. One is a emergency worker in his 40s who lives in one of damaged residential buildings. According to doctors, the man fought in the Nagorno-Karabakh war in the 1990s. The patient slept during reporters’ visit.Another patient received wounds to both legs as the rocket smashed windows in nearby houses. According to 20-year-old Isa Rzayev, he woke up at night to the noise of two powerful explosions. Neighbors helped him get out of the house. Isa said that he was demobilized in April.

The deal stipulated that the truce should pave the way for talks on settling the conflict.Crowds gathered in front of the Turkish Consulate in California’s largest city Sunday afternoon, waving Armenian flags, chanting and toting signs that said “peace for Armenians,” among other messages. Earlier, groups gathered along streets, with some climbing on top of cars to wave the banners.The demonstrations appeared to be largely peaceful.Southern California is home to the largest Armenian population in the United States and an East Hollywood neighborhood was designated Little Armenia in 2000.The recent bout of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces started Sept. 27 and left hundreds of people dead in the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh since a separatist war there ended in 1994. The region lies in Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia. Armenians refer to it as Artsakh.Turkey is supporting Azerbaijan and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently said “our Azerbaijani brothers are now waiting for the day they will return to their land.”As protestors gathered Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted in support, also attaching a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from a group of mayors across the country urging the United States to help deescalate tensions in the conflict.“We welcome the ceasefire and it must be respected,” Garcetti tweeted. “We need our national leadership to step up (and) help bring peace to the region. Turkey must disengage.”Thousands blocked freeways recently in the Los Angeles area, and assembled in front of the buildings of CNN and the Los Angeles Times and demonstrated outside the Azerbaijan Consulate, the Los Angeles Times previously reported. Several Armenian Americans have returned to the region to volunteer for their home country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-armenia-demonstrations-in-los-angeles-slogans-raised-against-azerbaijan-turkey/story-7Z4RrWNGcSYA9J8t1OnMQO.html

The study was published in Virology Journal.By comparison, Influenza A virus has been found to survive on surfaces for 17 days.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage CSIRO’s research involved drying virus in an artificial mucus on a range of surfaces at concentrations similar to samples from Covid-19 patients and then extracting the virus after a month.Experiments done in controlled laboratory environments at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C showed that the survival time declined as the temperature increased.Also Read: Will Covid-19 cases increase in India during winter? Likely, says Harsh Vardhan“Establishing how long the virus really remains viable on surfaces enables us to more accurately predict and mitigate its spread and do a better job of protecting our people,” CSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall said in a statement.Proteins and fats in body fluids can also sharply increase virus survival times.“The research may also help to explain the apparent persistence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in cool environments with high lipid or protein contamination, such as meat processing facilities, and how we might better address that risk,” said Trevor Drew, director of the CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness.Also Read: India considers using more than one Covid-19 vaccineAustralia has fared much better than most other rich nations in combating Covid-19, with a total of about 27,000 infections and 898 deaths in a population of 25 million.The epicentre of the country’s second wave of infection, Victoria state, reported 15 new cases on Monday, well shy of a target of less than five which the government has set for the easing of a hard lockdown in the state capital Melbourne.

12-10-2020||World||White House seeks limited Covid relief bill, promises further talks on broader stimulus||The Trump administration on Sunday called on Congress to pass a stripped-down coronavirus relief bill using leftover funds from an expired small-business loan program, as negotiations on a broader package ran into resistance.The administration proposal, which Democrats dismissed as inadequate, was the latest twist in on-again, off-again talks to try to secure more stimulus, as the economy struggles to recover from coronavirus-related shutdowns that threw millions of Americans out of work.In a letter to lawmakers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of State Mark Meadows said they would continue to talk to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to try to reach agreement on a comprehensive bill.But they said Congress should “immediately vote” on legislation to enable the use of the unused Paycheck Protection Program funds, which total around $130 billion.“The all or nothing approach is an unacceptable response to the American people,” they wrote.Also Read: Fauci says Donald Trump’s campaign ad twists his words on Covid-19A spokesman for Pelosi, the lead Democratic negotiator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Representative Nita Lowey, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, rejected the administration’s offer in a statement later on Sunday as “woefully inadequate.”“We can only reopen our economy and set the foundation for a strong recovery if we support state and local governments on the frontline of this crisis,” Lowey said in a statement.White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern told reporters the unused funds would be used to reopen the Payroll Protection Program, which expired earlier this year, to “allow businesses to continue to use it to keep their employees employed.”President Donald Trump on Friday offered a $1.8 trillion coronavirus relief package in talks with Pelosi after urging his team on Twitter to “go big” - moving closer to Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion proposal. That came days after Trump abruptly called off negotiations until after the Nov. 3 election in which he is seeking re-election.Trump’s reversal and higher offer drew criticism from Senate Republicans, some of whom are uneasy about the national debt and whether a deal would cost Republicans votes next month.Federal Reserve officials have urged Congress to be aggressive.

Measures include the closing of cafes and bars. The southwest city of Toulouse was doing likewise after a day of meetings between mayors of surrounding towns and the prefect, the local state authority, the Toulouse newspaper La Depeche reported.Soaring infections and increased hospitalizations put four other cities on the maximum alert list on Saturday: Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne in the southeast and Lille in the north.National health authorities reported on Saturday nearly 26,900 new daily infections in 24 hours. The count dropped to 16,100 on Sunday, but the rate of positive tests climbed to 11.5%. There were nearly 5,100 new hospitalizations over the past week, with 910 people in ICUs. As of Sunday, there were 32,730 Covid-19 deaths, but the actual number is likely higher due to deaths at home and incomplete reporting from hospitals or rest homes.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhile France girded itself for a climb in critical numbers, a consultation by the National Order of Nurses published Sunday suggested that a significant number of respondents feel tired and fed up, with 37% saying the coronavirus pandemic is making them want to change jobs.Nearly 59,400 nurses responded to the Oct. 2-7 internal survey on the impact of the health crisis on their working conditions, out of 350,000 in the Order of Nurses. A spokesman for the order, Adrien de Casabianca, described the survey as a “consultation” without the classic methodology of a poll.The numbers suggested that French medical facilities may not be keeping pace with the growing need, despite lessons from the height of the virus crisis last spring.The National Order of Nurses notes that 34,000 nurses’ jobs in France are currently vacant.Nurses and other health professionals in France and elsewhere have sporadically demonstrated for higher salaries, better working conditions and more personnel. They were given small salary hikes in France starting this fall.“Today, nurses must deal with a growth in Covid-19 cases and feel unarmed to do so,” the president of the National Order of Nurses, Patrick Chamboredon, said in a statement accompanying the survey.With nurses “indispensable” to the functioning of the health system, “we cannot accept that,” he said.The head of the infectious diseases unit at Paris’ Bichat Hospital, a major Covid-19 treatment center, Yazdan Yazdanpaneh, questioned whether so many nurses really want to change jobs because “despite it all, these are people who adore their work.”“They are tired ... it’s stress, it’s tension, it’s lots of work,” he said on BFMTV. “Truly, we must take care of them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soaring-coronavirus-cases-puts-more-french-cities-on-alert/story-x9j4K8NDLabkJ9XcD5j9IK.html

In body-camera video, one officer could be heard twice saying that leading Neely by rope down city streets would look “bad”.The lawsuit accused the city and the department of negligence, and stated that the officers should have known Neely would consider it offensive to be led on the rope “as though he was a slave.” “Neely felt as though he was put on display as slaves once were,” the lawsuit stated.In a statement at the time, Police Chief Vernon Hale called the tactic a “trained technique and best practice in some scenarios”. However, he said he believed his officers “showed poor judgment,” adding that the department since changed its policy to prevent use of the technique.A Texas Rangers investigation determined the officers didn’t break the law. Neely’s criminal trespass charge was dismissed in court. His lawsuit also alleges malicious prosecution connected to the charge.City officials declined to comment on the lawsuit to news outlets.A status conference was set for January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-man-who-police-led-by-rope-sues-texas-city-for-1-million/story-hG15RhRIuGicxji7LvCpcK.html

I’m down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. It’s every single day. So, I can’t imagine that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more.”In his statement Sunday, Fauci said, “The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.”Trump defended the clip, and his handling of pandemic, and rebutted the doctor’s criticism.“They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words.

12-10-2020||World||Joe Biden harnesses history to describe urgency of 2020 campaign||Presidential hopefuls tend to declare every upcoming election the most important one that voters have faced in their lifetime. Joe Biden goes bigger.The Democratic nominee portrays 2020 as an entanglement of social, economic, political, environmental and public health crises as threatening to America’s stability as the Civil War and the Great Depression. Biden points to the presidents of those times -- Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- for inspiration, even using one of the nation’s most hallowed battlefields, where Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address in 1863, as a backdrop for his closing argument against President Donald Trump.“A century and a half after Gettysburg, we should consider again what can happen when equal justice is denied and when anger and violence and division are left unchecked,” Biden said in rural Pennsylvania.He pledged, as president, to “marshal the ingenuity and good will of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together.” Refashioning Lincoln’s words, Biden added: “It cannot be that here and now, in 2020, that we will allow the government of the people, by the people and for the people to perish from this Earth. It cannot, and it must not.”The approach, Biden aides say, is more than lofty presidential rhetoric; it’s necessary groundwork for governing. Being a steady alternative to Trump, the ex-reality television star Biden describes as “erratic” and “dangerous,” may be enough to win in November, they argue.But once in office, Biden would need a clear mandate from a splintered electorate if he hopes to enact the kinds of comprehensive proposals he proposes to control the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, combat the climate crisis and confront centuries of racial and economic inequities.“A lot of good work and thinking is going into how to actually tackle the challenges in this moment of crisis that the Trump administration has failed to address and resolve,” Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden confidant, said in a recent interview.“It’s simple,” added Coons, who holds the same Senate seat Biden occupied for 36 years. “But it’s complicated.”A Biden aide who was not authorized to publicly discuss strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity said the campaign is considering at least one more major speech before the Nov. 3 election with the kind of historical sweep and imagery that Biden mustered in Gettysburg.There are hazards and unknowns in Biden’s approach.“Tom Dewey,” quipped Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker and Trump ally. He was referring to Republicans’ 1948 presidential nominee, who appeared a sure victor over President Harry S. Truman at a time of domestic uncertainty after World War II.“Dewey spent a large part of October talking about how great a president he’d be, and Truman spent October taking Dewey apart” on the particulars, Gingrich said of Truman’s comeback victory.As dire as Trump’s political standing appears to be, Republicans have countered Biden’s argument for an ambitious presidency with equally stark warnings that the longtime center-left deal-maker is in fact a vessel for a leftward lurch toward socialism.In Trump’s telling, Biden’s ideas to combat the pandemic would cripple economic activity; his tax plans are confiscatory wealth redistribution; health care insurance expansion amounts to a government takeover; his energy overhaul to stymie climate change would kill millions of jobs; and his talk of racial injustice amounts to declaring the whole country racist.Biden has from the start of his campaign talked of Trump as an existential threat to the “soul of the nation.” He nodded to racial injustice with frequent reminders that “we haven’t always lived up to those values” in the Declaration of Independence. During the primary campaign he made standard Democratic arguments about bolstering the middle class.But the coronavirus, its economic damage and a summer of protests of police violence against Black Americans have accelerated Biden’s rhetoric.“The blinders have been taken off. People realize what’s at stake here,” Biden said Saturday in Erie, Pennsylvania, repeating what has become a go-to line in nearly every campaign setting. Another line: “The country is ready. They get it.”And he swats away Trump’s caricatures. “Do I look like a socialist?” he said recently in Miami.Biden’s tack bears cursory resemblance to some of Trump’s stagecraft.The president made Democrats seethe in August as he used the White House as his backdrop to accept the Republican nomination for a second term. Before that, Trump traveled to Mount Rushmore on the weekend of July Fourth for a dramatic address. His backdrop: the carved likenesses of Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.“I’ve done more for the Black community than any other president ... with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln,” Trump said in September, four months after conducting an interview with Fox News from the feet of the Lincoln Memorial.Biden described his Gettysburg speech as “dramatic” in a preview to donors hours before he delivered it. Yet while Trump makes explicit comparisons to his predecessors in terms of accomplishment and renown, Biden’s language more carefully calls upon them as inspiration.In a Sept. 22 fundraiser, a top Biden supporter recalled urging the former vice president to run against Trump.“I was grabbing you by the lapels and said, ‘You’re the Harry Truman of our time. You’ve gotta run.’ I know you remember that,” Dennis Mehiel, chairman of U.S. Corrugated, Inc., told Biden, drawing laughter from the candidate.Then Mehiel pivoted, declaring a national “tipping point” that requires more. “I’ve changed my mind,” he told Biden. “You must be the Franklin Roosevelt of our time. ... We had wonderful success in many areas following his leadership.”Biden walked a fine line in response.“I have trouble thinking of myself in terms of FDR,” Biden said of the Democrat whose New Deal policies vastly expanded the federal government’s size and scope. “But one thing I do agree on ... whoever is the next president is going to inherit an economic circumstance that is as dangerous, as consequential as Roosevelt did.”Gingrich said Biden “has no choice” but to reach for a mandate as he tries to parlay a national lead into an expanded House majority and a new Democratic-run Senate. The raw political realities of the eras Biden cites as guideposts demonstrate why.Lincoln managed the Civil War as an iron-fisted commander in chief, often governing through executive orders his congressional opponents could do nothing about. His staunchest enemies weren’t on Capitol Hill for him to navigate at all: They’d seceded.Roosevelt, meanwhile, was vilified by Republicans and Wall Street titans as a socialist. But he commanded overwhelming Democratic majorities in Congress, margins Biden likely would never enjoy.“For Biden to do what he wants to do,” Gingrich said, “he needs to sweep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-harnesses-history-to-describe-urgency-of-2020-campaign/story-gMtygV73d6fMR2lVMmfDPK.html
12-10-2020||World||Pak politicises FATF, hires top lobbying firm for a US bailout from grey list||In view of the upcoming October 21-23 plenary and sub-groups meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Pakistan is understood to have hired a top lobbyist firm on the Capitol Hill to push a narrative favouring Islamabad with Trump administration and get bailed out of the club of nations on the “grey list.”With all-weather friend and iron brother China, Ottoman empire revivalist Turkey and increasingly radicalised Malaysia behind Pakistan, there is no possibility of Islamabad getting pushed into FATF’s black list as only three out of 39 member states are required to block the proposal. Islamabad, however, requires support of at least 12 out of 39 member states to remove its name from the grey list and this will largely depend on the approach the US will take at the Paris plenary.Also Read: China has itself to blame for strong QUAD | AnalysisAccording to diplomats based in the US and Paris, the Pakistan foreign ministry has hired Houston (in Texas) based lobbying firm Linden Strategies to push its case with the Trump administration. The lobbying firm website describes it as a “government relations and business development firm providing strategic analysis and advisory to domestic and international clients, including sovereign nations.” The firm’s specialisation is in government relations, strategic communication, business advisory and political consulting with clients spanning the globe.Also Read: Pakistan opposition parties accuse army of meddling with pollsApparently, the narrative that Pakistan wants the Houston firm to communicate to Trump administration is as follows:■ Main leadership of the Taliban, Haqqani network, al Qaeda and Daesh global terrorist groups is based in Afghanistan with sufficient funds available to them. This means that Islamabad has disavowed that Taliban shura and the Haqqani network operate from Quetta, across Bolan Pass, and Peshawar, across Khyber Pass, and there is no hand of Pakistan’s deep state in al Qaeda and Daesh or so-called Islamic state in Afghanistan. The fact is that Haqqani network chief Sirajiuddin Haqqani is the sword arm of the Taliban as its deputy leader with Maulvi Hibatullah Akhunzada being a cleric.■ While Pakistan claims that Muridke based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) remains defunct, terror financing cases have been registered against most of the identified leaders of Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniat foundation. The fact is that LeT chief Hafiz Saeed, main accused in 26/11 attacks, has handed over the reins of the proscribed group to son Talha, who is instigating violence and in touch with sleeper cells across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.■ The Imran Khan government claims that Bahawalpur based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist group follows a unique Afghan war based model of operation. While its key leaders are not in Pakistan, the group is operating through its sympathisers. The fact is that JeM’s emir Masood Azhar has a serious medical condition and is bed-ridden in Bahawalpur. His brother Mufti Rauf Asghar now operates the group with training camps both in Pakistan as well as across the Durand Line in Afghanistan. The JeM’s main operator in Kashmir is Kasim Jan, 2016 Pathankot attack accused, who gets instruction from Asghar. The JeM is a family enterprise with terrorism as its main product.■ Pakistan claims that it has successfully convicted four designated persons and two other senior leaders, and that terror financing cases have been instituted against 11 designated persons (61 cases) and eight other leaders (37 cases). The fact, however, is that according to FATF’s 2019 mutual evaluation report there were 66 organisations and approximately 7,600 individuals proscribed under UN Security Council resolution 1373, which was passed to prevent and suppress financing of terror acts post 9/11 attacks.Also Read: Pak cleric murder: Imran Khan blames India for triggering sectarian rift but fails to provide evidenceDespite hiring a top lobbying firm and offering its leverage with Taliban to US for reduction of violence in Afghanistan, Pakistan will not be able to escape the grey list this time as its 2019 mutual evaluation report leaves a lot to be desired and it is still to comply with all the 27 points of FATF action plan of the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hires-top-lobbyist-firm-for-a-us-bailout-from-fatf-grey-list/story-UXWYNT0L208gjGln6GrTdN.html

The farmer’s son said, “My father had taken Rs 2 lakh as loan from a moneylender sometime back on account of the marriage of my younger brother by mortgaging our 2 acre land but the soybean crop in our field was damaged due to excessive rain. My father was shattered on seeing the crop and he was under stress as to how to repay the loan and get back the land. On Monday afternoon, we found his body hanging from the branch of a tree in our field.” Investigating officer, sub-inspector of police AL Khairwar said, “We have got to know that the farmer was suffering from a respiratory illness. There is no suicide note. However, prima facie it’s a case of suicide. The body was sent for post-mortem examination. The report is awaited.” He said, “Investigation is going on. The son of the deceased said the farmer was under stress due to a Rs 2 lakh loan.

12-10-2020||India||‘Proof of failure in handling Covid-19,’ says Congress as Karnataka gets new health minister||In a minor reshuffle in Karnataka, the health portfolio which was with B Sriramulu has been transferred to Dr K Sudhakar the Medical Education minister, according to a notification issued by the Raj Bhavan. The changes were notified by Governor Vajubhai Vala on the recommendation of CM BS Yediyurappa. The health ministry has increasingly become important because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, with Karnataka registering the second highest number of cases in the country after Maharashtra.Sudhakar a trained doctor by qualification, who currently holds the medical education portfolio, will get the health and family welfare ministry too. Sriramulu has been given the social welfare department which was with PWD minister Govind Karajol as additional charge.Sriramulu a prominent OBC face of the party, however, rushed to meet CM Yediyurappa to express his unhappiness at being shunted out as ‘it would send wrong message to the people of the state about his ability to handle the responsibility,’ a source close to the minister told HT.The new social welfare minister himself, however, refused to talk to the media and Sudhakar the new health minister said that it was the prerogative of the CM to allocate portfolios and said he might have been given the responsibility as medical education, health and family welfare were closely related.Sudhakar also denied that the reallocation in portfolio had been done due to allegations by opposition Congress of massive corruption in procurement of equipment related to Covid-19 treatment or due to failure in controlling the spread of the pandemic.A senior minister in the Yediyurappa cabinet who is also a former president of the state BJP unit, KS Eshwarappa defended the re-allocation saying that social welfare department suited Sriramulu better. “It is upto the CM to decide who should be given what. Social welfare department is also a very big ministry. It is a good opportunity (for Sriramulu) to ensure social justice,” Eshwarappa added.Earlier for months there were murmurs of disagreement in terms of Covid-19 handling strategy between Sriramulu and Sudhakar. A miffed CM BS Yediyurappa had even named primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar as the chief government spokesperson for all matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sudhakar had then denied any rift calling Sriramulu his ‘elder brother’.The main opposition party Congress immediately hit out at the government’s decision to change the health minister. KPCC President DK Shivakumar tweeted, “The Cabinet Reshuffle done by CM @BSYBJP is proof of this government’s miserable failure in handling the Covid-19 Pandemic. The fact that the Health Minister has been changed adds credence to our charge that this govt’s incompetency has led to massive loss of life and livelihood.”A senior cabinet minister said that the larger expansion and reshuffle planned by the Yediyurappa cabinet might now happen only next month after the results of the Sira and RR Nagar assembly by-polls are known. “We are still awaiting the green signal from the high command for it as there are a large number of aspirants for it. Otherwise this (the minor reshuffle) would not have been done now.”Karnataka over the last week has registered on an average around 10,000 new Covid-19 cases daily and till now cumulatively has recorded more than 7 lakh cases with nearly 10,000 deaths due to the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proof-of-failure-in-handling-covid-19-says-congress-as-karnataka-gets-new-health-minister/story-VKs0Gn1R6l9DEFG0GdlQ7M.html
12-10-2020||India||The mystery of India’s low coronavirus death rate||India, with its population of 1.3 billion people, has the world’s second-highest number of coronavirus cases, now more than seven million, but far fewer reported deaths than other badly-hit countries.The figures have baffled experts, with explanations ranging from the young population to immunity given by other endemic viral diseases and under-reporting.Here are some of the questions and theories raised by India’s pandemic statistics:- What are the figures? -India said on Sunday there had been 108,334 fatalities from Covid-19 since the first death was reported in mid-March.The world’s second-most populous nation has the lowest number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases -- the observed case-fatality ratio -- among the top 20 worst-affected nations at 1.5 percent, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.In comparison, the United States, the most infected country, has a death rate of 2.8 percent. India’s number of deaths per 100,000 population is 7.73, compared with 64.74 in the United States.- Younger population -Older people suffering from conditions such as diabetes and heart disease have become a particular target of the pandemic but India has a young population with a median age of 28.4, according to the UN World Population Prospects report.In comparison, France -- which has reported almost 700,000 cases and more than 32,000 deaths for a death rate of 4.7 percent -- has a median age of 42.3.- Late start, strict lockdown -The Indian government says the first infection was detected on January 30, with numbers passing 100 in mid-March.By that time, the epidemic was already raging across Europe. Italy had reported more than 24,000 infections and almost 2,000 deaths, while France recorded nearly 5,500 cases and around 150 deaths.Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a nationwide lockdown from March 25 that severely limited movement. That gave India time to prepare for the pandemic, while experts say the strict lockdown may have helped doctors learn from the experiences of other countries.“Many of the treatment protocols were much better stabilised (by that time), whether it was oxygen use or ICU use,” Anand Krishnan, a community medicine professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told AFP.- Possible immunity -Virologist T. Jacob John and other experts told AFP it is possible that other viral diseases such as dengue fever, which is endemic in India, may have given the population some antibody protection against the coronavirus.Others say it is also plausible that exposure to other milder coronaviruses could give some cross-immunity. But all experts say more research is needed into this line of defence.- Under-counting -India already does not count all deaths. The problem is more acute in rural areas where 70 percent of the population live. Many rural deaths are not recorded unless the person has been in a hospital.This has been accentuated during the coronavirus. In many cities, tallies given by city governments and at cemeteries and crematoria do not match. Activists accuse some states of deliberately blaming other conditions for Covid-19 deaths.“Our poor routine death surveillance system... misses many deaths in the first place,” Bangalore-based community medicine expert Hemant Shewade told AFP. He reckons that only one in five deaths is recorded with a cause.Shewade, who has been analysing India’s official toll data, said many suspected Covid-19 deaths were not being recorded.Government-conducted serological surveys -- which test blood for antibodies to estimate how many have fought off the virus -- indicate that 10 times the official number of people may have already been infected, meaning many deaths could have gone unreported, he added.Meanwhile in some cases, the coronavirus may not be listed as the cause of death for patients with other medical conditions.- How to boost accuracy -Experts say greater toll accuracy is possible if is there is more testing, better recording of deaths and post-mortem examinations are carried out on suspected victims.Monitoring excess mortality -- the number of deaths above the “normal” figure -- as well as deaths at home could also shed some light on the real toll, Shewade said.Mumbai, the country’s worst-hit city, found 13,000 excess deaths in March-July compared with the same period last year -- twice the number of reported virus deaths at that time, the Indian Express reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-mystery-of-india-s-low-coronavirus-death-rate/story-dbLMNha0GRG8jcErpj43GN.html
12-10-2020||India||GST Council meeting ends, no consensus on states’ compensation: Nirmala Sitharaman||A meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Monday once again ended without any conclusion and the deadlock on compensation to states for the shortfall in their share of the indirect tax revenue continues, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.Nirmala Sitharaman’s comments came after another marathon meeting of the GST Council as she said there is no dispute but “we may have difference over states’ compensation”. “We were not able to arrive at a consensus. I appealed to all the states... That is how the GST Council meeting ended today,” Sitharaman said during a press conference.Sitharaman, who heads the Council, said the Centre cannot borrow and pay states for the shortfall as it would lead to rise in bond yields, resulting in rise in borrowing costs for the government and the private sector. However, this would not be the case if states borrowed against future GST receipts, she said, adding 21 states had agreed to borrow as suggested by the Centre. However, other states insisted on a decision to be taken by consensus, she said.“The collection of cess is inadequate for paying compensation. This is absolutely apparent for everyone to see and because it is something which was never envisaged, the shortfall will be now be met by borrowing,” she said.Also read | Eight decisions of the GST Council to impact businesses: EY“The Centre has issued a borrowing calendar, if I go beyond that to borrow, the G-Sec deals which are used as benchmark for every other borrowing will go up, this will hence increase borrowing costs for states and private sector too,” she said.The finance minister said that 12 states had accepted the Centre’s repayment proposal to borrow from the markets on their own account and that nine others stood want the Centre to do the borrowing. Sitharaman said she has asked for time to consider the demands of these nine states.“We are open to anyone who wants us to facilitate any loan. A lot of people have chosen Option 1, and some will approach us tomorrow morning. We are ready to deal with it,” she said.This was the second time after October 5 that the GST Council failed to reach a consensus on the Centre’s proposal of states borrowing against future GST collections to make up for the shortfall. This was also the third straight meeting during which discussion over the issue of compensation shortfall was held and ended without a decision.In its last meeting on October 5, the GST Council had deferred a decision on the issue of compensating states for the shortfall after 10 states ruled by non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA) parties insisted that the Centre borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore and compensate them. As many as 21 states, which are mostly BJP-ruled or have supported it on various issues, have opted to borrow Rs 1.10 lakh crore to meet the compensation shortfall. The Centre has released Rs 20,000 crore to the states towards the compensation shortfall so far in the current fiscal.The Centre had in August given two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from the market. It had also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing. Following demand by some states, the amount of Rs 97,000 crore was increased to Rs 1.10 lakh crore.Sitharaman had said 21 states have chosen borrowing option 1 for compensation of revenue shortfall due to GST implementation. She clarified that the Centre is not denying compensation to any state but those which have not chosen any borrowing option have to borrow from the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-coucil-meeting-ends-no-consensus-on-states-s-compensation-nirmala-sitharaman/story-76pn3S5JiVtMq5WGnXb3eP.html

12-10-2020||India||‘Timely moves’: PM Modi after Nirmala Sitharaman’s Rs 73,000 crore stimulus||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday praised Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after she annouced measures worth Rs 73,000 crore to stimulate consumer spending in the economy in an effort to fight the slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Today’s announcements by FM @nsitharaman Ji are timely moves which will boost consumer spending and sentiment as well as push capital expenditure. These steps will also boost demand in our economy,” PM Modi tweeted.Sitharaman’s Rs 73,000 crore package included advance payment of a part of wages to central government employees and cash in lieu of Leave Travel Concession (LTC). She said as much as Rs 11,575 crore would be paid as LTC allowance and advance to these employees on the condition that they spend the amount on non-essential goods before March 31 next year. She said the government will give its employees income tax-exempt cash vouchers in lieu of their entitled travel allowances this year. This cash will have to be spent on buying goods that attract 12% or more GST, in a condition which eliminates the possibility of the cash being spent on essential items. The government will also give as a one-time measure give Rs 10,000 salary loan to all its officers and employees as festival advance.Also read | LTC cash voucher scheme: All you need to know about it“All these measures are likely to create an additional demand of Rs 73,000 crore,” Sitharaman said, adding the proposals would stimulate demand in a “fiscally prudent way.” States would separately be eligible to get Rs 12,000 crore in 50-year interest-free loans for capital expenditure, while the Union government will spend an additional Rs 2,500 crore toward capital expenditure on roads, defence infrastructure, water supply and urban development.The government, which had in May announced a Rs 20 lakh crore ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ stimulus package, is pushing ahead with a full opening to try to boost the economy ahead of the usually high-spending festival season.A tough lockdown imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus had resulted in the GDP contracting by a record 23.9 per cent during April-June. Analysts have predicted that the economy may be headed for its worst contraction this fiscal.“Measures by the government to stimulate demand must not burden the common citizen with future inflation. We also kept it in mind that it must not put government debt on an unsustainable path. Today’s solution must not cause tomorrow’s problem,” she said at a news conference. The finance minister said that these two measures are “expected to create a consumer demand of about Rs 28,000 crore”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-moves-pm-modi-after-nirmala-sitharaman-s-rs-73-000-crore-stimulus/story-tc7SU0TCdem68Tyd7ASa9K.html

12-10-2020||India||Indians abducted in Libya released, efforts on for their return home: MEA||The seven Indian nationals kidnapped in Libya last month have been released by their abductors and handed over to their employer, the external affairs ministry said on Monday. The seven men are in good health and formalities are being completed to facilitate their return to India, the ministry said in a statement. The ministry reiterated that a ban on the travel of Indians to Libya, irrespective of purpose, has been in place since May 2016 because of the security situation there. The circumstances of the release of the seven Indians, including whether any ransom was paid to their abductors, couldn’t immediately be ascertained. It also couldn’t be ascertained who had kidnapped the men. No group or individual has so far claimed responsibility. On October 8, the external affairs ministry confirmed the seven Indians had been abducted at Asshwerif in Libya on September 14, while they were travelling to Tripoli airport to catch a flight back to India. The men belong to Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, and were working for a construction and oilfield supplies company. The men were released on Sunday and India’s ambassador to Tunisia, Puneet Roy Kundal, spoke to them on phone after they were handed over by the abductors to the company that had employed them, Al Shola Al Mudia. “All of them are in good health and are currently staying in the company’s premises in Brega,” the ministry said. “We convey our sincere thanks to the Libyan authorities and the tribal elders from the region for their steadfast cooperation in securing the release of our nationals unharmed,” it added. The Indian embassy in Tunisia handles matters related to the welfare of Indian nationals in Libya. India’s relations with Libya were snapped after the fall of the Muammar Gaddafi regime in 2011, and both countries currently don’t have a representative in each other’s capitals.

In July, the country generated 4,253 tonnes of Covid-19 waste, with Maharashtra (1,180), Karnataka (540) and Tamil Nadu (401) being the top three contributors. India generated 3,025 tonnes of Covid-19 waste in June, with Maharashtra alone accounting for 524 tonnes, followed by Gujarat (350 tonnes), Delhi (333 tonnes) and Tamil Nadu (312 tonnes). The CPCB had in March issued specific guidelines for handling, treatment and disposal of such waste at healthcare facilities, quarantine centres, homes, sample collection centers, laboratories, pollution control boards, urban local bodies and common biomedical waste treatment facilities (CBWTFs). The apex pollution body had in May developed the “Covid19BWM” mobile application to monitor coronavirus-related biomedical waste and to compile the data through electronic manifest system.This application tracks Covid-19 waste at the time of generation, collection and disposal.The Supreme Court has made it mandatory for all urban local bodies and state pollution control boards to use the mobile application for tracking biomedical waste daily in a bid to ensure that the waste is collected, transported and sent to the registered CBWTFs.The directions came on July 30 on recommendations made in a report by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.On Monday, India’s Covid-19 caseload stood at 71.2 lakhs while the death toll was 1.09 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-generated-over-18-000-tonnes-covid-19-waste-since-june-maharashtra-biggest-contributor/story-Zh9jj8O5HqGpyaNwHasWsN.html
12-10-2020||India||Goa govt’s flip-flop as it abruptly withdraws move to bring Covid-19 under its insurance scheme||The Goa government has withdrawn its decision to bring Covid-19 treatment under its universal mediclaim scheme, the Deen Dayal Swasthya Seva Yojana, allegedly under pressure from private hospitals who have said that the rates being offered by the scheme were ‘impractical’. “After deliberation with chief minister Pramod Sawant, we have decided to cancel the notification issued to cover Covid-19 treatment under DDSSY. A fresh notification will be issued in consultation with the CM,” state health minister Vishwajit Rane announced. The Goa government had notified rates for mild Covid-19 cases at Rs 4,600 per day with provision of Rs 64,400 for a 14-day package and critical ones at Rs 6,600 per day with Rs 92,400 set for a 14-day package.Private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients would be reimbursed as per the notified rates under the scheme, the notification stated. However, private hospitals - four private hospitals in the state are admitting Covid-19 patients - have said that they were not consulted over the decision to bring it under the ambit of the existing health insurance scheme and continue to be excluded from the government’s decision-making process. The rates, they said, were not sustainable. Also read: Andhra HC orders CBI to act against YSR leaders, others who attacked judges“We should have been consulted before any such decision was taken. They need to understand that with Covid-19 it is difficult to estimate what is the line of treatment that will be needed and with the rates that were notified, it was just not possible. We have to give the best treatment,” Dr Shekhar Salkar, head of clinical management at Manipal Hospitals, said.The rates notified by the government were also much lower than the cap set for private hospitals treating those affected by complications arising out of Covid-19. According to the rate, a private hospital can charge up to Rs 24,000 per day for an Intensive Care Unit bed while a bed in a Covid ward can be charged at Rs 10,000 per day down from Rs 12,000-13,000 per day with a twin sharing room. Charges for a bed in a single room are around Rs 15,000-16,000 per day, down from Rs 18,000.Rane said that an earlier notification was first drafted in February and the rates weren’t revised. However, the flip-flop by the government was latched on by the Opposition parties who accused the government of attempting to monetise the pandemic. “The decision to cancel the notification covering Covid treatment under Deen Dayal Swasthya Seva Yojana (DDSSY) in private hospitals by the BJP government is a clear reflection of its pro-rich and anti-poor agenda,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-s-flip-flop-as-it-abruptly-withdraws-move-to-bring-covid-19-under-its-insurance-scheme/story-9ePzE2IAzfdtaOXYVhujQP.html
12-10-2020||India||Key FATF affiliate finds Pakistan has complied with only 2 of 40 steps to fight terror funding||A little more than a week ahead of a crucial meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a key regional affiliate of the multilateral watchdog has concluded that Pakistan has complied with only two out of 40 recommendations to counter terror financing and money laundering. The Australia-based Asia-Pacific Group (APG) retained Pakistan in its “enhanced follow-up” category in a report adopted last month. Pakistan was fully compliant with only one of the 40 recommendations exactly a year ago, and the number was increased to two after an assessment by APG this year. FATF began holding a series of virtual meetings from Monday and they will continue till October 19 to discuss matters such as international cooperation, policy development, and risks and trends. FATF will hold its virtual plenary meeting during October 21-23, which will make an assessment of Pakistan’s steps to fight terror financing. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan is widely expected to be retained in FATF’s “grey list”, in which it was included in 2018, largely because of backing from China, Turkey and Malaysia. Opposition from only three FATF members is enough to stop a country being moved to the “black list”, which would entail harsher financial sanctions. The latest follow-up report by APG on Pakistan’s case showed the country was “non-compliant” on four of the 40 recommendations, “partially compliant” on 25 and “largely compliant” on nine. The findings were virtually similar to the conclusions drawn a year ago, except for Pakistan being found fully compliant with two recommendations. “In keeping with APG...procedures, Pakistan will remain in enhanced (expedited) follow-up, and will continue to report back to the APG on progress to strengthen its implementation of AML/CFT [anti-money laundering/counter financing of terrorism] measures,” the report said. Being included in the “enhanced follow-up” category means Pakistan has to submit quarterly progress reports, instead of biannual, to APG. The APG’s 40 recommendations are separate from the 27-point action set for Pakistan by FATF. Even in the case of that action plan, FATF concluded earlier this year that Pakistan had complied with only 14 of the 27 points. The recommendations cover issues such as freezing assets of UN-designated terrorists, use of non-profit organisations (NPOs) by terror groups to raise funds, and even state-run Pakistan Post not being subject to counter-terror financing requirements. The APG report said a risk assessment done in 2019 “confirmed that abuse of NPOs for TF [terror financing] purposes continues to pose a significant threat, both domestically and externally; that charities and fund raising is a source of funds for almost all EOCs [entities of concern]; and that terrorist organisations are known to use frontal NPOs, including registered charities (e.g. FIF [Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation], which was a registered NPO established by associates of LeT [Lashkar-e-Taiba])”. Pakistan has identified a total of 1,307 NPOs “as high risk” and these “will be subject to enhanced inspection”, the report added. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said, “Because Pakistan has been adept at taking face-saving measures just before FATF meetings, it appears it is doing the same thing again. Such steps may go down positively with some FATF members, who will say, ‘Okay, it’s good you’ve done this, but now take some more steps.’” He added, “There has been a visible reduction in activities of terrorist groups, like public rallies, but their workers haven’t disappeared and their networks and infrastructure remain. Social and charity organisation such as FIF remain, and provide legitimacy to the terror groups in Pakistani society. The threat to India remains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-fatf-affiliate-finds-pakistan-has-complied-with-only-2-of-40-steps-to-fight-terror-funding/story-XPWKrfj5xXBjUIbKtTbRgJ.html

The activists stopped vehicles carrying meat items meant for the big cats housed in the zoo. They blocked the roads leading to the zoo for several hours before allowing authorities to take the food items inside. “The vehicles carrying meat for the zoo inmates were stopped briefly by some miscreants. We had to call the police to disperse them. There’s no issue regarding supply of meat to the animals now,” said Tejas Mariswamy, divisional forest officer (DFO), Assam state zoo. Established in 1957 and spread over 175 hectares in the middle of Guwahati in the Hengrabari reserve forest, Assam state zoo, which has 1,040 wild animals and birds of 112 species, is the biggest zoo in the Northeast. At present, the zoo has 8 tigers, 3 lions, 26 leopards and other small cats like leopard cat, jungle cat etc. The zoo is a big attraction among people in Guwahati and others from across the region, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been closed for the public since March this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindu-activists-oppose-serving-beef-to-tigers-in-guwahati-zoo/story-XpD2DEdHhfXNB1d0BgKYyO.html
12-10-2020||India||Leh council polls: ‘People trust BJP, they support us,’ says Kiren Rijiju||Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Monday exuded confidence of BJP’s smooth sailing in the ensuing elections to the 30-member Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) of Leh. The sixth council elections will be held on October 22. Rijiju reached Leh on Sunday to campaign for party candidates. “Elections are an indispensable part of democracy and Leh council is going to polls on October 22. People in Leh trust BJP and they want to support us because under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi various developmental works have been taken up. From making Ladakh a UT to speedy development of the region, these works should not stop,” he told media persons in Leh. Congress campaign is being led by its leader and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora. A local said that nothing can be said as of now and both the arch-rivals appear neck to neck in the race. “There was resentment among the people of Leh against the BJP government for not providing us safeguards under the sixth schedule of the Constitution but then home minister Amit Sham promised a delegation of Apex Body of People’s Movement (ABPM), led by Thupstan Chhewang, that the same will be extended to us. So, how voters react to the verbal promise will be seen in the ensuing elections,” he said. Also read: Rhea Chakraborty asks CBI to act against neighbour for ‘false’ claim on TVOn October 7, Union minister Anurag Thakur had said that people of Leh will get much more than sixth schedule only because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Thakur had assured them that land, culture, ethnic values and everything shall be safeguarded. The Leh Council has 30 seats with a provision for nominating four members; 26 get elected via votes. On September 28, former BJP minister and ex-president of the Ladakh unit, Chering Dorjay, had cautioned the Centre of a sustained campaign in case the apex body was hoodwinked. Apex body of People’s Movement - an apolitical body comprising former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang, Dorjay, Thiksay monastery head Rinpoche Nawang Chamba Stanzin and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora - has been demanding constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule of the Constitution to Ladakh on the lines of north-eastern states having constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule. The umbrella group includes political parties and religious organizations and all-powerful Leh-based Ladakh Buddhist Association. The safeguards also guarantee more teeth to the two hill development councils of Leh and Kargil with legislative powers. Following Shah’s assurance, the delegation withdrew its call to boycott the ensuing polls. Thupstan Chhewang, former BJP MP, had resigned from his post and primary membership of the party in November 2018 for not conferring UT status to Ladakh region and other promises made by the BJP in 2014 general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leh-council-polls-people-trust-bjp-they-support-us-says-kiren-rijiju/story-Bc0tEZWmnJMHH6X45TvsfN.html
12-10-2020||India||School closure over Covid-19 may cost over USD 400 billion to India: World Bank||The prolonged closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic in India may cause a loss of over USD 400 billion in the country’s future earnings, besides substantial learning losses, according to a World Bank report.South Asia region stands to lose USD 622 billion from the school closures in the present scenario or up to USD 880 billion in a more pessimistic scenario, it said, adding while the regional loss is largely driven by India, all countries will lose substantial shares of their GDP. The report titled “Beaten or Broken? Informality and Covid-19 in South Asia” claims that South Asia is set to plunge into its worst-ever recession in 2020 as the devastating impacts of Covid-19 on the region’s economies linger.“Temporary school closures in all South Asian countries have had major implications for students. They have kept 391 million students out of school in primary and secondary education, further complicating efforts to resolve the learning crisis,” said the report.“While most governments have made enormous efforts to mitigate the impact of school closures, it has been difficult to engage children through remote learning initiatives,” it said. The report also noted that the pandemic may cause up to 5.5 million students to drop out from the education system and cause substantial learning losses, which will have a lifetime impact on the productivity of a generation of students.“Most school systems closed in March, and -- though there are important exceptions -- countries are starting to reopen or have already opened their schools. Children have been out of school for approximately 5 months. Being out of school for that long means that children not only stop learning new things, they also forget some of what they have learned. “The projected learning loss for the region is 0.5 years of learning-adjusted years of schooling (LAYS), falling from 6.5 LAYS to 6.0 LAYS, an enormous setback from recent advances in schooling,” it said. The ‘Learning Adjusted Year of Schooling’ (LAYS) concept, introduced by the World Bank, seeks to combine access and learning outcomes into a single measure. It combines quantity (years of schooling) and quality (how much kids know at a given grade level) into a single summary measure of human capital in a society. The report has projected that based on country data on household labor incomes, the average child in South Asia may lose USD 4,400 in lifetime earnings once having entered the labour market, equivalent to 5 percent of total earnings. “These projections are based on what we currently know about returns to schooling, using the reduced level of learning caused by the crisis. Summing these numbers for all children in South Asia, the region stands to lose USD 622 billion from the school closures in the present scenario, or up to USD 880 billion in a more pessimistic scenario. “While the regional loss is largely driven by India, all countries will lose substantial shares of their GDP. For reference, note that South Asian governments spend only USD 400 billion per year in total on primary and secondary education. The total loss in economic output from the current closures is hence substantially higher than what countries currently spend on education,” it said. The novel corona virus has infected over 3.7 crore people across the globe claiming over 10.5 lakh lives.India’s Covid-19 caseload stands at 71.2 lakhs while the death toll is 1.09 lakh as on Monday.Universities and schools across the country were ordered shut on March 16 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. On March 25, the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown. While several restrictions have been eased gradually in different phases of the ‘unlock’ since June 8, educational institutions continue to remain closed.However, according to the latest unlock guidelines, schools, colleges and other educational institutions outside Covid-19 containment zones can reopen after October 15. The final decision on reopening the institutions has been left with the states and Union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-closure-over-covid-19-may-cost-over-usd-400-billion-to-india-world-bank/story-hxzbNLnXV46hi0bPyOvfVJ.html

Lucknow has 10 single-screens and 9 multiplexes out of which only a few are set to throw their gates open from Thursday. Most single screen theatres will open by the month-end or next month. In a meeting held between cinema owners and Lucknow Divisional Commissioner Ranjan Kumar on Monday, they have been asked to operate with camera-enabled thermal scanners which gives accurate temperature. “Since it is a costly device so some may delay opening by a few days. Cinema management has to provide a certificate to the district administration that the entire staff had been tested for Covid-19. Besides, it was clarified that even for families also one-seat gap has been made mandatory,” said Ashish Agarwal, president, UP Cinema Exhibitor Federation. The state has 300 single cinemas and 87 multiplexes. “Besides hand sanitiser and thermal checking, we will also provide face mask if someone turns-up without it and would make patron download Arogya Setu app as both are mandatory. During the staggered intervals, only packed food material will be sold in the lobby area,” he added. For now, the tickets pricings have been kept the same as pre-Covid days even though the theatres will operate with maximum 50% capacity. Halls will be sanitized after every show while ACs will be maintained at 24-27 degree C while staff will wear gloves and face shields, said Agarwal. The move has brought cheers on the face of exhibitors and theatre owners. Rajesh Tandon of Novelty said, “We will be procuring camera-enabled thermal scanners and hope to start both Lalbagh and Aliganj theatres from Friday. We have reduced a show so that we can follow the sanitasation guidelines.” Uday Vikram of Inox, Crown Mall said they were looking forward to start operations from Thursday. However, Pratibha Cinema’s Vikas Jain said they may open the cinema hall from next week as currently there was no new release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cinemas-to-open-with-new-normal/story-T1FnAvJpzbMhHmFf0yauzH.html
12-10-2020||India||Amaravati agitation completes 300 days; paid artists, says Andhra minister||The agitation by farmers of Amaravati, the capital region of Andhra Pradesh, against the YSR Congress Party government’s decision to form three capitals for the state entered its 300th day on Monday.The protesting farmers, women and youth from the capital region, under the banner of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (Amaravati protection committee) took out rallies and staged demonstrations in several villages in the capital region, demanding that Amaravati be retained as the only capital of the state.Hundreds of women from Rayapudi, Thulluru, Velagapudi, Mandadam, Venkatayapalem and Krishnayapalem, under the banner of Amaravati Women Joint Action Committee, took out a rally from Thullur holding green flags and raising slogans of ‘Jai Amaravati’. The women took strong exception to a remark made by state minister for municipal administration Botsa Satyanarayna that they were “paid protesters” propped up by the Telugu Desam Party.“Let chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy or his cabinet ministers come here and talk to us. They will know whether we are aggrieved farmers or paid artists,” said a protester.The minister told the reporters in Visakhapatnam on Sunday that the government would not acknowledge the so-called agitation by paid artists of Amaravati in the name of farmers. “They don’t have people’s support. It is ridiculous that they are planning to celebrate their 300 days of agitation. It is like conducting a 100-day function for a flop film,” he alleged.The JAC leaders, however, said the agitation would continue indefinitely, till the Jagan government withdrew its three-capital plan. “When he was in the opposition, Jagan had supported Amaravati and even demanded that 30,000 acres of land should be allocated for the capital. Now, he has betrayed the farmers after coming to power,” JAC leader S Padmasri noted.At Guntur, the farmers staged a dharna in protest against the capital shift. Several leaders from the TDP, the Congress and CPI took part in the dharna. TDP MP from Guntur Galla Jayadev said the AP Reorganisation Act was enacted by the Centre and everybody should honour this act.“It is not correct on the part of the Centre to say now that it has nothing to do with the capital location,” he said.At Vijayawada, the JAC leaders held a demonstration in front of the Block Revenue Office at Gandhinagar. The police took many of them into custody for violating the rules. “It is unfortunate that the state government was least bothered about the farmers who had been agitating for the last 300 days,” a JAC leader V Gopalakrishna said.TDP general secretary and MLC Nara Lokesh took part in the agitation at Penumaka village in Amaravati and extended his support to the one-state-one-capital demand of the farmers.He accused the chief minister of trying to kill the ‘baby capital’ of Amaravati, in utter disregard for the rights and sacrifices of farmers who gave away 34,000 acres in response to a call given by the then chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.Lokesh also visited and addressed agitators at Yerrabalem, Krishnayapalem and other villages in Amaravati capital area.The TDP activists took up demonstrations in various other places including Tirupati, Anantapur, Rajahmundry, Kurnool, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amaravati-agitation-completes-300-days-paid-artists-says-andhra-minister/story-lurgRHSCzphfjsIK60SD8K.html
12-10-2020||India||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Kolkata Police lowers guard against those without masks||At a time when Kolkata is witnessing a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases just ahead of the Durga Puja, the Kolkata Police seems to have relaxed its norms and lowered its vigil against people not wearing masks. The number of people arrested every day for not wearing masks in Kolkata has dropped to almost half during the festive season compared to the number of people arrested earlier in August and September. On an average 160 people were arrested everyday between October 5 and October 11, for not wearing masks in public places while more than 300 people were arrested every day for the same reason between September 5 and September 11, barring two lockdown dates when the number of arrests was even higher.The number of such arrests on September 7 and September 11, when lockdown was enforced, was 525 and 488. In August, during the same period, the number of arrests was higher, 410 every day barring lockdown days which were enforced on August 5 and August 8. On these two dates, the number of people arrested was 469 and 494. “We are looking into it,” said Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, joint commissioner of Kolkata Police (HQ). This comes at a time when Covid-19 cases in the city have almost doubled over the past one month and doctors have warned the Mamata Banerjee administration that relaxation of restrictions during the festive season could result in a three to four fold spike in Covid-19 cases. They have cited the example of Onam in Kerala. Kolkata on September 8 had recorded 380 new Covid-19 cases. On October 10, the city registered 783 new cases. The West Bengal government had made wearing of facemasks mandatory on April 12 to check the disease from spreading. Over the past few months, the Kolkata Police have been arresting people every day for not wearing masks. “Unlike other states where people are beaten up for violating Cobid-19 norms, the West Bengal government has decided to treat people in a more humane way particularly during the festive season. People are being requested to wear masks and maintain social distance. Hence the arrest figures may have gone down a bit during the festive season,” said a top official of the state government. On Monday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged people to wear masks and maintain distance in public places. She also urged the puja organisers to distribute masks and hand sanitizers to pandal hoppers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-kolkata-police-lowers-guard-against-those-without-masks/story-hSJUpKCINq7ee2gHPecvfP.html

The plea said Bollywood is a distinct and well recognised class, comprising the Hindi film industry in Mumbai. It said that since several years Bollywood is a huge source of revenue for the public exchequer, earns significant foreign exchange for India by way of revenue from overseas releases of films, tourism etc, and is a big source of employment, with various other industries also being largely dependent on it.“Bollywood is unique and stands on a different footing from any other industry inasmuch as it is an industry that is dependent almost solely on goodwill, appreciation and acceptance of its audience. The livelihood of persons associated with Bollywood is being severely impacted by the smear campaign being run by the defendants.“This is in addition to the ongoing pandemic which has resulted in extreme revenues and work opportunity loss. The privacy of the members of Bollywood is being invaded, and their reputations are being irreparably damaged by painting the entire Bollywood as criminals, seeped in drug culture, and making being part of Bollywood as synonymous with criminal acts in the public imagination,” the plea read.The matter is likely to be heard this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-top-news-channels-face-lawsuit-for-calling-bollywood-dirt-druggies/story-PVOF5hu5KNnjnnQFFAp5eJ.html
12-10-2020||India||Even an ordinary BJP worker can defeat Hooda, says Haryana CM Khattar||Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar on Monday said even an ordinary BJP worker is capable of defeating former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda form Baroda assembly seat in Sonipat.Khattar made the remarks days after Hooda dared him to contest the next month’s Baroda assembly bypoll against him.BJP and Congress are yet to declare their candidates for the Baroda assembly, where bypolls are to be held on November 3.Baroda assembly seat fell vacant in April following the death of sitting Congress MLA Shri Krishan Hooda. Hooda, who is the Leader of the Opposition in Haryana assembly, had said if the Khattar government is confident of its performance, the chief minister should contest the by-election.Khattar said the Congress party did an “experiment” earlier too in Jind bypolls in January last year, but they had to eat humble pie. “They experimented earlier when they had fielded a national level leader (Randeep Singh Surjewala). We are saying this time too they should do another experiment (in Baroda),” said Khattar when asked to comment on Hooda daring him to fight form Baroda.Khattar, however, dismissed the challenge, saying even an ordinary BJP worker is capable of defeating Hooda from Baroda.“If he decides to jump into fray, even an ordinary worker of our party is capable of defeating him,” Khattar told reporters here on the sidelines of an event.He said a new and ordinary worker of BJP Krishan Middha had inflicted defeat on Congress’ senior leader Randeep Singh Surjewala from Jind, a seat which the saffron party had won for the first time. Notably, the Jind bypoll in January last year was necessitated after the demise of Middha’s father Hari Chand Middha, who was an INLD leader.Shortly before the Jind bypoll, Krishan Middha had joined the BJP.“Like in Jind, our ordinary and new party worker defeated Surjewala, here too (in Baroda), an ordinary and local worker will defeat Hooda if he contests from there,” said Khattar.Hooda had recently said all sections of the society were fed up with the BJP-JJP dispensation. He had also said there was the anger of the farming community against the Centre’s three farm laws. “This government has failed on all fronts. During the past six years, they neglected the constituency (Baroda) and now they talk of development, but people have seen their true face and will teach them a lesson in the bypoll,” Hooda had said.Baroda assembly seat falling in Jat-dominated Deswali belt of Rohtak-Sonipat region is considered Hoodas’ stronghold and the Congress had reaped rich electoral gains in the 2019 assembly polls from there.“If the government is confident of its development work, CM Khattar should come in as the candidate in Baroda by-election. If Khattar contests the by-election, I am ready to contest against him.“Let the Baroda by-election decide if the people are satisfied with the development work and vote on the popularity of the government,” Hooda, a two-time chief minister had told reporters earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-an-ordinary-bjp-worker-can-defeat-hooda-khattar/story-vxU3WvM3OoNbvZcHtWmEeJ.html

12-10-2020||India||Rhea Chakraborty asks CBI to act against neighbour for ‘false’ claim on TV||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, who walked out last week after spending a month in Byculla jail in connection with the drug probe in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, has written to the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is also probing the case of actor’s untimely death, to take action against her neighbour for giving misleading statement. The neighbour had claimed that Sushant had gone to drop Chakraborty at her home on June 13. Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai flat on June 14, which the cops had ruled as death by suicide. Earlier this month, even as the CBI maintaned that it is looking into all aspects of the case, the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) medical board set-up to look into the case “ruled out murder”.The case was first being investigated by the Mumbai Police. However, a month later, on the complaint of Rajput’s father, the Bihar police had registered a case of abetment of suicide, criminal conspiracy, cheating, theft, wrongful restraint and confinement and named Chakraborty and her family as accused. The case was later transferred to the CBI.During the probe, Rhea, 28, had claimed that she left Rajput’s house a week before the actor died. However, her neighbour Dimple Thawani in an interview had claimed that an eyewitness had seen Rajput dropping Chakraborty at her residence on June 13. Thawani had claimed that someone had informed her about this.Rhea, in her complaint against Thawani to the CBI, has claimed that Thawani “made patently false and bogus allegations against me knowing them to be false to mislead the investigation”.Further Rhea has claimed this amounts to an offence under section 203 (giving false information) and 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“The offences are serious and the allegations were made on Republic TV channel without any basis,” Rhea said in her letter to the CBI, seeking action against her.The letter was sent a day after her lawyer Satish Maneshinde announced that they would make a list of people who gave misleading information about the incident.“We will be forwarding a list of people to the CBI who made fake and false claims on TV and electronic Media including carrying mobile recording and fake stories on the SSR [Sushant Singh Rajput] case with particular reference to Rhea Chakraborty to go after them and record their statements. We will request the CBI to take legal action against them for misleading the investigations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-asks-cbi-to-act-against-neighbour-for-false-claim-on-tv/story-lqPpIbvtfBDVqyINcA3BLK.html

12-10-2020||India||Top Lashkar commander among two terrorists killed in encounter in Srinagar||A top commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) from Pakistan was among the two terrorists killed by security forces in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar on Monday.The two killings took the number of terrorists killed in Srinagar this year to 18. Since October 6, as many as 10 terrorists have been killed across Kashmir valley in four different operations and an attack.Officials said that a joint cordon and search operation was launched by Srinagar Police and CRPF in Rambagh area on specific information.“During the search operation, as the presence of terrorists was ascertained, they were given the opportunity to surrender after evacuating all the civilians. However they fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party which was retaliated leading to an encounter in which two LeT terrorists were killed,” a police spokesperson said.Also read: 54 done, BRO rushes to build 48 bridges that can shoulder T-90 main battle tanksThe killed terrorists were identified as top LeT commander Saifullah (a Pakistani National) and Irshad Ahmed Dar alias Abu Usama, a resident of Pulwama who was active since May-2019 and involved in several civilian killings and attacks. “The important fact of today’s operation is that a top terrorist of Lashkar from Pakistan, Saifullah has been killed. He was involved in three major attacks in the past,” said Dilbag Singh, J&K Director General of Police (DGP) at a press conference. Saifullah infiltrated earlier this year and two months ago shifted his base from north to south Kashmir.The DGP said that he was involved in planning and executing terror attacks on security forces which includes the killing of a CRPF officer at Chadoora on September 24, two CRPF personnel at Kandizal area of Pampore on October 5. He was also part of the group involved in the killing of two police personnel at Nowgam Srinagar on August 14.Keeping in view the prevailing pandemic due to Covid-19, the dead bodies of the killed militants shall be sent to Baramulla for burial after completion of all medico-legal formalities. 18 terrorists killed in 8 encounters in SrinagarThe DGP said that there have been eight encounters in Srinagar this year.“This is for the first time in 2020 that Srinagar city has witnessed eight encounters so far in which we have been able to neutralize 18 terrorists,” he said.The DGP added that the security forces were not allowing the terrorists to have a foothold in the city despite their repeated attempts.“So Lashkar and all, they have been trying to make a foothold in the city but our intelligence network is quite good and whenever they try to find a foothold in the city we have been able to find out and take care,” he said.“There is one active terrorist of Srinagar and two others are involved in terrorist activities. The search is on and I am sure they will be brought to justice,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-lashkar-commander-among-two-terrorists-killed-in-encounter-in-srinagar/story-XrUanZoV7aRwuhWA5OKw4K.html

12-10-2020||India||Overconfidence, low testing rate to blame for Covid-19 spike in Kerala, say experts||“Corona Slayer” and “Rock Star Health Minister” were just some of the epithets that the international media heaped on Kerala health minister K K Shailaja and her team a couple of months ago. They said the Communist-ruled state was a role model for many Western countries that were struggling with pandemic control measures in the initial stages. In tune with this, in May, the Kerala government had claimed it had flattened the coronavirus curve. But these records are history now-- statistics show things are not so rosy for God’s Own Country. The health ministry data shows it is fast becoming a Covid-19 hub. Other than the low mortality rate, all other indicators are heavily loaded against Kerala. The state’s test positivity rate (TPR) is almost double the national average (15.6% against the national average of 8.4%) and in the last one week it added more than 50,000 active cases to its tally, the fastest viral caseload. While the rest of India is adding fresh cases at a rate of one per cent the state’s growth rate is around 3 per cent. In tests per million, the state is on the 15th spot now, statistics show. With a high density of population (859 people per sq km) and a large number of elderly people (at least 20 per cent are above 65 years of age) the going is really tough for the state, medical experts have warned. The government’s over confidence, low testing rate and its public relation drive led to the sorry state, they said. But the Health Minister said things weren’t that bad and there was a concerted move to blame the government and portray it in bad light. “We admit Covid-19 cases are on the rise. We expected this. But the state has got the lowest mortality rate; it is less than 0.5 per cent. Our intervention delayed the outbreak and we got enough time to prepare ourselves,” she said. When lockdown was in force, the numbers were under control but when people started coming from abroad and other states, the situation really changed,” she said. She blamed relaxations during the Onam festivities (August) for the sudden spike. “We can’t remain in lockdown forever. People will have to go out and work, otherwise they will starve. But once rules were relaxed people took it for granted. You can’t blame the government for this,” she said adding opposition parties and others (a section of doctors and media) were on a race to find fault with the government. She said daily cases could go up by 15,000 by next week and the government has evolved enough measures to manage the surge capacity. As Covid-19 cases mount, the health department has given special directions to overcrowded hospitals to admit only serious patients. Signs of fatigue are visible in many hospitals. A series of agitations carried out by opposition parties last month also played a key role, the minister said. The state had witnessed protests and baton charges when the opposition activists took to streets seeking the resignation of higher education minister K T Jaleel who was interrogated in connection with the sensational gold smuggling case. But the opposition said it was a ploy to hide the government’s failure. “Five ministers in Pinarayi Vijayan’s cabinet tested positive. They never took part in any agitation. The government can’t blame the opposition for its failure,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala adding the state was after records and honours. “We warned the government that its public relations exercise won’t last for long. The first state to report a coronavirus case in the country, its test rate is abysmally poor,” he said. (Total tests are 35,94,320). However, CPI (M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said when the Pinarayi Vijayan government was all set for a second term, the opposition Congress and BJP have joined hands to topple the government. He said the state’s Covid-19 control measures were the best in the country that really helped it to cut down the death rate. “In neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka deaths are above 9,000-10,000 whereas in Kerala it is 1003,” he said. He said a section of the media also played a key role to “discredit the government”. As the blame game rages, experts want the government to take immediate steps to manage surge capacity and hike tests. Surge capacity refers to the ability of the health system to maintain sudden and unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge the system. “The state is in a critical stage. It has to double its tests immediately. The government will have to rope in more experts at least for now,” said Dr SS Lal, a public health expert who served the World Health Organisation for many years. Many experts have criticised the government saying it was only heeding bureaucrats and experts were being kept away. They also said the government was not sharing vital information and data and private players were not taken into confidence. “Cases are multiplying fast and most hospitals are filled to the brim. Health authorities should re-draw their strategies to save maximum lives,” said Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter president Dr Abraham Varghese. The CM had criticised the IMA recently, when it pointed out pitfalls saying it had a “different agenda”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/overconfidence-low-testing-rate-to-blame-for-covid-19-spike-in-kerala-say-experts/story-DFKuqkF9lCgn3hEsXSwIrI.html
12-10-2020||India||BJP slams Farooq Abdullah for saying he hopes Art 370 is restored in J&K with China’s help||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has dubbed as “seditious” National Conference chief and MP Farooq Abdullah’s comment that he wished that with China’s support, Article 370 will be restored in Jammu and Kashmir. Abdullah, also a former chief minister of J&K, said in a television interview that China never accepted the reading down of Article 370 which gave special status to the erstwhile state. Lashing out at Abdullah, BJP’s Sambit Patra said, “It is saddening as well as worrying. A sitting MP is using such words for the country. He thinks that China’s aggression is because abrogation of Article 370 has happened. He categorically states that since Indian Parliament abrogated Article 370, China is disturbed and that is why China’s aggression is justified. He seems to justify the expansionist tendencies of China.” Terming the statement as “seditious” he said, “If you have reservations about the democratic process you’re allowed to talk about it but to say that you will join hands with another country to reinstall something is condemnable. This is also seditious.”Patra said this was not the first time that he has said spoken against national interest. “On September 24, he said if you ask people in J&K whether they are Indian, they will say, ‘No we don’t want to be in India and we don’t to be part of India’. In the same statement he also said it would be good if we merge with China. To raise questions about the independence and sovereignty of the country does not behove a Member of Parliament,” he said.Patra also attacked the Congress leadership for making statements against the sovereignty of the country. “If you look at the statements made by Rahul Gandhi, you will realise that Farooq Abdullah and Rahul Gandhi are the two sides of the same coin. Hatred for Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led them to the extent of hating the country. A few days ago, Gandhi had said that India’s prime minister has surrendered, is a coward and he’s hiding,” Patra said. The Congress leader had questioned the surgical strike and the air strikes become a hero in Pakistan, the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-slams-farooq-abdullah-for-saying-he-hopes-art-370-is-restored-in-j-k-with-china-s-help/story-7FPTzxUz5EFiz6YY3OLbxK.html

12-10-2020||India||15 years of RTI: One-third of information commissions headless; misuse an obstacle||Around one-third of information commissions in India are headless, one-fourth of information commission posts are vacant and the Jharkhand and Tripura information commissions are defunct, two reports on 15 years of the Right To Information (RTI) law stated Monday.The transparency law came into force on October 10, 2005, giving the citizens a statutory right to seek a response from the government, which in a way became the biggest tool for grievance redressal. However, with the passage of time, the burden of replying to RTI applications increased, which increased response time, leading to a higher pendency of cases. And its misuse became more rampant. In 15 years, around 33 million RTI applications were filed with various government departments across the country, said Transparency International India (TII), based on annual reports of information commissions across India.Also Read: NMSEZ damaged Uran mangroves, wetlands, reveals RTIOnly about 9% of these RTI applications resulted in a second appeal, meaning that over 90% of the applicants were satisfied with the government response, which transparency law activists said is RTI’s biggest achievement.The first appeal against a dissatisfactory RTI reply is filed with the department from where the reply is sought. And the second appeal is filed with the information commission, an independent body that can direct departments to provide information and impose penalty for a delay in providing information.However, one of the reports also stated that Jharkhand information commission is without any commissioner since May 8, 2020, when the incumbent acting chief information commissioner Himanshu Chaudhary retired.“We invited applications in January but the appointment is pending in the absence of clear directives from the assembly secretariat,” said Sudhir Kumar Ranjan, joint secretary in Jharkhand’s personnel department. The appointment is stuck as the Jharkhand assembly is yet to appoint leader of opposition, who is a member of the appointment committee headed by the chief minister.Tripura information commission also does not have a single commissioner April, 2020, after G Kameswara Rao, former chief secretary, retired. State government officials said on condition of anonymity that they were in the process of making the appointment.Also Read: Consider starting e-hearings for RTI in all departments: Bombay HC to Maharashtra govtA report by Satark Nagarik Sangathan (SNS) released Monday, said nine states including Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan did not have a chief information commissioner, whose appointment under the RTI law is a statutory requirement.“The absence of a chief information commissioner has serious ramifications for the effective functioning of the information commissions since the RTI Act envisages a critical role for the chief, including, superintendence, management and direction of the affairs of the information commission,” the SNS report said. The central information commission (CICI), which hears second appeals against all Central government departments and union territories, has also been without a chief since August 17, 2020. “This is the fifth time in six years that the CIC has been rendered headless due to the delay in appointing a new chief upon the incumbent demitting office,” the SNS report stated. The Department of Personnel and Training has said the process for chief’s appointment has started. Anjali Bhardwaj of SNS said showing complete lack of political will, governments are not making appointments of commissioners in a timely manner leading to backlog of 2.2 lakh cases till July 31, 2020. “Today, one of the most significant challenges the transparency regime faces is the attack on the transparency watchdogs,” she said. The TII report said 24% of the information commissioner posts in 29 states were lying vacant despite Supreme Court order on February 15, 2019, directing all states and the Centre to fill all the vacant posts within six months, saying seeking information was a “fundamental right”. The court had also lamented that most of the information commissioners appointed under the public service category were retired bureaucrats while asking states to include people from diverse background in the commissions.During the Covid-19 pandemic, only 10 of the 29 information commissions worked, and in these commissions also very less appeals were heard citing technological glitches. “Instead of providing respite during the pandemic, the transparency watchdogs in most states stopped functioning. The pandemic has further undermined one of the most important governance legislations,” said SR Wadwa, chairman, TII.The SNS report said that despite 15 years of the law, many information commissions are not very transparent about their functioning. “Many information commissions still provide very less information about their orders and appeals, making analysis of their work difficult,” said Anjali Bhardwaj of SNS, adding that the Bihar information commission does not even have a website.Several studies on RTI done in the past decade shows that the transparency law has improved governance and checked petty corruption but its misuse has also increased manifold. Now, most public information officers are reluctant to give information to serial RTI applicants and publicists. On this aspect, Padma awardee RTI activist Subhash Aggarwal said that in 15 years, RTI proved to be “curative” and “preventive” for corruption and improved governance but its misuse emerged as a major obstacle in its efficacy. “There is a need to increase RTI fees and seek identity documents, as some states such as Punjab and Odisha have done, to prevent the misuse. The government is willing to provide information to genuine RTI applicants,” he said.The importance of RTI law for India could be gauged from the Supreme Court 2019 judgement, which stated that the RTI has the potential to bring about good governance, which is an integral part of a vibrant democracy. “Attaining good governance is also one of the visions of the Constitution. It also has vital connection with the development,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-years-of-rti-one-third-of-information-commissions-headless-misuse-an-obstacle/story-LHcDDpQTm3z4Om7rQazKcP.html
12-10-2020||India||Three leopard foetuses found in Uttarakhand’s Almora||In a rare occurrence three leopard foetuses were found in Uttarakhand’s Almora district on Sunday, forest officials said Monday. Mahatim Yadav, divisional forest officer of Almora forest division said that the forest officials were initially informed on Sunday evening that three leopard cubs were found dead but after reaching the spot they realised that those were foetuses. “The leopard foetuses were found in a village in Someshwar forest range of the division. They were found near two houses in the range. At present, we have recovered the leopard foetuses and are examining them to learn more. One foetus was approximately 18 cm long and they are likely to be two months old. It could be due to premature delivery or some health issue, but not much is known as of now,” said Yadav. Leopards have a gestation period of around 90-105 days (a little over three months) after which cubs are usually born. Leopards usually give birth to two to three cubs at once. Leopards cubs are dependent on their mother for food till the age of three months after being born and usually do not leave the den during this period. Yadav further said that a team has been formed and patrolling has been increased in the area where the foetuses were found to see if the mother leopard returns.Wildlife experts here said that such an event has not been reported before.Parag Nigam, a senior scientist from Wildlife Health Management department of Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun said, “Such a thing has not been reported much, so a lot is not known. If tests are done on the foetuses then more can be known, but something like this does not happen often.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-leopard-foetuses-found-in-uttarakhand-s-almora-for-the-first-time/story-JCBDuMgytS8xUWWgXMMJ5O.html
12-10-2020||India||Teen raped on campus while UP civil services exam was underway; 8 arrested||A 17-year-old girl was raped on Sunday allegedly by a student of a Jhansi college inside the campus while Uttar Pradesh provincial civil services (PCS) preliminary exam 2020 was underway, police said. The girl, a class 10 student, alleged in her complaint that around a dozen students of the college forcibly took her inside the campus where one of them outraged her modesty while others made an objectionable video and robbed her of Rs 2,000. She further alleged that they even thrashed the boy she had gone to meet. She also alleged that the students also threatened her that they will make the video viral if she revealed the incident to anyone.Dinesh Kumar P, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Jhansi, said eight students, including two main accused Rohit Saini and Bharat Kushwaha, were arrested in connection with the incident. Further investigations were on and if names of any other students surfaced in the crime, action will be taken against them too, the SSP added. The victim’s presence inside the exam centre is still being investigated. She alleges she was forced in from a gate that was unguarded. The center had just one guard and he was involved with the exam process. “Some police personnel heard the cries of the girl and took her to the Sipri Bazaar police station where she narrated her ordeal to the police. She identified one of the accused as Bharat,” the SSP said.“The police have registered an FIR under various Sections 376D [charge convict with gang rape], 395 [dacoity], 386 [extortion], 323 [causing hurt] and 120B [criminal conspiracy] of Indian Penal Code and section 66D of the IT Act and section 3/4 of POCSO Act in which Rohit Saini and Bharat Kushwaha were named.

12-10-2020||India||Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurates 8 bridges in Uttarakhand, says will benefit remote areas||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday inaugurated 44 newly built bridges including eight in Uttarakhand, by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in a virtual programme attended by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and other officials. In Uttarakhand, all the eight bridges inaugurated are located in the hill district of Pithoragarh which shares the border with Nepal and China. Hailing the development, Singh said that the bridges are of strategic importance and would help in improving connectivity to remote areas. The eight bridges in Pithoragarh district have been built in Kulanagad, Tullagad, Dongatoll, Dobat-1, Elagad, Sirall, Sayaldhar and Charigad areas. The eight bridges range from 30m to 85m with Dongatoll being the shortest one--30m while Charigad is the longest one--85m. CM Rawat appreciating the work of BRO said, “The bridges will be beneficial especially for the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. They will also help in the development of the remote areas of the district by improving connectivity.” He said that the people of the remote areas up in the hills of Pithoragarh were demanding the bridges for a long time. “Their demands have now finally been met, thus opening new avenues of development there.” Rawat also hailed the BRO saying, “It built these bridges in considerable time which shows its efficiency and the determination of the government to improve the infrastructure of the strategically important areas in the hills.” Earlier after inaugurating the 44 bridges built by BRO in seven states and Union Territories, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “The bridges will play a very vital role in supplying essentials to the armed forces in the areas near the border with China.” “These will fulfill the strategic requirement of connectivity to the border areas considering the fact that we have ongoing border issues with both China and Pakistan,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-virtually-inaugurates-8-bridges-in-uttarakhand-says-will-benefit-remote-areas/story-DhOXhOAE7djYqGaKGVnG6O.html
12-10-2020||India||Pakistan, China ‘creating border dispute under a mission’: Rajnath Singh||India’s northern and eastern frontiers remain tense, with Pakistan and China creating conditions that seem to suggest that “a border dispute is being created under a mission”, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday while drawing attention to the collusive threat posed by the two adversaries. “You are well aware of the conditions created on our northern and eastern borders. First, it was Pakistan, and now also by China, as if a border dispute is being created under a mission. We have a border of about 7,000 kilometres (km) with these countries, where tension prevails on a daily basis,” Singh said, while virtually inaugurating a raft of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) projects to provide connectivity to forward areas. The minister’s comments come at a time when tensions are simmering along the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan and the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, where Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been locked in a border row for over five months and efforts to reduce friction have made no headway. Also Read: A reminder for China: India is free | HT EditorialThe Indian armed forces are keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict. “Given the symbiotic relationship between China and Pakistan, a collusive threat to India cannot be ruled out. The question is when it is viable for them to initiate a conflict against India,” said Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retired), a former Northern Army commander. As India remains focused on scaling up its border infrastructure despite the ongoing border tensions, Singh dedicated 44 bridges in forward areas to the country, including 10 in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), eight each in Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, two in Himachal Pradesh and four in Sikkim, whose spans range between 30 and 484 metres. The bridges inaugurated by Singh included one on the strategic Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DS-DBO) road that provides connectivity to the country’s northern-most outpost, DBO. The bridge can support the movement of vehicles weighing up to 70 tonnes, including tanks. Also Read: LAC talks: India to push for restoration of status quo anteThe minister also laid the foundation stone for the Nechiphu tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh and said the border infrastructure projects were of strategic importance and would provide connectivity to remote areas of the north-eastern state. The 450-metre two-lane tunnel on the road to Tawang will ensure all-weather connectivity across Nechiphu pass besides providing a safe and secure passage through accident-prone areas, officials said. Singh said the country had not only resolutely faced the challenges posed by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the border tensions and disputes caused by Pakistan and China but it was also bringing about “historical changes” in all sectors of development. Singh said the new bridges --- spread across seven states and two union territories (UTs) --- would improve connectivity in the far-flung areas of western, northern and north-eastern sectors and fulfill the aspirations of local people. “They would also meet the transport and logistics requirements for the armed forces throughout the year,” the minister said. Congratulating the BRO for its efforts, Singh said the dedication of 44 bridges to the country at one go in itself was a record. He said that the annual budget of BRO, which varied from Rs 3,300 crore to Rs 4,600 crore between 2008 and 2016, is at Rs 11,000 crore, with no cuts, despite the prevailing pandemic. He said the government has sanctioned high-altitude clothing to BRO engineers and workers. BRO chief Lieutenant-General Harpal Singh said that besides expediting road construction, the organisation has laid an emphasis on construction of bridges by completing 28 major bridges in 2019. Another 102 major bridges would be completed this year, he added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-china-creating-border-dispute-under-a-mission-rajnath-singh/story-3RM6ZlUep0mppLKEeDakdP.html

Comedy is certainly a tough job but if it works and an actor strikes that instant connect with the audience then it’s a win-win situation for both,” said the ‘Sanskar: Dharohar Apno Ki’ actor. Hailing from Dibrugarh (Assam), Shamin always had acting on her career list. “Becoming an actor was always on my mind. Even during my second-year of engineering in Bangalore, I wanted to give acting a chance! I missed those college plays and being on stage. Soon I relocated to Mumbai and did an acting crash course to start looking for projects. Then shows like ‘Yeh Hai Aashiqui’, ‘Pyaar Tune Kya’, ‘Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki’ and more gave me a foothold in the industry. Thankfully, all shows gave me a chance to play lead or pivotal characters.” Talking about her film debut during a webinar, Shamin said, “I did romantic comedy ‘Love Shagun’ in 2016 and enjoyed being on 70mm. It was then I had an urge to do more films but understood that it was time to unlearn and start afresh. So, I took a break and started doing theatre under well-known actor Neeraj Kabi. That really helped me to sharpen my skills and learn the nuances of acting.” Currently, Shamin is busy playing a pivotal part in a light comedy series ‘Ram Pyare Sirf Hamare.’ “It’s a fun role and it gave me enough scope to play an emotional character with a splash of comedy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/being-a-drama-queen-comes-naturally-to-me/story-YPtAo4Ga492RrMdgqVXqiN.html

The 450m-long tunnel, which will bypass the existing road, will be D-shaped and comprise two lanes of 3.5m width each. Another 1.8 km-long tunnel is also being constructed on the BCT road and both will reduce distance to the area bordering China by 10km. Singh also inaugurated eight bridges built by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in Arunachal Pradesh. Thirty-six other bridges built by BRO in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Sikkim and Jammu & Kashmir were also inaugurated by the defence minister.

12-10-2020||India||In Tripura’s revised Durga puja guidelines, Covid-19 tests mandatory for organizers, priests||The Tripura government revised guidelines for Durga Puja celebration on Sunday to include mandatory Covid-19 tests of the puja organizers, priests and volunteers in order to contain spread of the pandemic.More than a month ago on September 4, the state government issued first Durga puja guidelines which directed the puja organizers to collect subscriptions online, reducing number of puja pandals through mutual consultation, avoiding narrow entrance and exit systems in the pandals, allowing 5-10 people to visit the idols at a time and others. According to the revised guidelines, all the priests along with puja organizers and volunteers will need to undergo Covid-19 tests before Panchami which falls on October 21. Besides, there might be Covid-19 testing teams at the vicinity of some puja pandals to conduct random tests on the devotees visiting the pandals during the puja.In order to avoid crowds in the pandals, the government ordered that the pandals should be kept open from all sides. If the roof of the pandal is required to be sealed, then all other sides of the pandal need to be kept open and vice versa. The government prohibited any kind of fair in front of the puja pandals barring few stalls could be set up at some distance from the puja pandal to avoid crowds.The priests have been asked to direct the pushpanjali ritual during puja through microphones and the devotees need to bring flowers from their homes and 10-15 devotees could take part in the pushpanjali at a time.On Dussehra, the puja clubs would organize ‘sindoor khela’ where 10-15 women could take part at a time in different intervals. Sindoor Khela is a traditional ritual where married women bid adieu to Goddess Durga by applying vermillion on her face.The puja organizers were also asked to bring idols to the pandals without any procession.The puja organizers need to identify a place, almost two meters distance from the entry point of the pandal for the visitors and they should engage volunteers to see that the people visiting the pandals are maintaining Covid-19 norms including social distancing, wearing masks etc. The revised guidelines also mandated the puja organizers to install CCTVs in their pandals to monitor the crowds and later handed over these footage to the police.Pregnant women, senior citizens and children below 10 years old have been advised to stay home during the puja. Though there would be no public Durga puja celebration in the containment zones, the people residing within the zones can celebrate in their respective homes.Tripura has so far recorded a total of 28,352 Covid-19 cases of whom 313 have died. Two others died by suicide.Dipak Majumder, secretary of Sanghati Club said, “We will organize the puja maintaining the guidelines of the state government. We have decided to curtail our budget almost by 50 per cent compared to the last year. Besides organizing puja, our main aim is to avoid crowds to contain the spread of the disease. We appeal to the devotees to follow the similar guidelines.”Sarmistha Das, a housewife, said, “It seems there will be less crowd for pushpanjali this year as many mothers cannot take part in the ritual by leaving their children alone at home. And also, safety is more important than visiting puja pandals this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tripura-s-revised-durga-puja-guidelines-covid-19-tests-mandatory-for-organizers-priests/story-1MUvPeCUgRU94THatxiIwI.html
12-10-2020||India||Farm bills: Farmers set preconditions after government outreach for talks||The Union government has invited at least 31 farmers’ organisations and their leaders from Punjab for talks in the national capital on October 14, the second attempt in a month to reach out to farmers protesting a set of laws enacted by Parliament to liberalise agricultural markets. The government has proposed talks by a team, led by agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal, who signed off on the letter of invitation to the farm leaders on October 10. The top bureaucrat had written to farmers’ organisations in Punjab earlier on October 8 for a meeting, which had been rejected. Farmers’ groups said they did not participate in the meeting because in its October 8 letter, the government had said that “farmers had misunderstood the laws”. “Farmers very well understand the laws and the intention behind them, which is why we rejected the meeting,” said Avik Saha, the coordinator of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), an umbrella platform of protesting farmers’ groups in Punjab and Haryana. Saha said farm organisations then received a redrafted, two-line letter from the agriculture secretary on October 10. Also Read: Farm bills 2020: CM Kejriwal joins AAP protest at Jantar Mantar“In Punjab, farmers have been agitating over issues related to agriculture over several days. The government of India has always been serious about agriculture and farmers. This is why the government is interested in holding talks with you,” the letter from the farm secretary, which HT has reviewed, states. The AIKSCC, the farmers’ platform coordinating the protests, said it would not participate in talks unless key demands are met. “We are preparing our charter of demands which we will release soon,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal faction). Saha said “there can be no talks on the merit of these laws”. He said the pre-conditions farmers will set are (a) repeal of the laws, (b) legal backing for MSPs and (c) any talks will have to be with a committee authorised by the Cabinet. Farmers have blocked roads and railway tracks since September 24 in a protest against legislations they fear could pave the way for the government to stop buying cereals at guaranteed prices (minimum support prices or MSP), leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private players. Also Read: ‘Save India’s farmers from such black laws’: Cong-ruled states to intensify farm law stirPrime Minister Narendra Modi, defending the laws, has called the new measures “historic”. He has publicly said that while the laws give farmers options to sell their produce to private buyers, the government would continue to purchase staples such as rice and wheat at MSPs. The laws seek to end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees or APMCs by opening the sector to private competition. These assurances have done little to satisfy millions of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and western parts of Uttar Pradesh. Big farmer groups, who usually produce substantial surpluses, fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. The reforms are a crucial test for the Narendra Modi government’s ability to push through structural reforms in the country’s antiquated agriculture sector, which supports nearly half of all Indians, while mollifying especially large farmers in the food bowl states, who are an influential voting bloc. At the talks, the agriculture ministry team comprising senior officials as well as government economists intend to clarify the government’s intention and make presentation on the economic benefits of opening up agriculture trade, an official said requesting anonymity. Influential farm leaders from Punjab invited to the talks include Balbir Singh Rajewal, head of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), Ruldu Singh Mansa, president of Punjab Kisan Union, Major Singh Punnawal of the Kulhind Kisan Sabha, Indrajit Singh Kot Buddha of Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Harjinder Singh Tanda of the Azad Kisan Singarh Committee, Gurbaksh Singh Barnala of the Jai Kisan Andolan, Satnam Singh Pannu of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, Joginder Singh Ugraha of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugraha) and Surjit Singh Phool of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Krantikari), among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-farmers-set-preconditions-after-government-outreach-for-talks/story-dWV2FMhnYCFaAQ9T170jKL.html

Many passengers deboarded and walked on tracks to reach the nearest station or road. Railway officials said this was a rare occurrence in the recent past when the suburban services on both the Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) routes came to a halt due to power grid failure. In September, both the CR and WR services, which are currently being run only for essential services staff amid the Covid-19 outbreak, were suspended due to water-logging on tracks after heavy rains.Also read | Mumbai power outage: Work from home shudders to a haltThe Central Railway’s services on the harbour line, which connects the city to neighbouring Navi Mumbai, resumed first at 10.55am, CR said in a release.

The 44 are among the 102 bridges that are being built by the BRO. These bridges are designed to withstand movement of India’s heaviest battle tanks.An official said 30 of the 44 bridges commissioned on Monday fall on the route to the Line of Actual Control from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.These are class 70 bridges; technicalese for bridges that can bear the weight of 70 tonne vehicles. Also Watch | ‘First Pakistan & now China’: Rajnath Singh speaks on border disputesIndia’s heaviest battle tank Arjun is about 60 tonnes.

Lt Gen Singh said the fresh round of 44 bridges are located in Jammu and Kashmir (10), Ladakh (8), Himachal Pradesh (2), Punjab (4), Uttarakhand (8), Arunachal Pradesh (8) and Sikkim (4).“These bridges of various spans, constructed by BRO, range from 30 metres to 484 metres are of strategic importance and have been designed to facilitate movement of heavy civil and military traffic in border areas,” he said, underscoring that some of these bridges were in locations that made building a 30-metre long bridge far more difficult than to make even a 1,000-metre long bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-s-bro-building-100-bridges-by-march-most-of-them-near-china-border/story-56XIHQA8yE05IHLDEptZqM.html

She had been in political hibernation after losing the parliamentary elections from Nizamabad in May 2019.Kavitha is now being tipped to be inducted into the cabinet of her father.“There is every possibility that she will become a minister in the KCR cabinet. We all wish to see her as a minister soon,” senior TRS leader and lawmaker from Bodhan Mohd Shakeel said.The former MP swept the bypolls to the MLC seat from Nizamabad local authorities constituency with a margin of 672 votes by securing over 88 percent votes polled. The polling was held on December 9 and the counting took place on Monday.Out of 823 votes polled in the constituency, Kavitha got 728 votes.

12-10-2020||India||Supreme Court dismisses petition seeking ban on Halal slaughter||Supreme Court on Monday rejected a plea seeking ban on Halal form of slaughtering of animals which is adhered to by the Muslim community. A bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul questioned the intention of the petitioner and also said that court cannot interfere with the food habits of people.“Court cannot determine who can be a vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Those who want to eat Halal meat can eat Halal meat. Those who want to eat Jhatka meat can eat Jhatka meat,” the bench which also comprised justice Dinesh Maheshwari said. The court was hearing a petition filed by an organisation, Akhand Bharat Morcha, challenging Section 28 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.The said section provides that killing of animal in a manner required by the religion of any community will not be an offence under the act. Various forms of killing of animals, like Halal in which jugular vein of the animal is severed leading to blood of animal draining out leading to death of animal and Jhatka where animal is killed instantaneously by a single strike of sword to sever the head, are protected by Section 28. While Halal is practiced by Muslims, Jhatka meat is consumed by Hindus. The petitioner argued that killing of animals by Halal method is extremely painful for the animal and such exemptions under Section 28 in a secular country should not be allowed.“Halal is extremely painful. Inhuman slaughter of animals in the name of Halal should not be permitted,” it was submitted. It was also pointed out that Jhatka does not cause suffering for animals since it dies instantaneously in such method of slaughter while in Halal, the animal dies a painful death. The bench, however, declined to entertain the plea. “Your petition is mischievous in character,” the top court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-petition-seeking-ban-on-halal-slaughter/story-5QfegKlWlZlHQfPF3nIToL.html

According to his family members, Krishna collapsed while having a cup of tea. He was rushed to a local hospital at Toopran, where doctors declared him dead on arrival. “He was feeling depressed for the last couple of weeks after coming to know that Trump and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But he was healthy and had no prior medical complications,” his cousin Vivek told reporters. Krishna, hit the headlines for the first time in 2018 by installing a photograph of Trump in his puja room and worshipping it every day along with other Hindu gods at his house in Konne village of Bachannapet block in Jangaon district. Last year, he had built a six-foot statue of Trump in front of his house and had been conducting regular pujas and bathed it with milk. He pasted posters and stickers of the US President all over his house and had written graffiti praising Trump on the walls. He used to wear T-shirts with Trump’s name on it. For his craze for the US president, he had earned the nickname as Trump Krishna in his village. It was only last week Krishna had released a one-minute video in which he was seen crying for Trump and praying for his speedy recovery from illness. Earlier, Krishna said he strongly wished that Trump returned to power in the presidential election. A school dropout, Krishna had been taking care of agriculture in his two-acre land in the village, while his parents had moved to Toopran a couple of years ago. His wife died last year while delivering a baby boy. Krishna started worshipping the US president after Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a software engineer from the state, was killed by a US navy veteran in an alleged act of hate crime in February 2017. “I was very much pained at the incident. I thought the only way the US president and his people could understand the greatness of Indians is to display our love and affection towards them. That is why I started worshipping Trump with a hope that the prayers would reach him one day,” Krishna had then said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-man-who-built-donald-trump-s-statue-and-worshipped-him-dies-of-heart-attack/story-PRqiSQ9bqbk6RdFkqgjNyN.html

Sitharaman introduced a proposal related to boost consumer spending. The plan is divided in two components: Leave Travel Concession (LTC) voucher and special festival advance scheme.The LTC allows central government employees to travel in a block of four years - one to anywhere in India and one hometown or two hometown. The air or rail fare, as per pay scale, is be reimbursed and in addition the employees will get a leave encashment of 10 days (pay+DA) is paid. Sitharaman said the new part of this scheme is that the employees can now encash their LTCs in the form of vouchers.“Since the employees are not able to travel anywhere due to Covid-19, they can spend the money in buying something of their choice. But the money has to be spent on items which attract 12% or more GST,” said the finance minister. “The spend should only be done through digital mode. And GST invoice will be required, so that the amount spent can be reimbursed to the employees,” she added.Sitharaman said that the scheme is valid till March 31, 2021. She said that the government will incur Rs 5,675 crore on this.

Sitharaman’s address comes hours before the third round of Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting over the issue of compensating states for the Rs2.35 lakh crore shortfall in their share of revenue from the indirect tax this fiscal year. On October 5, the council had deferred a decision on the issue after 10 states ruled by non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA) parties insisted that the central government borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore and compensate the states.The states were also given the option of borrowing the entire Rs2.35 lakh crore (including the shortfall caused by the Covid-19 pandemic) at a significant cost. Apart from the 10 dissenting states, 21 state governments have opted to borrow Rs1.10 lakh crore. Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal are among the states that have demurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-addresses-media-on-economic-issues/story-hSluh5NucJJYTDfiCHS7KK.html

India’s emphasis on fast-tracking development and deployment of the new-age stand-off weapons is a response to China’s mobilisation of troops and support elements in the East Ladakh sector.People familiar with the matter said the DRDO would conduct another trial in a few months that would pave the way for the missile’s full-fledged induction into Indian military and deployment on the borders.A limited number of Nirbhay missiles had been moved earlier to the border with China before Monday’s eighth round of test firing.Nirbhay is a subsonic missile, flying at a speed of 0.7 Mach, with sea-skimming and terrain-hugging capability that helps the missile stay under enemy radar to avoid detection. The missile has a loitering capability that allows the delivery platform to manoeuvre mid-flight and at the end to hit the target. The missile’s launch is powered by a solid rocket booster developed by DRDO’s Advanced Systems Laboratory, which unlike liquid propellant, are easier to handle.The conventional warhead missiles, capable of deep penetration to strike high-value targets with precision, are launched from mobile platforms.Mondy’s tests were conducted as part of an effort by the DRDO to expedite development of missiles along the LAC amid the stand-off with China’s People’s Liberation Army at multiple points in East Ladakh.Officials said scientists needed to analyse the data generated during the tests to figure the tweaks that may be needed to be carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-fires-nirbhay-cruise-missile-into-sea-hits-abort-after-8-minutes/story-pwMlu7YRVvgiHuhA0P2rfI.html

We do not work for ourselves. We do not put culture, the tradition of the country at stake. It is the difference between Sadhus and Shaitaan,” he said.“Congress can be equated with Satan. They have the ideology of the devil. Congress is promoting hypocrisy, casteism and class struggle for power. We believe in clean politics. We do not do casteist politics. BJP is a party of Sadhus,” he added.Commenting upon the Congress party candidate Premchand Guddu who is contesting for Sanwer constituency in the by-election, the BJP leader said, “Whosoever wants to leave the party give their arguments.”Guddu switched to BJP ahead of the 2018 Assembly polls. However, he later returned to the Congress fold.Former Lok Sabha Speaker and BJP leader Sumitra Mahajan said that people should refrain from using such words.“I have not used such words. If I have ever uttered such words, I apologise immediately. A Sadhu is hidden in everyone’s mind and Shaitaan inside us sometimes comes out... it should not happen...I do not give importance to such words,” Mahajan said while addressing a press conference here after inaugurating BJP’s war room in a hotel at Indore on Sunday.The war room has been created for the seven seats of the Indore-Ujjain division which will go into by-polls. Leaders of BJP will be in touch with the party through this war and will issue guidelines. The activities and strategy for the polls will be devised here.“The way of fighting elections has changed over the years. We have to keep track of opponents’ activities and we have to ensure that our message that reached voters. This war room is dedicated to helping our workers to advise them on how to strategise. The by-elections on 28 seats are important. We are a party which works for the people. We have the opportunity. I will campaign for the party if needed,” she said.Voting for 28 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh by-polls will take place on November 3 and the results are scheduled to be declared on November 10.Indore’s Sanwer seat will also go for polling.In March this year, 22 Congress MLAs resigned from the State Assembly, paving way for BJP’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan to take over as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister for the fourth time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-mp-by-poll-bjp-leader-terms-congress-party-of-shaitaan/story-Nyfg8MFr4NRLttv6eSJYqK.html
12-10-2020||India||One in every 130 females globally is living in modern slavery: UN report||Even as it remains true that modern slavery has an effect on everyone, females across the world account for about 71% of all victims, according to a report by the United Nations. Pointing towards the modern slavery being largely a gender issue, the report titled ‘Stacked Odds’ states that modern slavery is enabled by power imbalances and for women and girls, this imbalance is exacerbated by gender inequality and discrimination. According to the report, one in every 130 females globally is living in modern slavery. Females account for a staggering 99% of all victims of forced sexual exploitation, 84% of all victims of forced marriage, and 58% of all victims of forced labour, it added. The report highlighted that in most countries girl children continue to have relatively less access to school and medical care, which in turn makes women more vulnerable to end up in poverty. “...women are more likely to end up in poverty, to work in the riskiest sectors of the informal economy – and ultimately, in modern slavery – than men,” it explained. Females outnumber males as victims of modern slavery in four of the five world regions. They account for 73% of victims in the Asia and Pacific, 71% in Africa, 67% in Europe and Central Asia, and 63 % in the Americas, the UN report states. Even in the Arab States, where estimates are significantly impeded by a lack of data on forced marriages and the forced labour of domestic workers, nearly 40% of all people living in modern slavery are women. Saying that the need to address the disproportionate risk of modern slavery among women and girls has never been more urgent, the report reinforces the need to involve survivors in decisionmaking to ensure their voices are heard and the insights of their lived experience translates into effective solutions.The reports says, “At its core, the fight against modern slavery is about ensuring people have the most basic of human rights – freedom.”It aims to urge governments, faith leaders, and the business sector to work with the international and non-government organisations to bring about the required changed to achieve the goal of equality. The report has suggested six points that it says must be included in the action plan. According to the report the plan must include criminalising all forms of modern slavery, reform in all countries where laws still enable children to be married, valuing and prioritising education for girls as a critical circuit breaker to a lifetime of vulnerability, and challenging cultural norms, such as male preference, restrictions on freedom of movement outside the home, and lack of control over finances and assets, which allow harmful and exploitative practices to continue. It must also ensure overturning laws and policies that strip women of their rights and agency or exacerbate their vulnerability to sexual violence and exploitation; for example, inheritance rights, land ownership laws, and the kafala system, and prioritising supply chain transparency to ensure workers are protected, taking specific action to understand and address the vulnerabilities experienced by women, including protection mechanisms in crisis situations. The governments must acknowledge the clear link between gender and risk of modern slavery in their gender and development programming and budgets, the report said, adding that it is only by protecting this freedom that we will achieve true gender equality, and in doing so, unlock the untapped potential of half the world’s population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-in-every-130-females-globally-is-living-in-modern-slavery-un-report/story-VAVHGWAg8EMmCszl0YZZgO.html

12-10-2020||India||Actor-turned-politician Khusbhu quits Congress; likely to join BJP||Actor-turned-politician Khushbu Sundar on Monday resigned from the Congress, which promptly removed her as a party spokesperson, amid reports suggesting that she is likely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) later in the day. “Khushbu Sundar is dropped as the AICC (All India Congress Committee) spokesperson with immediate effect,” said Pranav Jha, secretary, in-charge of communications department, AICC, in a statement. “Few elements seated at higher levels within the party, people who have no connect with ground reality or public recognition are dictating terms. People like me, who wanted to work for the party sincerely, are being pushed and suppressed,” she wrote in her resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “I have decided to end my association with the party. I tender my resignation from the primary membership of the Indian National Congress (INC),” she added. Congress leaders from Tamil Nadu had attacked her after she took a divergent stand on the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. While the Congress had strongly opposed the policy, she welcomed it. Later, she had apologised to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, but had insisted she would “rather speak the fact than be a robot or a puppet”. “My stand on NEP, 2020 differs from my party and I apologised to Rahul Gandhiji for that. But I would rather speak the fact than act like a robot or a puppet. Everything is and cannot be about agreeing to your leader, but about being courageous to voice your opinion bravely as a citizen,” she had tweeted. The tweet had led to intense speculation that she would join the BJP, but she had vehemently denied it. “Sanghis can relax, please do not rejoice. I am not moving to the BJP. My opinion might be different from my party, but I am an individual with a thinking mind of my own. Yes, #NEP2020 is flawed and flawed at some places, but I still feel we can look at the change with positivity,” she tweeted on Saturday. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) marked her initiation into politics in 2010. She had left the DMK in 2014 and joined the Congress the same year. “I came into the fold of INC at the time when it was at its lowest, being defeated in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. I did not walk into the party for any monetary gains, name or fame,” she wrote in her resignation letter. But on Saturday her tweet intensified the speculation that she is quitting the Congress. “Many see a change in me. Well as you age, you evolve and grow, learn and unlearn, perceptions change, likes and dislikes too, thoughts and ideas take a new shape, dreams are new, you understand the difference between likes and love, between right and wrong. Change is inevitable,” she tweeted. “I wish to take this opportunity to thank you, Rahul Gandhiji and everyone in the party personally. My respect towards you will remain the same,” her resignation letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-turned-politician-khusbhu-quits-congress-likely-to-join-bjp/story-VQYi43XCmso5ChEz1GuG5H.html

The Hathras case will also come up for hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday. Advocate general, Uttar Pradesh government, Raghvendra Singh, will represent the state government in the top court.

12-10-2020||India||PLA rotating troops on north Pangong Tso, signals disengagement is far off||The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China has started rotating troops on the north banks of Pangong Tso with the intent that it has no immediate plans of either disengagement of de-escalation in Ladakh. The seventh round of India-China military-diplomatic talks will take place in Chushul today with XIV Corps Commander meeting the South Xinjiang military district commander to discuss comprehensive disengagement.According to military commanders, the PLA has moved an additional brigade north of Pangong Tso for rotating troops from finger four mountainous spur to keep up the morale of the deployed force. “Given that both sides are deployed at nearly 18,000 feet on finger 4 and the weather is deteriorating, the PLA is rotating 200 troops at a time so that front-line troops are fresh and motivated. This clearly means that PLA has no plans to disengagement at least this winter,” said a senior official.The assessment of the Indian side is that comprehensive disengagement will be a long-drawn process despite the inherent risk of a flare-up as the PLA will occupy positions south of Pangong Tso the moment they are vacated by the Indian Army. While PLA has come up to its perception of the LAC on the north banks, the Indian Army troops have come up to its perception of the LAC on the south banks by pre-empting the Red army all along the Rezang La Rechin La ridgeline.Even though winter is expected to set in by end of this month and take a turn for the worse, Indian Army is prepared to stay on the heights all along the 1,597 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. Army commanders take lessons from the fact that Sumdorong Chu stand-off in Arunachal Pradesh that started in 1986 was fully resolved through comprehensive disengagement by November 1995 - after nine years of continuous deployment. While Sumdorong Chu stand-off was resolved, the army is sitting on the Saltoro Ridge since Operation Meghdoot was launched in Siachen Glacier in April, 1984 - 36 years and counting.While the PLA aggression in Galwan valley and north of Pangong Tso was pre-planned with military objectives in mind, the Chinese were not prepared for either the June 15 flare-up or the August 29-30 pre-emption. It is quite evident that PLA commanders thought that the Indian Army would accept the aggression as fait accompli and move on. However, with both sides deployed in full at the LAC in Ladakh, the chances of an accident are high and thus distance is being kept between the front-line troops.Even though the PLA Western Theatre Command is deployed all along the Ladakh LAC and in depth, the Chinese problems have been complicated by the stand-off with the US over Taiwan. The PLA is currently stretched with South and Northern Theatre Commands also deployed to pressurize Taiwan with US Navy active in South China Sea. What happens next in Taiwan largely depends on the US posture after the November Presidential election results but either way American policy towards China has taken a turn for the worse. One must remember that the incumbent president has three more months in power before he completes his term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-rotating-troops-on-north-pangong-tso-signals-disengagement-is-far-off/story-ZOYHEkj3fGMjTk27k3vsoK.html

12-10-2020||India||TMC legislator’s ‘nepotism’ comment puts party in BJP’s line of fire||The ruling Trinamool Congress in Bengal found itself in the BJP’s crosshairs on Sunday after a video clip of part of a speech by one of its legislators in north Bengal asking the party’s panchayat leaders to stay away from nepotism till the assembly polls in 2021 went viral.The crux of what Udayan Guha, the TMC lawmaker from Dinhata constituency in Cooch Behar district, could be heard saying in the short clip is that party leaders had been involved in nepotism in the past and many were still into the practice but it should stop till the elections are over. Instead of directly saying that the leaders misused power to make money or property Guha could be heard saying in Bangla, “you have eaten a lot.” Guha made the speech on Friday afternoon but the video clip surfaced 48 hours later. Guha, the son of late Kamal Guha, a veteran Forward Bloc leader and erstwhile minister in the Jyoti Basu government, won the Dinhata assembly seat for the Bloc in 2011 and joined the TMC in 2015. He won the seat again in 2016. His father had won the Dinhata seat eight times; in 1962 and 1967 and six times in a row from 1977 to 2001.“Udayan Guha’s direction to the panchayat leaders have only reaffirmed that the cut-money culture is very much prevalent in the TMC. This is an admission in public,” said BJP’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh. In political parlance, cut-money refers to bribe or commission taken from beneficiaries of welfare projects. For the TMC, which is carrying out a rectification exercise on the recommendations of election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by chief minister Mamata Banerjee after her party’s poor show in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the video caused a major embarrassment. TMC leaders did not comment on the incident but Guha told HT that sentences that can be heard in the video were being wrongly interpreted as the context was quite different. “I said a lot of things before and after those sentences but the video was edited to play mischief. I told party workers and leaders that the BJP could win seven (out of eight) Lok Sabha seats in north Bengal districts in 2019 because voters were displeased with us. People know that Lok Sabha polls do not change state governments and yet they voted for the BJP. I said this was an expression of their anger,” said Guha. “I told the party leaders to take a lesson from the 2019 verdict and refrain from nepotism. I said they should concentrate on the welfare of the people, something the chief minister is repeatedly asking us to do. Those portions of the speech were edited,” he added. The cut-money controversy raised a storm in state politics in 2019. While the BJP called it an exposure of the corruption TMC leaders were involved in, the ruling party used it as a churning process to initiate rectification in the ranks. On June 18 last year, while addressing Kolkata’s civic body leaders, Banerjee said those who took ‘cut money’ or commissions from common people must return it. She alleged that some TMC leaders don’t even spare the dead and charge Rs 200 for releasing the sum of Rs 2,000 the state government gives to poor people to cremate family members. This opened Pandora’s box. Echoing allegations made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the then BJP president Amit Shah during the Lok Sabha poll campaign, hundreds of people, ranging from landless farmers to businessmen, started publicly naming TMC leaders who took money from them. The TMC launched the ‘Didi ke Balo’ (Tell Didi or the chief minister) helpline where people could register their grievance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-legislator-s-nepotism-comment-puts-party-in-bjp-s-line-of-fire/story-HZ06ZC7Z8Za4AJL07teygL.html
12-10-2020||India||QIA in advanced talks to invest in Mumbai airport||Adani Airport Holdings Ltd is in advanced talks with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to sell a minority stake in Mumbai International Airport Ltd that it acquired last month, two people aware of the matter said. Adani Airport, a unit of Adani Enterprises Ltd, is looking to raise $750 million from the stake sale, the first of the two people said. The Qatar fund prefers to invest directly in the Mumbai airport operator, but alternatively, it may buy a stake in parent Adani Airport, the person said on condition of anonymity.Emails sent to the Adani group and Qatar Investment remained unanswered.The sovereign wealth fund of Qatar is already an investor in Adani Mumbai Electricity Ltd, a division of Adani Transmission that distributes power to 3 million customers in Mumbai. The sovereign fund invested ₹3,220 crore (approximately $452 million) in the utility for a 25.1% stake in February 2020, including equity of ₹1,210 crore and subordinated debt of ₹2,010 crore. Last month, the Adani group said it would take control of India’s second-busiest airport of Mumbai, in its biggest move yet to become a top airports operator. Adani Airport agreed to buy the debt of GVK Airport Developers Ltd, against which a 50.5% stake in MIAL was pledged. The Adani group will also buy the combined 23.5% stake held by Airport Company of South Africa (Acsa) and South Africa’s Bidvest Group in MIAL, for which it has obtained the approval of the Competition Commission of India. This would give the group a 74% stake in Mumbai airport. The remaining 26% stake remains with state-run Airports Authority of India. The deal also gives Adani Airport a controlling stake in the Navi Mumbai International Airport being developed by GVK Group. Also, with one of India’s two most profitable international airports in its kitty and having won the development and operation rights over a 50-year lease for the Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Thiruvananthapuram, and Guwahati airports, Adani will be the biggest private sector airport operator in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/qia-in-advanced-talks-to-invest-in-mumbai-airport/story-DPxtPRe7G3FSGuFXPxLLjP.html
12-10-2020||India||Startups plan to approach CCI against Google’s rules||A group of 15 startup founders held a virtual meeting with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Saturday to apprise the regulator about Google’s anti-competitive policies in India, two founders aware of the meeting said. The discussion involved Google’s recent imposition of its Play Store billing system on Indian developers, as well as the 30% commission the company charges for selling digital goods and services through the system, they said on the condition of anonymity.The founders said that phones with Google’s Android operating system (OS) are preloaded with the Play Store app distribution platform, giving it an inherent advantage over rivals. Because of its dominance in app discovery and distribution, Google forces Indian developers to build and change apps based on its OS and app store, they alleged, adding that the company’s “arbitrary policies” illustrate this behaviour.“With more than 95% of India’s digital population accessing the Internet through Google, this strategy of having an OS and Play Store, together gives Google an advantage over other app stores and operating systems. Hence, we have requested them to look into this matter,” said one of the founders present at the meeting.The founders are now planning to send a written communication to both the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) as well as the CCI, this week after collating views from the industry. The startup ecosystem will send a single letter to both the government and CCI, the founder said.Last week, Mint reported that 120 Indian startup founders were looking to form an independent non-profit lobby to take on Google in India. In an interview on Friday, Murugavel Janakiraman, founder of Matrimony.com, said the companies are looking at “all possibilities”, including approaching the CCI and the government. He could not be reached for comment after the Saturday meeting.An email sent to Google did not elicit a response.If the startups file a case against Google with the CCI, it will be the fifth such case Google faces in India. Two independent lawyers filed an antitrust case against Google last week for abusing its dominance in AndroidTV, while the regulator is also looking into two other antitrust suits against the company. In 2018, it had fined Google ₹136 crore for abusing its dominance in search.Google has faced a strong backlash from Indian startups over the past two weeks after it issued a clarification for the already existing Play Billing policy in India. While the company hasn’t rolled back the 30% commission it charges for sales through the Play Store, it has given Indian startups six more months than global to comply with this policy. Additionally, Google has also been arranging meetings with developers and startup founders to listen to their concerns and has said that it will do policy workshops with companies as well.Some startups are already looking at alternative listing for their apps through Android Application Package (APK) downloads on their websites. There are instances such as fantasy sports platform Dream11 getting 100 million users without listing on Google Play Store.The central government, which has been in listening mode so far, had asked startups last week to send a letter apprising it of the challenges. The founders plan to send this application by this week. A view will be firmed up after deliberations at various levels, a government official had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/startups-plan-to-approach-cci-against-google-s-rules/story-FgzkmW9pP0K7RwxUJpRI8M.html
12-10-2020||India||Domestic workers face Covid test, interviews as they return to work||Sampati Bala was a bundle of nerves when she recently appeared for a Zoom interview before her prospective employers in Gurugram. She was looking to work as a live-in nanny; most questions she faced were about her medical history: did she or anyone in her family have fever recently? Did she live in a containment zone? Will she be okay with a coronavirus test? Will she be able to work without leaves for a few months? Eventually, she did undergo a coronavirus test through the domestic help placement company, which organised the interview. Though she tested negative, the outcome of the interview was not positive. “I do not know why I did not land the job. Maybe I failed to convince them about my abilities as a nanny, or maybe despite the negative test they were afraid of hiring me,” says Bala. “It has never been so difficult to find a job as a maid or a nanny.” Vinod Yadav, founder and CEO, Hire Help in India, who organised the interview, says that very few interviews are being translated into jobs. “I had to start Zoom interviews as prospective employers do not want to meet household help in person. First, they want an interview over the phone, and if satisfied they ask for a Zoom interview. And more often than not, most maids do not make the cut. It is more about the employers’s fear of Covid-19 than anything else,” says Yadav. “Out of the 100 zoom interviews I organised in the past few months, only 20 got hired. Ironically, while those wanting to hire a maid asked me to get the maid tested for coronavirus disease, which I do, but they do not want to undergo the test themselves as if only the maid is susceptible to the virus, and they are not, ” says Yadav, who started the company in 2012. Even five months after the easing of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions began, thousands of domestic workers — maids, cooks, nannies — have not been able to return to work since employers continue to see them as potential carriers of the coronavirus. Most companies and agencies that provide domestic help services say that hiring of domestic workers----their number in the country vary from official estimates of 4.2 million to unofficial estimates of more than 50 million--- has dropped by as much as 70 per cent. Mamuni Haldar , who lives in Savda Ghevra, a resettlement colony in northwest Delhi, used to work in Laxmi Nagar, almost 42 km away in east Delhi. She lost her job in March as the lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus began but is yet to be called back to work. “I had been working in three houses for the past 12 years. They had said they would hire me back after the lockdown, but this has not happened. One of my employers says she cannot afford to pay me as she lost her job,” says Halder, who used to travel by a DTC bus at 7.30 in the morning and reached her employers’s homes by 9.30am. The return journey, she says, often took around three hours because of the traffic rush-hour. Not far away from her lives Nisha Halder, 55, who, like dozens of women in Savda Ghevra lost her job as maid which fetched her Rs 6,500 a month. She has given up all hopes of getting it back. “At this age, it is next to impossible to find any work,” she says. Savda Ghevra, which has a population of about 50,000, has over the years, come to acquire the sobriquet of a ‘planned slum’. The reason why a lot of women used to undertake such a long journey to Laxmi Nagar, is that many of the residents were resettled here from places such as Laxmi Nagar, Lodhi Colony, Pragati Maidan before the 2010 Commonwealth Games. And these women could not find work nearby. Sunil Kumar, who runs Prema Manpower Service in Tughlaqabad village, says even those who are lucky enough to get a placement are getting unfair deals in terms of salary. “ A maid who earned Rs 16,000 before the pandemic is now getting only Rs 10,000 a month. The placements at my agency are down from 55 a month to about five a month. So far, I have got about 40 domestic helps tested for Covid-19, of which only one tested positive,” says Sunil Yadav, who has clients in many posh south Delhi colonies such as South Extension, Green Park and Vasant Kunj. Having failed to get back their jobs they lost during the lockdown, many domestic workers are now trying to change their line of work. While Sudha Rani, 45, who lives in Tigri village in Noida, has turned to selling vegetables; many of her neighbours, who used to work in an apartment building in Noida, are trying to find work in garment units in Noida and Sahibabad. “My employer in a housing society in Noida did not take my call, so once I tried visiting her, but the guard at the gate called her on the phone and conveyed to me that she did not need me as of now. What really hurt was the fact that I worked for her for five years, but she preferred to convey her decision through the guard,” she says. “Feeling humiliated, I decided never to work as help.” Rajiv Pandey, founder, Helpers Near Me — an online platform that enables the domestic workers to find work locally — says that the fear of the disease exists on both sides, “But the problem is concerns of the domestic workers have been overlooked.” Many non-government organisations working with domestic workers have long been demanding bringing domestic workers under the ambit of labour laws and employment regulations, and treating them as unorganised workers with all attendant benefits. Smita Khanijow, who heads Informal Work and Women Workers programme at Action Aid India, a non- government organisation, says that almost 70% of the domestic workers remain unemployed today and need immediate help. “The government should register them, provide them immediate cash and ration support at least till the time the pandemic is over,” she says. What is making matters worse, she adds, are the continuing restrictions by RWAs on domestic workers. “A lot of them still impose entry time instructions and allow them to work in one house only.” But RWAs denies the charge. “I think there is still a lot of fear of the disease in many households, and some individuals are not comfortable employing their helps at the moment. Our only advisory to RWAs right now is to ensure safety protocols while engaging domestic workers such as maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, regularly sanitising hands, ” says Atul Goyal, President, URJA (United Residents Joint Action), a collective of RWAs in Delhi. Meanwhile, it is Friday afternoon and Vinod Yadav is busy setting up another Zoom interview for a domestic worker. “Now, I have also started providing them a crash course in expressing themselves better during Zoom interview to increase their chance of success. But people need to understand that domestic workers are only as much carriers of the Covid-19 as anyone else. Not more, not less.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-workers-face-covid-test-interviews-as-they-return-to-work/story-nR5pD2kLDol8NBoIiIEZkO.html

It is a wrong decision. It will malign the image of our party,” Tara Yadav had said.As the nomination for the bypolls in seven Assembly seats of Uttar Pradesh began on Friday, the Congress declared the name of five candidates including Mukund Bhaskar Mani Tripathi, who is contesting from the Deoria Assembly seat. The voting will take place on November 3 and the counting of votes on November 10.In a video posted by news agency ANI, Congress workers are seen attacking the woman leader. “I was thrashed by party workers when I questioned party’s decision to give a ticket to a rapist, Mukund Bhaskar, for upcoming bypolls. Now, I’m waiting for ( Congress leader) Priyanka Gandhi ji to take action,” she said.Meanwhile, the National Commission for Women (NCW) took cognisance of the assault on the leader and asked authorities to arrest all culprits immediately.

12-10-2020||India||Nadda hails PM, Nitish in Gaya||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put up a united show in its first major election rally in Bihar on Sunday with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Nitish Kumar for changing the state’s political culture and propelling development. Speaking at the Gandhi Maidan in Gaya on the birth anniversary of socialist icon Jay Prakash Narayan, Nadda attacked the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress but did not take the name of estranged ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) once. “Leadership of India is secure in the hands of PM Modi and what is needed is to bring Nitish Kumar back to carry forward development work,” he said, coining a new slogan: “Modi hai toh mumkeen hai, Nitish hai toh pradesh aage badhega.” Nadda attacked former CM Lalu Prasad and his alliance with the Congress. “The leader who became a politician and CM with the blessings of Jayaprakash Narayan— the man who formed Janata Party by sidelining the Congress – is now hugging the very party,” he said.Nadda was sharing the stage with BJP and Janata Dal (United) leaders, along with former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi. Social distancing norms were enforced at the rally with attendees being made to sit apart and undergo thermal screening and spraying of sanitisers at entry points. This was the first big physical rally addressed by a top leader in the run up to the three-phase state polls that begin on October 28. The BJP released a list of 46 candidates for the second phase of the polls on November 3. Sitting minister Nand Kishore Yadav and Nitish Mishra, son of former chief minister Jagannath Mishra, were among the prominent names. The BJP is contesting on 110 seats in the 243-member asse mbly. The party has given 11 seats from its quota to the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). The JD(U) will contest on 115 seats, leaving its remaining share of seven seats for the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM). The results of the elections – where the NDA is facing the RJD-Congress-Left grand alliance, and a smaller third front—will be declared in November 10.In his speech, Nadda hailed Modi and Kumar. “Nitish ji, along with (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi ji, has changed the political culture and narratives of Bihar. Earlier, the Congress used to do politics on caste. Now Narendra Modi has started a culture of going to people with a report card of the government’s work,” he said. Nadda also hailed Bihar’s CM for his Covid-19 control strategy.Reminding people of ₹1.2 lakh crore package announced by PM Modi during the 2015 assembly polls, Nadda said ₹394 crore was already spent for farmers’ welfare, ₹10,000 crore for education and ₹1,550 crore for skill development.Congress MLC Premchandra Mishra said that instead of attacking other parties, the BJP leaders should explain to the public how they came to power in Bihar and what they do in three years of their rule with the JD(U). “People would like to know what they did during the Covid,-19 pandemic for migrants, and how many industries did they establish in Bihar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-hails-pm-nitish-in-gaya/story-nTW5IeFVaIDGPW5gFx26eL.html
12-10-2020||India||SVAMITVA scheme an effective step towards economic empowerment in rural India: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that the SVAMITVA scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday is an effective step in the direction of economic empowerment in rural India.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done historical work by launching the distribution of property cards under SVAMITVA scheme on Sunday to more than six lakh villages over a period of next four years. This scheme is an effective step in the direction of economic empowerment in rural India,” Rajnath Singh said in a tweet, roughly translated from Hindi.Modi on Sunday launched the physical distribution of property cards under the ‘Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas’ (SVAMITVA) scheme through video conferencing.The launch will enable around one lakh property holders to download their property cards through the SMS link delivered on their mobile phones, according to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).Along with Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Prime Minister is interacting with some of the beneficiaries during the event.SVAMITVA is a Central Sector Scheme of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, which was launched by the Prime Minister on National Panchayati Raj Day, April 24, 2020.The beneficiaries of the scheme are from 763 villages across six states including 346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 44 from Madhya Pradesh, 50 from Uttarakhand and two from Karnataka.“Beneficiaries from all these states except Maharashtra will receive the physical copies of the Property Cards within one day - Maharashtra has a system of recovering the nominal cost of Property Card, so it will take a month’s time,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.The move will pave the way for using the property as a financial asset by villagers for taking loans and other financial benefits.The scheme aims to provide the ‘record of rights’ to village household owners in rural areas and issue Property Cards.The scheme is being implemented across the country in a phased manner over a period of four years (2020-2024) and would eventually cover around 6.62 lakh villages of the country.According to the PMO release, about 1 lakh villages in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Karnataka and few border villages of Punjab and Rajasthan, along with the establishment of Continuous Operating System (CORS) stations’ network across Punjab and Rajasthan, are being covered in the Pilot phase (2020-21).“All these six states have signed MoU with Survey of India for drone survey of rural areas and implementation of the scheme. These states have finalised the digital property card format and the villages to be covered for drone-based survey. States of Punjab and Rajasthan have signed MoU with Survey of India for establishment of CORS network to assist in future drone flying activities,” read the release.“Different states have different nomenclature for the Property Cards viz. ‘Title deed’ in Haryana, ‘Rural Property Ownership Records (RPOR)’ in Karnataka, ‘Adhikar Abhilekh’ in Madhya Pradesh, ‘Sannad’ in Maharashtra, ‘Svamitva Abhilekh’ in Uttarakhand, ‘Gharauni’ in Uttar Pradesh,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/svamitva-scheme-an-effective-step-towards-economic-empowerment-in-rural-india-rajnath-singh/story-TpC9z4AzKunZochzIs3J2O.html

Yadav heard this and rushed for help. Both of them caught the snatcher and started beating him. Meanwhile, another man came from behind and attacked Aman and Yadav with a knife. Aman was stabbed in his back and Yadav who tried to save him was also attacked,” Bhatia said.As both men collapsed, the snatchers fled the spot with the mobile phone. Yadav then took Aman to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said all local vendors, parking attendants, rickshaw pullers and locals were questioned during the investigation. “Our teams raided the area on Saturday. While Salman and the other main accused Shoyeb were on the run, two of their associates — Fardeen and Rahat, who were also accompanying them on the night of incident and had helped the duo flee the spot, were arrested. The knife used in the murder and the scooter on which they had fled the spot were recovered from them,” Bhatia said.The DCP said that during interrogations, Fardeen and Rahat disclosed that on October 5 all four were searching for a target to rob.

12-10-2020||India||Nine BJP MLAs in Capital to complain against Tripura CM||Barely halfway into its term in power, differences in the Tripura unit of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have reached Delhi, with some party legislators camping in the national capital to meet the central leadership and complain against chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb’s performance.A delegation of nine legislators, including Sudip Roy Barman, Asish Saha, Sushanta Choudhury, Ramprasad Pal and Diba Chandra Hrankhawl are currently in New Delhi.Choudhury said that the delegation is hopeful of meeting BJP national president JP Nadda and other organizational leaders to discuss the current situation in Tripura; the legislators also plan to seek an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah.“Neither the government nor the party is moving in the right format, as it should be. All the pre-poll promises, mentioned in the party’s Vision Document, are made to be fulfilled. These should be reflected in action, but we are far away from reality. We want to highlight to the top leaders about all that is happening in the state,” said Choudhury. He didn’t mention specifics.Choudhury didn’t say whether the lawmakers want Deb to be removed from the chief minister’s post.“We will highlight the developments in Tripura. The rest will be decided by the top leaders if they want to intervene in this issue,” he said. He said the chief minister should be friendlier with party legislators.“Our fight is not against BJP ideology. We have full faith in the dynamic leadership of the Prime Minister and the home minister,” said Choudhury.Choudhury was elected a member of the Tripura assembly for the first time as a BJP candidate in 2018. He and Roy Barman were among the Congress leaders who joined the party in 2017. After the BJP and the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) came to power in the state, Roy Barman was entrusted with the health portfolio. But he was removed from his ministerial position in June last year. The health portfolio is currently with the CM. In August, Roy Barman was booked and a first information report lodged against him for paying an unauthorized visit to a Covid-19 care centre in Agartala although he entered the facility wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). BJP’s Tripura president Dr Manik Saha could not be reached over the phone and party spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharjee declined to comment on the issue.Communist Party of India (Marxist) veteran leader Bijan Dhar said: “This is BJP’s internal matter. We will not comment on this issue.” Congress’ Tripura vice president Tapas Dey said, “This is BJP’s internal matter. But the fact is that the state didn’t see any implementation of BJP’s pre-poll promises in the past two years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-bjp-mlas-in-capital-to-complain-against-tripura-cm/story-HF18whbwXLiekL9X6HOUPL.html
12-10-2020||India||Delhiwale: The museum of tea kettles||So many tea kettles in such a tiny shack. One is stuck between a mug and a jar. Another one perched by the gas range. And then there is this tea kettle hanging in the far corner, that looks like it hasn’t been touched for ages, trapped in the silken cobweb that has formed about it. This is a most fragile sight.The place, indeed, is like a museum of chai kettles.Simply called Chai ki Dukaan, Muhammed Waseem’s tea shack in Old Delhi’s Mohalla Qabristan neighbourhood exists like an unconscious work of art. Usually, tea stalls look ordinary in the first impression, revealing their beauty gradually on a more attentive examination. But this place snatches all the attention at first glance, and the more time you spend gazing upon it, the more bewitching it gets.The stall is located in a narrow alley. One of its two doors is made of disjointed wooden bars, and is painted with a shade of light-green so delicate that you fear the sun’s first touch might be too much for it to survive. This morning, a curtain-like plastic canvas is hanging from it, which is of a green shade too. It is covered with dust, and somehow these folds and shabbiness give a texture of agedness to the establishment, which was founded about 20 years ago. The customers often sit on the upholstered bench planked outside on the lane. Its leather cover is torn, revealing the foam underneath. The bench’s overused status evokes all the unseen patrons who must have sat upon it over the course of years. Mr Waseem likes to sit on the bench too, during his idle moments, quietly watching the street bustle. Though visitors are not expected to step inside, as there is only enough room for the owner to make tea, you ought to ask permission to enter. Not only you’ll see all the tea kettles, including the one with the cobweb, but there’s also a wiry basket to keep eggs, and a large wall clock, its hands frozen at 2.43. The daylight shoots in through a narrow opening, which turns the whole setting into one of those renaissance-era, lightly-glowing paintings.The shop opens daily from 7am to 10pm, and the chai is delicious. But that’s beside the point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-museum-of-tea-kettles/story-TZkcA0SOfNWoMlE01Ql3vM.html
12-10-2020||India||Monsoon withdrawal delayed till October 20: IMD||New Delhi: The withdrawal of the monsoon this year is likely to be considerably delayed because of the development of consecutive weather systems that will bring widespread and heavy rain to parts of peninsular and western India. This could also have an adverse impact on the harvest of crops in parts of the country, experts said.The normal date for the complete withdrawal of the monsoon from the northern parts of the country is October 15, but this time withdrawal will resume again from parts of northwest India after October 20. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the withdrawal line of the monsoon continues to pass along Faizabad, Fatehpur, Nowgong, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Vallabh, Vidyanagar and Porbandar. The winds continue to be predominantly south-westerly, indicating the monsoon is active.A depression over west-central Bay of Bengal has moved west-northwestwards with a speed of 12 kmph during the past six hours and was centered around 370 km south-southeast of Vishakhapatnam, 410 km southeast of Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh) and 450 km east-southeast of Narsapur (Andhra Pradesh).It is very likely to intensify further into a deep depression during the next 24 hours and move west-northwestwards and cross the north Andhra Pradesh coast between Narsapur and Vishakhapatnam on Monday night. The system is likely to bring widespread and heavy rain to Andhra Pradesh, Telanagana, Rayalseema, Maharashtra, Marathwada, Vidarbha, Kerala and Karnataka until October 14.Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over west-central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal, southwest Bay of Bengal and along and off the Odisha- Andhra Pradesh-Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts and over the Gulf of Mannar from October 11 and 12 and over the Gulf of Mannar on October 13. Another low-pressure area is likely to develop over northeast Bay of Bengal around October 14, but IMD hasn’t issued any official warnings on that because there is no consensus yet on forecasts based on various models of weather prediction.“When the deep depression moves inland, rainfall will be enhanced on October 12. Not just in Andhra Pradesh and Rayalseema, we are expecting rains across the western coast. Monsoon has not withdrawn so the deep depression that has formed has mixed characteristics. The south-westerly winds are still strong. For monsoon to withdraw the wind direction needs to change completely to north-easterly but monsoon hasn’t managed to withdraw due to consecutive weather systems forming in October,” explained Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclone prediction at IMD.Remnants of another weather system are likely to approach the Bay of Bengal from the South China Sea around October 14 which could also develop into a depression.“In fact, the second system could also intensify into a deep depression and is likely to bring widespread rains. Due to these weather systems, the wind regime in northwest India is likely to shift to easterly from north-westerly leading to above normal night temperatures again for about five to six days,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecaster.He added that the delay in monsoon’s withdrawal will not just delay the winter’s onset but may cause damage to crops in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-withdrawal-delayed-till-october-20-imd/story-ZMMAMZQYdcl2x1rHC9TQvM.html

The priest, identified as Samrat Das, has been referred to the trauma centre of King George’s Medical University in Lucknow after being given primary treatment at the Gonda district hospital. His condition is said to be critical, the officials said. According to police, the attack was the fall out of a land dispute.The head priest of the temple, Baba Sitaram Das, has alleged in his statement to the police that a local muscleman, Amar Singh, was trying to grab over 150 bigha land of the temple trust. Singh, the priest alleged, had planned an attack on him in the past and was also responsible for Sunday morning’s attack on Samrat Das. He said a similar attack was carried out against him last year, and a police investigation in the case was still ongoing. Das said that the police had even deployed two constables for his security post the attack but the security cover was removed under Singh’s influence, he alleged. Later two home guards were posted at the temple entrance, he said. The miscreants shot Samrat Das while he was sleeping at around 2.30 am and fled the scene, the head priest told the police. The incident occurred when two home guards were deployed for the security of the head priest at the temple’s entrance , said the head priest. Gonda superintendent of police (SP) Shailesh Kumar Pandey said an FIR under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) has been registered against four people in the matter at Etiathok police station and two suspects have been taken into custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/35-yr-old-priest-shot-at-in-up-s-gonda-over-land-dispute-critical-police/story-dsR9p5XtA2oEtO3GAHSeON.html
12-10-2020||India||Centre plans to increase MGNREGS targets again||As India stares at its worst recession ever in the current financial year, the Centre is preparing to raise the targets under its flagship rural jobs programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), which has enrolled one in every five Indians. The aim is to provide 320 crore days of work—about 40 crore days higher than the first estimate -- after the world’s largest employment scheme attracted unprecedented demand for work in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, top officials said on condition of anonymity. Eight big states including the most populous, Uttar Pradesh, have requested the Centre for more MGNREGS work allocation. The demand coincides with Indian economy’s sharp contraction by 23.9% in the first quarter. Many economists have argued that the country may suffer a demand shock in the coming months because of increased unemployment and wage cuts. The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) predicted on Friday that India’s economy may shrink by 9.5% this fiscal year, its worst recession ever.In May, the government pumped in an additional ₹40,000 crore to raise the MGNREGS budget for the year to staggering ₹1 lakh crore as a part of its stimulus package. It also raised the employment target from the first estimate of 281 crore days of work to 300 crore days of work. Officials said 221.9 crore days of work had already been completed as of October 7 and more than ₹65,000 crore been released till September 5, signalling the requirement of additional funds for the demand-driven programme. Internal notes of the union rural development ministry show that since May, the average number of workers in every month has been substantially higher than the corresponding month in FY 2019-20. “Average number of persons to whom work offered in May has been 2.51 crore per day, which is 73% higher than the one offered in May last year, which was 1.45 crore persons per day. Similarly, work was offered to an average of 3.35 crore people per day in June, which is 92% higher than the corresponding period last year,” said one note. “The July average was 114% higher, August (97%), September (86%) and October average was 109% higher than the last year,” said the note, which was reviewed by HT. Top officials also said that even after the target was enhanced to 300 crore days for work for the fiscal year, eight states demanded more allocation of work. “Big states such as UP, Rajasthan, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha. Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal have now asked for additional labour budget. We are looking at generating 320 crore days of work now,” said a top official, requesting anonymity. Former union rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra said: “The enhanced target of 320 crore days of work is doable. But the need of the hour is to focus on areas where poverty levels are high but demand is low due to various reasons. Like, Uttar Pradesh has a poverty share of 20% but its share in MGNREGS is 10%. This is not a reflection of demand but capacity constraints. Effort should be to augment demand in such places for a more equitable distribution of MGNREGS benefits.” MGNREGS guarantees 100 days of work a year to at least one member of every rural household.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-to-increase-mgnregs-targets-again/story-l0TbCyhHPnuu6E9uNxPhWM.html

The deadline expired on Sunday morning. “More than 200 resident doctors and over 300 nursing staff are on an indefinite strike since October 5. The administration has not paid our salaries for three months. It is difficult to continue working like this,” RDA president Abhimanyu Sardana said.Authorities on Saturday shifted 20 Covid-19 patients from the hospital to the Delhi government-run facilities, with health Minister Satyendar Jain saying the civic body should “hand over” municipal hospitals to the AAP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-at-hindu-rao-hospital-stop-work/story-ucIZMLstCyU75c9gK47a1O.html
12-10-2020||India||Spike in cases of social media ‘abuse’: Officials||In the wake of the India-China military standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the ministry of electronics and information technology has seen a sharp rise in the number of cases of “abuse of social media”.According to officials familiar with the matter, the number of social media accounts, pages and websites that have been blocked have gone up from 200-250 per month last year to nearly 500 cases in September this year. The government, in response to an unstarred question in Parliament last month, had said that it addressed 3,635 such cases in 2019. “We were blocking nearly 200-250 accounts, pages, websites on social media per month last year,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. “This year the number went up from approximately 250 in June, to 300 in July, 400 in August and say nearly 500 in September. These figures are indicative and dynamic, they change every day.” The official, however, added that the exact number of cases the ministry had tackled was confidential and could not be disclosed. “The trend has definitely been that the number of cases we are tackling has increased,” the official said. Also Read: The growing threat of cyberwarfareThe ministry takes down such information from the internet when it is in violation of Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which empowers the government to block any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state, friendly relations with other countries or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to such matters. The ministry has also taken down over 200 mobile applications, mostly of Chinese origin, in the wake of the tensions between the two countries between July and September. Electronics and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had called the decision to block the applications, including popular video-streaming app TikTok and game PUB-G, a “digital strike”.Friction has increased between India and China amid the military standoff in the Ladakh sector of the LAC, which led to a skirmish on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead besides an unspecified number of Chinese casualties. There have been multiple rounds of talks between high-ranking officials from India and China to resolve the standoff. The next round of military talks is scheduled for Monday. “These are regular cleanups the ministry does to ensure sanitation of cyber space,” said a second official. Hindustan Times on September 21 reported that the ministry had told Parliament that it had taken down 3,635 websites/pages/accounts on social media in 2019 for violating the Information Technology Act. Also Read: PUBG loses battle for India, among 118 Chinese mobile apps banned by CentreThe answer was given in response to an unstarred question about the ministry’s regulation of social media tabled in Parliament, in which the ministry added that 1,385 pages were blocked in 2017 and 2,799 were blocked in 2018. “With a borderless cyberspace coupled with the possibility of instant communication and anonymity, the potential for misuse of cyberspace and social media platforms for criminal activities is a global issue,” the ministry had said in its response. “In line with increase of usage of Internet as also the growth of social media platforms, there are increasing number of incidents of reporting of such content having potential to incite violence and hatred. Government has a well-defined system of reporting and blocking for public access within the framework of section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 and the Rules thereunder,” it added. Social media platforms are also expected to remove any unlawful content relatable to Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by appropriate government or its agency.“The rise in the number of blocked websites as per data side trends has been on the rise year on year. This is problematic and troubling as the legal process for it is secretive and results in an injury to peoples right to access public information,” said Apar Gupta, trustee of the Internet Freedom Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-cases-of-social-media-abuse-officials/story-GKtdpblx9L6Cjb5Tav1n7L.html
12-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||So, after eight months of the pandemic’s run in India, it is now down to good sense.Amid a lot of spin about what has worked for India and what hasn’t, and whether or not the government has done a good job in tackling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), two things stand out.One, we now know how to keep the viral disease at bay. I don’t mean that in jest. We really do. I remember telling a very senior functionary in the government this in mid-August — that if everyone in India wore masks when they were out and about (not just when they thought someone was watching, but even otherwise), the number of cases would fall to a tenth in about four weeks. I meant it directionally, of course — the four could have become five and the tenth could have become an eighth — but I still believe this.Also Read: Donald Trump says ‘seems like I’m immune’ from Covid-19Two, we now know how to save the lives of those infected by the disease. Every passing day increases our knowledge about what works and what doesn’t, and our ability to cure even people with severe infection.Both are universal truths. They apply to every country on the planet — from China, whose numbers remain a mystery , to New Zealand, which has successfully crushed the virus for the second time (a feat that is expected to play no small part in what political analysts in that country see as a landslide win for Jacinda Ardern in the coming national election), to the US, which now has as many alternate facts about Covid-19 as it does about anything else, and whose President Donald Trump, facing an election in November, is the most prominent world leader to have contracted the disease.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThese things matter because India is really opening up.Even the health minister of Maharashtra, the state worst affected by the pandemic — 40,040 deaths and 1.5 million cases out of India’s total of 108,374 deaths and 7.05 million cases till Saturday night — believes that everything in the state, including schools, will be open in some form by the end of November. “Schools are expected to open after Deepavali; railway services are being allowed this month; religious places and gymnasiums too, will be allowed to open in a phased manner. Some activities will be allowed by October-end and the remaining by November-end,” Rajesh Tope said on Saturday. “I think, by November-end, everything will be open,” he added, for good measure.The pan-India easing of restrictions on movement and activities comes ahead of the festive season, and with the beginning of the next cycle of elections in India — the Bihar assembly elections and by-elections in 11 states will be held shortly. In the first half of next year, Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal will all go to the polls.And in the first half of 2022, Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh will go to the polls. A Covid-19 vaccine will definitely be available by then, although it is unlikely that everyone in India would have got a shot.Put otherwise, it’s going to be business as usual — except, it won’t be. And things can’t be left to chance, or the belief (which has usually proved erroneous) that people will always end up doing what is best for them.Which is why it’s important that the Union health ministry and state (and Union Territory) health departments, and the Indian Council of Medical Research do what needs to be done.Also Read: India considers using more than one Covid-19 vaccineOn the testing front, they need to mandate the use of accurate rapid tests, even pushing for their use by occasion — ahead of events, for instance, or maybe even ahead of flights — or time (a weekly testing regimen for teachers and students once schools open physically).On the tracking front, they need to keep a close eye on numbers — at the neighbourhood level in cities, and at the village level elsewhere — and define containment zones at the first hint of trouble.And on the treatment front, especially with the onset of winter and other strains of flu (especially in central India and the northern plains), they need to ensure that hospitals are geared for an increase in the number of patients (perhaps even an increase in the number of those requiring critical care).It’s not over so there is simply nothing to be gained by pretending it is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-W2ViSX2eViuql2TGka4ylK.html
12-10-2020||India||GST Council to discuss revenue issue for third time today||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is expected to try and find common ground at a meeting on Monday on the vexed issue of compensating states for the Rs2.35 lakh crore shortfall in their share of revenue from the indirect tax this fiscal year, but the 10 dissenting states cannot indefinitely hold back 21 others that are ready to borrow a part of the amount from the market, two persons familiar with the situation said.There is a consensus on two basic issues – all states will be compensated for their entire revenue shortfall irrespective of the Covid-19 pandemic, through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles and coal; and the levy will be extended beyond June 2022, when it was due to lapse, the two said, requesting anonymity.“The Council, which is meeting on Monday evening, could also see some last-minute informal parleys [in the forenoon] among members as everybody wants a solution so that they could quickly get the money to meet their crucial expenditures,” one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.The council on October 5 deferred a decision on the thorny issue of compensating states for the shortfall after 10 states ruled by non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA) parties insisted that the central government borrow the entire Rs2.35 lakh crore and compensate the states.The states were also given the option of borrowing the entire Rs2.35 lakh crore (including the shortfall caused by the Covid-19 pandemic) at a significant cost. As many as 21 state governments have opted to borrow Rs1.10 lakh crore to repay which funds would be managed by the cess levied on sin goods and luxury products. Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal are among the states that have demurred. “A majority [21 states] have already accepted to borrow Rs1.10 lakh crore, hence it is certain that they would be permitted to initiate the borrowing process with the help of RBI [Reserve Bank of India] and DoE [Department of Expenditure]. But, the Council would like to take all members on board, and, therefore, the chairperson {Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman} called this meeting. Some common ground is expected,” the second person said. Both persons said neither a division of vote nor the constitution of a group of ministers (GoM) on this matter could make any material difference after the 21 states signalled their willingness to borrow. The GST Council may, however, address concerns of the 10 members and also try to find a solution that would be acceptable to all, they said.“Even in the last meeting [October 5], the council accepted suggestions of some members and raised the borrowing limit under the first option from Rs97,000 crore to ₹1.10 lakh crore. Similarly, some flexibility could be worked out to make the borrowing option more inclusive,” the second person said. Government officials and independent experts said on condition of anonymity that in unprecedented circumstances such as the present, when the economy has been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the council should not be seen to be divided on the political lines.“The situation emerged largely because of Covid-19 pandemic, which is unexpected and unprecedented in scale. In this hour of crisis, I hope and expect that both the Centre and the states will sit together and find a solution so that the economy as a whole gets a boost,” Pratik Jain, partner and leader of the indirect tax practice at PwC India, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-council-to-discuss-revenue-issue-for-third-time-today/story-81rsjxXyp6qJ5ITSzcTIeN.html

12-10-2020||India||Demanding a section of teachers be included into mainstream, Naga students to ban govt vehicles||Student organizations in Nagaland will impose an indefinite ban on movement of government vehicles across the state from Monday demanding that a section of teachers be brought into the mainstream.The ban sought by Naga Students Federation (NSF) and Eastern Naga Students Federation (ENSF), two influential student organizations, has been supported by student bodies of most tribes in the state.The student organizations have called the strike due to alleged inaction on the part of the state government for mainstream teachers belonging to the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamika Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) of batches 2010 and 2013 into the state education cadre.According to statements issued by various organizations, from Monday movement of vehicles bearing registration numbers beginning with NL-10 and NL-11, used by government vehicles, will be restricted.However, there will be exemption for vehicles belonging to district administrations, para-military, police, medical and emergency services, municipal bodies and those involved in Covid-19 activities.“The joint office urges the general public to extend its fullest cooperation for the plight of the teachers who are the backbone of the students’ welfare in particular and society at large,” said a statement issued by Dimapur Naga Students Union (DNSU) on Sunday.“Any untoward situation arising due to non-cooperation or defying the proposed ‘bandh’, the government official concerned and the state government shall be held solely responsible,” it added.However, some organizations have opposed the ban and urged the student organizations to call it off.In a letter addressed to NSF on Friday, Angami Public Organisation (APO), the apex body of the Angami tribe which is mainly active in Dimapur and Kohima, said any agitation/strike cannot be allowed at present due to the Covid-19 threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demanding-a-section-of-teachers-be-included-into-mainstream-naga-students-to-ban-govt-vehicles/story-Ixm0fZa2os4zLNQ9Jo8fPN.html
12-10-2020||India||Kerala’s Covid-19 graph rises, experts say next few weeks critical||Kerala’s Covid-19 graph took another leap on Sunday registering 9,347 new cases while the test positivity rate remained 15.17 per cent against the national average of 8.5 per cent, according to state health ministry data. With 25 new fatalities, the death toll went up to 1,003. Despite the high number of actives cases (93,316) and steep hike in test positivity rate (TPR), the death rate is low in the state being less than one per cent. Out of 61, 629 samples tested, 9347 people have tested positive. The high TPR is a worrying point to the state, according to the World Health Organization, the TPR should be below 5%. On Saturday, the state had reported the highest cases in the country, 11,755 surpassing Maharashtra 11,416 and Karnataka 10,517 cases while the TPR was 17.74 per cent.“Hike was on expected lines. By this month-end it is likely to touch 15,000 to 20,000. After Onam festivities, the laxity was quite visible. We are paying the price for it. We will redraw our strategies and increase tests,” Rajiv Sadanandan, health advisor to the government said. Many experts said the next few weeks will be critical for the state. In the last week of September, Kerala had reported more than 50,000 cases. Experts warned that high TPR coupled with high density of population and large number of elderly population mortality rate can go up. On May 8, after reporting a single case and 16 people in hospitals, the state had announced that it had flattened the coronavirus curve. But the situation aggravated when people started coming from abroad and other states. The Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter has reiterated its demand for a medical emergency. It said people should be made aware of the gravity of the situation and restrictions should be tightened. “Cases are multiplying fast and most hospitals are full now. The government will have to take drastic measures to contain the spread,” said IMA president Dr Abraham Varghese. He asked the government to increase daily tests to more than one lakh. Despite mounting Covid-19 cases the government has decided to open up the ailing tourism sector from Monday. Other than beaches, all tour destinations will be opened with restrictions. Tour mandarins have been knocking at the doors of the government for some time saying they will face permanent closure if they were not allowed to operate. The state is eying domestic tourists in a big way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-covid-19-graph-rises-experts-say-next-few-weeks-critical/story-6q6yPkcqt7lBM60DBehr9L.html
12-10-2020||India||India considers using more than one Covid-19 vaccine||India may have to tie up with more than one vaccine manufacturer to ensure that every one in the country receives protection against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) when a vaccine becomes available, Union heath minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday, and stressed the need for making sure that the most vulnerable groups get it first. “Considering the large population size of India, one vaccine or vaccine manufacturer will not be able to fulfil the requirements of vaccinating the whole country. Therefore, we are open to assessing the feasibility of introducing several Covid-19 vaccines in the country as per their availability for the Indian population,” the minister said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“All Covid-19 vaccines currently in India are in the phases 1, 2 or 3 of trials with results awaited. Adequate safety and efficacy data is required for emergency use authorization vaccine approval for ensuring patient safety. Further course of action will be based on data generated,” he added, responding to people’s queries on his social media accounts as part of the fifth episode of his Sunday Samvaad (dialogue).Dr. Harsh Vardhan clarified that since it is anticipated that supplies of a Covid-19 vaccine would be available only in limited quantities in the beginning, its administration will have to be prioritised. Of several different types of vaccines being tested, some may be suitable for a particular age group and may not be for others.“Prioritization of groups for vaccination will be based on two key considerations, first is occupational hazard and the risk of exposure to infection; second is the risk of developing severe disease and risk of increased mortality,” the health minister said. “The Covid vaccines currently under trial in India are two-dose and three-dose vaccines. While Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidates are two-dose vaccines, Cadila’s is a three-dose vaccine candidate. For other vaccines in preclinical stages the dosing is being tested,” he said.Also Read| 5 states with most Covid-19 cases contributed more than half of total recoveries: GovtAccording to the website of the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are currently more than 100 Covid-19 vaccine candidates under development, with scientists, businesses and global healthcare providers racing to find a safe and effective vaccine.In India, Bharat Biotech International Limited has developed an inactivated whole virion candidate vaccine (BBV152) for Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Cadila Healthcare Limited has developed a DNA vaccine for which pre-clinical toxicity studies were conducted in small animals: mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs.Serum Institute of India has entered a manufacturing partnership with AstraZeneca to produce the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine candidate in India, for which it is conducting Phase 2/3 trials.The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has granted test license permission for manufacture of Covid-19 vaccine for preclinical test, examination and analysis to the seven manufacturers in India.These are Serum Institute of India in Pune, Cadila Healthcare in Ahmedabad, Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad, Biological E Ltd. in Hyderabad, Reliance Life Sciences Private Limited in Mumbai, Aurobindo Pharma Limited in Hyderabad, and Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Limited, PuneExperts say that more than a vaccine, it is Covid-19 appropriate behaviour that will help prevent the transmission of the respiratory disease.“The vaccine is far from being available right now, as we really do not know when will it be available and more importantly, how effective it will be. If you look at the influenza vaccines, the efficacy that we get is about 50%. Even after 21 years the vaccine against Hepatitis C, which is an RNA-based virus like Covid-19, is not very effective. So, it is too early to predict about the Covid-19 vaccine at this stage,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.“Developing antibodies is one thing, more important is to know whether those antibodies can actually protect against the infection, which gets known after phase 3 trial data is generated. Phase-3 trial will be crucial but it takes longer for phase 3 trial results to be out; it cannot be expedited. Changing behaviour to make it Covid-19 appropriate is the key, especially with winters coming,” he added.Currently, the key component of the planning for Covid vaccine procurement is the cold chain and other logistics that need to be planned to ensure that no glitches take place in vaccine delivery even at the last mile, the health minister added.In another development, Dr Harsh Vardhan disclosed that Feluda,a low-cost indigenously developed test that can detect the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) within an hour, is expected to be available for use in the next few weeks. Feluda is said to be nearly as accurate as the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.Also Read: Harsh Vardhan dismisses rumors of working-class getting Covid-19 vaccine on priority“While I cannot put an exact date on the availability, we should expect this test within the next few weeks,” the minister said on Sunday Samvaad.The paper strip test has been developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India for commercial launch. The kit has already been validated by the Department of Atomic Energy’s National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru.The test is named after a fictional detective created by the late Satyajit Ray, although it is also an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Linked Uniform Detection Assay. It has been developed by senior scientists Dr Debojyoti Chakraborty and Dr Souvik Maiti at CSIR-IGIB.Based on tests performed on over 2,000 patients during the trials at IGIB and on testing in private labs, the test showed 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity. This compares favourably to ICMR’s current acceptation criteria of RT-PCR kit of at least 95% sensitivity and at least 99% specificity. Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate) whereas specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate).“It has similar accuracy as RT-PCR because it is based on the same PCR concept except it is done on simple machines, not expensive real time PCR ones. The detection system is CRISPR based,” said Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-IGIB, Delhi.Feluda uses CRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of Sars-CoV2. CRISPR, which is short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a gene-editing technology that can be used to detect a specific snippet of DNA from a sequence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-considers-using-more-than-one-vaccine/story-qpPrDd5ADHGLEjpb86pexH.html
12-10-2020||India||Will work for villages ignored by previous govts, says Modi||In a sharp rebuke to political parties that are resisting the three farm laws enacted by his government last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that those who had ruled the country through a nexus of middlemen in the past were opposing the reforms because they were worried that the legislation would hurt their interests.Hitting out at the Congress, which has been spearheading the protests against the farm laws, Modi said it was a party of people who for six decades had ignored the country’s villages. He said those who had benefitted from a system that was dominated by brokers and middlemen were trying to obstruct development of the countryside.“It is said that India’s aatma (soul) rests in its villages. But it is also correct that villages were left ignored. The people who were in power for a long time, they talked big, but left villages and poor uncared for amid difficulties. I will not do this. I will work for you. For the poor, oppressed and deprived. Because we don’t want them to be dependent on anyone,” Modi said.To promote efficient farm markets, the government last month enacted three laws, allowing farmers to bypass state-controlled market yards run by agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) and enter into five-year farming contracts with agribusinesses. The government also freed up several commonly consumed food items from strict stocking limits that discouraged private investment in cold storages.Political parties and farmers’ groups are protesting against the reforms, including the move to end the monopoly of APMCs, because they fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. They also fear the reforms may weaken the minimum support price mechanismThe prime minister said the government had raised the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to one and a half times its previous level. These people could not do it, he said hitting at political opponents.The PM spoke at an event where property ownership cards were distributed to beneficiaries of the Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas (SVAMITVA) scheme, which he said was a big step towards the country becoming “aatmanirbhar” (self-reliant). The cards will pave the way for villagers to use property as a financial asset for taking loans and other financial benefits, and end disputes among villagers over land ownership, he said. Modi claimed that for six decades, residents of villages did not have bank accounts, electricity, toilets, piped water or cooking gas connections. Many were homeless. Now, 20 million people have received concrete houses.“To keep villages deprived has been the basis of politics of some. We have started the campaign to free the poor of deprivation. Some people feel that if the villages, poor, farmers, tribals develop, who will come to bow before them?. Their shop will be shut,” Modi said.He alleged that these were the people who wanted problems in the villages to continue; obstructing ecojnomic development had become their habit.“These people now have a problem with the historic agricultural reforms. They are worried and hassled. Not because of farmers, their worries are centered on their interests. Generation after generation, with a huge system of dalals (middlemen) and bribe-seekers, they had created their own ‘maya jaal’(web of illusions). People of the country have begun dismantling their maya jaal,” said the prime minister.“They have a problem with every good thing that is happening. These people want to stall the development of the country. They don’t want our villagers, our poor, our workers, our farmers to become self-reliant.”Those who ruled on the strength of brokers and middlemen can spread as much disinformation as they want, but the country will not stop, Modi said, lashing out at opponents. He said those who had benefitted from government schemes had gained in confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-work-for-villages-ignored-by-previous-govts-says-modi/story-C0BU9HjPqx8NYBnxuYoYTP.html
12-10-2020||India||Winter could lead to spike in Covid-19 cases: Health minister||The onset of winter could lead to a spurt in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India, Union health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan warned on Sunday, as the country braces for a more rapid transmission of the respiratory virus in cold weather.“These viruses are known to thrive better in the cold weather and low humidity conditions. Overcrowding in residential dwellings also increases during cold weather. We also have evidence from the European countries that with the onset of winters the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing as is the case of the United Kingdom,” Harsh Vardhan said. “In view of these, it would not be wrong to assume that the winter season may see increased rates of transmission of the novel coronavirus in the Indian context too.”“This is the reason why we are emphasizing on following the preventive measures prescribed by the government. The measures are simple; people need to follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour such as maintaining a physical distance of six feet from people, wearing a mask and following hand hygiene,” he added.The minister also emphasized the need for being extra careful during the coming festive season as congregations n large numbers could turn into super-spreaderevents, and also if people do not follow government-prescribed guidelines to cut disease transmission. He appealed to the people to celebrate the festivals at home, with their families and friends, instead of going out to fairs and pandals, reminding citizens that the fight against Covid-19 was their foremost dharma, for mitigating the virus and preventing deaths at any cost.““The Bhagavad Gita condones war for the warrior class. So, there is no need to congregate in large numbers to prove your faith or your religion. If we do this, we may be heading for big trouble…Our goal is to finish this virus and save humanity. This is our religion…,” he said.“Extraordinary circumstances must draw extraordinary responses. No religion or God says that you have to celebrate in an ostentatious way, and that you have to visit pandals and temples and mosques to pray,” he added.Experts also say that the coming weeks could determine what shape the pandemic takes in India.“Even though nothing can be said with certainty because it is a new virus and we are getting to know it better; still going by the pattern of respiratory viruses in the past, this virus could also spread faster in cold weather. There are many factors that aid growth of respiratory viruses in winters that includes high pollution levels, low humidity etc. that helps them stay in the atmosphere for a longer period of time. Also, overcrowded spaces during winters are also common, and all this is ideal for virus multiplication,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of respiratory medicine and interventional pulmonology at Fortis Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winter-could-lead-to-spike-in-covid-19-cases-health-minister/story-GqTKoAygR7c4wCOYm7WDBL.html
12-10-2020||India||‘Save India’s farmers from such black laws’: Cong-ruled states to intensify farm law stir||The Congress has decided to intensify its political battle against the new farm laws enacted by the Narendra Modi government by expanding the scope and intensity of protests such as the one the party recently organised in Punjab and Haryana, and going ahead with its plan of having states where it is in power pass resolutions or bills effectively nullifying these laws. According to people familiar with the matter, the assessment within the party is that the agrarian distress has already affected a large chunk of the rural population and the new farm laws will aggravate the crisis. The people, who asked not to be identified, said the Congress has also decided that the party-ruled states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh will summon a special session of their respective assemblies to pass their own laws to override the central laws. The union territory of Puducherry will adopt a resolution in this regard. The people added that the party’s top leaders are not convinced that these bills will be approved by the respective state governors (all of whom have been appointed by the Union government). “In that case too, we are ready for any confrontation. Our aim is to save the farmers of this country from such black laws, “ said a Congress functionary. The people said that the party discussed the possibility of moving the Supreme Court against the three farm bills, but decided that it would be better to wait to do this. With political protests gathering steam and its states set to push their own bills that would counter the new laws, the party’s internal thinking is that time is not right for going to Supreme Court as the matter will then take a completely different turn. “There is a time and scope for political movement. Similarly, there is a time and scope for asserting legal remedies in the court. The Congress retains the right to go to court and will do so at an opportune moment,” said Congress leader and lawyer Winter could lead to spike in Covid-19 cases: Health minister. Singhvi has been extensively consulted on the farm bill issue and has also drafted the bills for the Congress-led state governments to take up in the respective assemblies. The people also said that if the Congress goes to court, the move to pass bills in state assemblies might get affected as the entire issue would be before the court. “The President, who has to give his assent to every bill for becoming a law, can very well cite the ongoing cases to not sign the state bills,” said a second Congress functionary. The party is also not sure of the outcome in the court. “If the apex court rules in favour of the government, we will lose ground and it will be difficult to continue the agitation,” said a third Congress leader. He referred to the Congress protest against the Rafale deal , where a court order took the sting out of the party’s allegations. The Congress high command has also asked party general secretaries and in-charges to visit their respective states and intensify the anti-farm laws agitation there. The party will also collect two crore signatures from farmers from across the country and submit those to President Ram Nath Kovind. Some individual MPs, including DMK’s Tiruchi Siva and Congress’ TN Prathapan have knocked on the Supreme Court’s doors for remedy on the farm laws but as a collective strategy of the party, no decision to go to court has been taken yet. Prathapan has clarified that he has gone to court only on one bill and not the larger issue of three legislations. In a sustained attack at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said that not a single policy introduced by the Centre in the last six years has benefitted the poor. “They passed the three black farm bills amid the coronavirus outbreak. What was the haste to do it at this time? They did it because they thought the farmers won’t be able to do anything, but they don’t know the power of a farmer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-ruled-states-to-intensify-farm-law-stir/story-Y8NjJYuat0jTqXKPLy45yJ.html
12-10-2020||India||100k get house ownership cards under new scheme||Some 100,000 people from states including Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh were handed over the legal ownership papers of their houses on Sunday, and the Centre vowed to give such documents to every household in every village of the country in the next three to four years.The property ownership cards were handed over to the beneficiaries under the government’s ambitious Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas (SVAMITVA) scheme at an event presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi over video link.The scheme will bring historical changes to the villages of the country, Modi said, adding that it was a key step towards an Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India).The cards will pave the way for villagers to use property as an asset for borrowing loans and deriving other financial benefits, and end disputes among villagers over land ownership, the PM said. On the occasion, Modi also interacted with several beneficiaries of SVAMITVA scheme.The prime minister said a record of property ownership opens up new avenues of investment. Access to bank loans becomes easier with a record of property ownership, which could generate self-employment, he said.The difficulty is that today only one-third of the world’s population has a legal record of their property, Modi said. He added that the property card will clear the way for people in rural India to buy and sell property without disputes.With new technology like drones being used in mapping and surveys, accurate land records can be created for every village. The Prime Minister said unprecedented development had taken place in the villages in the last six years, which hadn’t taken place in the first seven decades after independence. He listed benefits such as gaining access to bank accounts, electricity and piped drinking water connections and access to toilets built under the Clean India mission. He added that a major campaign to connect every village in the country though optical fibre is also underway at a rapid pace. Chief ministers of several states were also present at the virtual event., where Modi expressed happiness that the cards were being distributed on the birth anniversary of two great leaders, Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh, who, he said, had devoted their entire lives to the empowerment of rural India and the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100k-get-house-ownership-cards-under-new-scheme/story-W8QQb9lFUESMuyNzH0v4lI.html
12-10-2020||India||Hope Article 370 is restored in Valley with China’s help, says Farooq Abdullah||National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday said he wished that with China’s support, Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir, will be restored.In an interview to India Today TV, Abdullah noted that China was not happy with the nullification of Article 370, which was scrapped in August last year by Parliament. Parliament also pushed through the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union territories -- J&K and Ladakh. Abdullah’s statement came against the backdrop of the five-month-long border standoff between India and China in Ladakh which began in early May.“As far as China is concerned, I didn’t bring {the} Chinese president here. Our Prime Minister invited him to Gujarat and even did jhoola sawari with him. He [PM Modi] even took him to Chennai and had food with him,” he said.The former chief minister of J&K said that China “never accepted” the nullification of Article 370. “They said till you restore Article 370, we won’t stop because it has now become an open issue,” he said.“May Allah wish that our people get help from their might and our Articles 370 and 35-A get restored,” Abdullah said. Article 35A of the Indian Constitution empowered the J&K legislature to define permanent residents of the state for providing some special rights and privileges; it too was revoked.Nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders were detained on August 5, 2019, hours before Parliament nullified Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the state into two union territories.After being incarcerated for months, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, both former chief ministers, were released on March 13 and March 24, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hope-art-370-is-restored-in-valley-with-china-s-help-says-farooq/story-6qGiIwnh8PfXtXO1huOMvJ.html
12-10-2020||India||LAC talks: India to push for restoration of status quo ante||With military tensions showing no signs of subsiding along the country’s northern borders, India and China are set to hold the seventh round of their corps commander-level dialogue in eastern Ladakh on Monday to reduce friction in the sensitive theatre, officials familiar with the developments said on Sunday. The talks are expected to begin at 9.30 am in Chushul on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the officials said. The Indian side will demand comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April, the officials said. The two nuclear powers have been locked in a border dispute for more than five months, with several rounds of diplomatic and military talks failing to produce a breakthrough in reducing border tensions in the sector where both armies have made arrangements for a long haul through the winter months. The latest military talks will take place weeks after China hardened its position and asserted that it recognises the 1959 LAC, which was never accepted by India. China’s hardened stance has dimmed hopes for an early resolution of the border row, as reported by HT on October 5. China’s assertion that it abides by the LAC as proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959 has complicated the border row in eastern Ladakh, and called into question Beijing’s intent to restore status quo ante and de-escalate the conflict. Experts said it was important to find a resolution to the dispute through talks. “Both countries have said at various levels that they don’t want to escalate the conflict and find a solution through talks. So, talks at both military and diplomatic levels have to continue to find a methodology to disengage and deescalate,” said National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Lieutenant General SL Narasimhan (retd). Monday’s dialogue will be the last round of military talks to be led by the current commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, Lieutenant General Harinder Singh. Singh, who has completed his one-year term, is heading to Dehradun on October 15 as the commandant of the Indian Military Academy. He is being replaced by Lieutenant General PGK Menon, who had also attended the previous round of military talks on September 21. At the September 21 talks, Indian negotiators firmly demanded comprehensive disengagement at all friction areas and restoration of status quo ante as the only approach towards de-escalation. On the other hand, China asked India to withdraw its soldiers from strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso to reduce friction. According to a joint statement, released in New Delhi and Beijing on September 22, the two sides agreed to stop sending more troops to the front line, and to “take practical measures to properly solve problems on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-talks-india-to-push-for-restoration-of-status-quo-ante/story-0mDJq6VCuICTIo3nA5HdRP.html
12-10-2020||Today's||Why some millennials just can’t manage their money | Opinion||In 2008, Jackie and I arrived at our investment banking jobs on Wall Street. Fresh out of college, we were now among the top earners in our peer group. Twenty-hours-plus daily, most days of the week, working hard on pitchbooks, models and deals. We saw eye-to-eye on most things: people, what we were going to eat that night off of seamlessweb.com, and, more or less, life.We were both so-called Millennials, defined as those born between 1981 and 1996. There were a couple of big differences. One was that she thought about savings and investing her earnings. I was more basic, just thinking about spending less than I made. The day Jackie had to run out to set up her Charles Schwab Corp. account, I barely understood what she was doing. She came back with flyers and talked about Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, bond funds.I was bemused. While I could go through companies’ financial statements and run accretion-dilution and discounted cash flow models, I could just about keep track of my personal income. I was basically financially illiterate when it came to my own accounts. That stemmed, as I now see it, from the more fundamental difference between us: We grew up on two sides of the world — she in Maryland, me in Indore, India.Our micro-example is reflected in several surveys showing that financial literacy rates in Asia are far lower than in the US, Canada and the UK(1)That means possessing a basic understanding of concepts like interest rates, compounding, diversifying risk, and inflation to make decisions about personal savings. Money management behavior is tightly linked to such knowledge.Some of this comes down to cultural investing priorities. In Asia, property and gold – hard assets – have always taken precedence over speculative stocks and bonds. Capital markets haven’t been deep enough for previous generations to participate with confidence. Nor were retail investing products mainstream. A recent survey by China’s central bank that covered more than 30,000 urban households in 30 provinces showed that almost 60% of assets were tied up in real estate. About 70% of liabilities were mortgages. The portion of financial assets was low.To be sure, the privileges of investing and even holding financial assets are often impossible for many people in wealthy countries who are just trying to make ends meet. That’s even more true in emerging economies.In India, the average household has 77% of total assets in real estate and 11% in gold, according to a Reserve Bank of India report. The total is 44% in the US About 5% is held in financial assets like savings accounts, mutual funds and publicly traded shares, compared to 17% in the US, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report says.Generational attitudes get passed along. My parents didn’t really talk about money at the table or otherwise; it was only ever mentioned in terms of being prudent. (That’s a whole different topic I’ll save for another column.) Jackie’s family had a slightly different approach. Her allowance (and that of her younger brother) was split into four jars: taxes, savings, charity and spending money. They got to choose the charity. That helped create a sense of where money goes. “My dad was always (like) dollars and cents, spend wisely and make good choices,” she told me recently. “But not miserly.”For Millennials, choices are constantly changing. In the US, gurus like @MrsDowJones drop knowledge on their hundreds of thousands of Instagram and Twitter followers. Millennial investing podcasts laud putting money where you spend your time, thinking about your own price per hour when setting out for a new purchase. Gaming is big; experiences are more valuable than things. Millennials tend to think more about wellness and what’s good for the environment (greener packaging, no plastics). Fashion choices are sustainable — vegan leather, you name it. In Asia, the tech-enabled generation is beginning to take charge of its finances. Millennials have increasingly become a bigger part of the Asian consumer class that has driven travel and spending across the world. In India, savings in physical and financial assets as a portion of gross domestic product has been dropping, while net financial savings as a share of the gross national disposable income has also come down.To this cohort, property and jewelry increasingly look old-school. The permanence of such holdings is a turn-off. These assets are plagued with issues parents faced buying property (especially in India — a pre-sale gone bad, an incomplete project that took their cash) and the shifting relative value of gold. There are also questions of taste and practicality. Will I pull out bling and unfashionable traditional jewelry to go to the office? Unlikely. Online finance makes growing sense. More people in China are buying wealth management products, or thinking about how to maximize their balance sheets and taking out consumer loans. In India, investing apps such as Groww are all the rage. Backed by the likes of Sequoia India, it has 8 million users for mutual fund offerings and a couple of hundred thousand have bought stocks on it. Zerodha, ETMoney and others are increasingly popular.Economic insecurity from Covid-19 will likely accelerate the change. Millennials will be less quick to splash out on soy lattes and yoga pants, especially in Asia, as they become savers again. What they buy will be higher up the quality ladder – “premiumization.” That behavior will come with smarter ways to put their money to work instead of stashing it away in vanilla bank deposits. Risk profiles should change.There might be a whole new class of savvier savers, but the need for financial literacy will remain paramount. A YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey in India recently found that post-Millennials, born after 1996, “are much more likely to keep their savings as cash and least likely to invest in mutual funds.” But, this crowd was more prone to invest in cryptocurrencies and alternative investments.I’m still behind the curve on investing my retirement savings, but I’m going to start by setting up four jars for my kids today.(1) But even in the US, financial literacy levels among Millennials are considered low when compared to older generations. https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Millennials-and-Money-Technical-Report-August2020.pdf?x38887This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

12-10-2020||Today's||The govt’s Tree Transplantation Policy will damage ecology and our city||The Delhi Government’ new Tree Transplantation Policy hopes to save existing trees instead of cutting them down for new projects.Red alerts about the likely failure of this plan are abundant and are common knowledge . We hear about the impossibility of transplanting old trees, a hallmark of the capital and its climate warriors. The plan’s 80% survival target has been called out as something designed to fail.But there’s more. First, would you like the state to take away trees from your neighbourhood on the pretext that they would be planted elsewhere? Which neighbourhood doesn’t need trees? The policy isn’t about the question of saving trees, but the loss of several hundred trees from a neighbourhood. What kind of conditions will people have to endure? For sure, a hotter micro-climate and more dust would become the order of the day. The poorest in the city will experience unbearable heat.Birds, including those from exotic species, will lose their unsubstitutable homes. Are these benefits or losses?Second, examining the Masterplan 2021, I couldn’t identify spaces where the trees could be transplanted. Not all open spaces are ecologically viable for planting non-native trees anyway. Unless the Delhi government stops work on all upcoming buildings and knocks down built infrastructure, I don’t see where thousands of unwanted trees can be dumped in the what has been called transplantation.Charles Darwin, and even Carolus Linnaeus, spoke of the inter-dependence of species. The Delhi government overturns these giants of modern science. Nor does it trust Indian culture, rich with odes to symbiotic affections. Delhi (and India) must nurture trees in situ. It must build with them intact.The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-govt-s-tree-transplantation-policy-will-damage-ecology-and-our-city/story-jFIxOsmiZjkn1jeDvd1oTJ.html
12-10-2020||Editorials||There is an environment of fear in India. The State must renew the commitment to rights||Indian democracy has always been a work in progress. There is no doubt that unlike most post-colonial democracies, the idea of representative democracy, elections, free speech, free association and rule of law took deeper root in India. But while there may be a difference in degree, there has never been a golden period where individual rights were sacrosanct and protected as rigorously as the original drafters of the Constitution had in mind. This was symbolised in Jawaharlal Nehru’s push to bring in the first amendment, which restricted the scope for fundamental rights, Indira Gandhi’s Emergency, Rajiv Gandhi’s attempts at bringing in the anti-defamation bill, the curtailment of individual liberty under anti-terror laws, the fact that perpetrators of even mass crimes have often got away, and the crackdown on free expression for the fear of offending sensitivities. So no regime can claim it has been truly democratic.Yet, even in the backdrop of this mixed history, what appears to be happening now is an almost unprecedented attack on civil liberties of citizens, especially those citizens who the government finds inconvenient. From Bhima Koregaon to the Delhi riots, from the 2016 episode in Jawaharlal Nehru University to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests to even Hathras, there appears to be a pattern where the fundamental right of citizens to life and liberty is increasingly under strain. If, in the past, political protection enabled distortions in the justice system to protect the powerful, what is now happening is that the political regime is using the justice system not just to protect its own, but to frame others under serious charges from sedition to inciting violence.The action against a range of intellectuals and activists and journalists — Sudha Bharadwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Stan Swamy, Apoorvanand, Harsh Mander are among the better-known examples — indicates that the space for free expression and dissent is jeopardised. It gives rise to apprehensions that the political dispensation does not view criticism as an essential ingredient of democracy. It empowers the police to be vindictive rather than fair. It erodes the rule of law. And it creates fear. This is not to suggest that critics must not be held accountable for any illegal or unlawful activity; nor is it to endorse the viewpoints of many of these activists. But it does mean that the regime must revise its approach and deepen its commitment to rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/there-is-an-environment-of-fear-in-india-the-state-must-renew-the-commitment-to-rights/story-rVpiDb8UDZhrGzmhBlZjhO.html
12-10-2020||Editorials||The economy is still fragile | HT Editorial||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), in its first forecast after the Covid-19 pandemic, has projected a 9.5% contraction for the Indian economy in the current fiscal year. This number is in line with other projections and should settle the debate about the impact of the pandemic on the economy, for it is now clear that the Indian economy is going to face its worst-ever contraction. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das also ruled out any V-shaped recovery — which reflects an immediate revival in growth — and indicated that different sectors will follow different revival trajectories and the overall performance will be a sum of these parts. He also acknowledged the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic derailing the ongoing gradual revival from the 23.9% contractionary shock in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.The crux of RBI’s assessment is that while the worst is over, the economy is not out of the woods yet. Policy intervention, going forward, needs to have two objectives. It should ensure that things do not get worse. This will require controlling the pandemic (there is little RBI can do in this regard) and mitigating the impact of the pandemic’s current and future economic shocks on important economic institutions. The ongoing Supreme Court case where RBI is arguing against a stay on classifying loan defaults as non-performing assets is a critical factor vis-à-vis financial sector stability. Another factor, which has been highlighted by economist Pranjul Bhandari, is the risk of India facing another taper tantrum-like situation in the near future as advanced economies raise interest rates and inflation proves to be more than a transitory phase in India. A capital flight triggered by the coming together of these two factors could give a jolt to the stock market, which crossed the psychological 40,000-mark once again last week.To be sure, the government has undertaken critical reforms in sectors such as agriculture and labour during this period. This newspaper believes that they have the potential to unleash long-term gains. Any such gains, however, can be jeopardised if India’s financial sector problems, especially growing bad debt in banks is not addressed. If there is one lesson from India’s experience after the 2008 economic crisis and its aftermath, it is that a credit boost to unviable businesses cannot lead to a sustainable growth revival. This is also why the question of boosting demand continues to be critical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-economy-is-still-fragile-ht-editorial/story-836pClZZEz0MvBeCoqjv3O.html
12-10-2020||Editorials||A reminder for China: India is free | HT Editorial||Last week, the Chinese embassy in India issued an advisory to the Indian media — asking it to follow the Government of India’s position on the Taiwan question and not violate the one-China policy. The advisory came in the run up to Taiwan’s National Day on Saturday. This, legitimately, sparked outrage among Indian journalists. It also prompted the ministry of external affairs to say that the Indian media is free and reports on issues as it sees fit. This was then, followed, with the appearance of posters greeting Taiwan in Delhi’s key diplomatic enclave, put up by a local Delhi leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). With the embassy complaining, they were taken down, but only because they weren’t authorised.The episode reflects the undemocratic orientation of the Chinese embassy — much in line with the nature of the one-party regime in China. India is a proud democracy. It has a free and vibrant media. There is a healthy foreign policy debate conducted out in the open. Beijing’s actions in recent years, and its military aggression in Ladakh, have antagonised the Indian street. There is today a strong view that India must speak up against Chinese efforts to institute its hegemony. The media will, as it must, give space to these views. The government will, as it must, respect diplomatic norms. In fact, many would suggest that it has too cautious in its approach to Chinese sensitivities. But the media is within its right to flag issues, and expand the foreign policy discourse. China should not think it can do in India what it does in its own country, and suppress the media. If it wants goodwill among Indians, it should instead reform its behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-reminder-for-china-india-is-free-ht-editorial/story-eMkbVPTrvcFdnB97ceqGgN.html
