13-10-2020||News||The fragmentation of political power is key to institutional autonomy | Analysis||Over the past few years, we have seen a wholesale capitulation of our institutions. Democracy requires institutions to enquire into and produce truth, mediate, uphold the rule of law, and protect citizens from the State’s excesses. The diminishing of institutions must be resisted.Democracies are premised on the separation of powers and a system of checks and balances. However, this works well only when political power is factionalised. In a democracy, political power is derived from organised public opinion. The State’s executive power is acquired by winning elections. Institutions work when political power and executive power are distributed among competing factions. At some threshold of consolidation of political and executive power, institutions start collapsing. It would be wrong to see this as a result of individual failings, and examine systemic factors.First, a large part of institutional power is essentially delegated power because the executive controls most institutional appointments such as the election commissioners and heads of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Even in the selection of the Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC), where the appointment committee includes the leader of Opposition, the executive has a majority and appointments do not require a consensus. In such bodies or agencies, institutional capture is a real danger, especially if executive power is not transferred periodically between opposing factions. The executive can also make it difficult for independent-minded individuals to function to a point that they may wish to exit on their own. Second, even where institutional design insulates the appointment process from the executive to a large degree, such as the judiciary, the executive has considerable official and unofficial coercive power. Dissent can be neutralised through inducement, marginalisation, intimidation, harassment, propaganda, transfers, even incarceration. A determined State only needs a pretext. Third, institutions derive authority from normative legitimacy. Over the years, this normative legitimacy has been undermined due to various factors, including the (perception of) fallibility and venality.Moreover, most institutions are dependent on the coercive power of the executive for the implementation of their orders. This requires the executive to voluntarily accept the authority of other institutions and imposes an automatic horizon of acceptable opposition on institutions when facing down the executive. It is evident that while democracy needs institutions to function, this happens within a context. When the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) 2 government was thought to be on its last legs, institutions acquired a radical oppositional streak, driven not by any streak of independence but by political calculation. Similarly, executive overreach and countervailing institutional pusillanimity is greater in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s second term with consolidation of political power and its willingness to bypass normative thresholds to further consolidate power. This underscores how much our democratic systems rely on the strongest player in the game to voluntarily abide by the rules (Nehru did).This moment is an inflexion point. Institutions may always have been fallible but when political power is distributed, this fallibility is ad hoc to defuse specific issues or capricious in response to competing levers of power. Such institutional fallibility does not impede democratic contestation. The institutional capitulation of today is designed to consolidate political power and dismantle the constraints on State power which make it possible to contest it. Speaking up without organising is no longer enough because we are no longer working within the framework and logic of liberal democracy where the State is responsive to principled criticism and institutions act as countervailing power to the State.But India is still a democracy. Contrary to common rhetoric, democracy is not a binary construct but operates on a continuum. Important checks and balances have been lost but political and electoral contestation remains open. This underscores the importance and urgency of the political process at this point in Indian democracy and the need to go beyond outrage in an echo chamber.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-fragmentation-of-political-power-is-key-to-institutional-autonomy/story-2zhPfWaX2LVWLa4DpJxr0M.html
13-10-2020||News||The economy is looking up. Seize the moment | Analysis||The festive season is upon us and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s measures to boost demand will come as a relief to consumers. Monday’s announcement of the advance payment of a part of salaries to central government employees and spending tax-exempted travel allowance will be more than welcome. The announcement is a sign that the wheels of the economy are slowly moving again. Take specific examples. Exports touched $27.5 billion in September, up by nearly $1 billion in the same month last year. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection for September went up to ₹95,480 crore from a meagre ₹32,172 crore in April. Power demand accelerated to 113.5 billion units in September from 23.2 billion units in April. What is most welcome is the fact that there is a drop in unemployment. From a high of 23.8% in April, when the migrant labourers had returned home, the unemployment rate stood at 5.8% in September. My optimism is not only based on the 8-11% growth forecast by next financial year by all ratings agencies, but that it has taken on a V-shape recovery since the start of Q2. Passenger vehicles posted zero sales in April but, in September, it’s up by 37%. Two-wheeler sales had plummeted to minus-100% but posted a 13.4% growth in September.The most significant measure has been the Atmanirbhar package of ₹20 lakh crore announced by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on May 12. It was the biggest relief-cum-stimulus package among the G20 countries. And it ensured a sustained growth for India in the post-Covid-19 world. Despite the crisis, India has seen its forex reserves grow to around $550 billion as of September, enough to pay for 13-14 months of imports. The government should spend $30 billion from the forex reserves on developing infrastructure, which will create jobs and entrepreneurship. The modalities and regulatory compliant structure could be worked out in consultation with Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Normally, RBI buys government securities from the secondary market through the open market operation to create liquidity and manage interest rates movement. But the government and RBI can explore a legal framework to enable RBI to buy government securities worth $30 billion in the primary market.Another way the government can generate funds is by issuing perpetual bonds or “perps”, as they are known in the corporate world. Governments resort to this method during extraordinary times but they are beneficial to all parties concerned. These will allow the government to spend on infrastructure development and build robust supply chains with a view to competing with China. RBI buying government securities will keep interest rates in check as opposed to, let’s say, the government borrowing money from the market which might put pressure on the interest rates. In the pandemic-hit global trade and economy, a new world order is emerging and it’s a selfish one. The West had set the rules of the game in the global order it created in the aftermath of World War II, and most countries played along. In this emerging world, India wants its rightful place — it is a regional economic powerhouse and deserving of a permanent seat at the United Nations (UN) Security Council. The PM has made a strong pitch for a more meaningful role for India in the structures of the UN in his recent speech on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of its foundation. His argument was simple:“The world of 2020 is vastly different from the world of 1945”.Whether India will carve out a key role for itself in the new world order or not will depend a lot on how quickly it becomes a global economic powerhouse. We should seize the moment. I believe new trade deals and diplomacy will be at the heart of these opportunities. We need trilateral or multilateral trade deals with like-minded democracies. This should be done specifically to reduce dependency on China. For instance, the India-Japan-Australia joint initiatives of last month could be harnessed to reduce dependence on China and build supply chains.On the domestic front, India needs to attract global brands which are keen to move out of China altogether. There are several such companies which have previously shown an interest in setting up shop in India. It is perhaps time to provide them with incentives in the areas of land, labour and legislation.Another area of opportunity will emerge when we roll out the 5G technology which has the potential to create hundreds of new businesses and generate new jobs. There is no magic wand to control the pandemic, as it continues to destroy the economies across the world. We need patience and we need perseverance, both of which has been demonstrated by the PM in these trying times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-economy-is-looking-up-seize-the-moment-analysis/story-7oMTecZdgecm2I3vmLOy1H.html

The committee will investigate all aspects of the incident and submit a report within a week.”The Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) will also conduct an inquiry into the incident.The MFB said it will investigate how the generator got overheated and whether proper maintenance was being done from the fire safety point of view.A senior MFB officer said, “We will a check on the maintenance work. Other aspects of the fire safety point of view will be investigated. However, at no point were the patients under exposure to fire, as the generator is placed outside the hospital building.”After the blaze on Monday evening, 40 patients were shifted to different hospitals nearby, during which, one critical patient died on the way, while another patient who was shifted to Fortis Hospital died on Tuesday morning.A statement by Fortis Hospital said, “Of the 11 patients that were admitted, eight need intensive care and two are in stable condition.

During the shifting, an 82-year-old Covid-19 patient who was on ventilator support died. The generator was being used since morning due to power failure.Vivek Singh, administrator with Apex Hospital said, “We were informed that power supply storage might take time, hence we shifted all the patients. The generator was used almost for 10 hours and there was no other option available at that point of time. We do not know how it got overheated and caught fire. Unfortunately, one patient died while being shifted to another hospital. The patient was already in a critical condition; however, we took all safety measures during the transit. We will cooperate with all the government agencies for any enquiry or probe.”Overall, 28 patients of the total 40, admitted at Apex Hospital were taken to Fortis Hospital.

Complainant Kamla Sonkar is a resident of Sector 45 Noida. Her family was in financial difficulty after the Covid-19 pandemic cost her husband his job with an export company. “It became difficult to run the house. To support the family, my 16-year-old daughter searched the internet and found a company -- CCL Solutions Private Limited-- that offered a work from home job. She contacted the company and the officials promised good salary for data entry work,” she said. “They had also fixed a weekly deadline. My daughter failed to meet it due to network issues. The company officials called us and told to pay up ₹32,000 in penalty or they would file a case against us,” Sonkar said. The woman alleged that later a person who identified himself as an advocate, on behalf of the company, also contacted her and sent an email as legal notice. “We were scared and paid the penalty in two transactions. However, soon they stopped all communication with us. We later went to Delhi to check with the company office and found there was no such company at the given address,” she said. Sonkar then filed a complaint in Sector 39 police station. Based on the complaint, a case was registered against the unknown suspects under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. Azad Singh Tomar, station house officer, Sector 39 police station, said, “The police and cyber cell are investigating the matter.” The company could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/firm-offering-wfh-assignments-cheats-noida-family-of-32-000-case-filed/story-Dnc8I7WA4r89xYs5j5RmLM.html
13-10-2020||City||Delhi govt urges CBSE to push board exams to May||New Delhi: The Delhi directorate of education on Tuesday urged the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to delay the board exams till at least May next year, saying the prolonged closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic affected the teaching and learning processes.“In order to provide the students with reasonable time to study in person in schools, it is requested that the ongoing board examinations 2021 be conducted not before May 2021. Consequently, the next academic session may commence from July 2021,” read a letter written by additional Director Education (School/Exam) Saroj Bala Sain to the board.Delhi schools have been closed since March 19 due to the lockdown imposed to arrest the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Since then, schools have switched to online mode of learning. Government schools in the capital have also adopted a semi-online model of teaching and learning activities, wherein students are sent worksheets through teachers, parents, and school management committee members.“Though DOE has conducted online/semi-online teaching-learning activities through live classes as well as worksheets/activity sheets, but the online teaching-learning process cannot replace the physical classroom teaching process,” the letter stated.A senior official in the Delhi government’s education department said, “Since schools in Delhi will be closed till October-end at least, we have requested the board to delay the exams so that students have adequate time to prepare.”In addition, the education department has asked the board to further reduce the syllabus for the current session. In July, the board had reduced the syllabus by 30% for classes 9 to 12 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a meeting held last month with CBSE officials, suggestions were also made to reduce the percentage of syllabus to be covered for evaluation, HT has learnt. The education department on Tuesday also asked for detailed guidelines regarding conducting of practical exams under the prevailing conditions or “any other alternative mode to replace the practical part of the subject.”. On October 5, HT had reported how schools were worried about the absence of practical classes for students of class 10 and 12 and their implication in the board exams.“Practical and project work are an integral part of any subject that include assessment of desired skills and competencies. It is pertinent to give students hands-on practice for the same for a sufficient period of time. It is requested that the board may provide detailed guidelines regarding the conduct of these practical exams under such conditions or any other alternative mode to replace the practical part of the subject,” read the letter sent on Tuesday.When asked about the possibility of reducing the syllabus further or delaying the board exams next year, CBSE chairperson Manoj Ahuja said, “These decisions cannot be taken at the whim of the moment and involve deliberation. We haven’t taken a call on this issue so far.”The directorate had also asked the board, in a separate letter on October 9, to extend the deadline for the board exam fee up to November 14 instead of October 15 since many students were unable to pay the amount due to the economic crisis arising out of Covid-19 pandemic. The letter was sent after CBSE said it could not waive off the exam fee, as requested earlier, since it was a self-financing board and needed the funds to conduct the exams on a large scale, especially during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-urges-cbse-to-push-board-exams-to-may/story-JSdVOq2pHU4dT29sAMAZpK.html
13-10-2020||Noida||Three arrested for running online shopping racket, duping 100 people||Phase 2 police on Tuesday arrested three people and claimed to have busted an online shopping racket in Noida that cheated people by making fake bookings and extracting advance payments from customers, but failing to deliver their products.The suspects, police said, had been operating for around a year and had cheated over 100 people.Ankur Agarwal, additional DCP, Noida Central, said that the incident came to light after a money transfer agent from Gejha village filed a complaint in Phase II police station on Monday. The complainant said that some men had contacted him a few months ago for availing his service, following which his account had been frozen.Agarwal said that the police registered a case and launched an investigation into the matter. “We found that a number of transactions had been made in the complainant’s account, with the money being deposited from Delhi NCR, and from other states. The bank had later frozen his account due to suspicious transactions,” he said.The police tracked the mobile phones of the suspects - Abdul Hannan, Suhaib Hasan and Nishant Alam - and arrested them on Tuesday. The suspects are natives of Moradabad and they lived on a rented accommodation in Supertech Ecociti in Noida Sector 137.Agarwal said that the three suspects had a unique modus operandi. “They used to place advertisements on social networking sites for various mobile phones, headphones and other electronic equipment at 50% discount. They used to convince customers that the products will be booked and delivered from a leading e-commerce website,” he said.Once a customer contacted the suspects, the suspects used to book the products using fake bank details. “The suspects revealed that they used to book the product themselves on behalf of customers. They entered fake bank details for booking the products online. As a security measure, in case wrong bank account details are fed, the bank automatically cancels the booking in five to ten minutes. But the suspects used to take screenshots of the booking in those 5-10 minutes and shared them with the customers,” he said. The suspects then asked the customers to pay 50% of the money in advance and the rest was to be paid, once the product was delivered.Agarwal said that the suspects were aware that if they used their own bank accounts, they will land in the police net. “To evade surveillance, they approached a money transaction agent. The suspects used his account and used to get cash from the money transaction agent after giving him some commission,” he said. Agarwal said that the agent had no role in the racket. Police recovered nine mobile phones, Rs 1.22 lakh in cash and one high-end motorcycle from the possession of the suspects. A case has been registered against them under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC and Section 66 of IT Act. “The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” Anita Chauhan, SHO Phase II police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-arrested-for-running-online-shopping-racket-duping-100-people/story-vDBJo0KlSorGcUskgyv6gL.html
13-10-2020||Noida||Developer booked for construction on Hindon floodplains||Police have booked a developer for illegal construction on the Hindon floodplains in Greater Noida west on Monday following a complaint from the irrigation department. The suspect Pappu Tripathi is a resident of Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad. The complainant, seechpal/patwari from irrigation department Subhash Chandra, said that the suspect was allegedly involved in illegal plotting of land in Hindon floodplains where any kind of construction is prohibited. Chandra said that the land is notified by Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA). “The developer has been trying to buy land from the local farmer and sell them to vulnerable people at high rates after plotting. A team had visited the spot after getting information of illegal construction. He misbehaved with officials who had tried to stop illegal construction,” he said. Following this Chandra filed a complaint in Bisrakh police station. Munish Chauhan, station house officer at Bisrakh police station, said followed the complaint a case has been registered against Tripathi under Sections 430 (mischief by injury to works of irrigation or by wrongfully diverting water), Section 431 (mischief by injury to public road, bridge, river or channel) and Section 506 (criminal Intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. “We have registered a case and investigating the matter,” he said. Developer Tripathi said that he had bought the 150 square metre plot from a local farmer before the lockdown. “I had no idea that this was a floodplain area. I was fencing the property when the irrigation department officials reached and stopped the work,” he said. Tripathi alleged that the irrigation department officials asked for a bribe to allow the work. “When I refused, they filed a complaint.” He said he was yet to make an official registry of the property. Chandra denied the bribery allegation. “We have filed complaints against different colonisers for illegal constructions. This developer is making baseless allegations to escape from his wrongdoings,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/developer-booked-for-construction-on-hindon-floodplains/story-B4nzVOYjgzIT3x62HWd45J.html
13-10-2020||Noida||Ban on DG sets: Industrial units to make report card on power outages in Noida||NOIDA: The industrial bodies in Gautam Budh Nagar has said that the recent order of the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority banning diesel generator (DG) sets in the national capital region will be a “body blow” to thousands of units in the district, citing the long power cuts that take place almost every day.As a token protest against the power distribution companies (discoms), the business communities have decided to make a daily report card mentioning about the hours of power cut.Kulmani Gupta, chairman of Noida chapter of Indian Industries Association (IIA), said that all the 1,000-odd members of IIA in GB Nagar have been asked to keep a daily record of power cuts in their respective areas. “They have to face long power cuts at least thrice a day. The recent order of banning the DG sets is like a body blow to thousands of entrepreneurs here, who are already on the receiving end due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier they were operating with limited manpower and orders. Now, with the ban on DG sets, they will not be able to fulfil the supply against their limited orders,” he said. The report card will be later sent to the senior authorities of the Uttar Pradesh government, IIA officials said.Echoing similar views, Surendra Nahta, president of Micro, Small and Medium Entrepreneurs Association, Noida, said that before enforcing the ban on DG sets, the plight of industries in the post-Covid period should have been taken into account. “It is like double jeopardy to us. We also support complete ban on DG sets. But, first the respective state governments must give their undertaking in the court that they’ll ensure uninterrupted power supply in the areas – particularly declared as ‘no power cut zones’ by them, where DG sets have been banned. If the industrial units continue to face frequent power cuts and are not allowed to operate on DG sets, the entrepreneurs will no option other than to pull their shutters down,” Nahta said. Even residents are not happy with the ban on DG sets. PS Jain, president of Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Association (Conrwa), said that in the residential high-rises, use of DG sets become mandatory to run the lift and other essential services during the power cuts. “We’ve written letters to the EPCA chairman and the chief secretaries of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, to reconsider their decision. I’ve also spoken to them and they have given assurances to do the needful,” he said. Two power discoms -- Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) and Noida Power Corporation Limited (NPCL) -- are responsible to supply electricity to the different parts of the GB Nagar district. When contacted, VN Singh, Noida divisional chief engineer, PVVNL, said that elaborate arrangements are being done to ensure uninterrupted power supply in Noida. “The old wires and electric poles have already been replaced. There is no dearth of power in Noida now. Even if there is some trip in supply, our staff rectify it in no time,” he said.Despite repeated attempts, Sarnath Ganguli, vice-president (operation) of NPCL, the discom that supplies power to areas in Greater Noida, could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ban-on-dg-sets-industrial-units-to-make-report-card-on-power-outages-in-noida/story-RZjxKPxNVR8PubqkvbnxjK.html

While the main examinations are conducted in March, the supplementary exams are held in July. Students who pass the supplementary exams can thus begin their first year of college in the same academic year. This year, however, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the board results came out in July and August, respectively, and the board is yet to make an announcement on the supplementary exams. “A decision on whether the exams can be conducted and if yes, how, is yet to be taken,” said a board official.According to a letter sent to the secretaries of all divisional boards in August, the Maharashtra State Board has proposed to hold supplementary exams from October 6 to 23. The proposed schedule for Class 12 exams was October 6 to 29. However, with no announcement from the board yet, students have no clarity over the issue. “I failed my SSC exams in mathematics by just three marks, and now wish to write the paper again. But the delay in announcing the exam schedule has led to the loss of an academic year for students like me,” said Asawari Shinde, a Parel-based student. Nearly 2 lakh HSC and SSC students from the state did not clear their board exams this year. Officials at the state education department did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-worried-about-losing-a-year-as-maharashtra-state-board-yet-to-announce-schedule-for-hsc-ssc-re-exams/story-T4GdJgrLfJf8NMtrJReHqM.html

The bench was informed by advocate Uday Warunjikar — who represented the sweet sellers’ association — that the FSSAI had issued an order on February 24, mandating sweetmeat shops selling non-packaged or loose sweets to display the date of manufacturing and ‘best before’ date on the container or tray holding the sweets. Warunjikar submitted that this was the first of the three order issued by the FSSAI. The other two orders were issued on September 25 and 30. While the September 25 order reiterated the February 24 order and stated: “In the public interest and to ensure food safety, it has been decided that in case of non-packaged/loose sweets, the container/tray holding sweets at the outlet for sale should display the ‘best before’ date of the product mandatorily, with effect from October 1.” Warunjikar informed the court that while the September 30 FSSAI order clarified that the September 25 order was only pertaining to Indian sweets and local language was allowed to be used on the container in which the sweets were to be packaged, the directive was discriminatory and hence the association moved the PIL seeking setting aside of the three orders of FSSAI passed under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “The petitioner seeks to undo what the authority proposed to do for the benefit of consumers and therefore, it is thoroughly misconceived. We order the petitioner to deposit Rs1 lakh to the advocates’ Covid-19 welfare fund.” The court said that it will pass a detailed and reasoned order later and dismissed the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-dismisses-plea-of-mumbai-s-sweet-shop-owners-seeking-relaxation-of-expiry-date-rule/story-norKtDUQmnElDtn055Hd2I.html

Based on an autopsy, police said that the man was strangulated. Police said they have got vital clues in the case.Police said they recovered the body of Ajay Panchal, resident of sector-2 in Rajendra Nagar, around 4.45am on Tuesday. A preliminary investigation established that Panchal had left his cable manufacturing factory in Rajendar Nagar industrial area, 7 km from factory, at around 1pm on Monday for lunch at home, but never reached there. After he could not be contacted, the family launched a search and then approached the police on Monday night. “The autopsy on Tuesday indicated that he was strangled. We had registered a case of abduction after the family gave us a missing person complaint on Monday. We will now add the murder charge. Prima facie, it does not seem to have been a case of robbery,” said Keshav Kumar, assistant superintendent of police (Sahibabad). The family of the victim man was reluctant to speak to the media. “I have spoken to the family and they do not know why Ajay was killed. He had no enmity with anyone. There is nothing missing from his car and the family did not get any ransom call either,” said Subhash Panchal, a friend of the victim. The victim was father to two sons aged 10 and five years old and had been living in Rajendra Nagar for past 40-45 years, he added.“His mobile was missing and police are trying to trace it as part of investigation.” Late Tuesday night, the Ghaziabad police said they were looking into the role of a couple who were known to the victim. “It has come to light in investigation that the victim had willingly gone to their house. The police have scanned number of CCTVs and got vital clues,” the Ghaziabad police said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/38-year-old-factory-owner-found-murdered-in-ghaziabad/story-Lq723qMovAVklQWOv4yw3J.html

Request for proposal (RFP) for the project is being prepared at the state level. As per the officials, similar projects are being taken up in Amritsar and Jalandhar and the tenders for the same would be floated by the state government.MC superintending engineer Rahul Gagneja said, “It is expected that the tenders for the project would be floated in a week or so. It would be a major relief for the city.”Recently an MC committee, comprising civic officials and councillors, had also visited Indore to get an idea about the solid waste management in the cleanest city of the country. During their visit, the team saw the working of the C&D waste plant wherein rubble is converted into interlocking tiles, which are further used by the Indore MC. The councillors had then said they would work to implement the same in Ludhiana as well.Meanwhile, it would be a major relief for the residents as a large amount of rubble has been dumped at vacant plots and green plots across the city, including the cremation ground road at Model Town Extension, Dugri and Haibowal among other areas. The monitoring committee of National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also asked the MC to establish the plant at the earliest.Earlier, the MC had proposed Dhandari Kalan site for establishment of C&D plant and six spots were also identified in the city for dumping the rubble till the time the plant is established. But the residents and contractors continue to dump the waste at vacant plots and green belts.Karandeep Singh, a resident of Model Town Extension, said, “The green belt at the cremation ground road is filled with rubble and garbage. Despite complaints submitted with the MC, no action has been taken in this regard. The MC should establish a green belt at the site where people could come for a walk or to spend leisure time with families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-s-debris-recycling-plant-gets-state-nod-after-three-years/story-90yjaWjdWzKX7Ak5huSRvJ.html
13-10-2020||Noida||Noida parents uncomfortable about sending children to school||Despite the Uttar Pradesh government’s go-ahead on Saturday to reopen schools for students of classes 9 to 12 from October 19, parents in Gautam Budh Nagar district are apprehensive sending their children for physical classes in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Principals of a few private schools said as per a recent survey conducted by them, nearly 70% parents have expressed their unwillingness to send their children to schools, fearing coronavirus infection. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said a meeting of principals and managers of CBSE and UP Board schools has been called on Thursday to chalk out a proper plan to ensure education with health to the students . “The district has over 300 schools falling under these categories. The schools will have to take utmost care regarding the health of the students. The classes will run in two shifts and all necessary protocols, including social distancing and proper sanitisation of premises, will have to be followed by schools. Students will be allowed to attend classes only after furnishing written permission from their parents or guardians,” Suhas said. Renu Singh, principal of Amity school (Noida), said a recent survey undertaken by the school showed more than 70% parents were unwilling to send their children. “The ball is in the parents’ court now, who are still apprehensive of sending their children to schools. This is despite the fact that our campus is completely sanitised and we are following all safety protocols. We are a bit worried about our class 10 and 12 students, who will appear in board examinations in the next few months. They have yet not got any chance to attend their practical classes,” she said. Praveen Kumar, principal of Sunriseville school, Sector 25, Noida, said so far less than 20% parents have given their nod to send their children to schools. “However, we are still hopeful that parents will reconsider their decision for the sake of the academic future of their children, particularly those studying in classes 10 and 12,” he said. Kamini Bhasin, principal of DPS Noida, said it is too early to come to any conclusion. “We need time to gauge the views of the parents,” she said. Yatendra Kasana, president of the Noida parents’ association, said only 10% of the parents are ready to send their children back to school in the present scenario. “What is wrong in giving online classes to students? Yes, the schools can make special arrangements for practical classes for students of class 10 and 12, but for that they will have to give an undertaking of proper safety measures in their campus,” he said, adding if schools impose anything on students and parents, the association will protest.Suman Shekhar, whose daughter is studying in a CBSE school, said he is not willing to send her to school till the pandemic ends completely. “My daughter is in class 12 and we are comfortable with online classes. Since I’ve also arranged practicals for her at home, so there is no need to send her to a public place, where no one can guarantee that infection will not take place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-parents-uncomfortable-about-sending-children-to-school/story-bAcfd66IJNlN3NibleTTvM.html
13-10-2020||Noida||After UP govt nod, Ghaziabad administration allows schools to reopen from October 19||After a gap of nearly seven months, schools in Ghaziabad will re-open from October 19 for classes 9 to 12 on October 19. The UP government on October 10 approved re-opening schools and also sent a detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) that needed to be followed as the Covid-19 pandemic forced the country into staying indoors and protecting the children. Students will be allowed to attend only after written consent of the parents is received. They added that all the precautions like wearing masks, social distancing and sanitisation, should be strictly adhered to. “The consent form will be in a particular format for all schools. On the suggestion of parents’ associations, we have directed schools not to charge them on account of implementation of SOPs. We also directed them to get their staff tested and post the results on their websites. The schools have also been told to make available transport with all precautions,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “The schools will not conduct any immediate examinations. All the precautions will be taken up and our officers will also conduct random inspections at schools. The corporation has been directed to take up cleaning outside the schools.”Despite this, parents’ associations were not in favour of reopening schools. “We are still of the view that schools should not open. Even Delhi has decided not to open its schools till end of October. We do not understand the hurry. In coming days, the pollution will also rise and it, along with Covid-19, could prove dangerous for children,” said Seema Tyagi, chairperson of the Ghaziabad Parents’ Association.“The conditions to open schools will not be favourable till a vaccine is available. The administration or school should take up responsibility if any student contracts the infection,” said Sachin Soni, general secretary, All Schools Parents’ Association. The schools said they will take up all precautions and preventive measures as directed. “The parents’ associations raised their points and many were accepted by the district magistrate. With regard to their apprehension, we will abide by the directions given by the government. We will not charge anything extra for taking up Covid-19 prevention measures. Transport facility will be provided to students. When the parents raised the issue of responsibility, the district magistrate told them that all SOPs will be followed,” said Subhash Jain, president of Independent Schools Federation of India that has around 100 member schools. He added that all member schools got the consent of about 40-57% of parents. The management of some schools, however, they are likely to resume physical classes only later when they have enough parents’ consent. Sangeeta Hajela, principal of Delhi Public School, Indirapuram, said, “The fear of the contagion and concern for well- being of children has dominated the parents’ decisions so far. We have approximately 2000 students in classes 9 to 12, out of which parents of only 10% students gave their consent. The school will be equipped for ensuring students’ safety, but other than that it is completely upon individuals to ensure safety for themselves.”Sharmila Raheja, principal of Uttam School for Girls also said that the school is already prepared but is likely to open for classes after the festival season. “As of now, we have declared preparatory holidays for our students for about 8-9 days. Then the festivals days will come up. So, we are likely to open after the festivals end. During this time, we will also be able to assess the Covid-19 and pollution scenario which will help us take more measures for our students,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-up-govt-nod-ghaziabad-administration-allows-schools-to-reopen-from-october-19/story-rdP94BZ7d1zhiRGSZau5WP.html

The move comes after a group of residents, who had submitted their forms for membership nearly eight years ago, recently threatened to stage a protest outside the authority’s office in Sector Knowledge Park-IV. The authority will also start issuing membership cards to its members beginning October 15, officials said, adding that new applications for membership will be accepted from January 1 next year. “The authority has decided to open the integrated sports complex. But in the beginning. only a few facilities will be opened and users will have to follow social distancing norms to contain the spread of Covid-19,” said Shiv Pratap Shukla, officer on special duty, Greater Noida authority. The 39-acre sports complex in Sector Gamma II was supposed to be opened to the members in August 2016.According to the officials, in Phase 1, the members can use the facility only for jogging and walking with social distancing rules in place. In second phase beginning November 1, 2020, the members will be allowed to use badminton court, lawn tennis, football ground, basketball and volleyball courts and table tennis.

The woman is the main witness in the case.“The female friend, who is the prime witness, in the case is in police protection.

13-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh police losing battles with gangsters on another plane: Social media||Gangsters bragging about their criminal exploits, flexing their muscles, twirling their moustaches and brandishing weapons, even updating their status from behind bars... The presence of antisocial elements on social media is a problem law enforcement agencies have been grappling with for quite some time. And there’s no controlling the menace. After Sunday’s murder of Gurlal Brar, 26, student leader and close aide of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, a group loyal to slain gangster Davinder Bambiha posted a message claiming responsibility for the crime. Bishnoi’s group retaliated, announcing the beginning of a “new war.”There are many such accounts, where gangsters challenge each other and threaten targets. Sympathisers working behind the scenes“Most of the (social media) accounts are just using the names of gangsters and their sympathisers are running them. Initially, it was thought that gangsters were passing on instructions from prison but considering the frequent updates that does not seem possible,” said a senior police official on condition of anonymity.  “Gangsters most active on social media are Lawrence Bishnoi, Sampat Nehra, Bhupi Rana, Deepu Banur; and Lucky – who is believed to be heading Bambiha’s gang. Bambiha too makes an occasional appearance while the Jaipal Singh group hardly uses social media,” he added. “Bishnoi and Nehra are popular among the youngsters and to keep themselves relevant they use social media. Most of the accounts in their names are being operated from abroad. Youths are hired to update these from time to time,” the official said. Deactivating accounts no deterrent Jurisdiction issues make things difficult. “Tracking locations from where the accounts operate and people running them is not easy as multiple people have access to the accounts,” said another official. The fact that Chandigarh police has managed to get only 105 accounts blocked on various social media platforms has not acted as a deterrent as multiple new accounts have sprung up. “We have directed the cyber cell to trace the accounts from which threats (In the Brar and Bambiha case) were issued. We are scanning the accounts operational in names of various gangsters and are trying to ascertain if the persons uploading these are involved in any anti-social activity. Accordingly, action will be taken,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. Tedious process Chandigarh police have so far identified more than 250 accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter being operated in the name of gangsters and other criminals, which are run by their associates.It has been a long and tedious process to get the 105 accounts, blogs and pages blocked. Once such sites are identified the list is shared with the cyber cell of the police department which tracks the IP addresses and content uploaded and then considers the requests to deactivate the accounts. “It is very time consuming and not all requests are honoured. Only those accounts that violate the norms of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are deactivated. But getting a response from the sites is another area of concern as they keep sitting on the requests for deactivation,” say police officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-police-losing-battles-with-gangsters-on-another-plane-social-media/story-1mPoS3mR0iDI53ij2MTWNP.html

The authority has also directed warrants to be issued against the promoter to make him appear before the authority along with the requisite documents, as he has failed to appear before the authority even after being served with repeated notices.The directions were issued on the complaints of several buyers, who alleged that despite being promised delivery of flats in 2013, the project was delayed by seven years. KK Singh, a buyer, said that they were seeking penalty for the late completion of project. “Most of the buyers are end users and have suffered a lot due to the inordinate delay. They are, therefore, seeking penalty,” said Singh.Sana Realtors launched the Precision Soho Tower, a commercial project on Sohna Road in Sector 67 in 2010-11. The project was supposed to be completed by 2013, said buyers. The H-Rera bench comprising Dr KK Khandelwal, chairman, pointed out that the builder-buyer agreements between the allottees and M/s Sana Realtors Pvt. Ltd. were executed in the years, 2010 and 2011, and the possession had to be offered between 2013-14 but, till date, legal offer of possession has not been made by the promoter. He was duty bound to give possession within a period of three months to the allottees from the date of obtaining the occupancy certificate (OC).The bench of the authority has decided to issue show-cause notices to the promoter for violation of Section 17(1) of the Rera Act, and initiating proceedings against the promoter under Section 61, which states that “the promoter shall be liable to a penalty which may extend upto 5% of the estimated cost of the real estate project”The Authority has also ordered to refund the amount which has been demanded by the promoter for increasing the super area. A forensic auditor has been asked to verify the change.Pankaj Ghambir, director, Sana Realty, when asked about the matter, said that he was not aware about any such directions. “I am not aware of any such development as our lawyer could not attend the hearing on Tuesday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/h-rera-asks-developer-to-pay-3-crore-for-delayed-possession-of-flats/story-1NmuWIfuhUQeH77bv7LKwM.html
13-10-2020||Gurugram||Man held for supplying drugs to jail warder||The police on Monday night arrested a 30-year-old aide of a drug peddler lodged in Bhondsi Jail from Badhshahpur area for allegedly supplying drugs to the jail warder which were supposed to be smuggled inside the premises, said the police. According to the police, the suspect used to buy drugs through peddlers for sale in Gurugram and Rewari and was in touch with inmates lodged in Bhondsi and Rewari jails. The suspect has been identified as Dharambir alias Mota of Rewari. His brother is lodged in Bhondsi jail for allegedly smuggling drugs and is a history-sheeter. The police said Prem Chand, the jail warder, was arrested from Bhondsi Jail crossing, while receiving drugs from one Ankit Kumar. The drugs included 110 grams of sulfa and 24 grams of smack. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Mota’s brother, Inderjeet, is lodged in Bhondsi jail and is a close friend of Deepak alias Deepu, who had coordinated with the jail warder to smuggle drugs. “Inderjeet and Deepu are allegedly involved in over 10 cases of loot, drugs, assault and smuggling of mobile phones in different jails and were arrested last year from Rewari. They are lodged in the same barrack and were using the same mobile phone,” he said. Sangwan said the crime investigation unit of DLF-4 arrested Mota after his name was revealed by the warder during his two-day police remand. “Mota had bought drugs from a drug peddler who, in turn, got it from Orissa in the first week of this month. He had received call from his brother who had asked him to meet Ankit Kumar who was in touch with jail warder,” he said. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, smuggling of drugs has increased inside jail premises. According to the police, inmates are being produced before the court via video conferencing and are, therefore, unable to get drugs during their visits. Further, visitors are not allowed on the jail premises any longer, forcing inmates to look for alternate means for their supply of drugs, including coordinating with jail officials, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-held-for-supplying-drugs-to-jail-warder/story-FxI61p1AvHkptUHhD933bN.html
13-10-2020||Gurugram||Govt allows farmhouses in urban Gurugram||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has announced a policy to allow development of eco-friendly dwelling units, akin to farmhouses, in urban areas, said officials. According to the department, farmhouses that have been developed on urban and agricultural land can also be regularised under this policy, if they meet the conditions. Under the ‘low density eco-friendly housing policy’, owners of plots ranging from 2,000 square metres to 2.5 acres would be allowed to develop farmhouses in urban areas, but no commercial activity would be allowed, said officials. The permissible floor area ratio (FAR) for plots would be 0.20. Further, the ground coverage for plots between 2,000 square metres to one acre would be 20%, while 15% would be allowed for larger plots. A setback of six metres needs to be provided on each side of such properties, the policy states.Earlier, such constructions were allowed only in agriculture zones and developers had to obtain a licence for this purpose. Landowners will have to obtain a change of land use (CLU) clearance, under the scheme. As per the policy, the eco-friendly units can have only one dwelling unit, should have ample green area and owners will be allowed urban farming and horticulture. Also, a biogas plant and rainwater harvesting system have been made mandatory.The house policy assumes significance in view of the violations at a large number of farmhouses on the outskirts of the city. Recently, the DTCP had demolished around 20 farmhouses in the Aravallis. Makrand Pandurang, director, DTCP, said that the department had received a number of representations from landowners, who either owned agricultural land or undeveloped plots, which could be converted into farmhouses. “Clear rules for development of farmhouses in urban areas are outlined in the policy. Farmhouses that were developed earlier and meet the norms can be regularised,” he said. However, farmhouses in forest land and areas where urban development is not allowed will not be permitted. “This policy will generate revenue for the government and also help in maintaining low density, as only one dwelling unit is allowed,” Pandurang said. Farmers in rural areas, which are in the controlled zone, can set up such farmhouses, said Pandurang. The policy, however, stipulates that owners would not be allowed to carry out commercial activities, such as setting up banquet halls, recreation zones or religious/institutional purposes. Pools, ponds and water bodies are allowed in the farmhouses, and are excluded from the allowed FAR. The policy also allows construction of rooms, between 70 to 100 square metres, for guards.Officials said the new policy is likely to help landowners on the outskirts of the city and those who own pockets of developed sectors, where development could not be undertaken under existing policies. Experts, meanwhile, said that this policy will greatly help in curbing development of unauthorised colonies, which is rampant in the city. “A large number of landowners are turning their land into colonies as there is no other avenue to use this land. Also, it will keep a check on density of population and reduce pressure on infrastructure,” said Vinod Behl, a city-based real estate expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-allows-farmhouses-in-urban-gurugram/story-j63fzTvanJXRj06Ghypf0M.html

No arrest was made till Tuesday evening. The deceased, Netarpal Singh, was a resident of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, and had an electrical business. On Sunday, Singh and a relative were returning from Pataudi in their car, when a trio parked the scooter they were riding on in front of the car and alleged it had rammed the scooter, the police said. The incident took place adjacent to a petrol pump near a T-point on Pataudi road in Bhangrola. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The complainant alleged that the suspects confronted the victim, who was behind the wheel, and blamed him for brushing the car against their scooter. They snatched the car keys and manhandled him. During the confrontation, the suspects called at least 10 persons, who assaulted the victim with sticks and rods. He was also punched and kicked by the suspects, who then escaped.” The police said he was rushed to a private hospital in Manesar and they received information of the incident from the hospital on Sunday. “At the time of the incident, the victim was declared unfit for a statement and his relative had said that she would record her statement later, as she was not in the right frame of mind. On Monday, the victim’s nephew filed a statement and an FIR was registered at Kherki Daula police station. According to the FIR, 10 to 15 persons had attacked the victim. The accused are yet to be identified,” the police official quoted above said. The victim was referred to another private hospital on Monday, as the injuries were critical.

Earlier, on Monday, the air quality in Gurugram entered the ‘poor’ category for the first time this season, with Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 259. The air quality of other neighbouring districts, such as Karnal, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Hisar, Sonepat, Bahadurgarh and Manesar, was also described as “poor” on after AQI crossed 200 points. Experts are of the opinion that Gurugram may see cleaner air days over the next week before the full impact of stubble burning in paddy-growing states of Haryana and Punjab is felt. Speaking on the Grap measures to be implemented in the city, Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, said, “The air lab will be responsible for compiling and analysing all the data related to the enforcement of Grap measures. Further, it will also be used for monitoring CPCB’s Sameer app and ensuring that all social media complaints pertaining to garbage-burning, dumping and other pollution-related matters are resolved within a given timeline.”The setting up of the air lab is one of the several measures, the civic body would be taking from October 15 to curb pollution in the city as per the guidelines laid down the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) in its official order.“As Gurugram falls in the poor category in terms of air quality, all efforts are being made by the MCG to ensure that the air quality does not deteriorate further,” said Singh.Apart from the setting up an air lab, the MCG has directed its officials to identify road stretches that generate a high amount of dust and increase the frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and sprinkling of water. The MCG has directed its horticulture wing to sprinkle water from nearly 50 water tankers, while the fire department has been asked to use around 10 of its fire tenders for the same purpose.Further, officials have been directed to check and penalise the violations of environmental norms at construction sites, and ensure the compliance of environmental norms on MCG projects, such as construction of roads, stormwater connections, drains and sewage lines.Officials have also been directed to check burning of rubber, plastic waste, cloth waste and constitute teams to check burning of garbage and biomass waste. Further, the use of single-use plastics has also been also banned. All vehicles carrying municipal solid waste to the Bandhwari waste plant need to be covered.To ensure that all these measures are followed, the MCG has decided to carry out night patrolling for which dedicated teams have been constituted.Following Epca’s observation that municipal solid waste and construction and demolition (C&D) waste materials were found to be lying around in the city, the civic body has cleared nearly 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of waste over the last five days and has transported it to appropriate facilities for proper scientific disposal.MCG officials said that orders have been given to zone-wise executive engineers and assistant engineers to oversee the implementation of Grap measures in their respective areas. The officials are required to send a daily report on the action taken via email on grap@mcg.gov.in.The civic body has also asked councillors and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to report any instances of open burning to the MCG or any other pollution-related violations via email at grap@mcg.gov.in or calling them on their toll-free number, 18001801817. Further, RWAs have also been asked to encourage residents to use non-motorised vehicles and public transport during the winter months to reduce pollution. The civic body has advised residents to reuse wastewater, such as the water left behind by purifiers or after washing. Further, the water should be sprayed in front of houses to control dust pollution. RWAs have also been directed to provide electric heaters to their security staff members during the winter season to ensure they avoid the practise of burning of wood to keep themselves warm.Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist, said, “Open waste burning is rampant across the city, especially in urban villages and vacant plots located near Golf Course Extension Road and Gurgaon-Faridabad Road. The MCG alone does not have the adequate mechanism to ensure a round-the-clock surveillance on the issue. They should ideally create a task force, incorporating volunteers and citizen groups for a more comprehensive coverage.” BOX: Measures to control pollution:Clean roads and sprinkle water on treesIssue penalties on violations of environmental norms at construction sitesCheck and stop burning of rubber, plastic, cloth waste, garbage and biomass Ban the use of single-use plasticCover all vehicles carrying municipal solid waste to the Bandhwari waste plantClear construction and demolition waste Night patrolling of Grap measures||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-prepares-action-plan-to-implement-grap-measures/story-Pim2p1wBKih4LhFa6qPaaI.html
13-10-2020||Gurugram||97 healthcare facilities served notices for violating biomedical waste management rules||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s (HSPCB) regional office in Gurugram served show-cause notices to 97 healthcare facilities on Tuesday for failing to comply with the Centre’s Biomedical Waste Management (BMWM) Rules, 2016. Officials said that these facilities, including mid-level hospitals, private clinics, nursing homes and even laboratories, have not taken official permission from the HSPCB for collecting, storing, handling, transporting and treating hazardous disposable biomedical waste.Officials said that Tuesday’s notice was an “ultimatum” against these defaulters, all of whom have been served similar notices in the past. “After the BMWM Rules were enacted in 2016, we have served all of them at least two, if not more, notices.This year, we organised multiple ‘authorisation camps’ throughout the month of February, so that proprietors or representatives could come in to clear the formalities in the single day,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, Gurugram, adding that these camps had not seen much success.Singh said, a significant majority of these 97 healthcare facilities were also not complying with the mandatory ‘barcoding’ system, designed to track the movement of hazardous biomedical waste from facility to collection centre for disposal. However, Singh declined to identify any facilities by name. A redacted copy of the Tuesday’s show-cause notice, addressed to the healthcare facilities directly (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times), states, “In case you fail to comply with the observation, it will be presumed you have nothing to say in this regard and have accepted the status as mentioned above, which will warrant action under the provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, for the said violation (sic).”As per the rules, the punitive action includes prosecution, closure and levying of environmental compensation. Violators may also be subjected to imprisonment for a year or more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/97-healthcare-facilities-served-notices-for-violating-biomedical-waste-management-rules/story-JbOrRN1RAwuQK5bLzpv5gO.html
13-10-2020||Gurugram||Sohna shoot-out: Two more aides of gangster Sube Gujjar arrested||A week after three sharpshooters of Sube Gujjar’s gang were arrested after an exchange of gunfire with the police in Sohna, two more aides of Gujjar were arrested on Monday night. The police said the accused men were arrested after a brief chase during which they allegedly fired two gunshots at the policemen. No one was injured in the incident, said the police, adding that a countrymade gun, a cartridge and a motorcycle were seized. According to the police, the crime branch of Sector 39 was stationed at a check post on Hasanpur-Darbaripur crossing for routine inspection of passing vehicles. A motorcycle, which did not have a registration number plate, was asked to stop by the policemen. The motorcyclist, however, allegedly rammed the motorcycle into a barricade and tried to escape. The barricade and a police constable fell due to the collision, following which the policemen chased the duo in a car. The police said during the chase, the pillion rider fired two gunshots at the policemen but they missed hitting them. The suspects, identified as Jaivir and Ved Prakash, hailing from Bar Gujjar in Kherki Daula, were both held after a short chase. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Prima facie, a probe has found that they worked as informants in Sube Gujjar’s gang and passed on inputs to him on a routine basis. They conducted recee and identified certain potential targets and locations. On the directions of Gujjar, they were involved in several crimes. They were loitering in the area to potentially commit a crime before they were caught. We are checking their criminal record.” A case was registered against the suspects under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and The Arms Act at Badshahpur police station. On October 6, three sharpshooters of Gujjar’s gang — Rajesh Kumar alias Fauji, Kamal alias Kamli and Aman alias Sardar — were arrested after a shoot-out with the police, during which at least 25 gunshots were allegedly fired in Sohna. Two suspects and two policemen had suffered gunshot wounds and the police had recovered two pistols, two revolvers, a countrymade gun, 110 live cartridges, a backpack, and a motorcycle from their possession. A probe had found that the trio was part of a ‘sleeper cell’ of shooters, whom Sube had allegedly instructed to carry out a series of crimes, starting with the murder of a property dealer in Dhunela, to establish supremacy. The trio had conducted a recce for two days and assembled a cache of weapons for the murder. The other gang members in Gujjar’s gang were unaware of the recruitment of these ‘silent’ sharp shooters. Fauji, who was Gujjar’s most trusted aide, kept him informed of the gang’s activities. He had recruited the other two shooters. Sube Gujjar, a former sharpshooter of gangster Kaushal, has assumed leadership of the gang in the past one year. He has a reward of ₹5 lakh for information leading to his arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sohna-shoot-out-two-more-aides-of-gangster-sube-gujjar-arrested/story-ljL5kdSfaSdpPmPHScqNUM.html
13-10-2020||Gurugram||Plastic manufacturers in Gurugram under pollution board scanner||Manufacturers of plastic carry bags and multi-layered plastic packaging materials in Gurugram will have to register themselves with the state pollution board, at the time of seeking consent to operate and establish (CTO/CTE), or renewing older clearances.The move is aimed at identifying the number of such units in the district, following orders from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last week. Officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said that those failing to do so will be prosecuted and made to pay environmental compensation as per the Environment Protection Act, 1986.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said, “Plastic pollution is a huge challenge, especially in the winter, when so much of it is burnt. Industries need to implement the principle of extended producer responsibility (EPR), which is a part of the Centre’s Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. However, this has not yet happened on ground.”However, Singh says that authorities will be able to better enforce the EPR clause now as the environment ministry issued draft guidelines on EPR, under Plastic Waste Management Rules, in June.As per the 2016 rules, the primary responsibility for collection of used multi-layered plastic, sachets, pouches and other plastic packaging lies with the manufacturers, importers or brand owners who introduce these products in the market.“These parties, as per CPCB orders on extended producer responsibility, have to establish their own system of retrieving and processing the waste generated by their products,” said Singh.In a general direction to state pollution control boards on October 6, the CPCB called for identification of all manufacturers and brand owners introducing plastic products or packaging into the market without prior registration.All such defaulting units may be fined, prosecuted and even directed to close operations. In an annexed list, the CPCB has also included the names of 78 major manufacturers across India, who are said to have already defaulted on the EPR rules. Of these, three manufacturers are based in Gurugram.“The real number of defaulters is likely to be much higher. We may have to engage with an independent agency that will be able to assist us in identifying them. A report will be submitted to Centre in this regard soon,” said Satendar Pal, senior environment engineer, HSPCB.However, he added that the CPCB’s EPR rules with regard to plastic management were only at the draft stage at the moment. “The NGT {National Green Tribunal} has recently instructed that these rules be enacted within three months, so this work at the moment is preliminary. Plans for long-term implementation will happen only when the draft rules have been notified,” Pal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/plastic-manufacturers-in-gurugram-under-pollution-board-scanner/story-BhBgwvgjdNoxJKvqRr7AfL.html
13-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Private schools reluctant to reopen||The Haryana government’s decision to reopen schools received a mixed response from private schools in the city, with many expressing reservations over holding physical classroom sessions. The state education minister Kanwar Pal on Tuesday stated that the order will be applicable to private schools too. However, senior education officer and school principal privy to the matter confirmed that it is not mandatory for private schools to reopen. “Parents are satisfied with online classes and do not wish to send their children to school. We are focusing on online classes, with special emphasis on students who have to appear for their board exams,” said Aparna Erry, principal of DAV Public School, Sector 14. The school conducted an internal survey in September, seeking suggestions from parents on resumption of regular classes. “In the survey, we found that nearly 70% of the parents refused to send their ward to school and opted for online classes only,” said Erry. Other schools, such as Suncity School in Sector 54 and Scottish International School in Sector 57, have been holding guidance sessions for students of classes 9 to 12, who can visit schools in alloted time slots. Suncity School had issued a letter in September stating that three-hour classes, from 9am to noon, will resume on October 19 for class 12 students while guidance sessions will be held from October 22 for students of class 10.Virtual classes will continue for those who opt out of sending their children to school. The Scottish High International School has allotted slots to students who want to visit school for special classes. Sudha Goyal, director of the school said, “Online sessions and extra classes are given to the board students, and those who wish to come physically are given individual classes.” Neeti Kaushik, the principal of Mount Olympus School in Sector 47, said that she has encouraged online classes so far. She said that physical presence in schools will have a positive impact on social and emotional health, and overall well-being, of students. “I completely support the government’s decision to allow senior students to attend school while complying with all safety measures and precautions,” said Kaushik. “Online classes have been a great support but now, it is time to move beyond confines by gearing up for the challenge. Students attending school will undoubtedly be able to deal with their academics with more seriousness and sincerity. They will be able to seek guidance without barriers. Peer interaction and support is a necessity for healthy development of any adolescent,” she said.Vaibhav Kumar, a class 11 student of Suncity World School, said that he has missed physical classes and is hopeful of resumption. But Vanya Duggal, Kumar’s classmate, said, “Just because we are tired of sitting at home doesn’t mean that the pandemic is over. With cases rising every day, it will be completely irrational for schools to open. The younger generation happens to be the highest carriers of asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, and the risk of spreading the virus will only increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-private-schools-reluctant-to-reopen/story-NLxBzm7sejF7b4JcVaVzNI.html
13-10-2020||Gurugram||Govt schools set to resume classes 9 to 12||Physical classroom sessions for students of classes 9 to 12 of government schools will resume from October 15, with certain riders, state education minister Kanwar Pal said on Tuesday. Regular classes will be conducted for three hours, from 9am to noon. Attendance, however, will not be compulsory as students can voluntarily continue with online classes, which will continue alongside regular classes. Pal said that same rules would apply to private schools if they decide to reopen their premises.According to the plan, separate schedules will be created for classroom and web sessions, as per teacher availability, between 9am and noon.Although an official notification is yet to be issued, Pal said the decision has been taken in compliance with the Unlock 5 guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs. “Even though regular classes will resume for a few hours, students who cannot attend classes physically will not be marked absent. Online classes will continue the same way and students can attend that as well,” he said.To ensure that the safety of the students is not compromised, Pal said a maximum of 20 students will be accommodated in a classroom. “If, for a particular class, the number of students is more, the class will be divided into two sections and accordingly schools will make their own arrangements and time tables based on the number of students and the availability of classrooms,” Pal said.Pal said that they are targeting an attendance of around 50% of students and that a consent letter from parents or guardians is not necessary for the same as per fresh guidelines.The Unlock 4 guidelines had made a consent letter mandatory, which has been done away with under the new rules.“From October 15, consent letter is not required since classes will be held regularly. It is expected that attendance in schools will increase as compared to the guidance classes. We will see how schools function after they reopen. If the process remains smooth, then by November, regular classes will start for students of classes 6 to 8,” he said. Principals are of the opinion that it will take up to 15 days after reopening to achieve 40-50% attendance. Sunil Kumar, principal of Senior Secondary Government School, Jacobpura, said, “Children will take some time to get back. If no Covid-19 cases are reported among teachers or students in the school, it is likely attendance will reach to at least 40% in 15 days and almost 90% in a month.”To ensure smooth functioning of the schools, Kumar said that arrangements are being made to ensure social distancing within classrooms. “A distance of two feet is being maintained between two benches. A single classroom will accommodate a minimum of 12 and maximum of 20 students, based on the size of the room. Besides, temperatures will be checked at the entry and students will have to apply sanitisers and wear masks to avoid contracting any infection,” said Kumar. Similar arrangements are being made at the Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, according to Suman Sharma, the principal of the school. “There will be separate entry and exit points for students to enter the school premises. To avoid crowding at the time of entrance, circles have been made for students to stand until they can enter. Posters have also been prepared to advise students about not sharing their belongings and maintaining social distance.”Mahavir Singh, additional chief secretary, school education, said that schools will have to follow guidelines similar to those issued for guidance sessions. Schools falling under defined containment zones will remain closed. Only asymptomatic teachers or students will be allowed to enter, based on the thermal screening at the entrance. Activities such as assemblies, sports and events, which lead to crowding will not be allowed.Suman kadiyan , mother of a class 12 student, favours sending her daughter to school. She said, “Personal interaction in regular classes makes a child attentive. There can be doubts related to the subject which need to be addressed on a regular basis. It is only possible only through regular classes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-schools-set-to-resume-classes-9-to-12/story-nsvFsidRqX9mTFeRjKiZvN.html

HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION FROM NOVEMBER The research scholars have been demanding the reopening of labs and libraries. They have also been pressing the university for hostel accommodation. Now the university has agreed to provide hostel accommodation to research scholars in a phased manner from November. As four hostels of the varsity are Covid care centers of Chandigarh administration, providing hostel accommodation for students, has been an issue. “We will collect the data of research scholars and hostels to see how we can arrange their accommodation. We have to keep in view the safety of students as well. We will distribute the research scholars to different hostels after analyzing the data,” said an official on condition of anonymity. It has also been decided that research scholars who are already staying in hostels will not be asked to vacate and, the decision of opening the library will be taken in a week.

Against an air quality index (AQI) of 304 in Delhi, Punjab’s Mandi Gobindgarh—an industrial town—has 175, which falls in the medium category.“The Delhi’s AQI has worsened, while Punjab air is still comparatively clean. This indicates that stubble burning of Punjab has no role in affecting Delhi air quality. It’s wrong to blame Punjab for poor air quality of the national capital,” said Krunesh Garg, secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board.Amritsar, which has recorded highest farm fires in the state, has AQI of 131. Even the other major towns have the AQI below 150.The average AQI of Delhi is 261 while that of Punjab is 120.Even the prominent cities of Haryana has much better AQI than Delhi, said a PPCB official monitoring the air quality. “The AQI of Punjab and Haryana should deteriorate too if Delhi’s was affected due to farm fires as being claimed. Farm fires will first affect local air,” he said.However, PPCB officials admitted that the stubble burning is affecting the air quality in the state. “We have appealed to the farmers to desist from this illegal practice. We are challaning the erring farmers,” he said.The official said the wind is toward Pakistan and not in the direction of Delhi.---AQI in Punjab (Tuesday)Mandi Gobindgarh 175Ludhiana 160Jalandhar 159Khanna 145Amritsar 131Bathinda 129Patiala 125Ropar 85--- ScaleBetween 0 and 50: Good51 and 100: Satisfactory101 and 200: Medium201 and 300: Bad301 and 400: Very poor401 and 500: Serious||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-has-better-air-delhi-blaming-state-for-very-poor-aqi-wrong-ppcb/story-tqojRFCMqpoIOuj28Kh4fP.html
13-10-2020||Patna||Special Investigation Team constituted to probe Buxar gang-rape and murder case||A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up to probe the case of gang-rape of a 35-year-old Dalit woman in Bihar’s Buxar by seven accused. The accused also strangulated and killed the victim’s five-year-old son at a village under Murar police station. As the accused continued to evade arrest three days after the incident, the Buxar police constituted an SIT in the case on Tuesday. The victim’s father said she could have been raped by six to seven men. The father hit out at the police for allegedly failing to take action in the case and said his daughter was traumatised even as the accused “were roaming freely” after the incident. Different police teams had been constituted which were conducting the raids to nab the accused, an official of the Buxar police said. “We are conducting raids and hope to make the arrests soon,” said Buxar Superintendent of Police (SP) Niraj Kumar Singh. He said that the woman recorded her statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) before the court of judicial magistrate. The investigating officer of the case, Nitu Priya, informed that in her statement, the victim supports FIR’s allegation. Jitendra Nath, a civil surgeon in Buxar, said a medical team comprising two women doctor conducted her medical examination and the result is awaited. Meanwhile, in Danapur gang-rape case, police are yet to arrest the main culprit, who along with three others, raped a minor girl inside the godown in Lekhanagar.“An accused is still evading arrest and raids were on to nab him,” said station house officer (SHO) Ajit Kumar Saha. The SHO said forensic experts were also roped in who examined the spot to help with the investigation.This is the second gang-rape incident surfacing before the Patna police in 24 hours. Earlier, a gang-rape case of a scheduled caste minor girl had surfaced at Fatuha in rural Patna on Friday night in which four accused were arrested but one was evading the arrest. The incident evoked sharp reaction from the Opposition with former deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav alleging a complete breakdown of the law and order situation in the state. “The government talks about ‘Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao’ but is this the price we have to pay for getting our daughters educated? The accused are roaming freely but the police have failed to nab them,” he told reporters. BSP chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati expressed concern over the incident and on the rise in rape cases in Bihar. Mayawati’s statement assumes significance as it may become a poll issue. Some constituencies, like Buxar, have a sizable number of BSP supporters. The state Crime Records Bureau statistics revealed that a total of 825 rape cases were lodged in Bihar between January and July this year. The highest number of cases, 152, was registered in June. In July, 149 incidents of rape were recorded. Authoritative sources said 1,450 rape incidents were reported in the state in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/special-investigation-team-constituted-to-probe-buxar-gang-rape-and-murder-case/story-Z4LwbPk3CkIVxmWK1q48kL.html

More tests for both the diseases are being conducted.” The ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday asked all secondary and tertiary level hospitals of all states and Union Territories to prepare for severe dengue and Covid case surge. “Mild to moderate dengue and Covid coinfected patients should be monitored closely, preferably at the hospital, as they may rapidly deteriorate to severe stage.

The Congress’ block units of Manali and Lahaul-Spiti have filed two different FIRs at police stations in Keylong and Manali, seeking investigation into the missing foundation stone. The stone had been laid in the presence of Congress leader Virbhadra Singh and former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, at tunnel’s south portal at Dhundhi in June 2010. The Congress leaders alleged that Sonia Gandhi’s plaque was deliberately removed and the administration was tight-lipped on the matter. When contacted, Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh said investigations are underway, however, he refused to comment further. The chief engineer of Rohtang tunnel (renamed as Atal tunnel), KP Purushothaman told Hindustan Times that the stone was lying with the BRO. “The stone was temporarily installed on the roadside at that time. The site had to be developed so it was removed. It’s lying in safe custody,” he said. On being asked if the stone would be reinstalled, Purushothaman did not comment. Kuldeep Rathore writes to CM Meanwhile, the grand old party’s state unit chief Kuldeep Rathore has written to Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur demanding the reinstallation of the foundation stone. Rathore threatened to launch a statewide stir if the government failed to reinstall it within 15 days. “The government removed the stone under a well-planned strategy. The BJP leaders are giving credit to NDA for the tunnel but it’s a fact that the work on the tunnel started during the UPA regime and Sonia Gandhi had laid the foundation stone,” said Rathore. Rathore has also written to director general of police Sanjay Kundu over the issue. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party’s state president and MP Suresh Kashyap rebutted the Congress’ allegations. “It is a matter of pride for Himachal that the Atal Tunnel has a record for becoming the highest high-altitude highway tunnel in the world. It will boost tourism in remote regions of Lahaul-Spiti and Leh and will provide all-weather connectivity,” he said, adding, “It was the Virbhadra Singh government that had replaced the foundation stones of many projects and developmental works started during the Prem Kumar Dhumal regime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/foundation-stone-laid-by-sonia-gandhi-at-atal-tunnel-is-safe-with-us-bro/story-vlvqAAL7ROSqOoVbr7e0CP.html

Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth said the railway track is very important for Shimla and is likely to help in providing a much needed boost to the tourism and hospitality sector. “In the last six months, tourism industry has witnessed massive losses due to the pandemic and it will take a little time to get things back to normal,” he said.Built in 1903 during the British Era, Kalka-Shimla railway track is 96km long and goes through 18 railway stations, over 880 bridges and more than 100 tunnels.

The Instrument of Accession was signed by the Maharaja in Karan Palace in Jammu on October 26, 1947 which was brought by then Union secretary from Delhi. Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947 which was taken back to Delhi for acceptance by the Governor-General of India, who approved and signed it in the early hours of October 27, 1947. Jammu and Kashmir acceded to the Union of India on October 27,” he said in a statement.Singh said an organising committee of Accession Day has decided to celebrate the historic day on October 27 at various places in India as well as in Jammu and Kashmir. He expressed hope that the leadership will join hands to pay homage to Maharaja Hari Singh who signed the Instrument of Accession. Singh also described the nullification of Article 370 by the Centre as half-baked approach since the Parliament had not approved/accepted the Instrument of Accession. “This is an unfortunate situation which enemies of India can exploit internationally. The leaders in India, particularly the Parliament, has not been briefed properly on the situation and the need to integrate Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country. Instead, statehood of J&K has been demolished by converting it into a Union territory. This will not be fruitful for the integration of J&K with the Union of India,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-accession-day-will-be-celebrated-on-october-27-panther-party/story-bBGw8Dm8SIn7S866NBj3WM.html

Addressing media persons here, president of the Sikh Progressive Front (SPF) Balvinder Singh expressed concern over the “step motherly treatment to the micro minority Sikh community of J&K”. Singh said the discriminatory attitude of the BJP-PDP alliance was first observed in 2017, when with an intention to debar the educated Sikh youth from the package of special drive for non migrant Kashmiri, they amended the J&K Migrant (Special Drive) Recruitment Rules 2009 in terms of SRO 425 and added a clause stating that non migrant Kashmiri means “Kashmiri Pandit”. “There is no doubt that Kashmiri Pandits deserved all the benefits due to their miseries and sufferings but it is unfortunate that Sikhs who didn’t migrate were excluded from it,” he added. He said while constituting Public Service Commission, the present UT administration deceived the Sikh community by not including their member in it. Two other leaders S Manjit Singh and S Harmohinder Singh said the community was also totally neglected when Punjabi was not included in the J&K Official Languages Bill 2020.They also cited other instances and urged L-G Manoj Sinha to put an end to such type of discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikhs-in-j-k-want-end-to-step-motherly-treatment/story-NeqpW6wGpdae4geduJQSUJ.html

13-10-2020||Kolkata||Powerful explosion jolts local club in Kolkata, BJP demands NIA probe||A powerful explosion in a local club, located in the midst of a crowded residential neighbourhood in eastern-suburban Kolkata, early on Tuesday morning sent a shockwave among the residents.Even though none was injured, the Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the incident alleging that huge amount of explosives were stored in the Trinamool Congress-backed club to create trouble ahead of 2021 assembly elections. The TMC has, however, rubbished the allegations.Police suspect some kind of explosive was stored in the room as splinter-like objects were found from the spot.“We are investigating the matter. The dog squad and the forensic teams are assisting us in the investigation. The nature of the blast will be known after the forensic report,” said Ajay Prasad, deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) of Kolkata Police. It was around 6:30 – 7 am on Tuesday when the residents of Beliaghata were jolted out of their sleep by a deafening noise. The club’s room was badly damaged and there was smoke all over. “We saw that a wall of the room, located on the second floor, had collapsed and the asbestos roof of the club was ripped off,” said Sukhdeb Das, a resident.Also read: Bihar polls - Amid rumour-mongering, all eyes on Cong’s apex poll body meetThe club is located at a stone’s throw from Gandhi Bhavan, a single-storied British-era house where ‘father of the nation’, Mahatma Gandhi, had stayed between August 13 and September 7, 1947.“The TMC is trying to create trouble in West Bengal. Today we got the proof of that when there was a huge explosion in a local club. It is being apprehended that huge quantities of explosive were hidden there,” tweeted Kailash Vijayvargiya, national general secretary of the BJP.BJP MP Locket Chatterjee, who went to visit the spot late in the evening but was stopped by the police, demanded an NIA probe. “The CM is distributing Rs 50,000 to all clubs before the puja to make bombs. The club members were testing the materials,” she added. “Police are looking into the matter. It has been brought to the chief minister’s notice. They (the BJP) have gone insane and are saying all rubbish,” said Firhad Hakim, state urban development minister.Even though club members claimed that they have seen at least two men running away from the spot soon after the explosion and outsiders may have hurled bombs, police suspect some kind of explosive was stored inside the room.“Some locals said that they saw at least two men running away from the spot. Their faces were covered. We are a very popular club and some people want to malign us,” said Arnab Dey, member of the local club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/powerful-explosion-jolts-local-club-in-kolkata-bjp-demands-nia-probe/story-T7UfhLtq723NEvcGHidm0K.html

13-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police issue show cause notice to Republic’s Arnab Goswami||The Mumbai Police has sent a show cause notice to Republic Television editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami asking him why a chapter proceeding under Section 108 of the Criminal Procedure Code should not be initiated against him.Sudhir Jambavdekar, assistant commissioner of police (Worli division) who has sent the notice, has asked Goswami to remain present before him on October 16. The notice (HT has a copy) refers to objectionable coverage of two incidents-- lynching of sadhus in Palghar district, and the issue of Bandra migrants gathering during lockdown-- and states that Goswami and his channel gave communal colour to the incidents and tried to incite communal tension between Hindu and Muslims. Goswami has two FIRs registered against him in Mumbai. One has been registered at NM Joshi Marg police station earlier while the other is at the Pydhonie police station. Both the offences indicate similar allegations against Goswami of inciting hatred and communal tension between two religious groups or communities.Senior inspector of the NM Joshi Marg police station sent a proposal to the ACP seeking preventive action against Goswami. Acting on the proposal the ACP initiated the process.ACP Jambavdekar, a special executive magistrate, confirmed the development, but refused to comment.The notice states that Goswami’s channel spread communal tension and it can be easily seen from the extremely abusive, communal and hateful comments from the viewers of videos of the shows on YouTube.Goswami will have to appear before the ACP and give satisfactory reasons on why such preventive action should not be taken against him.If the ACP does not find his response satisfactory then he can initiate chapter proceedings against Goswami. Once that happens, Goswami will have to sign a legal security bond for good behaviour for a year (if he violates the bond then he would have to pay penalty of Rs 10 lakh). He would also have to pledge not to indulge in any act of dissemination of seditious matter. He would have to take along a person as security who would take responsibility of his behaviour for the duration of the bond.The three page notice was issued on October 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-issues-show-cause-notice-to-republic-s-arnab-goswami/story-tgLVkToNhfRTh2O1hp69RP.html

13-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Amid rumour-mongering, all eyes on Congress’ apex poll body meet on Wednesday||With allegations of ‘tainted and misfit’ leaders getting preference in selection of candidates by the Congress party for Bihar assembly polls, all eyes are now on the central election committee (CEC) meeting scheduled to be held in New Delhi on Wednesday. The CEC, leaders said, is expected to scrutinise the candidature of leaders selected by the screening committee headed by former AICC general secretary Avinash Pande for fielding them as the party nominees in the wake of allegations of foul play in the selection. On the last-minute intervention of the CEC, chaired by AICC chief Sonia Gandhi, the party had replaced its candidate for Tikari assembly seat in Gaya and fielded Sumant Kumar in place of Ashok Gagan, going to the polls in the first phase. The apex selection body of the Congress, however, did not take note of selection of candidates like Nitu Kumar, who is involved in 18 criminal cases including that of murder and kidnapping, and Lalan Yadav, involved in a case of forgery to the tune of Rs 80 lakh, contesting from Hisua (Nawada) and Sultanganj (Bhagalpur). Also read: In ‘Festival Special’ services, railways to run 392 more trainsDoubts prevail over participation of Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Sadanand Singh in the scheduled CEC. Singh returned to Patna on Tuesday, a day ahead of the CEC, citing electoral necessities for his home constituency of Kahalgaon. Singh’s son Subhanand Mukuesh is taking the plunge into electoral politics from the seat vacated by his father. Meanwhile, speculations flew thick and fast regarding dropping of the names of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha and the CLP leader from the CEC. Jha, however, dismissed the report as fabricated, aimed to malign the image of the Congress at the behest of rival parties. “I am going to Delhi to attend the CEC,” said Jha. The state party chief and the CLP are part of the CEC as it shortlists the candidates to be fielded in any assembly or parliamentary elections. Singh, however, could not be contacted for his comments. A section of the BPCC leaders claimed that the CEC has decided to scrutinise the list of candidates finalised for the second and final phases of elections in view of continued protests by the party leaders at the AICC and BPCC offices. AICC in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil, along with Pandey and other top leaders from Bihar, were accused of doling out tickets to incompetent and tainted leaders. A senior AICC leader said that the CEC, which has already shortlisted 46 candidates in its meeting on October 6, would select the candidates for the rest 24 seats. The Congress has been allotted 70 out of 243 seats under the Grand Alliance (GA), comprising the RJD and the Left parties. The AICC had announced names of 21 contestants for the first phase of elections, slated for October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-amid-rumour-mongering-all-eyes-on-congress-apex-poll-body-meet-on-wednesday/story-nXtffWOhdyj9fF5zRYzXDM.html

13-10-2020||Dehradun||Only 7.8% of industrial units in Uttarakhand paid workers during Covid-19 lockdown||Only 271 units, around 7.8 percent, of the total 3,432 industrial units in Uttarakhand paid salaries to their workers during the Covid-19 lockdown period, revealed state labour department data. The data has come out in contrast to the Centre’s direction that no industrial unit would deduct or hold salary of any of its workers during the lockdown, rather pay them in full. According to the data, of the total 3432 industrial units in Uttarakhand with 6.81 lakh workers, only 271 units paid salaries to their 43,612 workers. Of the total, 3,161 units didn’t pay salaries to 6.37 lakh workers. The data also revealed that in Haridwar district, which hosts the maximum number of industrial units - 1,436 with 3.28 lakh workers - only 101 units paid salaries to 20,760 workers. US Nagar, which has the second-highest number of industrial units - 1,186 with 2.37 lakh workers - only 77 paid salaries to their 13,536 workers. Also read: ‘Media trial causing great damage to judiciary’ - Attorney General KK VenugopalIn Dehradun district, which has 550 units with 77,875 workers, only 65 of the total industrial units paid salaries to 574 workers. Similarly, Nainital district, which has 139 industrial units with 19,977 workers, salaries were paid only to 150 workers in just two industrial units. Labour commissioner of the state, Dipti Singh said, “It was compiled by receiving information from the industrial units which paid salaries to their workers.” “Those units which didn’t share the data with us were deemed not to have paid the salaries,” said Singh. The trade unions of the state have reacted sharply to the data, terming it “high handedness of the industrial units.” Lekhraj, state general secretary, Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said, “The condemnable act of not paying the salaries to the workers amid lockdown is absolutely against PM Modi’s directions to all the industries on paying full salary to the workers during the lockdown.” “These figures prove that only a few industrial units paid heed to the PM while others left the workers on their own in this difficult situation. We will soon hold large scale protests against the industries,” he said. On taking action against industries who didn’t pay the salaries, Singh said, “We could only take any action if any worker complained about not been paid. So far we haven’t received any such complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/only-7-8-of-industrial-units-in-uttarakhand-paid-workers-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-njbtkGuU8RTEjdqihzvVRK.html

Health experts fear that the combination of dengue with Covid-19 can enhance the severity of both the diseases as there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for both and the treatment mostly depends on only clinical conditions and symptoms. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) wing of the Punjab health department has already recorded 2,600 dengue cases and 19 deaths in the past five months. This season, most of the cases have been reported in Ludhiana, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur and Hoshiarpur districts. Nearly 10,400 cases of dengue were recorded in Punjab in 2019. “The cases of Covid-19 and dengue co-infections in Punjab are rising and the state health department is dedicatedly working to control it. Till now, 9 patients in the state, who were suffering from both the diseases, have died during the treatment. Of the 9 patients, 4 belonged to Ludhiana, 2 from Hoshiarpur, and one each from Moga, Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib. The department, at present, does not have a data of total number of people suffering from co-infection in Punjab but since the cases are increasing, we have asked the district officers to submit the data to the state,” state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said. He said the state also recorded two cases of Covid-19 and malaria co-infection and both patients have recovered from the diseases. “Covid-19 proves fatal when combined with any other diseases or co-morbidities and since people suffering from Covid-19, dengue or malaria, suffer from common symptoms, we urge people to get tested for both the diseases as early detection can help them recover,” he said. A senior health official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Since major focus of the health department, at present, is on combating the Covid-19, the dengue testing in the state is low. When compared with last year, Punjab conducted only 60% of the dengue tests this season, amid the Covid outbreak. Also, most of the health workers have been assigned Covid-19 related duties.” Also, the Punjab health department is planning to make Covid-19 test compulsory for the dengue patient and vice-versa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-and-dengue-co-infections-add-to-worries-of-punjab-health-officials/story-P1Do0l8h04bjaxILoQK9gN.html

Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the violation came to the fore during checking by joint teams of the agriculture department and Punjab Pollution Control Board. The combine was seized and the violator, Balwinder Singh, told to deposit the fine within stipulated time, he said.The super straw management system attached with a combine chops the paddy straw into very minute pieces, and holds the potential to do away with stubble burning, as other machines can directly sow wheat seedlings while ploughing the existing residue in the field. Dayalan called upon farmers and combine operators to shun stubble burning by adopting new hi-tech technologies. He has already issued prohibitory orders against use of combine harvesters without the super straw management system. The violators have to pay environmental compensation of ₹50,000, ₹75,000, and ₹1 lakh for the first, second and subsequent offences, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/combine-sans-straw-management-system-impounded-50k-fine-imposed-on-mohali-farmer/story-TQq3iZrMZt13EHxWbkRGyI.html

13-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: RSS Vijayadashami event in Nagpur to be low-key||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has decided to celebrate Vijayadashami, which is the most awaited event in its annual calendar, in a low-profile manner this year because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Earlier in March, the RSS had suspended its three-day annual meeting of the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the top decision-making body of the right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation, in Bengaluru. Also read: World looking up to Indian ways of life amid Covid pandemic, says Mohan BhagwatThe Vijayadashami programme is significant for the RSS, as the organisation was founded on this day by Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar in Nagpur in 1925. As per the norm, the RSS chief makes a customary speech after a parade of swayamsevaks and shastra pujan (worship of weapons), which is often seen as a pointer to the way its affiliate organisations and political offshoots will function in the following year. This year’s Vijayadashami, which falls on October 25, will be held days ahead of the three-phase Bihar assembly elections and a clutch of by-elections.Bihar goes to polls on October 28, November 3 and 7 and by-elections to around 60 seats in several states, including Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP), will also be held in early November.RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech will be keenly watched by both Sangh supporters and the opposition. The speech assumes significance in view of a raft of assembly elections that will be held in the middle of next year in states such as West Bengal (WB), Assam, Tamil Nadu (TN) and Kerala. Political parties and experts are eager to get a sense about how Bhagwat reacts to the construction of the Ram temple following the Supreme Court’s (SC) judgement last year and the killing of seers and Hindu priests in some parts of the country such as in Maharashtra’s Palghar district in April. It is also a matter of interest how he would address issues such as women’s safety in the backdrop of the alleged gang-rape and murder of a Dalit teenager (19) by four upper caste men in western UP’s Hathras district in September.Sameer Gautam, a veteran RSS member, said that the Sangh would adhere to the Centre’s government’s Covid-19 guidelines and norms while organising the Vijayadashami programme at Reshimbagh ground in Nagpur on October 25. Around 50 prominent people, mostly from the Sangh parivaar, would be invited to the programme, while the annual swayamsevak parade would be cancelled, he said. “However, Bhagwat will perform the shastra pujan and deliver his customary speech on the occasion,” Gautam said. The concept of annual chief guest at the annual Vijayadashami celebrations would likely be done away this year, he added. Dr Hedgewar had founded the RSS with a vision to infuse the Hindu community with new physical strength through military training. He had propounded that the struggle against the British Raj lacked a “sense of moral purpose and Hindu nationalism,” and that the Indian National Congress (INC) had no “positive vision of a Hindu nation”. He had urged that was the duty of every practicing Hindu to do his best to consolidate the society. The RSS has emerged as a power centre through the years. For instance, in October 2014, Eknath Khadse, the strongman of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is considered to trace its ideological moorings to the RSS, was overlooked for the coveted Maharashtra chief minister’s post. Instead, the Sangh had backed Devendra Fadnavis for the top political top job in the state. This was not the first time, when the RSS had dictated terms. The RSS had also thrown its lot behind Manohar Lal Khattar, a former full-time pracharak, as its choice for the Haryana CM in 2014. Earlier in 2009, it had pushed for anointing Nitin Gadkari, a hard core swayamsevak, as the national president of the BJP. A strong visible RSS imprint was evident in the choice of Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of the country in 2014 along with his council of ministers. A similar trend was also apparent during PM Modi’s second consecutive term last year. In a separate announcement, no programmes would be held at Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur on Vijayadashami on October 25 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Vilas Godghate, one of the working committee members of Deekshabhoomi Trust. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar had embraced Buddhism with thousands of his Dalit followers on the occasion of Vijayadashami at Deekshabhoomi in 1956. “All programmes have been cancelled on October 25 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The public should stay at home and offer Buddha vandana and salutations to Dr Ambedkar,” Godghate said. Lakhs of followers visit Deekshabhoomi on the occasion of Vijayadashami to pay their homage to Dr Ambedkar and Lord Buddha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-rss-vijayadashami-event-in-nagpur-to-be-low-key/story-pQ7QBrG2ARKgvMZL4OymxN.html
13-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: BJP stages protests seeking reopening of temples in Maharashtra||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra staged protests across the state on Tuesday demanding reopening of temples amid coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. BJP workers gathered in large numbers and staged protests in front of temples in Mumbai and other parts of the state. They also criticised the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and alleged that the latter could reopen restaurants and bars despite the contagion, but not temples. BJP workers shouted slogans against the state government while flouting the protocol to maintain social distancing that has been enforced because of the viral outbreak.The agitations were reported from some of the prominent temples in the state such as Siddhivinayak temple at Prabhadevi in Mumbai; Sai Baba temple in Shirdi; Tambdi Jogeshwari temple in Pune; and Vitthal Rakhumai Temple in Pandharpur.At the Siddhivinayak temple, the BJP supporters performed a symbolic aarti in front of the shrine. “The state government has reopened restaurants, bars and wine shops but it is not allowing the temples to reopen. They are playing with the sentiments of the devotees,” alleged BJP’s Pravin Darekar, who is also the leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra state legislative council. He blamed the government for non-compliance of social distancing norms, as he alleged that the latter was responsible for inciting the public to take to the streets.At the Tambdi Jogeshwari temple, the BJP made a person dress up as Kumbhakarna, who could be seen sleeping on a road. The BJP likened the Uddhav Thackeray-led government to Kumbhakarna and asked the state authorities to accede to their demand of reopening temples.On Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said that the government was cautious in reopening temples because of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. He had stated it was the responsibility of the state government to ensure the safety of the public unlike his political rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-bjp-stages-protests-seeking-reopening-of-temples-in-maharashtra/story-FejWwCXAK4z1iQUKPGA2RK.html
13-10-2020||City||Central team warns of possible second wave in Pune during Dec-Jan||Pune: Even as state health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday indicated that Covid-19 lockdown restrictions will be lifted completely in Maharashtra by the end of November, a central team of medical experts has advised the administration to be prepared for a possible second wave during December-January. According to Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) new health chief Dr Ashish Bharti, the central team was in Pune for a three-day visit in the second week of October. The medical experts warned of a second spike mainly due to unlock and upcoming festival season. The central team concluded its visit on Saturday. Bharti said, “As the coronavirus is relatively new, we cannot predict its behaviour in winter season. In winter regions like Kashmir and other countries the cases are less.” The central team, including All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) professor Dr Arvind Kushwaha and assistant professor Sitikanta Banerjee visited Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and rural areas. A PMC official on condition of anonymity said that the city saw a rise in cases during September with daily case count touching 2,200. “Though cases are coming down, chances of a second wave cannot be ruled out,” the official said. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “There was a definite rise in cases post Ganesh festival as residents started coming out of homes and meeting people. The two to three weeks post the festival saw a spike in cases and additional pressure on health machinery.” Rao has warned residents to strictly follow prevention norms during Navratri and Diwali. PMC assistant health officer Dr Sanjeev Wavare said, “The history of pandemics like flu and other diseases show second or third wave. Hence, the central team has alerted of a possible second wave. It may or may not come. Residents have to follow norms like hand sanitisation, mask and social distancing to check the second wave.” A PMC health office said that the civic administration has made adequate arrangement for oxygen and ventilator beds to tackle the possible second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/central-team-warns-of-possible-second-wave-in-pune-during-dec-jan/story-b5JpohUJvs1FG4fntUR35J.html

We have been pursuing this for the last ten years. We want this service to resume as many people want to go to Europe,” Banerjee said on Tuesday. Also read: West Bengal government brings back Kolkata’s iconic double decker busesAir India had started a direct flight between Kolkata and London in 2005. The services were, however, discontinued in September 2008 because of poor load factor. British airways, too, moved out of the sector in March 2009. Direct flights resumed under the Vande Bharat Mission with the first one, carrying 14 passengers, landing in Kolkata on September 17. “There is, however, a problem, I have been told. As passengers need to undergo a Covid test in London, it is taking time and flight seats are not getting filled up. If they (London authorities) can at least sanitise the plane, we can conduct rapid test of the passengers once they arrive in Kolkata. Covid patients would be shifted to safe house and hospitals. If we give these facilities, more passengers can come. We want the direct flight to continue as there is a huge demand,” Banerjee said. Authorities said the Vande Bharat flights were leaving London for Kolkata every Wednesday and Saturday and the return flights were leaving Kolkata for Heathrow every Thursday and Sunday. The Vande Bharat services are expected to continue till October 24. “Only two flights (under Vande Bharat) are operating every week. We want this to become permanent as Kolkata is a gateway to the northeast and there is a huge demand,” the chief minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/resume-kolkata-london-direct-flights-bengal-cm-urges-union-civil-aviation-ministry/story-j9z4VzXQ71ZuMbPgg7DddL.html

The civic administration says that the fatality ratio in the industrial town is less due to more testing and early tracking of Covid-19 patients.“More testing and early tracking of patients are two reasons because of which we have managed to keep the case fatality rate low at 1.4 per cent. We are also constantly upgrading our health infrastructure,” said Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer, PCMC.Currently, the case fatality rate of rural Pune is 1.99 per cent.“There are differences in geographical area and population, that’s why the case fatality rate in Pune is 2.25 per cent. Whether it is PMC or PCMC all Covid warriors are taking great efforts in the fight against the virus,” said Salve.In PCMC, the first person to be infected with Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection was detected on March 10. Currently, every week PCMC is conducting 26,000 tests.As of Monday, the Pimpri-Chinchwad has 71 Covid dedicated hospitals and Covid care centres and 6,901 beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients. While it has 1,872 oxygen beds and 714 ICU beds.In April and May, not many cases were reported although it surged in June, July, August and September.“We managed to control the increasing Covid case rate from mid-September and now positivity rate is around 15 per cent,” added Salve.On Monday, 226 people were tested positive for the virus and five deaths were reported which took the total number of positive cases to 81,057 and total deaths to 1,134 in Pimpri-Chinchwad.“Our focus is on bring case fatality rate below 1 per cent. Currently, less new cases are detected which is a good sign. If people continue to follow norms during the upcoming festive season then decline in Covid cases will continue. Still, people need to be careful and take precautions,” he said.“Even when the positive rate was 21.59 per cent in last week of September the case fatality rate was 1.71 per cent,” he said.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, state health department, said, “The difference between case fatality rate in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad is minimal.

13-10-2020||Pune||Experts raise doubts over state’s ‘My Family my Responsibility’ campaign||In a bid to make the fight against Covid-19 stronger, Maharashtra government in September started door-to-door health check-ups under the campaign ‘My family, my responsibility’. However, the campaign has come under criticism of activists and public representatives who have called it “misleading” and “flawed” in its implementation. In the first phase of the initiative, the state government had set a target of reaching 2.25 crore families across Maharashtra twice a month, with the help of NGOs, elected representatives and college students. Volunteers have been appointed by the health department for undertaking a door-to-door survey and test temperature and oxygen levels of people.Almost a month into the campaign, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole has called the campaign as misleading and said that it does not render a clear picture of the pandemic in the city, a claim the district administration has denied. “The concept of the campaign is good, but it is somehow flawed as not every family member is screened by staff and volunteers of this campaign. The information obtained from a family member is verbal and there is no system to confirm the information received. The family might provide vague information on blood pressure, fever, and diabetes. The Covid outbreak in the city cannot be predicted due to such faulty campaign,” said Shirole. Besides the current initiative, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has also undertaken a door-to-door survey in the city and has completed multiple rounds. He stated that about 1,068 employees and 2,116 volunteers were appointed for this work to do the door-to-door survey of the campaign. They have approached about 9,42,000 houses and checked about 29,83,000 citizens. Of this, 1,226 coronavirus-infected patients were found in a fortnight while about a thousand or 1,500 new patients are being found in Pune every day. “The door-to-door inspection campaign seems too good to be true, it is misleading,” added Shirole. Contradicting the administration, health activist Vaishali Patkar, president of the Aundh Vikas Mandal who is working as a Covid warrior since the lockdown started, said, “The ground reality of this campaign is different, in most of the housing societies people are not allowing the campaign employees to come inside to conduct the survey. Whereas citizens in some areas intentionally give false information due to various reasons.”“There is need to create awareness about this campaign if the state government wants to make it a success model. Only collecting the information is not enough, according to its survey report further steps towards improvement needs to be taken,” she said.Chandrakant Zende, a resident of Kasba peth, said, “Last week a group of people had come to our house to take the information for this campaign. We gave the necessary details to them, but some of the residents in our area gave false details to them. Such kind of campaigns are not going to work and I think state government should focus on the improvement of medical treatment given to the Covid patients.”“The Covid pandemic has not yet ended and we all need to get together to stop the infection spread in our areas,” he said. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, however, said the administration has completed the first round of campaign in Pune successfully. “Through this campaign, we are able to collect information of citizens and so it helps prevent the spread of the virus. The local people are also accompanied by the survey employees so there is cannot be misinformation shared by the citizens,” said Deshmukh. About the initiativeStated on September 15, ‘My family, my responsibility’ campaign aims to reach out to twelve crore people in Maharashtra as part of the government’s statewide outreach programme to check the health status of each individual in government’s efforts to contain Covid.In the first phase of the initiative, the state government had set a target of reaching 2.25 crore families across Maharashtra twice a month, with the help of NGOs, elected representatives and college students.

13-10-2020||Pune||AAI claims passengers will not be affected due to night embargo at Pune airport||Although fears are being expressed by the travel industry that flyers heading for Delhi, Bengaluru and other cities during Diwali may face inconvenience due to night flight embargo at the Lohegaon airport beginning October 26, the Pune airport authorities have made it clear that the rescheduling of flights will not have any impact on the number of flights departing Pune and all the night slot flights will be adjusted as per the revised scheduled.As many as 26 night flights have been shifted to day time to accommodate the re-carpeting work which will take place between 8am and 8pm for the next one year by the air force authorities. According to the travel agents’ association, the waiting list of passengers will increase and mostly the tourist passenger traffic will be affected. The association said that during the festive season it would be difficult to travel to different destinations and catch the connecting flights due to the limited operational timings. During the festive season, the number of flyers increase and as a result the waiting time for tickets too will increase with lesser options for the flyers.Currently between 35 and 42 flight movements are taking place on a daily basis at the airport which is a significant reduction from nearly 160 flight operations before March.Pune airport director Kuldip Singh said, “The airport authorities will operate four flights in an hour of the twelve hours available with them. There are currently 42 flights with a capacity to run 48 and more flights cannot be squeezed as social distancing norms are to followed. The new schedule will not lead to flight cancellations and will not have any impact on the flights and there will be no night flights during the said period.”The airport is losing an income of about Rs 2.5 crore in freight every day and the AAI is striving hard to acquire additional land for cargo facility.“There are no direct flights to many cities from Pune and even for going abroad. Flyers fly to Delhi and take international flights from the capital. From here they either take the early morning or night flight.

The pandemic has impacted air travel drastically with the airport witnessing a passenger footfall of nine million during 2018-2019, while in January-February 2020, the footfall was reduced to a meagre 2,000-3,000.

13-10-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Ganga canal closure earlier this year for Mahakumbh infrastructure work||The closure of Ganga canal has been advanced this year so that authorities get more time to carry out infrastructural work on it in time for Mahakumbh early next year. Usually, the closure is from Dussehra to Diwali. From October 15 midnight to November 15 midnight, closure of the 135-year-old Ganga Canal will be undertaken as per the order issued by Uttar Pradesh government which manages its affairs. Last year, it was done from Dussehra (October 4) till Deepawali (October 27). Confirming the closure date, sub-divisional officer Uttar Pradesh Irrigation department Vikrant Saini said, “From midnight October 15 till November 15 this year, Ganga canal closure will be carried out during which maintenance, renovation of Ganga ghats, cleaning and other related construction works will be done.” Also read: Mahakumbh 2021 may not see mass participation owing to Covid-19, says Akhada ParishadUnion education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who represents Haridwar in Parliament, had also written to UP Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Yadav to ensure that the canal closure time gets extended so that Mahakumbh work on Ganga canal can be completed. Uttarakhand irrigation department executive engineer DK Singh said during this one-month period, all work on new Ganga ghats will get completed. While Ganga canal closure is done, minimum water flow at the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri will be ensured so that religious rituals can be performed. Haridwar-based religious scholar Padam Singh Chauhan pointed that in 1916, a pact was signed between the princely states, local priests and Ganga activists led by Pt Madan Mohan Malviya ensuring constant and minimum flow of holy Ganga be maintained at Har-Ki-Pauri as Britishers were trying to build a dam near Har-KI-Pauri-hindering the flow of Ganga at Har-Ki-Pauri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-ganga-canal-closure-earlier-this-year-for-mahakumbh-infrastructure-work/story-hSIjCCvl5lqXOZdSl8o6bI.html

13-10-2020||Mumbai||Consider 26/11 victim’s plea for EWS house: High court directs Maharashtra government||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government to consider the plea of Devika Rotawan, the youngest victim of the November 26, 2008, terrorist attacks on Mumbai, seeking allotment of residential premises under the (economically weaker section) EWS scheme for her family members and a provision for her higher education.The two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Nitin Jamdar and Milind Jadhav, directed the court registry to forward a copy of Rotawan’s petition for the consideration of Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary (CS), Maharashtra.Also read: Increase local train services on Central and Western railways to 700 per day, HC tells MaharashtraThe directive came after the bench noticed that though her representation dated July 19 was pending with Kumar, it did not contain all particulars cited in the petition. The HC also granted Rotawan, a junior college student, liberty to present a copy of her petition to CS Kumar. Rotawan had moved the HC expressing apprehension that her family members would be rendered homeless, as they had not been able to pay monthly rent of their room in a chawl at Subhash Nagar in Bandra (East) because of prolonged economic hardship.On Tuesday, when the petition came up for hearing, Rotawan’s counsel, advocate Utsav Bains, submitted that her was an extraordinary case. Bains pointed out how Rotawan, as a child had suffered a bullet injury in the 26/11 terrorist attacks and how she stood in the line of fire of the captured terrorist Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab, as a prosecution witness.The advocate submitted that her plea was required to be considered on compassionate grounds, as the family is on the verge of being rendered homeless.The bench said that Rotawan has written to a number of authorities and nobody has refused her. “We will ask the CS to consider your requests,” said the bench.Rotawan had pleaded that because of multiple health issues, it was not possible for her father and brother to earn a livelihood, which resulted in her family members to default in the payment of their monthly housing rent.Rotawan, a first year bachelor of arts (BA) student of Chetana College at Bandra, was barely nine year old, when the 26/11 attacks had occurred in 2008. A bullet had passed through her right thigh after two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives from Pakistan had indiscriminately fired upon passengers at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and also hurled grenades at them.Rotawan was slated to travel with her parents to Pune by train to meet her brother on 26/11 in 2008. She fell unconscious shortly after receiving the gunshot wound and when she regained consciousness she found herself at St George Hospital, which is located close to CSMT. Rotawan was operated upon six times over a period of one-and-half months. She was bed-ridden for about six months following multiple surgeries.Rotawan had cited in the petition that after the incident several representatives of the central and state government had assured to provide them with residential accommodation under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota while taking into account their acute financial hardship.She had claimed that the government officials had also assured to make provision for her education and financial assistance over and above what was required for her medical treatment. However, the petition had pointed out that all the government assistance received by her to date was required to be spent on her treatment and post-operative care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/consider-26-11-victim-s-plea-for-house-high-court-directs-maharashtra-government/story-J2CyNCOsXoCDRQZLcBtlGJ.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||North Delhi civic body to be fined Rs 20 lakh for violating dust control norms: Gopal Rai||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday issued directions for imposing a fine of Rs 20 lakh on North Delhi Municipal Corporation for violating dust control guidelines at Bhalswa landfill. The minister said the North MCD has not been sprinkling water regularly to prevent dust pollution at the site. “I have asked the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to impose a fine of Rs 20 lakh on North MCD. The municipal corporation has been directed to immediately increase the number of tankers for water sprinkling,” he said. “We have issued guidelines for all government and private agencies to take anti-dust pollution measures. We have directed everyone to follow five directives. Action will be taken against anyone not doing so,” Rai said. The five steps are installing windshields and barriers at the periphery of construction and demolition sites, covering debris with tarpaulin, using green net to prevent dust from blowing out, water sprinkling, and covering trucks carrying construction material. Rai had on Monday asked common people, private and government agencies that have undertaken construction works to take adequate measures to prevent dust pollution, “else strict action will be taken against them”. The minister also said the government has started “micro monitoring” of all the 13 pollution hotspots in the city and will soon deploy environment marshals to check violations of environmental norms. He said all construction and demolition sites, irrespective of size, will have to compulsorily take the five steps to check pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-delhi-civic-body-to-be-fined-rs-20-lakh-for-violating-dust-control-norms-gopal-rai/story-pC80ZfeXfcyLfRKJrQy9wL.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||States should stop blaming each other on stubble burning, need to take it seriously: Arvind Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said state governments should stop blaming each other and work together to find a solution to the issue of stubble burning, one of the major reasons for the yearly problem of poor air in Delhi-NCR during winters.Kejriwal said while farmers of neighbouring states and people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, “governments have shut their eyes”. “State governments should stop blaming each other. We have to work together to find a solution to the issue… All agencies and governments need to take it seriously now,” he told reporters in Hiranki village in Narela where the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution started on Tuesday. The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.“I am worried about farm fires in neighbouring states. The smoke has started affecting Delhi’s air quality…Air pollution was under control for the last 10 months, but it has started increasing again,” the chief minister said.Imagine the impact of stubble burning on the families of farmers who have no option but to burn the crop residue. Farmers don’t burn it willfully, he said.While the farmers of neighbouring states and the people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, governments have shut their eyes. I hope that they take concrete steps so that the entire north India gets rid of high levels of air pollution,” he said.The Pusa bio-decomposer is being sprayed free of cost in around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown.The national capital’s air quality hit the “very poor” category on Tuesday morning, the first time since February, with calm winds and low temperatures allowing accumulation of pollutants.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, an increase in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions of Pakistan is also going to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 303 at 8:30 am, which falls in the “very poor” category. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of fires near Amritsar and Firozpur in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Kaithal in Haryana.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, farm fires contributed 3 percent particulate matter to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/states-should-stop-blaming-each-other-on-stubble-burning-need-to-take-it-seriously-arvind-kejriwal/story-FMKENNMjFPjilvymLykNGL.html

State education and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the amount would be in addition to the Rs 1,000 which each mid-day meal cook and helper at government schools receives from the Centre. “The amount will be paid from April this year and the total sum till September would be deposited in the bank accounts of mid-day meal workers before the Durga Puja festivities,” the minister said while addressing a press conference. “The finance department has already approved a sum of Rs 34 crore for this move. It would cost the state exchequer an additional sum of nearly Rs 60 cr annually,” he added.

A study done by divisional commissioners found that some of these teachers were getting salaries and had even gone through training while others were getting paid but didn’t have the training required for the jobs,” said Sarma. He said that 1,574 teachers, who had undergone training, would be employed as regular teachers beginning November this year while 2,960 others would be used as tutors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-to-pay-119-000-mid-day-meal-workers-additional-rs-500-per-month/story-RlthvCv5EO6wrB0YpQOjeL.html

Responding to Koshyari’s letter on the issue, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said he does not need a “certificate” on Hindutva from the Governor.

Secularism is a crucial base of the oath you took as Governor. Do you not believe it?”Thackeray added that he does not need any preaching on Hindutva. “Sir, you mention Hindutva in your letter, but I do not need any certificate or any teaching on Hindutva from you.

13-10-2020||Mumbai||Saamana attacks BJP for criticising govt over decision on Aarey Metro car shed||In a veiled attack on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said political greed ensures support for murderers and rapists while environmental activists, who want to save trees and jungles, are deemed criminals. The attack comes after BJP leaders, including former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, criticised Uddhav Thackeray government’s decision to shift Metro car shed out of Aarey colony to Kanjurmarg. Fadnavis had termed the decision as “unfortunate” and “driven by ego”. An editorial in Saamana on Tuesday said that Fadnavis government should have listened to environment lovers’ plea to relocate the Metro car shed. “After moving the car shed to Kanjur[marg], opponents like BJP are criticising the decision... When Devendra Fadnavis was the chief minister, environment lovers protested against the project and they cried over the hacked trees. Was that ego? Fadnavis government should have put aside its ego and respected the environment lovers and moved the car shed to Kanjurmarg,” the editorial said.Also read: Citizens, activists welcome decision to shift Mumbai Metro-3 car shed from AareySpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Saamana executive editor and Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that the state’s decision is in line with the Centre’s decision to save tigers, environment and Ganga. “In fact, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis should congratulate Uddhav ji Thackeray for saving environment. He has saved the wildlife there, the trees and other species there. It is Prime Minister Modi’s national programme. Look at his speeches in the last six years, he spoke about saving Ganga, saving tigers and forests. If we saved the lungs of Mumbai, where does the question of ego arise?” Raut asked.The editorial added that mere speeches on saving environment will not help, but “bold decisions” are needed to save nature. “Murderers and rapists are supported for political benefit but environmental activists, who want to save trees and jungles, are deemed criminals. Mass murder of 2,000 trees was done at night in Aarey [in last October].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/saamana-attacks-bjp-for-criticising-govt-over-decision-on-aarey-metro-car-shed/story-JtNUkNS8E4kZqFZhFh7u6K.html
13-10-2020||Chandigarh||Thaw in sight as Punjab farmers meet to decide on strategy for talks with Centre on farm laws||Representatives of 29 farmer organisations are meeting in Chandigarh on Tuesday to decide on the course of action following the Centre’s second invite for talks on the new agriculture laws in Delhi on Wednesday. It is learnt that most of the farmer organisations are in favour of the meeting, except the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee based in Majha. The committee has rejected the meeting call, saying the invite is a ploy to divide farmers as farmer organisations from neighbouring Haryana and other states have not been invited. However, two major farmer organisations, the Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) and the BKU (Dakounda), which have the largest support base in Punjab are open to the talks and want a truce in the ongoing struggle. SHOULD NOT CLOSE CHANNEL OF TALKS: BKU (DAKOUNDA) “We should hear what the government has to say and should not close the channel of talks,” said Jagmohan Singh, the general secretary of the BKU (Dakounda). However, Satnam Singh Pannu, the president of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee differed with him. “The Centre has invited farmers to discuss the benefits of the new farm laws but we have rejected it as it is detrimental to our interest. No point meeting them,” said Pannu. The farmers have been on the protest path since September 25 against the three new farm bills passed in Parliament by the Narendra Modi government that seek to liberalise agriculture. They have blocked major rail routes in Punjab and held up traffic on highways besides holding protests in front of corporate establishments to register their protest. PUNJAB GOVT APPEALS FOR RESTORING RAIL TRAFFIC The Punjab government, which came out in support of the farmers in their protest, has reiterated its appeal to them to end the rail blockade as it has severely impacted essential supplies, including fertilisers such as di-ammonium phosphate and urea, required for wheat sowing. “The movement of foodgrain from the state has also come to a standstill and stocks are piling up. We want stocks to move out so that space is vacated for the paddy harvest,” said an officer of the state food department. BKU (EKTA-UGRAHAN) LIFTS RAIL BLOCKADE The BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has decided to lift the blockade on railway tracks and other farmer unions are expected to take a call at Tuesday’s meeting. “We were holding protests on rail tracks at three places, including Sunam and Nabha, and have decided to lift these blockades. However, protests will be held outside the houses of eight BJP leaders across the state. As for the rail blockades at other places, it is for the other organisations to decide,” BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) state general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said. DWINDLING COAL STOCKS A WORRY The Punjab government has also cited dwindling coal stocks in the state thermal plants as a concern if the rail blockade continues. An official said if the supply doesn’t arrive, generating units might shut down, leading to power cuts. A state-level committee of three cabinet ministers is also awaiting a meeting with the farmer union leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/thaw-in-sight-as-punjab-farmers-meet-to-decide-on-strategy-for-talks-with-centre-on-farm-laws/story-pSrEObNkVewiDMkzfZ9T9N.html
13-10-2020||Dehradun||Rudraprayag hydel project PIL: Uttarakhand HC issues notices to MoEF, Jal Shakti, state govt||Uttarakhand high court has issued notices to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC), Jal Shakti ministry, Central Electricity Authority (CEC), Uttarakhand government and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Uttaranchal Hydropower Ltd in a public interest litigation (PIL) alleging violations in Singoli-Bhatwari Hydroelectric Power Plant in Uttarakhand’s Rudraprayag district. The court has directed them to respond to the notices within three weeks. The PIL, filed by Bharat Jhunjhunwala, a 70-year-old assistant professor at Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Bengaluru, who originally hails from Tehri district, has alleged violations by carrying out construction beyond the expiry of environmental clearance and not informing authorities concerned on time about change in the design parameters of the project, said Ajay Veer Pundir, counsel of the petitioner. HT has a copy of over 400-page PIL. Also read: Himachal CM for time-bound completion of development worksSituated on Mandakini river in Rudraprayag district, the 99 MW project features a barrage, with a medium-sized intake pond near Ukhimath, a 12-km-long headrace tunnel and a surge shaft over 180 metre in depth. The project was awarded to L&T on Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis following a competitive bidding process by the Uttarakhand government in 2006. The PIL alleges that environment clearance, which was issued for ten years and then extended by another three, expired on August 24, 2020, and as such, any construction beyond that was a violation of the norms. “Also, the project had to start its commercial operation in March 2020 but that also didn’t happen. The fish ladders which allow movement of fish were not constructed despite the same being part of the agreement with Uttarakhand government,” he said. Pundir said environmental clearance had expired on August 24, 2020, while the project completion and readiness for commissioning was announced on September 21, 2020. The PIL alleged that the hydroelectric project is “being constructed without an environment clearance”, adding, “change in scope (design parameters of the project due to 2013 floods) beyond the approved environment clearance and techno-economic concurrence issued earlier (in 2008 by Central Electricity Authority) with respect to old project which has not been implemented… and now in the garb of earlier environment clearance and techno-economic concurrence, respondents are continuing with the changed project which is not permissible as per law.” The PIL seeks the project to “obtain fresh environment clearance...because the ground reality has changed”. The PIL has also sought directions for installation of fish ladders for the conservation of aquatic biodiversity. The PIL pointed out that the project was hit by the floods of 2013 which apparently led L&T Uttaranchal Hydropower Limited to make changes in design. “However, L&T Uttaranchal Hydropower Limited disclosed these changes to Central Electricity Authority only on February 6, 2019,” it alleged. On September 21, L&T announced completion and readiness for commissioning of 99 MW Singoli-Bhatwari Hydroelectric Power Plant, saying the commissioning of this run-of-the-river plant along the Char Dham route will be a major boost to the state of Uttarakhand, with the plant’s capability of providing over 400 million units of renewable energy per annum. Jhunjhunwala’s PIL says he has also submitted a representation to MoEFCC regarding change in scope of the project. L&T spokesperson refused to comment on the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/rudraprayag-hydel-project-pil-uttarakhand-hc-issues-notices-to-moef-jal-shakti-state-govt/story-9ndgqPxdIJxUa9i2lUEjfI.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Akshardham temple opens today||The Swaminarayan Akshardham temple in the national capital will reopen on Tuesday after a gap of around six-and-a-half months following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The entry to the temple will be allowed only between 5 pm and 6.30 pm, but the public can stay inside the premises until 9 pm, said a trustee of the shrine.Though religious places of worship were allowed to reopen in June, the temple authorities had decided to keep it closed for the visitors following a spike in Covid-19 positive cases in Delhi. The authorities have decided to open only a few spots inside the sprawling complex such as the temple, the park, the musical fountain and the restaurant. However, the three exhibition halls and the theatre will remain closed. “We are opening a few places inside the temple complex, which has abundant open spaces. The move will ensure adequate social distancing norms for the public. The exhibition halls are closed spaces. But the restaurant is an open space, where the public is allowed to sit outside,” said Janak Dave, director and trustee of the Swaminarayan Akshardham temple.“The temple will open briefly only in the evening. The exercise is being carried out on an experimental basis and a decision to increase the timing will be taken in due course of time. An extensive sanitisation drive has been conducted before throwing open the temple premises to the public. Though an entry to the temple is allowed until 6:30 pm, the public will be allowed to stay on in the premises until 9 pm,” he said. The temple authorities have put in place elaborate arrangements to screen the visitors and sanitise their belongings. “We have created multiple booths at the entrances, where the visitors will be screened and their stuff will be sanitised. It is compulsory to wear a mask for the visitors inside the temple premises,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-akshardham-temple-opens-today/story-12txzO11Ok8Bzvp2R8p6ML.html
13-10-2020||Lucknow||UP opens up two nationalised routes for private buses||The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has opened two of its prime nationalised routes for running private buses for the first time. The move is being seen as the beginning of the end of the state-owned UP State Road Transport Corporation’s (UPSRTC) decades-old monopoly on nationalised routes. The state transport authority (STA) is likely to invite applications soon and grant stage carriage permits to private players to operate their buses on two prime nationalised routes -- Lucknow-Gorakhpur (via Ayodhya-Vikramjot-Basti) and Lucknow-Agra-Noida Expressway (via Ring Road Kuberpur (Agra)-Pari Chowk). The UP government had issued separate notifications for the two routes in September, which led to discontent among UPSRTC employees’ unions. Also read: UPSRTC initiates intra-state operations from GhaziabadRajesh Kumar Singh, principal secretary, transport, UP, said the state government had taken a decision to open the two nationalised routes for private buses in a bid to unleash healthy competition between UPSRTC authorities and private operators. The move would benefit passengers, who could avail more options, better services and lower fares, he added. “We are not preventing UPSRTC authorities from operating on these routes. We are facilitating parallel operations of private buses for healthy competition and UPSRTC employees must accept the healthy competition,” he said.Singh said the government would open more nationalised routes for private operators in the near future.However, UPSRTC employees, officers and pensioners suspect that move as a part of a larger conspiracy to decimate the state-run corporation in favour of private operators. The aggrieved state transport authority is planning to form a joint forum to launch a statewide agitation to demand rollback of the decision. “The decision to open two nationalised routes for private operators has made all of us suspicious of the state government’s intention. We will soon chalk out a joint strategy to strike back,” said Tej Bahadur Sharma, a veteran union leader of UPSRTC employees. An official claimed the UPSRTC and similar other state transport undertakings (STUs) were created under a Central government’s Act, which gave them exclusive rights to operate on nationalised routes. “The state government has no legal authority to tamper with the sanctity of nationalised routes,” he said. “The total length of nationalised routes in UP is less than 7% of the total stretch for vehicular movements. Private operators have a free run on 93% of the routes,” he added. Sources claimed the state government’s intention was to issue permits to private operators of neighbouring states such as Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The move will connect bus operators directly to the national capital via UP.“This is not a fair deal. If connectivity is the issue, then UPSRTC authorities can think of operating private buses under an inter-state agreement that is already in place,” they said.Private buses operate on most nationalised routes in UP, including on the two prime ones opened by the state government, albeit illegally. Transporters obtain contract carriage permits for diverse purposes such as transporting people taking part in a wedding, tourists and pilgrims.“Though they obtain contract carriage permits, they run regular bus services illegally,” said a transport official. “The state government will get to earn more revenue following its decision to grant carriage permits to private transporters to operate their buses on the two prime nationalised routes,” he said. Though all erstwhile state governments had made similar efforts, stiff opposition from militant UPSRTC employees had proved to be the major deterrent, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-to-open-up-two-nationalised-routes-for-private-buses/story-lh0SI6ochKPKtE2Hmc1JJI.html

We have resolved to continue this drive on a daily basis for the next month at least, and it will be monitored personally by me every evening.”BMC had made it compulsory to wear a mask in public from the first week of April 2020 and has also levied fines since then for violating the order. The fine for not wearing a mask in a public place is Rs 200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-penalises-over-4-300-citizens-for-not-wearing-masks-on-first-day-of-drive/story-7eBA2qaZcBw29Zc157AZWN.html

13-10-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal government brings back Kolkata’s iconic double decker buses||Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee unveiled two open-roof double-decker buses on Tuesday. “Such buses are usually seen in London and will be used here for hop-on hop-off tours. The booking can be done online from October 23,” she said. The buses will pass by heritage buildings and important landmarks in Kolkata such as Writers’ Building, GPO and Victoria Memorial. The authorities will revise the route to include more landmarks depending on the demand. “Folk artists will perform on the bus to showcase the culture of Bengal,” she added. The double-decker buses were introduced in the 1920s. The erstwhile Left Front government phased them out in the early 1990s. In 2005, the last bus went off city roads. In 2011, after coming to power, Banerjee directed the transport department to bring back the iconic buses. “As of now these two will be used for puja parikrama and pandal hopping. Later they will be used for tourism, such as hop-on hop-off tours. They are not meant for commercial services,” said a transport department official. Also Read: Bengal gears up for spike in Covid-19 cases during festive season, 24X7 control room set upThe new buses will have features like automatic doors, destination boards, panic buttons and CCTV cameras. While the old buses used to have two doors, these will have one door. Of the 51 seats, there will be 16 on the upper deck. “The buses will be painted in blue and white, the favourite colour of the chief minister, and will be BS-IV complaint. One of the main purposes the old double decker buses were phased out was that they used to consume a lot of fuel and hence were uneconomical. They were polluting too,” said the official. While the festive season has already started and puja shopping is going on in full swing, the construction of pandals is also in the final stage. In some places, the idols of Goddess Durga have already arrived. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is going to virtually inaugurate dozens of pujas over three days. Puja starts from October 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-government-brings-back-kolkata-s-iconic-double-decker-buses/story-RIh6rqukSV2Mbfc5Xq4DTN.html

13-10-2020||City||Farmers’ rail roko stir bleeds Ludhiana’s industrial sector||The Ludhiana industry continues to face hardships as the recent strike and ‘rail roko’ agitations by farmers have spelt disaster on exports at a time when the businessmen are already reeling under losses due to shortage of labour and restrictions owing to the ongoing pandemic. Ludhiana, known for its cycle, cycle parts and machine tools industry is in deep waters as not only are the shipments being delayed, the supply of goods from here to the rest of the country is also getting severely hampered owing to non-movement of trains at the ports. The industry is facing a huge deficit of containers due to imbalance in import and exports at Ludhiana. The problem is so grave that the godowns usedto stock goods are full to capacity in absence of any movementand the production is taking a toll. President of United Cycle Parts and Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), DS Chawla said that the credibility of exporters is at stake. “Not only of cycles and cycle parts, but the rail roko agitation has also affected all types of exports in the state,” he said. Former president of UCPMA, Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma said that shipments have been delayed and as demand for cycles has swelled, they need to increase production but are unable to do so as the stocks are not moving. “Due to the ongoing pandemic, the supply of essential parts from China like spokes, steel valves have been severely hit. We are still facing a shortage of labour and now the farmers’ agitation has added to our woes. This delay will also raise the price of transportation now,” he said. President of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU), Upkar Singh Ahuja said that the sudden increase of freight and other expenses are adding to losses and mental agony of industrialists.CICU has now written a letter to the PMO, ministry of commerce, ministry of MSMEs, and ministry of finance requesting their immediate intervention and highlighting the hardships being faced by exporters. The major commodities contributing to imports into Ludhiana are metal scraps and waste paper for 20 feet and 40 feet containers, respectively. Orders of metal scraps from Dubai dried up due to the ban on export by the supplier country amid the onset of Covid-19. The import of waste paper also saw a steep fall due to the same reason. Consequently, exports are either in waiting or are forced to rely on the empty containers from Delhi or Mundra ports at an additional cost of ₹20,000 and ₹30,000 respectively per container.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-rail-roko-stir-bleeds-ludhiana-s-industrial-sector/story-RlrYB3gnhQIztj7qA9MyNO.html

13-10-2020||City||Curfew gone, late-night revellers are back in Ludhiana||With Covid cases on a steady decline and the government lifting the night curfew, late-night revellers in Ludhiana are back and with a vengeance! A visit to the popular haunts of the city, including Pakhowal road, Malhar road, Sarabha Nagar, BRS Nagar (near Orient cinema), Model town, Dugri and Field Ganj, revealed that most residents are now confident of venturing out in the public as the number of cases have remained well below the 100-mark for the last six days. The weekends attract the most crowds as residents drive up to popular food joints and enjoy late-night snacks and savour on ice-creams with their friends and family. Booze lovers too are back to merrymaking as long queues are now common outside the liquor vends. The traders, meanwhile, are heaving a sigh of relief as they are finally raking in profits. Traders in most of the popular spots of the city, including Kipps market in Sarabha Nagar, Model Town market and Dugri market, have suffered massive losses since March 23, when the restrictions were brought in to check the spread of Covid-19.Gurkaran Tinna, the owner of Waterfront Grills on Pakhowal road, said, “Even after the government allowed us to resume our business, we were not making much profits due to the continuation of night curfew and Sunday lockdown. But now since these restrictions have been removed, our business is picking up pace.”Harpreet Singh, a resident of Model Town Extension, said, “I am trader. The only time I get to spend with my family is at night. We used to visit different places, including Sarabha Nagar market, Malhar road and other dhabas in night hours to grab a bite. But due to the night curfew, we were not able to move around much. But with the government lifting the restrictions, we are finally able to go out with the kids.”Mandeep Singh, another resident, said, “We used to play cricket with our friends at night and then visit our favourite eatery on Pakhowal road to gorge on paranthas. But due to the restrictions, our game as well as the late-night visits to the eatery came to a halt. But now we are happy that we are able go out again.”Sarabha Nagar main market traders’ association chairman Wangjenn Chiu said, “Our market is one of the favourite haunts of the city residents but remained desolate over the last few months. Though the response now is still low as compared to the pre-lockdown period, the numbers are slowing rising and we are looking at it as a positive sign.”Amarjit Singh, the owner of Green Hotel on Railway Station Road, said, “The lifting of night curfew has brought a major relief to the restaurant and hotel owners as well. It has also brought down the level of fear in the minds of residents. The restaurant business in the city mostly depends on bars and residents visit bars only during night hours. The restaurants have now opened up and the business has also increased to around 65-70 percent.” Keerat Bajaj, a wine contractor, said that there is some relief for his sector too as liquor sales had gone down drastically due to the night restrictions. A WORD OF CAUTIONThough the number of new infections is coming down and fatality rate is also down, youngsters roaming around the city without masks have become a cause of concern for the district health authorities. As the threat of a second wave looms large, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said there should be no room for complacency. “While it is a huge respite that cases are on a decline, residents should not be careless,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/curfew-gone-late-night-revellers-are-back-in-ludhiana/story-1casCWv1uKzHS4a0IBCyJN.html

The accused was caught by people at Tarkhan Majra village and was mercilessly thrashed. They later handed him over to the police. Following the incident, the irate residents of nearby villages and members of Satkar committee started converging at the Sirhind police station spot and later blocked the highway. This led to a massive traffic jam and ADGP law and order Ishwar Singh, Rupnagar range IG Amit Parsad and Patiala range IG Jatinder Singh Aulukh rushed to the spot to handle the situation. The accused, identified as Sehajvir Singh, 19, is a resident of Nabha. His search yielded a prescription slip from a Patiala hospital, where he was undergoing drug de-addiction treatment for the past one year. The accused was identified by his father, who was also brought to the spot. Fatehgarh Sahib SSP Amneet Kondal said Manjot Singh, sewadar of gurdwara at Tarkhan Majra, told police that the accused arrived at the shrine around 11 am and on the pretext of paying obeisance, he committed the sacrilege. “As I entered the gurdwara, I saw that the accused had torn pages of the Guru Granth Sahib. I raised alarm and overpowered the accused with the help of my father. Later, the villagers gathered and the accused was thrashed,” he said. Before he was taken away by the police, the accused confessed to have committed a similar act at Jallah village gurdwara, said the sewadar. After his arrest, the accused tried to mislead the police by speaking in Hindi and hiding his identity saying that he was Sahil from Delhi. But after cops grilled him, he said he was from Nabha. Two cases under section 295-A (hurting religious sentiments), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC and 18, 20 of The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 has been registered against the accused, said the SSP. “The reason why accused committed such an act is still unknown and he will be thoroughly quizzed once we get his remand,” he said.

The control room is the biggest and busiest emergency response system of the city, which registers over 5,500 emergency calls everyday. All the machinery to monitor activities such as CCTV network feed, wireless vans, mobile data terminals, tablets and GPS-enabled first emergency response vehicles, video wall or monitoring screens, computer and internet-based systems ceased to function during the three-hour outage. Police sources said that the emergency call response system on the 100 number helpline was also impacted and the personnel faced difficulties to resume its functioning in a full-fledged manner as the generators installed to supply power developed mechanical errors and could not be switched on immediately. “Our staff received phone calls of citizens in distress and had to take down the details of their exact locations as the existing system which gives live GPS location of the caller to the police control room and shows the location of the nearby police team on the monitor screen, was not functioning due to the disruption in power supply. We also had to provide the details of the caller to the police team patrolling manually through wireless communications or mobile phones. Because of the power failure, the entire process of emergency response slowed down for nearly three hours,” said an officer from the control room. However, Mumbai Police spokesperson deputy commissioner of police N Ambika said that the emergency calls response system remained unaffected during the power failure. All the five regional police control rooms, which coordinate with the main control room and local police for effective law and order management, were also badly impacted amid the power failure. “Operations at the regional police control room came to a standstill for over two hours as there was no power back up. Officers and staff used mobile phones to communicate,” said a control room officer from of one of the five regional police control rooms. Suhas Warke, inspector general of police (law and order), said that there was no adverse impact on the state police control room and the director general of police (DGP) office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/power-outage-in-mumbai-police-control-room-affected-for-three-hours/story-PKMRgerjyjBr8Jj9CqmUKM.html

Meant to monitor smart field elements such as CCTV cameras, data of which will be channelised into a video wall for real-time surveillance of traffic junctions and other key buildings of Chandigarh, including the MC office, the centre also hosts advanced video analytics system and will generate automatic alerts for events such as abandoned baggage, illegal parking, and crowd detection among others.He said surveillance cameras with analytics have also been installed at the entry and exit of parking lots which will not only help in effectively monitor the operation but also provide vital inputs like colour, make and model of the vehicle. “This technology can be used to generate alarms for blacklisted vehicles and search vehicles based on the attributes,” he added.The commissioner said that Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) featuring red-light violation detection, speeding violation, and automatic number plate recognition has been installed at two locations in the city. “This will help in making roads safer and reduce accidents. Additionally, public addressing system has also been installed to disseminate information to citizens,” he added. An adaptive traffic control system with a variable message signage has also been fixed at a traffic junction to keep track of traffic movement and provide maximum green time to the vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/command-centre-to-monitor-smart-field-elements-launched/story-3NSIS1F9cZSBlq4xNN0JZM.html
13-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai power outage: Civic-run hospitals affected, minor surgeries cancelled||Health services, especially in civic-run hospitals, were affected as a result of a power outage across the city on Monday morning. Most civic-run hospitals cancelled minor surgeries.As per medical requirements, hospitals have emergency power backup. All the emergency wards like casualty, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Covid-19 centres did have adequate supply of electricity. However, civic-run hospitals like Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known Sion Hospital, BYL Nair, King Edward Memorial hospitals stopped power supply at their OPDs and general wards. Resident doctors had to examine patients in out-patient departments (OPD) in personal protective equipment (PPE) suits in darkness.“We don’t know how long there will be a power shortage. So, we had to stop the supply at OPDs, which don’t require emergency services. But as we had already received a large number of patients, we completed their checkup in the dark with torches and phone lights,” said a resident doctor from Nair Hospital.Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair Hospital, said, “We had power failure only for an hour. So, we kept the essential medical services running without any obstructions. In our hospital, no surgeries has been cancelled.” Around 12pm, Sion Hospital cancelled a few minor surgeries to avoid unnecessary complications during the procedures. “We have spoken to the electricity department of our hospital which informed us that we have power backup only for two hours. So, we are trying to arrange for more fuel to provide electricity in emergency wards longer,” said a resident doctor from Sion Hospital.Doctors said working in PPE suits in non-emergency wards was exhausting. “Once we wear the PPE, we can’t remove it until our duty is over. So, we have no option but to continue working in the suit even though the power outage made it worse. We are perspiring profusely in the OPDs but we can’t ask the patients to go away,” said a doctor from KEM Hospital.“It was exhausting to work in PPE without fans or light. But we were just praying that electricity be restored at the earliest as we have many critical patients on ventilator,” said a doctor from Sion hospital.Around 3.30pm, electricity was restored in most civic and government-run hospitals. But by then, OPDs were already closed. Private hospitals have been less affected by the outage. “Our medical services haven’t been affected in any way. We have a power backup pf upto 12 hours. The OPDs and surgeries are going on smoothly,” said Dr Ravishankar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Lilavati Hospital. Authorities from Nanavati and Bombay hospitals also assured uninterrupted electricity supply to their staff in all the wards.Jumbo Covid Care Centres (CCC) in the city have adequate supply of electricity for their ICU beds due to automated power backup.Taking note of the power cut, IS Chahal, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner, instructed all hospitals to contract transport garages of BMC’s solid waste management department to arrange adequate supply of diesel for the next eight hours to run generators.BMC has refused to provide data on the total number of minor surgeries that had to be cancelled on Monday due to power outage. As per sources, surgeries will be rescheduled in a day or two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-power-outage-civic-run-hospitals-affected-minor-surgeries-cancelled/story-VSIyZwT1NZ4YJVtb2Rg3JI.html
13-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s local train services come to standstill after disruption in power supply||Commuters experienced a harrowing time on Monday morning after local train services came to a complete standstill for more than two hours owing to the power outage. Services were disrupted between Churchgate and Vasai stations on the Western Railway (WR), as well as on the mainline and harbour line on Central Railway (CR). By 12.26pm, the train services were completely restored on all the lines.Amid the disruption, passengers were stranded inside local trains. Major stations such as Andheri and Borivli witnessed huge queues of commuters heading to their workplaces.“My train stopped ahead of Kurla station for 45 minutes. Nobody on the train had any idea about what had happened. It was only through WhatsApp and social media did I get to know about the power outage. The railway protection force (RPF) had helped women, senior and differently-abled passengers to de-board the train,” said Ghatkopar resident Anuja Bhosale.Around 350 passengers stuck inside local train compartments were assisted by 100 RPF personnel deployed on railway tracks. The disruption in services lead to chaos on platforms and outside stations. “I was heading to my office at Churchgate and there was a huge crowd outside Andheri railway station. That’s when I got to know about the power failure. I waited for an hour but the trains did not resume operations. So I headed back to my house,” said Andheri resident Dominic Rebello. Though the outage caused disruption in local services, no outstation train was stranded. However, CR and WR rescheduled the timings of 10 outstation trains after the outage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-local-train-services-come-to-standstill-after-disruption-in-power-supply/story-lT1OudtoI05hrAdSyxh2TO.html

As the university has not taken any new decision regarding the election so far, over 20 members of the PU senate and syndicate have written to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar.”Earlier, it was justified to postpone the senate elections, but now the situation has improved and unlocking is already going on. University authorities should hold the elections immediately for the smooth functioning,” senator Navdeep Goyal said. The term of present PU senate is about to end on October 31. Senators and syndicate members have also cited the recently held PU’s teaching body polls to support their demand. The senate is a 91 members’ apex governing body of the Panjab University. Out of the total members, 36 are nominated by the vice-president of India, who is also the chancellor of the university. There had been friction between the opponents, Goyal group, which has majority in the PU syndicate, and the vice-chancellor ever since the election was postponed on August 15. After that, no syndicate meeting has been held so far. Though the vice-chancellor had convened an emergent online syndicate meeting twice in September, the members had refused to attend the same.Another PU senator Rajat Sandhir said, “It is urged that fresh dates for voting to various constituencies of senate be announced immediately so as to avoid any crisis resulting from the delay in election.”Panjab University’s vice-chancellor has, meanwhile, refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/syndics-senators-urge-v-c-to-hold-pu-senate-polls/story-pUjHZ89w4yuxwRsLzhVk5O.html

13-10-2020||Chandigarh||In Haryana, urban belt hit more than rural by coronavirus||Urban areas in Haryana have outnumbered rural pockets in terms of Covid-19 mortality rate. The rural areas have registered 28% Covid-19 mortality rate as compared to about 72% in urban areas, a significantly higher proportion of virus spread.Though three districts—Sonepat, Nuh and Jhajjar—have reported higher number of deaths in rural areas, the remaining 19 districts have reported more fatalities in urban areas. As per the latest health department statistics, 1,150 infected patients from urban centres have died so far as compared to 429 from rural areas. The total number of fatalities reported till October 11 was 1,579. Health officials said the trend that virus had a far wider spread in urban areas was also evident from findings of the serological survey conducted in August. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said serological positivity of urban areas was also found to be higher at 9.59% as compared to 6.90% in rural areas. “The reasons behind higher rate of infection and deaths in urban areas are high density of population, intermingling and socialising, people’s tendency to dump safety measures and large scale movement of people. In comparison, people in rural areas have showed better adherence to safety measures. During lockdown, the residents did not allow outsiders to enter the villages,” the ACS said.Data shows that 58% of the dead were senior citizens (above 60) and about 47% had multiple comorbidities. Only 16% of those who died did not have any comorbidity, as per the data. “About 57% infected patients were on ventilator when they died while 21% were put on oxygen support. Around 15% patients were on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP)—a kind of ventilator that helps in breathing,” a health official said. Infection rate down for third consecutive week For the third consecutive week, number of infections continued to drop. The state reported 8,277 infections last week (October 5-11) as compared to 10,096 the week before, a reduction of 1,819 cases. The state had reported 2,429 lesser infections between September 28 to October 4 as compared to September 21 to 27. There was a decline of over 5,000 infections between September 21 and 27. The state had reported an all-time high of 17,616 cases between September 14-20. Statistics show that though the health authorities stepped up sampling last week, testing 16,606 more people than the last week, yet more than 15,000 of the tests were done using rapid antigen kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-haryana-urban-belt-hit-more-than-rural-by-coronavirus/story-VYbGroYKQ9IgPgXqpYYnDK.html

The Haryana School Education Board has come out with a notification that it will accept enrolment forms and fee only from recognised schools. In November 2019, a committee was set up under the chairmanship of the director, secondary education, Haryana, to look into the issue regarding grant of recognition to temporary/unrecognised/provisional recognised schools on simplified norms. The schools were given extension of recognition for the academic year 2019-2020. However, till date, the committee’s report has not been submitted and the simplified norms have also not been notified. These schools have been left out of the notification on collection of forms and fee from students for the academic year 2020-2021, their counsel Pankaj Maini had told court.

13-10-2020||Mumbai||Power outage in Mumbai: Why did city’s islanding system for uninterrupted electricity supply fail?||Why did the four decades old islanding system, meant to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to the city, fail to work when the power grid tripped on Monday? Developed by Tata Power in 1981 to handle disturbance, the islanding system is meant to ensure that the power systems of Tata and Adani plants are intentionally isolated or islanded from the external grid. This helps the power generated at the plants to be transmitted to concentrated areas and enables the authorities to continue supply to essential category customers. Of the approximate 2400MW-2600MW power supply to Mumbai, 1600MW is to be islanded, with Tata’s Trombay thermal plant’s 500MW, 600MW from hydrogeneration units in Khopoli and 500MW from Adani’s Dahanu plant. The system could not work as Tata plants failed to isolate from the rest of the grid. Adani Power’s Dahanu plant islanded 385MW (the supply has been reduced from 500MW owing to Covid). Since 1981, the islanding system in Mumbai has worked well on 27 of the 37 occasions of grid disturbances, according to industry insiders. Energy minister Nitin Raut said the islanding could not work because of grid failure at multiple centres. “Besides the tripping of circuit-2 at Kalwa-Padghe centre, Kharghar transformer tripped, Uran gas power plant developed a technical snag. This led to overload on Tata and Adani plants resulting in failure of the islanding system,” he said. Tata Power Company, in its statement, said: “Mumbai’s islanding system that saves the city from major power outages was separated, however, it could not hold as additional 900MW load dropped at 10:05hrs.” Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited, in its statement, said, “Islanding of Dahanu saved the essential supplies. Rest supplies are being restored as grid inputs get available from the state system.” Energy expert Ashok Pendse says the islanding system would not have worked in the wake of rise in demand. “Even if the islanding system had been activated, Mumbai’s demand could not have been met. Currently, the power demand in the city is 2400MW owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it goes upto 3200MW at other times and in that case islanding could not have worked. There would have been a shortfall of 800-1600MW over the supply from the islanding system.” The state had appointed an expert committee headed by IIT Bombay’s professor SA Khaparde to study a similar outage in Mumbai in November 2010. The committee submitted its report in June 2011.It had commented on the islanding: “With expected Mumbai demand touching to 500MW (in near future), the existing islanding scheme will not work. The islanding scheme needs to be reviewed for possible load-generation balance and accordingly islands need to be formed by separating other networks. Initially, both Tata Power Company and R-Infra (Now Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited) can be islanders together, but independent islands would be required to be formed in future, so they survive on their own available load-generation balance.” Pendse added: “A robust system of transmission with 400KV line as recommended in the report could have enabled direct supply to Mumbai, avoiding indirect supply through Kharghar and Kalwa. Why could the state not strengthen the transmission?” Raut said the proposal of laying of 440KV line for Mumbai will result in additional burden on consumers and hence has been put on the backburner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/power-outage-in-mumbai-why-did-city-s-islanding-system-for-uninterrupted-electricity-supply-fail/story-rHCm11Hta9Ice45zFztXcK.html

It is a matter of convenience and not of necessity as vegetables and fruits are available in other markets of the city.” Decision on Ramlila soonUT adviser Manoj Parida said the administration will soon (in a day or two) decide on granting the permission to organise Ramlilas in the city. The administration will take into consideration the decision of neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana on the issue.“Approval to organise Ramlila is likely to be given, but the administration is still weighing in its options regarding the organisation of bigger Dussehra functions in the city. At such places, management of huge crowd in the wake of Covid-19 crisis is a concern,” said a senior UT official, who wished not to be named.In the Covid-19 review meeting, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had directed the deputy commissioner to ensure that the festivals are celebrated by people while following the Covid safety protocols strictly. Necessary guidelines should be issued while giving permissions for such public celebrations, he addedMeanwhile, Chandigarh Police held a meeting with Ramlila organisers and representatives of various religious organisations on Monday and directed them that thermal scanning of all visitors and volunteers will be mandatory during events in the upcoming festive season.UT senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal told the organisers that all entrances should have provisions for thermal screening and hand sanitisation. Even the organisers must get scanned before entering the venues, he added. Police also advised the organisers to ensure the usage of masks, maintenance of social distancing norms, and sanitisation of temples and Ramlila stages. Strengthening of dispensariesIn the meeting, Badnore stressed upon the need to strengthen the smaller health units located in various sectors. He instructed the director, health services, to ensure that more doctors are posted and more facilities provided in these dispensaries, so that patients do not throng the OPD facilities in PGIMER or GMSH-16.The administrator directed special secretary, health, to ensure that patients in home isolation are taken care of and provided necessary medicines and health kits. Regular monitoring and telephonic consultations with them should be done by dedicated doctors, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/resumption-of-apni-mandis-ut-administration-to-take-final-call-in-month-end/story-ZKMohR9CZeGZnOqconY5dP.html

Some of our teachers had come to the school for the exam and were stuck in school due to the power outage. We also had a storytelling event which had to be cancelled,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle. Sanghvi added that even after power was restored, classes could not be resumed. “The staff waited in the school till 2pm but since power had not resumed, we had to leave. Parents were already informed about the postponement,” she said.At St Mary’s School (ICSE) in Mazagaon, online classes had to be cancelled. “We informed all our teachers to communicate this to the students. Similarly, we told our non-teaching staff not to come today,” said Father Francis Swamy, principal of the school. Several teachers who were headed to go to school were stuck due to trains being stalled. “I had to go to school to make question papers for an internal test. Now I am heading back home as there are no trains,” said the teacher of a BMC school in Goregaon.At St Joseph’s School in Panvel, the semester exams took place as per the schedule before the power failure. However, most schools in Navi Mumbai and Panvel, too, had to cancel online classes.Yukti Rajan, 37, whose son is in class 2 of Reliance Foundation School, said, “My son Prithvi had online classes from 11.30am to 12.30pm.

13-10-2020||City||Haryana farmers fret as basmati prices fall to ₹1,800 per quintal||For the first time in past several years, the PUSA 1509 variety of Basmati is being sold at ₹1,800 per quintal in Haryana, which is far less than the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of ₹1,888 fixed for the Parmal varieties procured by government agencies. There is no fixed MSP for the Basmati variety.Raj Kumar, a marginal farmer from Ladwa, has been visiting the Kurukshetra grain market daily for last three days to sell the PUSA 1509. However, private traders are not ready to procure his produce above ₹1,800 per quintal. Several other farmers have also been left crestfallen since the prices of this premium aromatic variety of rice is ₹1,100 less than last year. Farmers blame it on lack of proper pricing policy as private traders have been making the most of it by procuring the variety at their own prices. Last year, farmers had fetched ₹2,700 to ₹2,900 per quintal for this Basmati variety. Farmers, however, say this year they will have to sell it below ₹1,800 since they have to repay their debts. Ram Kumar, a farmer from Yamunanagar’s Radaur said, “After waiting for three days, I had to sell my produce of two acres to a trader at ₹1,815 per quintal. I feared that the prices may fall further since there are no buyers. Therefore I sold it even below the MSP of parmal.” Lack of pricing policy Due to the lack of a pricing policy for the Basmati, farmers are left with no option but to sell their produce at prices fixed by private traders. On the other hand, growers of Parmal are not concerned about the prices since the government has fixed the MSP for this variety. Farmers say the per acre yield of Parmal is around 30 to 35 per quintal and they easily get ₹60,000 per acre. However, the yield for PUSA 1509 is around 18 to 22 quintals and the growers get below ₹40,000 per acre. Mahinder Singh, a commission agent at Nilokheri grain market, said, “It is because of the MSP. The difference between the earning from Parmal and Basmati is over ₹20,000 per acre. Farmers have been fighting to get the MSP for Basmati since the private traders have been buying the variety at their own prices.” People associated with the rice industry have also blamed the lack of proper pricing mechanism for the Basmati. Vijay Setia, former president of the All-India Rice Exporters Association, said, “There is no ban on export of Basmati and the government has also reduced the market fee and rural development fee from 2% each to half a percent. Still, the farmers are not getting any benefits and are left on the mercy of traders.” On more than 50% fall in the prices of Basmati, additional chief secretary, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, PK Das said, “Earlier, there was a policy decision that the government agencies will procure the PUSA 1509 on the MSP of Parmal if farmers are forced to sell at lower prices. However, in past couple of years the prices of PUSA 1509 had gone up. We stand by our decision to buy Basmati on the MSP of Parmal variety if farmers are not getting fair prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-farmers-fret-as-basmati-prices-fall-to-1-800-per-quintal/story-N0NXV37R3jSn6lCs124q9O.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appealed citizens to store water and use it cautiously as the supply will get normal by Tuesday afternoon.On Monday, a grid failure caused a widespread outage in the state capital and its suburbs, affecting train services, delaying exams and causing traffic jams.BMC, in a statement on Monday, said, “The power supply in the city was cut off for a few hours this morning, adversely affecting the work of the water treatment plant at Bhandup. As a result, the water supply in the city area was partially affected and has also reduced in some areas.”A BMC official from the hydraulics department said, “Water supply is affected and this means the supply pressure will be low. This is basically a cascading effect. Supply will be normal by tomorrow [Tuesday] afternoon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/water-supply-affected-in-mumbai-due-to-power-cut-bmc-urges-citizens-to-use-water-cautiously/story-J2rtp79gJtnj3qA2yc6pEJ.html
13-10-2020||Mumbai||Power outage leads to water cuts in Thane, Kalyan, Bhiwandi; loom workers lose a day’s wage||Several areas of Thane, Kalwa, Mumbra, Kalyan and Bhiwandi were affected due to the power failure on Monday morning. While power was restored in some areas within a few hours, many areas in Kalwa, Kalyan and Bhiwandi had to wait till around 8pm. Power loom workers in Bhiwandi were the most affected as they lost a day’s pay due to the power failure.“The labourers working in these power looms are daily wage workers and get paid on the basis of how many metres of cloth they produce. Hence, a six-hour power cut means they lost earning opportunity for the day. Moreover, power loom owners have a deadline for supply of materials. The day-long power outage has left a huge impact on our production,” said Jivraj Nagariya, chairman of Power Loom Owners Federation, Bhiwandi. Some parts of Thane such as Upvan, Majiwada and Kopri did not have power for a long time while power connection in Vartak Nagar and Naupada was restored by evening. Kalwa, Mumbra, Bhiwandi and some parts of Kalyan did not have power till late in the night. “The repair work is in progress in a phase-wise manner. We are hoping that the situation will be under control at the earliest. However, areas like Shilphata, Bhiwandi and Mumbra will take some more time,” said Chetan Bijlani, public relations officer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The power failure also impacted water supply in Kalyan, Dombivli, Mumbra, Thane city and some parts of Bhiwandi. “Due to the power outage, pumping of water at Temghar was stopped on Monday for around five hours. Although water supply has been restored, water flow would be low till Tuesday morning. We sent an alert and requested all residents to use water sparingly on Monday,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).However, TMC and the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) ensured that Covid care centres and hospitals had power back up. “We made arrangements for power back up at our Covid care centres and hospitals. We also made arrangements for water tankers for areas where we were unable to supply water due to power outage,” said Madhavi Pophale, public relations officer, KDMC.Students and professional working from home were also severely affected. Supriti Katkar, principal of Radcliffe School in Thane, said, “We had our online tests on Monday. Due to the power outage, not everyone could login online. So, we postponed the test and conducted it later in the day. However, some students were upset with the rescheduling.”“Not only our work schedules but also cooking and cleaning took a backseat as there was no water supply. We have a toddler at home and it was difficult to get her to sleep in the extremely hot weather without fans,” said Suhas Sawant, 35, a resident of Kalwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/power-outage-leads-to-water-cuts-in-thane-kalyan-bhiwandi-loom-workers-lose-a-day-s-wage/story-twrZe2K9fa1XujXUUtEusJ.html
13-10-2020||Chandigarh||High Covid positivity rate remains a concern in Chandigarh||The Covid-19 positivity rate in Chandigarh has dropped by 7% in the first 10 days of October when compared with the same period in September, though the overall rate continues to remain around 15% even as there has been a drop in the number of cases recently.Positivity rate is the percentage of people testing positive for every hundred tests conducted.Comparing the two periods (September 1-10 and October 1-10), the number of fresh cases has seen 62% drop and tests have gone down by 66%. However, there seems to be a renewed effort to increase the testing numbers, as the health department has started aggressive sampling in containment zones. While, on an average only around 650 tests were conducted in the first five days of this month, around 900 have been conducted daily in the next five days. In fact, 1,334 people were tested on October 12, highest this month. Overall, 88,819 people have been tested so far, of whom 13,260 have tested positive (positivity rate of 14.9%). What high positivity rate suggestsA high positivity rate suggests that testing has been restricted to a particular group, such as those reporting for testing or seeking medical treatment, without encouraging more people in the community to come forward and get sampledThrowing more light on it, a community health expert at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), who did not wish to be named, said, “High positivity rate indicates that the authorities are testing sick patients and those reporting for testing, which is as per the established protocol. However, if more random samples of high-risk groups or people in professions that have more public interaction, such as vendors, policemen and salespersons, are taken, it can lead to a higher case detection. It will also bring down the positivity rate.”The World Health Organisation had also suggested a positivity rate below 5% for a period of 14 days is an indicator that the epidemic is under control and that social restrictions can be gradually relaxed.What is admn doing to increase testingHealth officials said that testing more people has been a real challenge in the wake of declining numbers of new cases as residents have stopped coming forward to get tested.Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang said that mobile testing teams have been sent to the MC office and UT secretariat besides congested areas like Hallomajra and Manimajra for testing people who come forward voluntarily. She said special drives for random testing have been conducted at the Police Colony, vegetable market and various community centres too.“If we see the single-day positivity rate, it has decreased from 30-35% from the peak time (in September) to 6-7% in recent days,” said health secretary Arun Gupta.Claiming the criticism over low testing in the first few months of the pandemic is “unwarranted”, he said: “As the prevalence was low, there was no need to randomly pick up people for tests. But now when we see widespread infections, we have resorted to non-targeted testing in containment zones as well as in market areas where public presence is more. Earlier, people themselves reporting was almost equal to our capacity for testing, which has now decreased. So, it also gives us more room for testing more people who seem to be at high risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-covid-positivity-rate-remains-a-concern-in-chandigarh/story-1ps4zp2E6mWoK7SqAScwML.html
13-10-2020||Mumbai||Power outage brings Mumbai to a standstill; probe ordered||Millions of people across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) went without electricity for between three and 12 hours, owing to a rare grid failure triggered by “multiple trips” during maintenance work on Monday morning. A power outage of this scale had last happened in November 2010, while in mid-2018, a fire on a transformer caused major electricity cuts in the city and its suburbs.Monday’s blackout from around 10.05am paralysed India’s financial capital, already strained by a pandemic, stranding thousands of train passengers; affecting hospitals, online exams and mobile telephone services; disrupting the new normal of work-from-home; trapping people in elevators and even causing the police control room to crash. While the power supply was gradually restored starting 1pm, many parts of the city (especially in eastern suburbs), Thane and Navi Mumbai were without electricity for more than 12 hours. In some areas, supply was restored only to be cut again and it hadn’t been restored until late night.According to a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO), MMR gets its power supply via four main transmission lines. Of the four, on October 10, there were issues with the Kalwa-Talegaon line, on which repairs were undertaken as a conductor was broken. Later, the 400KV Kalwa-Padghe line-1 also tripped, owing to excess voltage around 4.33am and work of changing the insulator was undertaken by the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL). While Mumbai’s supply was on via the other two transmission lines, Kalwa-Padghe line-2 was hit by technical problems and tripped at 10.01am. Thus, three of the four lines that supply power to Mumbai and surrounding areas were affected, officials said. This resulted in tripping of 500MW of Tata Power’s Trombay plant and 250MW of Adani Electricity’s Dahanu plant.The power fiasco prompted Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to order a probe and convene a meeting with officials, including state energy minister Nitin Raut, on Monday evening. “The probe will look into reasons for the outage, find out whether it was unavoidable and caused because of negligence on part of the officials concerned. The committee will also recommend measures to be taken to avoid such an occurrence in the future,” Thackeray said. He also asked officials to remain alert as there is a heavy rain forecast for the city. The CM meeting was also attended by minister of state for energy Prajakt Tanpure, senior officials from the government and representatives of Tata Power, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) and Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) agency. The government is expected to set up a committee under its technical advisor Uttam Zalte, with experts from IIT-Powai, and officials from the energy department. Raut said, “The probe committee will do a technical audit and root-cause analysis, which will help us avoid any such failure in future. It will also see whether the department followed all protocols required, while going for the maintenance of the transmission system, all precautions were taken among others. The probe will find out flaws if any, but the transmission company today [Monday] did a commendable job by restoring electricity in just three-and-a-half hours.”The power outage in areas served by all four distribution companies —BEST, AEML, Tata Power Co Ltd and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL)— virtually brought the city to a standstill, with traffic jams caused by around 700 disrupted traffic signals and also dysfunctional street lights across the eastern express highway late in the evening. Meanwhile, Mumbai civic chief IS Chahal directed the administration to ensure diesel for generators for civic hospitals and Covid care centres.According to MSETCL, the Kalwa-Padgha line-1 was affected owing to over-voltage around 4.33am. Post which, restoration work undertaken. The cascading effect of multiple tripping lines resulted in affecting a total of 1,700MW load in Mumbai. The city’s demand is anywhere between 1,600MW to 2,600MW. Around 6pm, MSETCL stated that 70% of the power restoration has been completed and power has been restored mainly for essential services like railways and hospitals.While Mumbai has a well-known islanding system, which isolates itself during a state grid failure to continue supply to the city, Tata Power in its statement on Monday said that islanding could not hold owing to the additional drop of 900MW.The company said, “Mumbai’s islanding system, which saves the city from major power outages, was separated, however, it could not hold as additional 900MW dropped at 10.05 hours.”It further said, “Tata Power swiftly began restoration work to bring back supply from the 3 Hydro units and Trombay gas and coal units as soon as the MSETCL transmission lines were connected. Tata Power started restoring supply to its consumers progressively from 12 noon onwards. Tata Power regrets the inconvenience caused to its consumers due to this unforeseen event in power failure due to the transmission system failure leading to the cascading impact to all downstream suppliers of electricity including Tata Power, BEST and its consumers.”The MSETCL, which handles the units, stated that there were sparks observed at the Kharghar unit, too, post which both the Kalwa and Kharghar unit came down to zero load, also affecting the Trombay power unit, which is a major supplier for Mumbai.Dinesh Waghmare, managing director of MSEDCL, said, “Ideally, when there is a failure in the state grid, Mumbai could isolate itself owing to the Trombay and Dahanu power plants, however, on Monday, there was a cascading effect.”MSETCL said that the technical fault resulted in tripping 570MW of Tata Power, 440MW of BEST and 700MW of AEML.Tata Power caters to seven lakh consumers, while BEST and AEML cater to 10 lakh consumers in the island city and close to 30 lakh consumers in the suburbs respectively.AEML in its statement said that it went into islanding for essential installations in the city, though residential units did face power outage.AEML, in its statement said, “Due to transmission network failure outside of our system at around 10.05 this morning, power grid saw outages across utilities in Mumbai. However, AEML operated islanding facility successfully and continued successfully power supply to vital installations with the help of Dahanu Thermal Power Station (DTPS). We wish we had more power for which we are dependent on grid input. The power supplies to remaining consumers of AEML are being restored in phased manner as input power is being restored by Grid operations of Maha.”On Monday, Mumbai’s power demand was close to 2,600MW. While DTPS has an installed capacity of 500MW, Trombay has a capacity of about 1,100MW, sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/power-outage-brings-mumbai-to-a-standstill-probe-ordered/story-psReskhURqozVJDoCJf4nN.html
13-10-2020||Mumbai||Nagpur resident booked for posting objectionable tweets against CM Uddhav Thackeray, Aaditya directed to appear before Mumbai cyber cell||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed Nagpur resident Sameet Thakkar, booked for making derogatory statements against chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and his son and environment minister Aditya Thackeray on social media, to appear before the cyber cell of the Mumbai Police at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) on October 16. The court has also directed Thakkar to hand over his mobile phone to investigators and posted the matter for hearing on October 23. A division bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik, while hearing the plea of Thakkar to quash the multiple first information reports (FIRs) filed against him for the alleged objectionable tweets against the CM and Aaditya, was informed by advocate Dr Abhinav Chandrachud that Thakkar had got interim protection from a Nagpur bench of the HC in a similar plea there. Dr Chandrachud then informed that as per court directions in the previous hearing, his client had attended the VP Road police station where the FIRs was registered against him and had also recorded his statement there. However, he had to leave the police station in a hurry as he was informed that a police team from the cyber cell was coming to arrest him. In light of this, Dr Chandrachud submitted that his client should not only be given protection but also be allowed to have an advocate with him when he goes to the police station. He assured the court that the lawyer would be at a distance from where he could see Thakkar but not hear the questioning by the police. He further submitted that Thakkar was incorrectly booked under section 505 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as he had not incited any hatred between any community with his tweets. The advocate claimed that the accused should have instead been booked under section 504 (intentionally insults, gives provocation to any person) of the IPC. However, chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare informed the court that Thakkar had not cooperated with the police, nor complied with the previous court order and had run away from VP Road police station without signing the statement. Thakare said that this was done at the behest of the accused’s lawyer who was present with him at the police station. Thakare, however, submitted that if Thakkar was willing to attend the police station at VP Road and the cyber cell at BKC, police would consider his application to allow a lawyer to be present with him. With regards to the threat of being arrested under one FIR or another, Thakare said that even though Thakkar had approached the court to quash the FIRs, he had not restrained himself from making objectionable tweets against political personalities. Thakare also submitted that Thakkar had not deposited his mobile phone to the investigators. After hearing the submissions, the court directed Thakkar to attend the police station on October 16 between 11am and 1pm, and also asked him to deposit his mobile handset with the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nagpur-resident-booked-for-posting-objectionable-tweets-against-cm-uddhav-thackeray-aaditya-directed-to-appear-before-mumbai-cyber-cell/story-jRSPkCB3IoNgcjAdcTKOOM.html
13-10-2020||Mumbai||Payal Tadvi suicide case: Mother writes to Maharashtra CM pleading government to file review against SC order||The mother of Payal Tadvi, a postgraduate student at BYL Nair Hospital who died of suicide last year, has written to Uddhav Thackeray, chief minister of Maharashtra and minister for law and judiciary, pleading to file a review petition against the order of the Supreme Court permitting the accused doctors to resume their postgraduate medical course in gynaecology and obstetrics. Payal Tadvi’s mother Abeda also said that they should allow these three doctors to resume their studies only after the trial in the case is over. Twenty-six-year-old Tadvi, a second-year medical student at Dr BYL Nair Hospital, died by suicide on May 22 last year. The Mumbai Police had arrested three senior doctors namely - Dr Hema Ahuja, Dr Bhakti Mehar and Dr Ankita Khandilwal on May 29, 2019. The accused were charged with abetment to suicide under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code and also for offences under provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 and the Maharashtra Prohibition of Ragging Act of 1999. After spending nearly two months in prison, they were granted bail by Bombay high court on August 7, 2019. The high court, however, ordered that the three shall not enter the college and the licences issued to them by the Medical Council of India as well as Maharashtra Medical Council would remain suspended until the conclusion of the trial in the case. The Apex court last week relaxed the condition and said the three can go back to their studies provided they appear in court whenever the case is posted for a hearing and don’t attempt to influence witnesses. Against the order, the family wants the government to file a review petition. In the letter written in Marathi, Abeda also claimed that the anti-ragging committee of the Dr BYL Nair Hospital in their report held the three doctors guilty of ragging the junior doctor. However, Abeda alleged that even after the report, no action has been taken against the doctors. “Because of no action by the hospital, Maharashtra Medical Council, (MMC) ignored the report of the committee and revoked the suspension of the doctors. The doctors took the opportunity and approached the Apex court for relaxation in the condition. The government should now probe on who is responsible and take action,” Abeda said in her letter written in Marathi. Besides the family also staged a protest outside the hospital on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/payal-tadvi-suicide-case-mother-writes-to-maharashtra-cm-pleading-government-to-file-review-against-sc-order/story-HryLF5n0ZxtA3gAswW2iaK.html

As a result, five first information reports (FIRs) have been registered at Mumbai and Thane between July 10 and August 3, and 18 persons have been arrested in connection with the crimes.FDA has set up a control room and also provided a helpline to ensure that the critical medicines are made available to Covid-19 patients in time, it added.The affidavit was filed in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) by Jayesh Mirani, president of All Maharashtra Human Rights Welfare Association, complaining about black marketing of Remdesivir 100 and Actimera 400 injections and Fabiflu tablets required for treatment of critical Covid-19 patients.According to Mirani’s counsel, advocate Prashant Pandey, a Remdesivir 100 injection has an MRP of ₹3,000 but is being sold on the black market for over ₹30,000. Therefore, the injections and tablet should be made available by the government directly at Covid care centres.Besides, Pandey said, because of the artificial shortage of the medicines, relatives of Covid-19 patients are required to run from pillar to post to get these drugs, as they are not available at medical stores. He said he was told that in Mumbai, the medicines were available only with six suppliers.The PIL is expected to come up for hearing on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/instances-of-black-marketing-of-critical-covid-19-medicines-but-culprits-nabbed-maharashtra-fda-to-bombay-hc/story-FE1MkjcJTDapeteJ1KR4oO.html

Rajput was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14. The case was first probed by the Mumbai Police, however, a month later, on the complaint of Rajput’s father, Bihar Police had registered a case of abetment of suicide and named Chakraborty and her family as accused. The case was later transferred to the CBI. Presently, CBI is probing all allegations and theories that were floated relating to Rajput’s death. During the probe, Chakraborty had claimed that she left Rajput’s house a week before the incident. However, her neighbour Dimple Thawani, in an interview had claimed that an eyewitness had seen Rajput dropping Chakraborty to her residence on June 13. Thawani had claimed that someone had informed her about this. Chakraborty, in her complaint against Thawani to CBI, has claimed that the neighbour “made patently false and bogus allegations against me knowing them to be false to mislead the investigation”. Further, the actor has claimed this amounts to an offence under section 203 (giving false information) and 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “The offences are serious, and the allegations were made on Republic TV channel without any basis,” she said in her letter to CBI, seeking action against Thawani. The letter was sent a day after Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde claimed that they would make a list of people who gave misleading information about the incident. “We will be forwarding a list of people to CBI who made fake and false claims on TV and electronic media… with particular reference to Rhea Chakraborty. We will request CBI to take legal proceedings against them for misleading the investigations,” Maneshinde had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-actor-rhea-chakraborty-writes-to-cbi-to-take-action-against-her-neighbour-for-false-allegations/story-92G3aIArGJse3XhJaX6PII.html

13-10-2020||Delhi||Pay staff salaries or hand over hospitals, Delhi govt tells MCDs||The Delhi government on Monday asked the three municipal corporations (MCDs) to immediately pay salaries to doctors and other health care workers in their hospitals or hand over these facilities to the city administration. Taking cognisance of complaints from doctors of hospitals run by municipal corporations (MCDs) about not receiving salaries for months, Delhi urban development minister Satyendar Jain on Monday asked his department to issue letters to all the three MCDs, asking them to clear the dues of health care workers and supporting staff at north Delhi’s Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals.Resident doctors at Hindu Rao hospitals are demanding unpaid salaries for three months and timely release of wages every month.The urban development department then sent letters to the commissioners of the north, east and south Delhi municipal corporations, asking them to do the needful or hand over the hospitals to the AAP government. “Resident doctor associations of the above-mentioned hospitals have threatened to go on strike if their dues are not cleared on time and MCD failed to meet the deadlines for paying them on time. The above-said situation has led to inconvenience and improper treatment to Covid-19 patients and it has forced the Delhi government to shift Covid-19 patients from Hindu Rao Hospital to Lok Nayak hospital of the Delhi government for a continuum of medical care…,” read the note signed by Jain, which was sent to the state urban development department. The note said “it is evident that MCD is finding difficulty in proper running and management of their hospitals, which has led to anguish among doctors and paramedical staff, apart from causing inconvenience to patients relatives/citizens of Delhi during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and treatment of non-Covid ailments.”The minister further wrote that if the MCDs are finding it difficult to pay salaries and to run the hospitals, the three MCD commissioners should be asked to hand over all the hospitals to the Delhi government. He sought an action taken report from the urban development department in the matter. After this, the department’s ‘local bodies’ wing sent letters to the three MCD commissioners, saying that “serious concerns” have been raised regarding non-payment of salaries, wages and other dues to the medical, paramedical and other staff of Hindu Rao , Kasturba and other MCD hospitals.“...it is worth mentioning that under the extant recommendations of the 5th Delhi Finance Commission, the first and second instalments of basic tax assignment by UD department and grant-in-aid by health and education departments have already been released to the MCDs by Delhi government for financial year 2020-21. Apart from these released amounts, MCDs are having their own sources of revenue generation and thus have to ensure sufficient provisioning of funds to pay the salaries of the front line health workers in MCD hospitals during Covid pandemic,” the letter read. The letter said the MCDs should “expeditiously” clear all payments and submit a report to the department. “If DMCs are unable to pay salaries and facing difficulties in running their hospitals, they may consider handing over their hospitals to the Delhi government to avoid any further anguish to medical, paramedical and other staff and inconveniences to patients/relatives/citizens of Delhi during ongoing Covid pandemic,” the letter read. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, a councillor in the north Delhi municipal corporation, said, “The corporations are facing a financial problem and are unable to pay salaries as the Delhi government is not releasing funds. The government reduced our funds by nearly 58% due to Covid. The corporations have done a lot of work during Covid. We can run the hospitals provided the government clears the dues. As far as not paying salaries to our employees is concerned, the government too is not able to pay salaries to guest teachers, professors, doctors, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pay-staff-salaries-or-hand-over-hospitals-delhi-govt-tells-mcds/story-zFxfxVYk99DLH4hLibxDcM.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||North MCD doctors urge L-G to file FIR over unpaid salaries||A day after resident doctors of Hindu Rao hospital, a designated Covid facility, went on a strike over unpaid wages, senior doctors of north corporation-run hospitals urged the lieutenant-governor of Delhi to file an FIR against “authorities” for not paying their salaries for the last three months. In the letter addressed to LG Anil Baijal, the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association wrote, “MCDA requests your goodself to implement the order… by filing an FIR against the authorities responsible for non-payment of our salaries.” The doctors were last paid for the month of June. The order the letter refers to is the one sent by the union health ministry in June this year to all states. It “directed the states and UTs to ensure that salaries of doctors and health workers during Covid-19 related duty shall be released on time and the violation of which will be treated as an offence under the Disaster Management Act”. “The union health ministry order says non-payment of salaries will be an offence. We are just asking them how will the order be implemented, who would file the FIR, who should it be against? We are asking the LG to implement the order – either file an FIR or give us our salaries,” Dr RR Gautam, president of the association, said. The L-G office did not respond to requests for a comment.The organisation represents 2,000 doctors from five hospitals run by the north Delhi municipal corporation as well as clinics, maternity centres, and dispensaries under it. Hindu Rao is one of the five hospitals run by the north corporation and the only one to treat Covid-19 patients, which were moved to Delhi government-run hospitals on Saturday ahead of the resident doctors’ strike. The other four hospitals run by the North Corporation are Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis, Maharshi Valmiki Infectious Disease hospital, Kasturba Hospital, and Giridhari Lal hospital. Kasturba hospital doctors  had earlier gone a strike for nearly 20 days to get their salaries for June. “We are not going on a strike at the moment because it will hamper patient care. We are hoping the government will pay our dues after this letter. However, if no action is taken, we will be forced to join the strike of the resident doctors,” said Dr Maruti Sinha, general secretary of the association . “The corporation currently does not have the money to pay salaries, we are working to get the funds in place. Our priority is to pay the doctors, health care workers and sanitation workers,” said North DMC mayor Jai Prakash. Meanwhile, even as more than 250 resident doctors continued their strike for the second day, the hospital has started preparations to open up for non-Covid-19 patients. Jai Prakash had earlier told HT that patients were moved on Saturday not because of the strike. He said Hindu Rao hospital had been receiving very few Covid-19 cases and could utilise its services better as a non-Covid hospital. The hospital had been designated as a dedicated Covid facility in mid-June after a spike in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-doctors-urge-l-g-to-file-fir-over-unpaid-salaries/story-BuQ6Fk31snw1IYvJ9KjH4O.html
13-10-2020||Education||Covid-19: Admission buzz missing in DU as admissions go online||Admission season has begun at Delhi University (DU) but amid the ‘new normal’ triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and without the usual campus buzz. The crowds are missing, so are tents, special seating arrangements for students and parents and food stalls outside. And minimal staff is present as the admissions for undergraduate courses have gone completely online this year. On the first day of the admission process on Monday, the usually busy roads of DU’s north campus were deserted and the colleges remained usually silent. Quite a few colleges put up posters outside their gates, advising students to stay at home. A poster outside Ramjas College read, “Students and parents are not allowed in college premises due to pandemic”. Principal Manoj Khanna said, “Earlier you would not even get a space to stand in our corridors on the first day of admissions. But things are different this year. It looks very different but it’s the only way to conduct the admission process safely amid the pandemic,” he said.Ramjas has set up 22 rooms, each for every department, for admission work. Every time a student applies for any course as per the cut-off, the teachers on duty would get a notification on the portal. They would take out printouts of the application to calculate the ‘best of four’ and verify the documents. “We have set-up a four-step document verification process. Once the teachers-in charge of the department clear the admission, it goes to the co-convenor. Next it goes to the convenor and finally to the principal for the final approval,” Khanna said.Other colleges set up “online control rooms” to coordinate with teachers and administrative officials. The three-tier document verification process at Hindu, for instance, has more than 85 teachers and officials working together. “Generally, we would counsel non-eligible students who came to the college and ask them to try in the subsequent cutoffs or guide them accordingly. This time, we received applications with much lower cut-offs.Teachers are not very happy about using strong words like “rejected” for students who have scored as high as 93-94%,” principal Anju Shrivastava said.Jayesh Solanki, 18, who applied for the BA programme at Hindu College, said, “I had submitted my applications by 11.30 am today and the status is still pending. I called college officials who assured me my application would be processed and the delay was due to the load on the server.”According to the data provided by the DU administration, as many as 19,086 students had applied for around 70,000 undergraduate seats available in over 60 colleges by 8 pm on Monday. Of them, 1,628 applications were approved by the admission committees of the colleges and 920 of them completed the admission process after paying the fees. Miranda House set up a “virtual control room” to address real-time queries of parents and students between 10 am and 5 pm through video conferencing. A panel of four college officials were available throughout the day on zoom call. The meeting ID and password were displayed on the college website and at a huge banner outside the college gate beforehand. “We have been receiving queries from parents and students who are applying to other colleges as well,” the college’s acting principal, Bijayalaxmi Nanda, said. A “virtual tour” was organised for students who would have visited the campus had it not been the pandemic. “We are getting calls from several parents asking details about the campus. The Covid-19 pandemic has made everyone anxious. We thought it would help the parents if they could know the college a bit more, even if it was through a virtual medium,” Nanda said.Every year, student outfits would set up help desks across the campus to help new students and introduce them to their political groups. This year, however, very few people were physically present at the camps organised by the DU students’ union (DUSU) office. “We have set up online assistance desks with volunteers to help students. Other than that, we set up a control room at the DUSU office to help those students who may not have smooth internet facilities,” said DUSU president Akshit Dahiya.The online admission process and the pandemic left another set of people unhappy -- street vendors, photocopy shop owners, and rickshaw pullers, who would otherwise look forward to this time of the year to cater to students and earn some extra bucks. Naveen Kumar, who sells tea and snacks at a small kiosk near Hansraj College, said, “We would get the maximum sales during the admission process when hundreds of students and parents visited the campus. This time we hardly have any.”Sunil, a rickshaw-puller, said he would easily make 30-35 rounds a day from Vishwavidyalaya metro station to colleges during admissions. “I hardly get 6-7 rides a day now. I was looking forward to getting some work during the admissions. It broke my heart when I got to know everything will be done through the computer now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-admission-buzz-missing-in-du-as-admissions-go-online/story-tQUVnaVhy2zYzsGdkBHDfO.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||HC tells DU to declare results of final-year open-book exam by Oct 23||The Delhi high court on Monday directed the Delhi University to declare the results of all undergraduate final year students who had appeared for the online Open Book Examination by October 23, adding that no physical collection of the mark sheets would be allowed and the university should not insist on the students to come. A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad also asked the university to declare the results of remaining two post graduate courses on or before October 31. The DU has already announced results of 16 post graduate courses. The court was hearing a petition filed by law student Prateek Sharma and the National Federation of the Blind, who wanted better facilities for physically disabled students during examinations. The court has been monitoring the examinations and has been passing orders from time to time for their smooth conduct.On Monday, DU’s counsel MS Rupal filed an affidavit in the court stating that strenuous efforts are being made to expedite the evaluation process so as to enable the examination branch to declare the results for the undergraduate and post graduate courses. He said letters and emails have been sent to the principals of the college and heads of the departments with a request to expedite the process.He also told the court that the Sanjeev Singh, head of the computer branch, who was quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19, has joined duty. He said results of 16 PG courses have been declared and the results of MSc Geology and MA Geography is almost ready and would be declared in a day or two.The court, however, said the affidavit is silent on the date for the declaration of the BA (program) results. Following this, the bench directed the varsity to declare all the results on or before November 6 after the counsel for DU said that because of the high number of students, BA (Prog) results could not be declared by October 23.The bench also said that no physical collection of the mark sheet would be allowed and there would be no footnotes on the mark sheets that would require the students to come for the physical collection of the mark sheets. With these orders, the court also disposed of the plea and said that there are no further orders required.Delhi University had conducted the final-year examinations for undergraduate students from August 1 to 31 in the online open-book mode and later in the blended method (online and physical examinations) from September 14.On September 23, the court had expressed its concern on the extended schedule of the DU in declaring the results of examinations. It had said the varsity should take all steps to expedite the results as many students have to secure admissions in other universities in the country and abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-tells-du-to-declare-results-of-final-year-open-book-exam-by-oct-23/story-ZEBmqFTimQVggt42qyOlFM.html
13-10-2020||Education||DU switches to online admission process, less than 5% applications process on day 1||Only 920 students managed to complete formalities on the first day of admissions under the first cut-off list at Delhi University (DU) colleges on Monday. To ensure restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the university is conducting the entire process online this year. Last year, on the first day of admissions, 2,026 students were able to finish the process. According to the data provided by the university, as many as 19,086 students had applied for 70,000 undergraduate seats across 60 colleges by 8pm on Monday. Of them, 1,628 applications were approved by the admission committees and only 920 of them completed the admission process after paying the fees.Officials at several colleges said slow internet connectivity and elaborate online screening process – which involves checking the mark sheets and other documents, including caste certificates – took a lot of time.In the new process, the application of students goes through the at least three levels of verification. The course in-charge of all colleges verify the minimum qualification, eligibility, cut-off requirement, and certificates uploaded by the candidates. Once it is done, the convener or admission committee of the colleges check the application and after that, the college principal approves the admission. The applicants will then have to submit the fee to complete the process. DU dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said, “Some colleges expressed concerns and we have advised them to improve internet connectivity in colleges because a number of people from the same network connect to the same portal, which slows it down. So we have asked them to arrange for additional routers. Since not all colleges faced this issue, it shows that this wasn’t a central server issue but happened at the local server level. Besides, this is the first time colleges are conducting admissions online and it was the first day.”Officials at Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College, which has announced a 100% cut-off for three admissions to Political Science, Psychology and Economics this year, refused to share the data of applications received on the first day. College principal Suman Sharma said, “It will be difficult to confirm the exact number of admissions till the process under the first cut-off gets over. We have received maximum admissions in BSc in Mathematics and Political Science (Hons) on the first day,” she said. Around 300 students had completed the admission process in the college on the first day last year. The admission process under the first cut-off will be concluded by 5pm on Wednesday. The second cut-off will be released before October 19. Hindu College approved nearly 300 applications by Monday night and more than 100 among them had paid the fee. Of them, 15 had applied in BA (Honours) in Political Science – which saw the highest cut-off in the college this year at 99.5%. “Till 6.30pm, we had received 131 applicants for Political Science, of which 52 had to be rejected. Of these 131 students, at least 36 students had submitted 100% as their best of four aggregate,” said a college official, requesting anonymity. The course has 49 seats, according to data shared by university officials.Even for BSc (Hons) in Physics in Hindu College, 28 of the 67 applicants submitted their best of four aggregate as 100%. BSc (Honours) in Physics, the cut-off for which is set at 99.33%, has 79 seats this year. “The remaining applications are still being screened. The number of approved applications may increase by tonight,” said the official.Miranda House received 737 applications, of which the maximum number (87) were for BA (Honours) in Political Science – which had a cut-off of 99%. College acting principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said on Monday night that administrative officials were still processing the data and could not provide the total number of admissions. The college had enrolled 280 students on the first day last year. “Our team is making sure that the data is checked meticulously and that is taking time. Slow internet and other accessibility issues are causing a delay in processing,” she said.Ramjas College approved 150 applications by 7pm on Monday. College principal Manoj Khanna said that 20 of them had completed the admission process. “We got maximum applications in Political Science (Hons) and BSc in Statistics on the first day. We faced few issues in verifying the CBSE mark sheets online due to which there was a delay in clearing some applications. The slow internet connectivity on the university campus also slowed down the process. We will process and approve the remaining applications by Tuesday afternoon,” he said. Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) had received 200 applications in B Com (Hons) and 130 in BA (Hons) in Economics by Monday evening. College principal Simrit Kaur said they had processed 60% of these applications. “We will approve the admissions and process the remaining applications by Tuesday afternoon,” she said, adding that the overall process went smooth and the college witnessed only marginal glitches. At Sri Venkateswara College on South Campus, nodal officer Lata N said they had approved 157 applications by the evening. “Of which 50 have paid the fees as well. Around 110 applications have been approved by the teacher-in-charges and are pending with our admissions committee. Upon clearance, they will be sent to the principal for approval,” Lata said, adding that maximum admissions on the first day have been in BA (Honours) in Political Science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/poor-internet-speeds-hit-admissions-at-du-on-day-1/story-52NOQs1K8MmAW69ieoa0VI.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi assembly peace panel resumes investigation of complaints against Facebook||The Delhi Assembly’s peace and harmony committee on Monday resumed its proceedings to investigate complaints it received against social media company Facebook for allegedly failing to take down hateful content from its platforms, especially during the Delhi riots in February.The panel questioned and recorded statements of two witnesses on Monday, both of whom said the social media giant urgently needed more transparency in its operations, functioning and grievance redressal systems.Facebook did not respond to requests for comment on the matter. Prabir Purakaystha, editor of the news website NewsClick and Pratik Sinha, author and co-founder of the non- profit fact-checking website Alt News, attended the hearing through video conference on Monday.According to a statement released by the committee, Purakaystha deposed that Facebook, through its business model allegedly thrives on the “virality” of hate as it grabs more eyeballs, so curbing hateful content on their platforms does not incentivise them.“There is an inherent conflict of interest within Facebook’s business strategy and curbing of hateful content. He [Purakayastha] also deposed that there should be more effective measures undertaken by Facebook with respect to grievance redressal mechanism as persons sending their grievances must be entitled to know as to what fate their complaint met. This will only infuse more public confidence in the platform,” read the statement, which also said the committee has been reconstituted by the Assembly Speaker with some new members, even as Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha remained its chairperson. As per the statement, Sinha said there is a “total opacity” in the functioning and structure of Facebook. He also is said to have cited various posts, which were widely shared during the Delhi riots but despite being declared fake, still exist on the platform without any requisite mark of caution. “He also emphasised that Facebook operations need to be more transparent, especially with respect to recognising the habitual offender and taking them down permanently. He also deposed that a much greater effort is required as their business model is itself proving to be a hindrance in executing their moderation policies,” the committee further stated.Monday’s hearing by the panel came after the Delhi Legislative Assembly told the Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday that it had summoned Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan as a witness to ascertain the social media platform’s views on whether it contributed in any manner to the build-up of the February 2020 communal violence in the Capital.Mohan and Facebook moved the Supreme Court on September 22 challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the peace and harmony committee. The summons stemmed from the committee’s decision to look into Facebook’s role following several foreign media reports that purported to show the social media company may have acted in a politically partisan manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-assembly-peace-panel-resumes-investigation-of-complaints-against-facebook/story-VIyfhYZPc1EMFGd4TWNkXO.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||‘Laughable’: AAP on Congress and BJP’s questioning on pollution control measures||The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday questioned the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government on the measures it has taken to curb air pollution in the Capital, allegations which the party called “laughable.”The Congress asked why a report on the causes of Delhi’s pollution that was to be prepared by the state government in collaboration with Washington University had not been released.The 18-month-long study, announced in January last year, was aimed at collecting information which would help authorities not just to get a better idea of the chemical composition of Delhi’s pollution but also identify the source of pollutants in an almost real-time manner.Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said, “The report should have come earlier this year, but there is no sign of it yet. The government has so far not announced that the project has been delayed.”Chaudhary said the Arvind Kejriwal government is “falsely blaming farmers” for the pollution in the capital. “They are trying to create confusion and fear among the people by blaming the farmers for the severe air pollution because of stubble burning without admitting the fact that a major source of pollution in Delhi is vehicular traffic. They are falsely blaming farmers. Even EPCA’s 2019 report says so. Studies done by The Energy Resource Institute and IIT-Delhi in the past few years say that vehicular pollution is the main contributor to pollution,” said Chaudhary.Praveen Shankar Kapoor, Delhi BJP spokesperson, said, “The government has collected ₹1,259 crore as ECC [environment compensation charges]. What exactly has the government done with the money? It is about time, they tell the people about what measures they have taken to curb pollution.”The state BJP said the AAP government claims about a funds shortage when it comes to the fight against pollution. “Why has the Delhi government not used the ECC funds to buy field residual (stubble) from neighbouring states?” Kapoor said.The Opposition parties said little has been done to bring down vehicular pollution in the Capital. Chaudhary said, “The government has not taken strong steps to improve public transport fleet.”An AAP spokesperson said,“These are laughable allegations There’s not a single thing that the Congress government in Punjab or BJP governments in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have done to control crop stubble burning or other major sources of pollution like themal power plants, despite repeated strictures from the Supreme Court. In fact this year, the number of farm fires has increased five times than the last year.”“On the other hand, Kejriwal govt has been a pioneer in battling air pollution which has made Delhi the only city in India where pollution has decreased by 25% in last 5 years instead of increasing,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-and-bjp-question-aap-on-pollution-control-measures/story-xItCkbKvhjsHMGlv4C07xJ.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi minister issues directives to construction agencies, orders micro-monitoring of 13 hotspots||The Delhi government has started cracking down on agencies and private individuals not following dust-control norms at construction sites even as air pollution levels saw a huge spike on Monday to push the air quality index (AQI) to 261, the highest so far this season. State environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday ordered five measures that government agencies and private individuals undertaking construction will have to follow to keep dust pollution in check at the sites. Addressing a press conference, Rai said as part of the Delhi government’s ‘anti-dust’ drive; he has been visiting construction and demolition sites across the city. Rai said while norms are in place at big construction projects operating in an area bigger than 20,000 square metres, many smaller sites were found to be ignoring dust-control measures. “Even if someone is building a house, if they take small steps such as covering the construction material and ensuring the site is sprinkled with water at regular intervals, it can make a great difference to the overall pollution levels, which tend to worsen every winter,” Rai said. Listing out the five measures, Rai said in all construction sites, irrespective of the size, 10-metre-thick metal panels will have to be installed to cover the entire site so that dust does not spread to nearby areas. Building material and the construction area will have to be covered with nets and green cloth sheets to trap its residue. “Construction agencies will have to ensure water is sprinkled inside the site and on the road outside at regular intervals. Construction sites bigger than 20,000 sqm will have to mandatorily install anti-smog guns to sprinkle water. They will make sure all vehicles carrying construction material or demolition debris are covered while in transit and when it is parked at these sites,” Rai said. Rai said soil and concrete when they spill over to the road break down into smaller particles with the constant movement of other vehicles and turn into ultra-fine particles that can enter people’s organs and bloodstream. “With Covid-19 still spreading in the city, it becomes all the more imperative that all preventive measures be taken before the winter season to avoid a spike in pollution levels,” the minister said. The wheels of vehicles carrying debris will have to be washed regularly to ensure construction residue is not circulated. Apart from keeping a watch on construction activities, the government has come up with ‘micro-monitoring’ teams to check pollution levels at Delhi’s 13 hot spots, Rai said. These hot spots are Rohini, Bawana, Dwarka, Okhla phase-2, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, RK Puram, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri, where pollution levels remain higher than other areas. “These hot spots come under nine deputy commissioners of the municipal agencies and we appointed the DCs as the nodal officers. They will keep a direct tab on any violation. Government agencies will keep in touch with these nodal officers to undertake any work in these hot spots,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-minister-issues-directives-to-construction-agencies-orders-micro-monitoring-of-13-hotspots/story-tAc9v8kTYWdXz0X2GNpcmM.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air worsens as farm fires rage, wind speed stays low||Delhi breathed the most polluted air of the season on Monday, the worst since February 26, with the air quality index (AQI) slumping to 261, in the ‘poor’ category -- which indicates breathing problems over prolonged exposure --- with low wind speed, no change in wind direction and increase in the number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana.The AQI on February 26 was recorded at 274.According to the CPCB bulletin, particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM10) was the primary pollutant in the city air on Monday. PM2.5 and PM10, dangerous microfine particles that cause a variety of cardiovascular and respiratory problems, are triggered by road dust, industrial emissions and crop residue burning. Also read: Delhi air quality remains poor for fifth consecutive day on SundayScientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the accumulation of pollutants was a result of low wind speeds over the city coupled with an increase in the incidents of stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings, the AQI on Monday rose sharply to 261 from 216 on Sunday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The early warning system of the Union ministry of earth sciences had on Sunday predicted that the air quality would improve to land in the ‘moderate’ zone on Monday and Tuesday because of a change in the wind direction. According to the forecast, Delhi will receive wind from the southeast direction, which will limit the impact of stubble burning to a minimum. There was also a forecast of wind speed of up to 12kmph, enough to disperse the accumulation of pollutants.Contrary to the forecast, the average hourly AQI started rising since early Monday morning. At 6am, the hourly average AQI was 232. It progressively increased and touched 248 at 10am and by 2pm the pollution levels had peaked to 258.Also read: Delhi pollution levels likely to dip today, reach moderate levelThe levels of PM 2.5 (ultra-fine particulate matter with diametre less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM 10 (particles with diametre less than 10 micrometres) also showed an upward trend through the day.The levels of PM 2.5 rose from 91ug/M3 at 2pm to 119ug/m3 at 8pm. The level of PM 10 peaked to reach 258.3ug/m3 at 6pm. The prescribed safe standards for PM2.5 is 60ug/m3 and 100ug/m3 for PM10. Scientists at the IMD said that Delhi on Monday was “victim to several unfavourable factors”, including a delayed change in the wind direction, low wind speed and farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. The air quality is expected to improve only “marginally” on Tuesday, scientists said.“Delhi continued to receive north-westerly winds on Monday and the surface wind speed was as low as 8kmph during the day, which was not strong enough to disperse the polluting particles. We are expecting the wind to blow from southeast direction by late Monday, which would bring some respite but the effect will only be marginal,” said a senior IMD scientist.Satellite imagery recorded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) reported the most number of farm fires in parts of Punjab and Haryana on Monday, since the harvest season began this season.Till Monday, Haryana reported 111 stubble burning cases and Punjab witnessed 700 such incidents.Pawan Gupta, research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association, said on Monday farm fires were more widespread in parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and also in parts of border areas in Pakistan.“On Monday, the crop fires were more widespread in India as well as in Pakistan. You can see hazy skies over the Indo-Gangetic plains and parts of central India. The PM 2.5 levels were also high in Delhi, Indore, Bhopal, Kanpur and Agra,” said Gupta.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the government has started “micro monitoring” of all 13 pollution hot spots in the city and will soon deploy environment marshals to check violations of norms.Rai said all construction and demolition sites, irrespective of their size, will have to compulsorily take five steps – covering the area with a 10-metre-high tin shed and the construction and demolition waste with a green shade net, covering the vehicles carrying building material and water sprinkling.He said nine deputy commissioners of municipal bodies have been appointed as nodal officers to keep an eye on the situation at the hot spots.Rai also said that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will launch spraying of “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution at Hiranki village in Narela on Tuesday. The solution that decomposes crop residue has been manufactured to control stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-air-worsens-as-farm-fires-rage-wind-speed-stays-low/story-HJzmOzCOXp9auiWBONlVVM.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||Wear N-95 masks without valve to beat pollution, Covid: Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain||With pollution levels on the rise in the city, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain urged people to wear N-95 masks without valves to protect against Covid-19 as well as pollution. “The best way to fight Covid-19 is to wear masks, maintain social distance, and practice proper hand hygiene. Wearing N-95 masks will protect people against both Covid-19 and pollution. Surgical masks are good enough to prevent Covid-19 and are also somewhat effective against pollution,” said Jain. However, caution against wearing masks with valves. With N-95 masks designed to keep out 95% of airborne particles, most come with an exhalation valve, which could act as an easy passage for germs and endanger those in close proximity if the user has an infection. The Union health ministry warns against the masks with the valves for Covid-19, as it will let out the viral particles breathed out by a person. Experts, however, said that wearing an N-95 mask may not be practical. “The minister is absolutely right technically; N95 masks are very good at keeping most airborne particles out, thereby preventing exposure to both the Sars-CoV-2 virus and pollution. But this may not be practical. One, these masks are very hard to wear for long durations: the small pore size means people have to make an effort to breathe. Two, they are expensive. These are meant for health care workers in areas with high viral load,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung hospital. He said a simple triple-layer mask is good to prevent against Covid-19 and can keep larger pollutants like PM10 and smoke out as well. The dip in Delhi’s air quality has the experts worried, with several studies showing that increase in pollution levels can lead to increasing Covid-19 mortality. “There might be an increase in the number of deaths due to Covid-19 when the pollution levels go up; that’s what the current evidence suggests. It is well known that pollution exposure compromises lung function and immunity that can lead to complications in respiratory infections,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Currently, India’s case fatality ratio – fraction of deaths among those who test positive – stands at 1.53% as compared to the global average of 2.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wear-n-95-masks-without-valve-to-beat-pollution-covid-delhi-health-minister-satyendar-jain/story-xSrvPfEUSjK5RHjPc4sfHP.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP spar over Adarsh Nagar murder||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday alleged that the female friend of Rahul Rajput, the DU student who was beaten to death by her brothers in Adarsh Nagar last week, had approached a nearby police station for help but was denied any assistance. The party threatened to take to the streets and launch a protest if strict action is not taken against the “erring officials”.AAP chief spokesperson and MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj said Delhi Police, which comes under the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled central government, was completely silent when the girl reached out for help.“The girl requested Delhi Police to help because her family members were beating up the boy but the police refused to help and told her they will not be able to interfere in this matter. The AAP wants to know from the BJP why do police stations exist in Delhi? Are these police stations here to collect money from the people or to extort people or just to be silent or to help the people and stop crimes? If the police had intervened, then Rahul would have been alive. He was the only child of his parents,” Bharadwaj said at a press conference. Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said they were looking into the allegations.“A case of murder under section 302/34 IPC was registered and five accused (two adults and three minors) were immediately apprehended and further investigation is on. It is clarified that it was a dispute between two families over a personal issue and there are no communal overtones in the matter. The area is peaceful and police are keeping a close vigil. All are requested to refrain from spreading rumours or misinformation,” Arya said. Bharadwaj said an AAP delegation led by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia met the family of Rajput. On the same day, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta too met the family members.The AAP leader alleged Gupta tried to mislead the family and tried to spread communal hatred. Bharadwaj said the girl claimed there were eight people and not five. “Delhi Police have only arrested five people in the case. After the girl spoke to the media, the police took away her sim card and destroyed it. Today, I had a word with the area DCP on the issue, and she has denied the claim. Now, this girl will not be able to contact any person,” Bhardwaj said. Rahul Rajput, a tuition teacher and a second-year BA student, was beaten to death on the night of October 7. Police official said he died due to severe internal injuries and spleen rupture.Harish Khurana, Delhi BJP spokesperson, said, “AAP and Congress are doing convenient politics in Rahul’s case. On the one hand Sanjay Singh along with MLAs went to Hathras. But in the Adarsh Nagar case, Arvind Kejriwal, who is the head of the government, and Sanjay Singh, who is a Rajya Sabha MP from Delhi, has not utter a word.Only when the BJP president went to meet the victim’ family and after pressure from society, Manish Sisodia went to meet the family.Police have already arrested the culprits and girl has been sent to Nari Niketan.But why is Delhi CM still silent and not condemned this heinous crime?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-bjp-spar-over-adarsh-nagar-murder/story-znoYYt9UUv00lhfOYN9OUP.html
13-10-2020||Delhi||Centre has stabbed farmers in the back: Delhi CM Kejriwal hits out at farm laws||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Monday joined a protest leaders of the party at Jantar Mantar against the Centre’s three new farm reform laws, which were passed in Parliament last month. The protest, organised by AAP’s Punjab unit, was attended by ministers from the Delhi cabinet, other AAP leaders from the national capital and members of the Delhi legislative assembly.Farmers in several states have protested against the laws, with the primary points of contention the absence of any mention of a minimum support price (the government-decided floor) and the freedom given to private players and others to operate in areas beyond the physical boundaries of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs).Kejriwal said AAP is opposed to the laws, called for their abolition, and suggested that a law be introduced where MSP will be applicable to all farm produce.“Through these bills, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wants to take farming away from the farmers and give it to the corporates. The farmers of Punjab gave birth to the Green Revolution by working hard and made the country self-reliant in producing and providing grains,” Kejriwal said in his address to the farmers and AAP supporters from Punjab. “This is the season of harvesting and sowing the fields, and farmers should have been in their fields. But instead of being on your fields, you have to be here at Jantar Mantar to protest. This is a blot on the society,” he continued.He reminded the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government that the party had promised, before the parliamentary elections in 2014, that it would implement the Swaminathan Committee’s report.“The BJP had promised to implement the Swaminathan report, which talks about the cost of MSP crop being 1.5 times more. But after winning the election, BJP scrapped MSP altogether. Only 6% of the crop is procured at MSP across the country, whereas 100% of the crop should be procured at MSP, and the cost of selling should be 1.5 times the production cost. What has been done is the opposite of what ought to have been done, that too without asking the farmers. You left the farmers to die by deceiving them,” he said.“The Central government has backstabbed farmers,” he alleged.He also alleged some political parties of doublespeak. “I am sad to see that some parties are playing politics over the issue. They do something in the parliament, do something else behind closed doors, and then pretend to hold protests among the public. There is a national party in Punjab with a very celebrated leader. When the BJP formed a committee to draft this bill, the party leader was present in the committee, who drafted the clauses of the bill to be passed by the Centre. But now, they are playing games and doing tractor rallies. Another party leader was a part of the cabinet that approved the bill and congratulated the BJP for passing the bill. She sat in the Lok Sabha while the bill was being passed and then resigned after the bill was passed. Do they think people do not understand their intent and actions? Now they are taking out tractor rallies and holding dharnas, against a law that is being brought and passed by themselves,” said Kejriwal.Sunita Duggal, BJP MP from Haryana’s Sirsa constituency, accused AAP of spreading misinformation. “Purchase of crops will continue at the minimum support price (MSP). The Prime Minister has himself assured this MSP rates have increased significantly between 2014-2020. Complete security of farmers has been ensured in the farm bills. The role of middlemen is completely eliminated. The Modi government is committed to double farmer’s income,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-has-stabbed-farmers-in-the-back-delhi-cm-kejriwal-hits-out-at-farm-laws/story-Boh0jXnAkMYH2U9K3sWYSP.html

As a pilot project, 2,200 systems will be installed on a first come first serve basis.Under the RESCO model, residents won’t have to spend a single penny on setting up the SPV power plant. The SPV plant will be installed by a private company.The residents will only have to give permission to set up the plant on their property. The maintenance of the equipment will be done by the private company, while the extra power generated by the plant against the power used will be paid to the company. After a period of about 15 years that will be decided through e-tender, the plant’s ownership will be transferred to the resident without any extra payment.All plots above 500 sq yards mandatorily have to get SPV power plants. But, with not many residents coming forward, Crest decided to implement the RESCO model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roof-top-solar-plants-scheme-crest-to-access-number-of-households-interested/story-9P3xVPgK7Gr2X1MU5sbcqN.html

The former vice-president leads by 10.4 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.More than 10 million Americans have already voted through mail or early voting in person according to a University of Florida study tracking the polls.Trailing in polls, the president returned to the campaign trail with an hour-long speech in Sanford, Florida, in which he sought to set at rest doubts about his recovery from the illness that has killed more 215,000 Americans and infected nearly 8 million.“I don’t have to be locked up in my basement and I wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway,” Trump said, replaying a version of an attack line he has used to belittle Biden’s careful approach to campaigning, which, in fact, is tailored to ensure the safety of the nominee, surrogates and supporters.“Now they say I’m immune. I just feel so powerful,” Trump went on to say, pushing a claim that is not grounded in science. There is no evidence to support an infected person develops any kind of immunity to being reinfected. “I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and the... I’ll just give you a big, fat kiss.”A report in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal published on Tuesday said a man in Reno, Nevada was infected twice — first in April, when he had mild symptoms, and then again in May, this time it was more severe.Biden continued to attack Trump for his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic, in two speeches in Toledo and Cincinnati in Ohio, portraying him as a president who was not upfront with the American about the gravity of the epidemic and “is only worried about the stock market, because he refuses to follow science”.He added: “His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, is unconscionable.”The two candidates hit another bunch of battleground states on Tuesday. Biden will be in Florida and Trump in Pennsylvania, a state being deemed as a “tipping point” in the 2020 race for the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-insists-he-s-immune-to-covid-as-he-resumes-campaign/story-bHDH7QIPyGTeiKhjEXSoWL.html
13-10-2020||World||White House moves forward on three arms sales to Taiwan: Report||The White House is moving forward with three sales of advanced weaponry to Taiwan, sending in recent days a notification of the deals to Congress for approval, five sources said on Monday, while China threatened retaliation.The move in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. election, first reported by Reuters, is likely to anger China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province that it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Reuters broke the news in September that as many as seven major weapons systems were making their way through the U.S. export process as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China.Leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees were notified that three of the planned weapons sales had been approved by the U.S. State Department which oversees foreign military sales, said the sources, who are familiar with the situation but declined to be identified.The informal notifications were for a truck-based rocket launcher made by Lockheed Martin Corp called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), long-range air-to-ground missiles made by Boeing Co called SLAM-ER, and external sensor pods for F-16 jets that allow the real-time transmission of imagery and data from the aircraft back to ground stations.Notifications for the sale of other weapons systems, including large, sophisticated aerial drones, land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles and underwater mines, to deter amphibious landings, have yet to reach Capitol Hill, but these were expected soon, the sources said.A State Department spokesman said: “As a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan severely damaged China’s sovereignty and security interests, urging Washington to clearly recognize the harm they caused and immediately cancel them. “China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,” Zhao told reporters in Beijing, without elaborating.CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR TAIWANThe U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees have the right to review, and block, weapons sales under an informal review process before the State Department sends its formal notification to the legislative branch.Lawmakers, who are generally wary of what they perceive as Chinese aggression and supportive of Taiwan, were not expected to object to the Taiwan sales. Taiwan’s defense ministry said it would comment only when there was formal notification of any arms sale. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the government had not yet been formally notified.“China continues to use military provocation to undermine cross-strait and regional stability, highlighting the importance of Taiwan’s strengthening of self-defense capabilities,” Ou said.News that new arms sales were moving forward came after senior U.S. officials last week repeated calls for Taiwan to spend more on its own defense and to carry out military reforms to make clear to China the risks of attempting to invade.It comes at a time when China has significantly stepped up military activity near Taiwan and as U.S.-China relations have plunged to the lowest point in decades as the U.S. election nears. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have both sought to appear tough in their approach to Beijing.Speaking on Wednesday, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, warned against any attempt to retake Taiwan by force, saying amphibious landings were notoriously difficult and there was a lot of ambiguity about how the United States would respond. The United States is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but it has not made clear whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack, something that would likely lead to a much broader conflict with Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-moves-forward-on-three-arms-sales-to-taiwan-report/story-XVg7FivksJ4qPhXX087a3J.html

Currently the community is under-represented in six vaccine clinical trials taking place across the UK. Officials said that of the 270,000 people who had signed up to the NHS Vaccine Registry (launched in July), only 11,000 volunteers are from Asian and British Asian backgrounds, and just 1,200 are Black, African, Caribbean or Black British. Thousands of people from different ages and backgrounds are urgently needed to help speed up their development and ensure they work effectively for the whole population, the officials added.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: “Coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of their background, age or race. To ensure we can find a safe and effective vaccine that works for everyone, we all need to get involved”.“That’s why we are urging more people to support our incredible scientists and join the 270,000 people who have already signed-up so we can speed up efforts to find a vaccine to defeat this virus once and for all.” he added.Maheshi Ramasamy, consultant in Infectious Diseases and Acute General Medicine and principal investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group, added: “We know that people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are disproportionately affected by Covid in terms of severe disease and mortality.”“So when we do have a vaccine that we roll out to the general population, it’s really important that we can demonstrate to people from these communities that we have evidence that the vaccine works.”The UK government set up a Vaccine Taskforce in May to ensure speedy access to clinically effective and safe vaccines, while working with partners to support international access.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-non-white-volunteers-for-covid-19-vaccine-trials/story-LFMUYkECUYGYQrrWmMW8fP.html
13-10-2020||World||India building border infra, deploying military root cause of tension: China||India’s decision to develop infrastructure and deployment of troops along the border with China are the root causes of tension, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday, adding that Beijing is against New Delhi building military facilities close to the disputed boundary. “For some time, the Indian side has been ramping up infrastructure development along the border and stepping up military deployment that is the root cause for the tensions between the two sides,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.“We urge the Indian side to earnestly implement our consensus and refrain from actions that might escalate the situation and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border,” Zhao said at the regular ministry press conference. Also read:  Pushback to Xi Jinping to reflect in US approach to ‘One China’ policy | AnalysisZhao was responding to a question on India building all-weather bridges in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh that would give access to the disputed boundary. India’s strengthening of its infrastructure in border areas along the line of actual control (LAC) comes amid the worst border tension with China in decades in eastern Ladakh, where border troops from the two countries have been locked in a faceoff since May.Several rounds of diplomatic and military-level talks have failed to resolve the situation and disengage troops.Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated 44 bridges built by the army’s Border Roads Organisation (BRO), among the 102 bridges that it is building.An Indian official told the Hindustan Times in New Delhi that 30 of the 44 bridges commissioned are on the route to the LAC from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.Zhao reiterated Beijing’s views on both the Indian regions. “First, I want to make it clear that China does not recognise the Ladakh Union Territory illegally set up by the Indian side and Arunachal Pradesh,” Zhao said.“We stand against the development of infrastructure facilities aimed at military contention along the border area. Based on the two sides’ consensus, neither should take actions along the border that might escalate the situation that is to avoid undermining the two sides’ efforts to ease the situation,” Zhao added.While China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of “south Tibet”, it had reacted strongly after India divested the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir of the special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and decided in August 2019 to bifurcate it into Union territories – J&K and Ladakh. “China has always opposed India’s inclusion of Chinese territory in India’s administrative jurisdiction in the western part of the Sino-Indian border. This position is firm, consistent and has never changed,” the foreign ministry had said in a statement.China continues to hold a grudge over the change of Ladakh’s status despite the explanation given by India that the change would not impact the LAC.During his visit to Beijing last year, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that there was no implication of the change “for either the external boundaries of India or the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. India was not raising any additional territorial claims.”“The legislative measures were aimed at promoting better governance and socio-economic development,” he had said, referring to J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-building-border-infra-deploying-military-root-cause-of-tension-china/story-HJlhvB3dUAsTYB8IdDO7cK.html
13-10-2020||World||Covid-19 reinfection casts doubt on virus immunity: Study||Covid-19 patients may experience more severe symptoms the second time they are infected, according to research released Tuesday confirming it is possible to catch the potentially deadly disease more than once.A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal charts the first confirmed case of Covid-19 reinfection in the United States -- the country worst hit by the pandemic -- and indicates that exposure to the virus may not guarantee future immunity.The patient, a 25-year-old Nevada man, was infected with two distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, within a 48-day time frame. The second infection was more severe than the first, resulting in the patient being hospitalised with oxygen support.The paper noted four other cases of reinfection confirmed globally, with one patient each in Belgium, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Ecuador. Experts said the prospect of reinfection could have a profound impact on how the world battles through the pandemic.In particular, it could influence the hunt for a vaccine -- the currently Holy Grail of pharmaceutical research. “The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity, especially in the absence of an effective vaccine,” said Mark Pandori, for the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory and lead study author. “We need more research to understand how long immunity may last for people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and why some of these second infections, while rare, are presenting as more severe.”- Waning immunity? -Vaccines work by triggering the body’s natural immune response to a certain pathogen, arming it with antibodies it to fight off future waves of infection.But it is not at all clear how long Covid-19 antibodies last. For some diseases, such as measles, infection confers lifelong immunity. For other pathogens, immunity may be fleeting at best. The authors said the US patient could have been exposed to a very high dose of the virus the second time around, triggering a more acute reaction. Alternatively, it may have been a more virulent strain of the virus. Another hypothesis is a mechanism known as antibody dependent enhancement -- that is, when antibodies actually make subsequent infections worse, such as with dengue fever.The researchers pointed out that reinfection of any kind remains rare, with only a handful of confirmed cases out of tens of millions of Covid-19 infections globally.However, since many cases are asymptomatic and therefore unlikely to have tested positive initially, it may be impossible to know if a given Covid-19 case is the first or second infection.In a linked comment to The Lancet paper, Akiko Iwasaka, a professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University, said the findings could impact public health measures.“As more cases of reinfection surface, the scientific community will have the opportunity to understand better the correlates of protection and how frequently natural infections with SARS-CoV-2 induce that level of immunity,” she said.“This information is key to understanding which vaccines are capable of crossing that threshold to confer individual and herd immunity,” added Iwasaka, who was not involved in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-reinfection-casts-doubt-on-virus-immunity-study/story-7VZkl8v7cUQ9BFp8ESr3HL.html
13-10-2020||World||Nagorno-Karabakh: Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of violating ceasefire||Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Tuesday of violating a humanitarian ceasefire agreed three days ago to quell fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh that has claimed hundreds of lives in the past two weeks. Ethnic Armenian officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said their total military death toll was 542, up 17 from Monday when reports of fresh fighting drew appeals from Russia and European Union members to respect the truce.Azerbaijan said 42 Azeri civilians had been killed and 206 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed military casualties.Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but governed and populated by ethnic Armenians.Saturday’s Russian-brokered ceasefire was aimed at allowing ethnic Armenian forces and Azerbaijan to swap prisoners and bodies of those killed in the deadliest fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh in more than 25 years.On Tuesday, the truce appeared to buckle further as Azerbaijan’s defence ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy, Terter and Aghdam, “grossly violating the humanitarian truce”.A Reuters television crew in Terter said the city centre was being shelled.“Azeri armed forces are not violating the humanitarian ceasefire,” defence ministry spokesman Vagif Dargiahly said.Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan denied the accusation. He said the Azeri side had resumed operations after an overnight lull, “supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions”.Reuters could not independently verify those report of artillery fire.The conflict is being watched abroad because it is close to Azeri gas and oil pipelines to Europe, and Turkey and Russia risk being dragged in. Russia has a defence pact with Armenia, while Turkey is allied with Azerbaijan. Turkey is not yet involved in the mediation which has for years been led by France, Russia and the United States. Ankara backs Azerbaijan’s offensive to “retake its occupied lands”.

13-10-2020||World||How long can I expect a Covid-19 illness to last?||How long can I expect a Covid-19 illness to last? It depends. Most coronavirus patients have mild to moderate illness and recover quickly. Older, sicker patients tend to take longer to recover. That includes those who are obese, or have high blood pressure and other chronic diseases.The World Health Organisation says recovery typically takes two to six weeks. One US study found that around 20 per cent of non-hospitalised individuals ages 18 to 34 still had symptoms at least two weeks after becoming ill. The same was true for nearly half of people age 50 and older.Among those sick enough to be hospitalized, a study in Italy found 87 per cent were still experiencing symptoms two months after getting sick. Lingering symptoms included fatigue and shortness of breath.Dr Khalilah Gates, a Chicago lung specialist, said many of her hospitalized Covid-19 patients still have coughing episodes, breathing difficulties and fatigue three to four months after infection.She said it’s hard to predict exactly when Covid-19 patients will return to feeling well.“The unsettling part of all this is we don’t have all the answers,” said Gates, an assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.It’s also hard to predict which patients will develop complications after their initial illness subsides.Covid-19 can affect nearly every organ, and long-term complications can include heart inflammation, decreased kidney function, fuzzy thinking, anxiety and depression.It is unclear whether the virus itself or the inflammation it can cause leads to these lingering problems, said Dr Jay Varkey, an Emory University infectious diseases specialist.“Once you get over the acute illness, it’s not necessarily over,” he said.

13-10-2020||World||Italy targets bars, restaurants, parties in new virus curbs||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a series of new curbs on nightlife, social events and amateur sports as the coronavirus pandemic intensifies throughout the country, albeit at a slower pace than in other major European nations.Conte signed a decree that focuses especially on bars and restaurants, as the government seeks to avert a new national lockdown that the economy, ravaged by one of the strictest and longest in the continent earlier this year, could ill afford.The measures include closing bars and restaurants by midnight and banning people from gathering outside them from 9 p.m., according to the decree seen by Bloomberg News. Bars with no table service must also close by 9 p.m.The curbs come amid concern that groups of young revelers are responsible for spreading contagion, as the average age of the infected has dropped. The initial European epicenter of the pandemic, Italy has seen new virus cases spike in recent weeks as the administration seeks to restart an economy that the government forecasts will contract by 9% this year.New infections numbered 4,619 on Monday, compared with 5,456 the day before, as daily tests dropped over the weekend. Pressure on hospitals is growing but patients in intensive care units are still about a tenth of the peak of more than 4,000 in early April.Receptions for events such as weddings and baptisms will be limited to a maximum of 30 people. Despite pressure by Health Minister Roberto Speranza, who told Rai television Sunday that 75% of infections occur between family members and friends, the decree stopped short of banning private parties. Instead it recommends a maximum of six people from different households taking part.At the urging of government medical advisers, amateur sports including five-a-side soccer and basketball are banned. The decree recommends businesses resort more to remote working.People who test positive for the virus will see their quarantine time cut to 10 days from 14. One negative test result after that period -- as opposed to the current two or three for symptomatic patients -- will suffice to allow a patient to exit quarantine. Earlier this month, the government again made wearing face masks outdoors compulsory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-targets-bars-restaurants-parties-in-new-virus-curbs/story-B6K2sNwcTDYmrSO56zyk0N.html

A total of 557 new cases were recorded in St. Petersburg (up from 538 on Monday) and 420 cases were confirmed in the Moscow region (down from 440 on Monday).The response center reported 244 new coronavirus-related fatalities, up from 125 on Monday, raising Russia’s total death toll to 22,966.As many as 7,550 coronavirus patients were confirmed to have recovered over the last day, up from 3,793 on Monday, bringing the total number of discharges to 1,031,785.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-covid-19-daily-growth-hits-new-record-with-13-868-new-cases/story-D78fsXULw5N94o30yDPBQI.html
13-10-2020||World||Amazon workers in Germany strike on Prime Day||A German trade union called on workers at seven Amazon warehouses to go on strike on Tuesday to coincide with the global “Prime Day” promotion event that was postponed due to operational challenges from the coronavirus pandemic.Verdi said it was organising the two-day strike as part of a long-running battle with Amazon in Germany over better pay and conditions, noting that a coronavirus bonus introduced for workers in Germany in March had been scrapped again in May.An Amazon spokesman said the majority of employees were continuing to work as normal despite the strike call. He said the company offered “excellent salaries”, with benefits and working conditions comparable with other important employers.Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany since 2013, most recently in June in protest over safety after some staff at logistics centres tested positive for the coronavirus.Germany is Amazon’s biggest market after the United States.Prime Day, typically held in July to boost summer sales, is now a kickoff to what will be an earlier holiday shopping season. The member-only discounts are a key way Amazon markets Prime, a fast-shipping and media-streaming service that incentivises subscribers to do more shopping on Amazon.A report by news site Reveal said the week around last year’s Prime Day was the most dangerous for injuries at Amazon’s fulfillment centers, prompting criticism by a prominent union. Amazon disputed the claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-workers-in-germany-strike-on-prime-day/story-hSuOWIUB30CNCY8Ng2MtWN.html
13-10-2020||World||Pushback to Xi Jinping to reflect in US approach to ‘One China’ policy | Analysis||Two of the biggest takeaways from the October 6, Quad security dialogue were that US confrontation with China over Taiwan has the potential of serious escalation and that Washington blames Beijing for not only the global pandemic but also for the economic hit on the American economy on the eve of Presidential elections.While India is legitimately worried about the on-going military stand-off with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in East Ladakh, the three other Quad powers were far more concerned about China’s bellicose moves on Taiwan. With US Navy super carriers and destroyers patrolling the South China Sea, there is serious military friction over Beijing’s bullying of Taiwan.Indo-US interlocution and diplomatic feedback from the Indo-Pacific indicates that Beijing’s “One China” mantra may come under question if US President Donald Trump returns to power, although the Biden campaign has signaled that it too will take the hard line on China. The legislation introduced in Capitol Hill over Tibet and Xinjiang, and the military moves over Taiwan and South China Sea are clear indicators that the “One China” policy could be called out by Washington — although some experts believe that the Trump administration is also applying the squeeze on China in the hope that a potential international incident could help the incumbent President in an election where he is trailing his opponent.Also Read: China has itself to blame for strong QUAD | AnalysisWhile China wants the world to recognise “One China” policy as a matter of its right, it evidently has no respect for sovereignty of others including India, Japan (Senkaku Islands) and Russia (Vladivostok). China does not recognise Ladakh but wants India to recognise its occupation of Tibet, Xinjiang and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) construction in Occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. And of course, it can always be sanctimonious over Jammu and Kashmir, more so when politically desperate Valley politicians are apparently asking Beijing to intercede on their behalf.ALSO WATCH | Cornering China: India, USA, Japan, Australia hold Quad meet amid LAC tension China watchers in New Delhi believe that the PLA aggression in Ladakh is directly linked to the security of the CPEC in PoK and Northern Areas. The PLA has made out a case that the new Ladakh map published after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019 indicates that India will put pressure on CPEC in Gilgit-Baltistan. This is also the reason that Beijing convinced Pakistan to declare Gilgit-Baltistan as the fifth province — even though this compromised Rawalpindi’s decades-old Kashmir agenda.At a subterranean level, Beijing has involved both Nepal and Pakistan for abrogating the Buddhist cultural plank from India by highlighting the place of birth of Prince Siddharth (in Nepal) and the prominent Gandhara school that flourished (in Pakistan) before Islam swept through the Af-Pak region. So what if Siddharth became Gautama Buddha in Bodh Gaya in the heart of Bihar.The world of Buddhism will be further complicated by China in the coming years over the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama. While the exiled leader continues to be popular with a Buddhist temple dedicated to him being built in Tuva in Russian Siberia, Bejing’s Sinicization of Tibet will put very serious pressure on the very institution of Dalai Lama itself in coming years.However, Beijing is least bothered about global statements. Its expansion plans have picked up steam after a weak global response to Beijing’s introduction of security laws in Hong Kong and the near-absolute silence of ASEAN countries over events in Taiwan and the South China Sea due to the massive economic clout of the middle kingdom. Beijing has refused to be part of any arms control negotiations despite rapidly growing nuclear arsenal and delivery platforms. The PLA’s cyber offensive capabilities now match the best in the world but it has no intentions of joining the proposed US-Russia cyber talks.The time has come to call out China for the global bully it is before it becomes the hegemon it wants to be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-could-amp-up-pressure-on-beijing-bring-one-china-policy-under-a-strain-analysis/story-pwRBQVnxPAFkzmc4fWiXyO.html
13-10-2020||World||Covid-19 infections near 38 million-mark: Latest updates from across the world||Over 37.7 million people across the world have been infected with coronavirus disease, with the United States being on top of the list followed by India and Brazil.According to Worldometer, the US has over eight million cases of Covid-19 and 2,20,011 deaths as on October 13. India has 7.17 million infections and nearly 110,000 deaths, according to Union health ministry, and Brazil has over five million Covid-19 cases and 1,50,709 deaths.Even as most countries are easing lockdown restrictions and reopening their economies, the virus is far from being defeated and its vaccine still not out. However, World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that a Covid-19 vaccine will be ready for registration by the end of 2020 at the earliest.Here are the latest Covid-19 updates from across the world:• The British government on Monday unveiled a three-tier plan to tackle the spread of the disease. The country was divided into three tiers of Covid-19 risk by the government with the objective to “simplify and standardise” a confusing patchwork of local rules. “The goal of the new system was to save lives without ‘shuttering our lives and our society’ through a new national lockdown,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.• Britain can very soon begin carrying out studies that would intentionally infect healthy people with Covid-19 to help researchers in coming up with a vaccine. Thousands of volunteers from across the country have shown willingness to be a part of the study. “I think the potential successes of the trials outweigh that small risk to myself,” Greer, a 20-year-old student who wishes to volunteer, said.• Meanwhile, the WHO has warned against the idea that herd immunity might be a realistic strategy to stop the pandemic, dismissing such proposals as “simply unethical,” according to news agency Associated Press.• Adding to the list of advanced stage trials of Covid-19 vaccines halted, Johnson & Johnson paused its study on Monday, citing an “unexplained illness” of a participant. The company’s physicians and a safety monitoring panel would try to determine the reason behind the illness, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. Trials of AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s vaccine candidate were also halted last month. They have resumed in almost all countries now.• According to billionaire Bill Gates, life will become normal only after the second generation of Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. Normalcy can return “when we have, not the first generation of vaccines, but one that is super-effective,” he told NBC.• Union health minister of India Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said that India is likely to have a vaccine against the coronavirus disease by early next year. “We’re expecting that early next year we should have vaccine in the country from maybe more than one source. Our expert groups are formulating strategies to plan on how to roll out the distribution of the vaccine in the country,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.• WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan also said that a vaccine against the disease will be ready for registration by the end of 2020 or early next year at the earliest.• About 40 vaccine candidates are now in some stage of clinical trials, and 10 of them are in late-stage phase three trials, which will tell us about both the efficacy and the safety, Swaminathan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infections-near-38-million-mark-latest-updates-from-across-the-world/story-n5RFoyywJsNe3LNt8HKUMJ.html
13-10-2020||World||Europe recording more daily Covid-19 cases than India, shows data||Europe is witnessing a resurgence in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The continent was able to control the spread of the disease, but is now reporting more daily cases than the United States, Brazil or India.After falling during the summer, coronavirus cases are rising in the United Kingdom as winter approaches, with northwest and northeast England seeing the steepest increases. Liverpool has one of the country’s most severe outbreaks, with about 600 cases per 1,00,000 people, even more than the hard-hit European cities of Madrid and Brussels.The British government has carved England into three tiers of coronavirus risk in a bid to slow a resurgent outbreak, putting the northern city of Liverpool into the highest-risk category and shutting its pubs, gyms and betting shops.Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a three-tier lockdown plan, which he said designed to “simplify and standardise” a confusing patchwork of local rules. Johnson said hospitals are now filling up with more Covid-19 patients than in March, when he ordered a national lockdown.The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,875. In other countries like Czech Republic, government has put new measures in place to curb the fast spread of Covid-19 cases. Bars, restaurants and clubs have been ordered to close from Wednesday and schools shifted to distance learning.The Czech Republic is experiencing the strongest surge in Europe when adjusted for population as the number of infections detected since the outbreak began has soared to nearly 1,20,000, from around 25,000 at the beginning of September.Hospitals in the country are starting to feel that strain as the number of patients have doubled since the start of October to over 2,000.The surge in new virus cases continued in the Netherlands, with a record 6,854 cases, confirmed in the 24 hours until Monday morning, news agency ANP reported, citing the country’s health agency. More than 41,000 cases were reported in the past seven days. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to announce stricter measures on Tuesday.In France, the number of people being treated in intensive care units for Covid-19 exceeded 1,500 on Monday for the first time since May 27, authorities said, raising fears of local lockdowns being imposed across the country.Till October 12, Europe has recorded more than 6.4 million cases of the coronavirus disease. The same day, it recorded 87,100 new Covid-19 cases, according to World Health Organisation (WHO). Last Thursday, Europe had surpassed 1,00,000 daily reported Covid-19 cases for the first time.India, meanwhile, continues to witness a decline in the number of daily cases of the coronavirus disease. On Tuesday, the country recorded 55,342 new infections, the lowest in nearly two months, according to figures released by the ministry of health and family welfare. On Monday (October 12), India’ daily caseload was 66,732.In the morning, the ministry had said that India’s average daily Covid-19 cases have been declining for the past five weeks.The United States recorded 53,055 cases of the coronavirus disease on October 12, according to WHO, while Brazil’s daily caseload stood at 26,749.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-recording-more-daily-covid-19-cases-than-india-shows-data/story-B4USMs3nrRV3yATY3vf1qK.html
13-10-2020||World||UK moves closer to infect healthy people with Covid-19 to aid vaccine efforts||Alex Greer says he’d rather put himself directly in the path of the coronavirus than get blindsided by the disease after an evening at the pub or with friends. It’s a scenario that could soon become a reality.Britain is moving closer to carrying out studies that would intentionally infect healthy people with the virus to help researchers in their quest for Covid-19 vaccines, and thousands of volunteers like Greer, a chemistry student at Durham University in northeast England, are ready to go. Open Orphan Plc, parent of human challenge trial specialist hVivo, has said it’s in talks with potential customers including the UK to conduct tests of Covid shots.Such studies may help speed development of vaccines and give scientists new insights into a disease that has spread to more than 37 million people globally, but would expose participants to a threat for which there’s no cure. Numerous questions about the virus -- which volunteers would likely have sprayed into their noses -- remain unanswered. Even young people could face dangers.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “I can’t lie and say it doesn’t cross my mind,” said Greer, 20. “The long-term consequences of Covid aren’t fully researched yet and that does need to be taken into account. But I think the potential successes of the trials outweigh that small risk to myself.”Despite recent strides in treating Covid-19, experts disagree on whether challenge trials are justifiable. One uncertainty is why some young and otherwise healthy people end up with complications months after experiencing mild symptoms, according to Seema Shah, a bioethicist at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and Northwestern University.Crossing a Line“This would really cross a line that people have drawn in terms of when it’s ethically acceptable to do challenge studies,” she said. “In the past, it’s been about diseases that we know a lot more about. We’re still learning so much about Covid-19.”Companies such as AstraZeneca Plc -- the University of Oxford’s partner in an experimental coronavirus vaccine -- suggested earlier this year that declining infection rates could make it harder to do conventional tests that wait for people to catch the virus naturally in the wider community. Yet Covid continues spreading, allowing a number of projects to sprint into the final stage of clinical trials.Front-runners Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca say they have no plans to do challenge studies. Other vaccine makers like Johnson & Johnson are eyeing them cautiously. The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, partner of biotech company Moderna Inc., has started manufacturing a strain of the virus that could be used for challenge studies and is investigating technical and ethical considerations.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We will only go in this direction if the ethical, the medical and the safety parameters are clear,” said Thomas Lingelbach, chief executive officer of Valneva SE, a French company working on another experimental Covid shot.Comparing EfficacyThe idea is gaining momentum. 1DaySooner, a group that advocates on behalf of people who want to join challenge studies, says it has attracted more than 38,000 volunteers. UK studies would likely be the first such tests in the world for Covid-19.“I’m sure it will happen,” said Robin Shattock, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London. “The difficulty is to know what it actually will achieve and whether it will make anything quicker.”Various forms of human challenge studies have been used for centuries, but proper practices and guidance for ethics and safety were only adopted about 50 years ago. The approach was key to vaccine development for diseases such as cholera, malaria and typhoid.No deaths have been recorded from challenge trials in recent decades, research shows, and studies have been performed safely in tens of thousands of consenting volunteers. Unlike Covid-19, however, many of the diseases targeted by these trials had well established treatments.Challenge studies could play an important role as scientists look to build on the first generation of Covid inoculations, according to Northwestern’s Shah. They might offer a way to compare efficacy, allowing the best prospects to advance in larger studies, and tackle questions such as the persistence of vaccine-induced immunity.National SupportUK support, along with therapies like Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir for patients who get sick, would provide a boost for the campaign. Eli Lilly & Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. last week asked U.S. regulators for emergency-use authorizations for their antibody treatments, and many other companies are advancing with potential weapons as well.“If the UK can be involved in human challenge trials, we’ll be leading in this area of science,” said Jennifer Wright, a 29-year-old volunteer who’s pursuing her PhD in physics at the University of Glasgow. “It should be the countries with the most money who lead these kinds of efforts, because we are the ones who presumably won’t suffer as much.”The issue is heating up as the virus advances and governments push for a way out of worsening economic damage to travel, tourism, retail and many other industries. The risks would be minimized as much as possible by selecting younger people who don’t have underlying health conditions, and keeping volunteers under constant observation, according to proponents.“There’s pretty clear evidence across the world it’s young people who are least susceptible to severe disease,” said Adrian Hill, director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute. “Everyone would agree that it would be nice to have something more than remdesivir, but it’s not even clear if you would need remdesivir.”Such studies in the U.S. wouldn’t replace large final-stage trials, according to the NIAID. Data from ongoing conventional trials will be available toward the end of 2020 and will be used to assess future challenge studies “should they be needed and deemed safe and ethical to employ,” the agency said in an email.Any UK plan would still need to overcome hurdles including approval from regulators and an independent ethics committee.“Given the state we are in with respect to the epidemic and the urgent need for multiple efficacious vaccines, I think there remains a very compelling case for proceeding,” said Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.The main question is whether the studies would clearly “make a big difference,” said Northwestern’s Shah. “I just don’t know yet whether there’s a solid rationale for moving forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-moves-closer-to-infect-healthy-people-with-covid-19-to-aid-vaccine-efforts/story-nfWQNs4GGcRtAN8EzjPtEM.html
13-10-2020||World||Malaysia’s Anwar meets king in bid to form new government||Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim met the nation’s king on Tuesday in a bid to form a new government after claiming he had secured a majority in Parliament.Anwar said he would present the monarch with “strong and convincing” documentary evidence of the support he has from lawmakers, which would allow him to unseat Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.But he did not speak to reporters gathered at the gate after spending about an hour at the palace, and instead his party said he will hold a hold a news conference “regarding an important announcement post-audience with His Majesty.”Muhyiddin, who took power in March after securing enough support in Parliament to unseat Anwar’s reformist alliance, has dismissed Anwar’s claim to a majority. Muhyiddin currently boasts a slim two-seat majority and has been grappling to maintain support amid infighting in his coalition.Allies in Muhyiddin’s ruling coalition have denied supporting Anwar, and branded Anwar a “desperado” for seeking to wrest power as the country struggles with the coronavirus.The audience with the king was slated three weeks ago, but postponed as the king was hospitalized. Anwar has been tight-lipped and said he would only reveal details after meeting the king.“I frankly do not think it will be a smooth and easy ride for Anwar. For one, even if the king is convinced of Anwar’s command of parliamentary majority, the king still has the alternative constitutional option of dissolving the parliament,” said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.Oh, a Malaysian, said support for Anwar could also have waned as Muhyiddin’s camp may have lured back defectors in the past three weeks.Before leaving home Tuesday morning, Anwar tweeted a picture of himself and his wife. “Hopefully it will be a smooth affair today,” he wrote.Anwar’s Alliance of Hope was elected in 2018 but collapsed after Muhyiddin withdrew his party and tied up with opposition parties to form a Malay-centric government in March. Then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned in protest, saying he wouldn’t work with parties accused of corruption that he ousted in the 2018 polls.If Anwar succeeds, it will mark a dramatic comeback after his roller-coaster political journey since the 1990s.Once a high flyer in the ruling party, Anwar was convicted of homosexual sodomy and corruption after a power struggle with Mahathir in 1998. He was imprisoned for a second time for sodomy in 2014.Anwar and his supporters have long denied the sodomy allegations, saying they were concocted to destroy his political career.Rather than give up, Anwar ended his feud with Mahathir from his prison cell to forge a the Alliance of Hope, which in the 2018 polls defeated the coalition that had led Malaysia for 61 years.Mahathir became premier a second time. Anwar was freed with a royal pardon days after the polls and was Mahathir’s designated successor before their alliance fell apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-s-anwar-meets-king-in-bid-to-form-new-government/story-xlDwJV0uos5xTgOVpy5m9M.html
13-10-2020||World||Pfizer modifies protocol for virus vaccine study to include more young participants||Drugmaker Pfizer has again modified the protocol for its late-stage study of its vaccine against the new coronavirus, this time to include more young participants.The company said on Monday that it’s received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to include adolescents aged 12 through 15 in its global Covid-19 vaccine study.New York-based Pfizer originally planned for 30,000 participants, but in September expanded that to 44,000 people. That increase was made to boost diversity in the trial population, specifically by including 16- and 17-year-old teens, as well as stable patients with some common chronic infections: hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.Pfizer’s trial also includes significant numbers of Hispanic, Black, Asian and Native American participants, plus many people aged 56 through 85. The diversity is aimed at providing information on how safe and effective the experimental vaccine is in people of different ages and backgrounds.

13-10-2020||World||Alvin Cole killing: No reason to fire officer who fired fatal shot, says police chief||The police chief of a Milwaukee suburb that has seen protests and unrest since an officer was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a Black teenager in February said Monday that he sees no reason why the officer should be fired.Joseph Mensah, who is also Black, fatally shot 17-year-old Alvin Cole on Feb. 2 outside the Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa. Cole was the third person Mensah shot and killed since joining the police force five years ago.Milwaukee County’s district attorney announced last week that like the first two fatal shootings, Mensah would not be charged in Cole’s death. In his report, he noted that officers said Cole pointed a gun at them and refused to drop it, and that Mensah could successfully argue he fired in self-defense.Although Mensah won’t face charges, the Wauwatosa Police and Fire Commission is considering firing him. The commission asked an independent investigator, former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic, to look into a complaint filed by the family of one of the men Mensah killed.In a report provided to The Associated Press by Cole’s family’s attorney, Biskupic recommended that Mensah be fired because he felt the risk was too great that Mensah would fatally shoot someone else, which would create “an extraordinary, unwarranted and unnecessary risk” to the city and police department.After five nights of protests and sporadic unrest, police Chief Barry Weber said during an online news conference Monday that he disagrees with Biskupic’s recommendations because Mensah was found to have acted legally when he used deadly force in all three shooting deaths.“I’ve never heard of any police officer ever being disciplined for something they may or may not do in the future,” Weber said, noting that the decision is ultimately up to the commission to decide.“Joseph Mensah’s been cleared by the district attorney in three different cases. There’s been no reason to this point, and none that I can see, (for why) he should be removed from the force,” the chief said.Kimberley Motley, the Cole family’s attorney, rejected Weber’s position, again calling Mensah “unfit” and renewing her call that he and the chief be fired.“I think that position of the chief is another reason why he needs to be terminated as well,” Motley said, adding: “Joseph Mensah is not credible and neither is Chief Weber.”Mayor Dennis McBride, who also spoke at the news conference, openly questioned in the past whether Mensah should remain on the force. But on Monday, he declined to say where he now stands, explaining that he didn’t want to put additional pressure on the police and fire commissioners.“I’m not a police officer, I’m not a psychologist. I’m a mayor, I’m a lawyer. Those things don’t qualify me to judge (the) fitness of police officers,” McBride said.Mensah’s attorney, Jonathan Cermele, did not immediately return a call for comment.The decision to not charge Mensah in Cole’s death sparked five nights of protests in Wauwatosa, including a gathering Sunday that was much more peaceful than protests last week in which demonstrators clashed with police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them.Cole was the third person Mensah has killed on the job since he joined the force in 2015. He shot Antonio Gonzales in 2015 after police said Gonzales refused to drop a sword. A year later, Mensah shot Jay Anderson Jr. in a car parked in a park after hours. Mensah said he saw a gun on the passenger seat and thought Anderson was reaching for it. He was cleared of wrongdoing in each case.The protests in Wauwatosa are just the latest in a series of demonstrations against police racism and brutality that have erupted across the country since George Floyd’s death. Floyd, who was Black, died in May after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes despite Floyd’s pleas for air.___Associated Press writer Doug Glass contributed from Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alvin-cole-killing-no-reason-to-fire-officer-who-fired-fatal-shot-says-police-chief/story-ZMZqV2MG3qMeD9ugTV13CK.html
13-10-2020||World||Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot: 5 accused to face hearings||Five men accused in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will appear in federal court Tuesday for a hearing on whether they should be detained before trial.U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Berens will oversee the bail and detention proceeding in Grand Rapids for Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta — all Michigan residents. A sixth man, Barry Croft, was being held in Delaware.The FBI made arrests last week after using confidential sources, undercover agents and clandestine recordings to foil the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Some defendants had conducted coordinated surveillance of the Democratic governor’s vacation home in northern Michigan in August and September, according to a criminal complaint.The men were trying to retaliate against Whitmer due to her “uncontrolled power” amid the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said. They said four of the men had planned to meet last week to pay for explosives and exchange tactical gear.Whitmer, who was considered as Joe Biden’s running mate and is nearly halfway through a four-year term, has been widely praised for her response to the virus outbreak but also sharply criticized by Republican lawmakers and people in conservative areas of the state. The Capitol has been the site of many rallies, including ones with gun-toting protesters calling for her ouster.Whitmer put major restrictions on personal movement and the economy, although many of those limits have been lifted since spring.Fox, who was described as one of the leaders, was living in the basement of a vacuum shop in Grand Rapids. The owner said Fox was opposed to wearing a mask during the pandemic and kept firearms and ammunition at the store.The defendants face up to life in prison if convicted.Seven others linked to a paramilitary group called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged in state court for allegedly seeking to storm the Michigan Capitol and providing material support for terrorist acts by seeking a “civil war.”The investigation is ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-5-accused-to-face-hearings/story-ZojS2GdgQnlwg1CCCdxtiL.html

The participant’s “unexplained illness” is being investigated by the company and a statement was issued in this regard on Monday.Accidents and other so-called adverse events “are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies,” the company said in the statement, adding that its physicians and a safety monitoring panel would try to determine the reason behind the illness, reported news agency Associated Press.While few stoppages of this nature are made public in typical drug trials, Covid-19 vaccine trials have very high stakes as worldwide infection cases have crossed 37 million. Over 1 million people have lost their lives due to the virus.This is the second such instance in which trials for a late-stage study have been halted. AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s vaccine testing is on hold in the US as officials examine whether an illness in its trial poses a safety risk. In other places, however, trials have resumed.WATCH | Covid update: Trump says he’s immune; new inhaler vaccine; India new flights This trial was stopped when a woman developed severe neurological symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis, a rare inflammation of the spinal cord, the company said.Health news site STAT was the fist to report the pause of J&J’s vaccine candidate trial.

The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states where they are in lockdown,” he said at a rally in Sanford, Florida.Trump was referring to remarks by WHO envoy David Nabarro, who was quoted in recent media reports as saying that restrictive measures like the lockdowns should only be treated as a last resort. He also said that lockdowns have severely impacted countries that rely on tourism.US president said that China, which has 1.4 billion people is paying USD 39 million per year to WHO in contrast to the US that is paying about USD 500 million.“I took us out of the WHO because they were wrong about everything. Although, they corrected themselves--they say I was right about the lockdowns. (I asked) Why are we paying USD 500 million a year and China which has 1.4 billion people is paying USD 39 million per year -- they couldn’t explain so I took us out,” he said.Trump further attacked the World Health Organisation saying that they are being dominated by Beijing. “China dominates them and I said it doesn’t work that way anymore. They will take us back in so fast with less money,” he said.Trump had this July pulled out his country from the WHO after he criticised the body for covering up the outbreak of Covid-19, which first emerged in China last year. The US has also backed out of a joint global effort led by the WHO to develop, manufacture and distribute a vaccine to cure coronavirus.Meanwhile, earlier on Twitter, he urged New York and other Democrat governors to open up from the lockdown.“The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up, New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-china-dominated-who-says-was-right-on-not-imposing-covid-lockdowns/story-PPeX2yLpQQFLqmbbW9nfEL.html
13-10-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson shuts pubs in parts of England with new Covid-19 curbs||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a tiered system of further restrictions on parts of England on Monday, including shutting pubs, to curb an acceleration in Covid-19 cases, though anger was rising at the cost of the curtailment of freedoms.Johnson announced a new three-tiered system in an attempt to standardise a patchwork of often complicated and confusing restrictions imposed across England. Lawmakers will vote on the move on Tuesday.The lockdowns will include shutting pubs and bars and banning wedding receptions in areas placed in the “very high” alert level from Wednesday. The other alert levels in the new system are “medium” and “high”. So far, Merseyside in northwest England - which includes the city of Liverpool - is the only area classified at the “very high” level. Gyms, leisure centres, casinos, betting shops and adult gaming centres there will also close, Johnson said. Also Read: Covid: Britain’s hospitality industry sets legal challenge to lockdown curbs“We must act to save lives,” Johnson told parliament, adding that he did not want another national lockdown and that he understood the frustrations of those chafing at the “repressions of liberty”. “If we let the virus rip, then the bleak mathematics dictate that we would suffer not only an intolerable death toll from Covid, but we would put such a huge strain on our NHS (National Health Service) with an uncontrolled second spike that our doctors and nurses would simply be unable to devote themselves to other treatments.”“NARROW PATH”Health officials say the freshest data showed infections were rising across the north of England and in some more southerly areas too, while the virus was creeping up age bands towards the elderly from those aged 16-29 years.Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, said the standard restrictions that would apply to very high risk areas would not be enough to control the outbreak there, and urged local authorities to go further.“The base will not be sufficient ... but there are additional things that can be done within that guidance,” he said.Schools, restaurants and most workplaces will remain open even in the “very high” risk areas.Manchester intensive care consultant Jane Eddleston said 30% of critical care beds were taken up with Covid-19 patients and this was starting to affect healthcare for others. Also Read: UK unveils 3-level lockdown plan; Liverpool at highest risk“This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and massive human and indeed economic cost of an uncontained epidemic,” Johnson said.The three-tiered system applies only to England as devolved authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have responsibility for their own health arrangements.Britain’s large hospitality sector says it is being brought to its knees by the restrictions.Karen Strickland, landlady of The Grapes pub in Liverpool, said their income was already down by 70% with the current enforced countrywide closing time of 10 p.m., and the government’s support scheme help was not enough. “It’s absolutely horrendous,” she said.Under the new restrictions, pubs that serve meals will be allowed to stay open, though they will only be able to serve alcohol as part of such a meal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-shuts-pubs-in-parts-of-england-with-new-covid-19-curbs/story-jztUyvgiYjFbpCzExj9tDM.html
13-10-2020||World||‘Normalcy only when second generation of Covid-19 vaccine is out’: Bill Gates||Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has given a gloomy picture for the world looking to get to normal after being hit by the coronavirus pandemic.In a television programme, the billionaire said that life will get back to normal only when a second generation of Covid-19 vaccine become available.Gates told NBC that normalcy can return “when we have, not the first generation of vaccines, but one that is super-effective”. He also said that the second generation vaccine should also be widely available. “Only then all the problems created by Covid-19 can be solved,” he added.Gates’ comments come as the world is racing towards finding a vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which has affected millions across the globe.AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine is one of the most advanced candidates in the race against the novel coronavirus.The British drugmaker has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.Developed by the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, the vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate.Pfizer has, meanwhile, again modified the protocol for its late-stage study of its vaccine, this time to include more young participants.The company said on Monday that it’s received permission from the Food and Drug Administration in the United States to include adolescents aged 12 through 15 in its global Covid-19 vaccine study.New York-based Pfizer originally planned for 30,000 participants, but in September expanded that to 44,000 people. Pfizer’s trial also includes significant numbers of Hispanic, Black, Asian and Native American participants, plus many people aged 56 through 85.Last month, in an email interview to Hindustan Times, Gates had spoken about vaccine development and the protection it will provide. “It’s too soon to make predictions about how long protection might last. At this point, we don’t have enough data on the duration of antibody and T-cell response to the disease itself, let alone to the various vaccine candidates. Many of the vaccine trials underway should start to report efficacy data in the next few months, which will start to provide answers to these critical questions,” Gates had said.“The good news is that there is a large portfolio of vaccines in testing, each with a different approach. This gives the greatest possible chance to develop effective vaccines,” he had further said.Read the full interview hereOn October 6, he had said that rich countries could be back to close to normal by late 2021 if a Covid-19 vaccine works, is ready soon and distributed properly at scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/normalcy-only-when-second-generation-of-covid-19-vaccine-is-out-bill-gates/story-j96EWApnUeW827lfiEORZJ.html
13-10-2020||World||Columbus Day: Protesters knock down Roosevelt, Lincoln statues in Portland||Protesters in Portland overturned statues of former Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln and vandalized the Oregon Historical Society in a declaration of “rage” toward Columbus Day.Protest organizers dubbed the event “Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage,” in response to Monday’s federal holiday named after 15th-century Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, a polarizing figure who Native American advocates have said spurred centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas.The group Sunday night threw chains around Roosevelt’s statue, officially titled “Theodore Roosevelt, Rough Rider.” They splashed red paint on the monument and used a blowtorch on the statue’s base, news outlets reported.The statue was pulled down by the crowd just before 9 p.m. The group later turned their attention toward Lincoln’s statue, pulling it down about eight minutes later.Historians have said Roosevelt expressed hostility toward Native Americans, once saying: “I don’t go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are ...”Protesters spray-painted “Dakota 38” on the base of Lincoln’s statue, referencing the 38 Dakota men Lincoln approved to have hanged after the men were involved in a violent conflict with white settlers in Minnesota.After toppling the statues, the crowd smashed windows at the Oregon Historical Society and later moved onto the Portland State University Campus Public Safety office.A quilt sewn by 15 Black women from Portland in the mid-1970s was among the items damaged, Oregon Historical Society executive director Kerry Tymchuk said Monday in a statement.Each square of the Afro-American Heritage Bicentennial Commemorative Quilt honors a Black individual or moment in history. The quilt that had been given to the museum for safekeeping was found a few blocks away and will be assessed for damage, Tymchuk said.“As we clean up broken glass, scrub paint, and make plans to ensure safety in our building, we also, as always, welcome critique of our work,” Tymchuk wrote. “We would be grateful to have constructive feedback from all those who are willing and able to aid OHS in fulfilling our vision of an Oregon story that is meaningful to all Oregonians.”Three people were arrested by police who said in a statement that multiple businesses were damaged, including a restaurant that had at least two bullets fired through its front windows.In New Mexico, protesters on Monday tore down a historical monument as part of demonstrations in the state and in neighboring Arizona meant to mark Indigenous Peoples Day. Protesters used a rope and chain to topple an obelisk in Santa Fe long a point of contention for its references to the “heroes” who died in battle with “savage Indians.”The monuments are the latest statues to come down in a wave of removed monuments and protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/columbus-day-protesters-knock-down-roosevelt-lincoln-statues-in-portland/story-1sKAe4PMlJ6I6cNp6RylIL.html

She further referred to Khan as a “handpicked” person, she said that he did not care about the people.“The handpicked one is only concerned with himself and always wants to silence his opponents,” she said. “The handpicked one does not concern himself with the masses.”She called the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) as the “need of the hour” adding that it had been established because as a result of pressure from the masses against the measures of those in power.Maryam further said that there was no division within the party and added that the party president Shahbaz Sharif “had a different approach” which has been the case for a while.“Shahbaz Sharif is like a father to me, I do not see him any different than my father... There is no rift within the PML-N, the entire party stands behind Nawaz Sharif,” she said.She added, “Shahbaz went to jail because he did not leave his brother alone... The Sharifs have always been on pone page and will continue to remain so. Those who have tried to cause a rift between the Sharif brothers have always tasted failure.”According to Geo News, the party vice president rejected allegations about her father, Nawaz Sharif. “Mian sahab’s narrative is exactly the same as Quaid-e-Azam’s narrative,” she said.“Asking the questions that Mian sahab has asked does not amount to treason.” With regard to returning to Pakistan, she added that he would return once doctors allow him.

13-10-2020||World||Need to revive spirit of bipartisanship in US: Joe Biden||There is an urgent need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in the US, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said as he blamed the policies of President Donald Trump for dividing Americans. Addressing a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is a battle ground State, Biden said America needed a leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communication and bring them back together. “We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country,” the former vice president said on Monday. Biden’s campaign is very restrictive due to the strict enforcement of social distancing measures because of coronavirus pandemic. “I know that sounds bizarre in light of where we are. A spirit of being able to work with one another. It’s time to unite America, and we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear, science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division. Democracy requires consensus. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president,” Biden,77, asserted. He said that more than 214,000 Americans had died so far due to Covid-19 because of the policies of Trump. “He told Bob Woodward he didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panicked. Trump is the one who panicked. Reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis as well has been unconscionable,” he said. “The longer Donald Trump is president the more reckless he gets. Dr Fauci, most respected person in this area in the country referred to the president’s announcement event for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden as a super spreader event. Publicly criticising it. How is the president responding? He’s running a national ad here in Cincinnati and all across the country quoting Dr. Fauci out of context,” he said. As a consequence of overwhelming lying, misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Trump, how many empty chairs are going to be around dinner table tonight because of their negligence? Biden asked. He, however, said that there was a silver lining. “Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity like America has done unlike any other country after every crisis, we’ve always come out of the crisis stronger than we were before we went in. That’s uniqueness of who we are. We now have an opportunity to build back and build back better. To give everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. Begin to reward work not just wealth,” Biden said. “For example, for communities of colour here in Cincinnati and all across the country the question is how do we break the cycle? Where in good times they lag in bad times they get hit first and hardest and in recovery they’re the last and toughest to bounce back - the answer is justice. Justice. Criminal justice, police reforms,” he said. Biden said the US was strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for “our families and small businesses” that too often bare the brunt of looting and burning, which are never justified. He said America needed a leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communication and bring them back together and to heal and to hope. “As president that’s precisely what I will do. That’s a president’s job. It just goes beyond the issue of police community relations. Goes about being able to compete and build wealth. “It’s about jobs. Good-paying jobs. Financial stability. Families of colour building wealth and being able to pass it down like my Irish Catholic folks were able to do in Scranton coming up from nothing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-to-revive-spirit-of-bipartisanship-in-us-joe-biden/story-1S8OIABkMkL7l3sYGVHtFK.html

13-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Donald Trump boasts at Florida campaign rally of feeling ‘so powerful’||President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail on Monday night, boasting at a rally in Florida that he felt “so powerful” after his recovery from Covid-19 that he wanted to walk into the audience and “kiss everyone.”“I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support,” Trump said at the outdoor rally at the Orlando Sanford International Airport, where there was little social distancing though some spectators wore masks. “Twenty-two days from now we’re going to win this state, we’re going to win four more years at the White House.”The crowd at one point broke into a chant of “we love you” as Trump renewed his attacks on his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.“Now they say I’m immune. I feel so powerful. I’ll walk into that audience. I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and the -- everybody,” Trump said.Hours earlier, his doctor said Trump had tested negative for Covid-19 on consecutive days. In a memo released by the White House, Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said the tests, along with guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, informed the conclusion that Trump “is not infectious to others.”Trump’s trip to Florida was part of an effort to reverse his slide in polls in the key swing state. Biden is leading Trump in Florida by 3.7 percentage points in a RealClearPolitics average of nine polls taken since late last month -- a reversal of fortune for the president in a state he narrowly won in 2016.The Florida event, along with three others planned this week, threaten to advance the spread of the coronavirus, Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, warned in an interview on CNN earlier Monday.The virus hit the Sunshine State especially hard and has contributed to the president’s declining popularity. His decision to resume large-scale rallies risks reinforcing perceptions that he’s been cavalier about a disease that has killed 215,000 Americans and sent the economy into recession.Trump sought to energize the crowd by highlighting the partisan battle over his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.“A lot of people said I was elected because of the Supreme Court,” Trump said Monday night. “but if it is true, it is more true now than it was four years ago.”The president and his campaign aides believe Barrett’s confirmation hearings can be a turning point with just three weeks until Election Day, activating conservative and religious voters who care deeply about the composition of the high court.The focus on Barrett also seeks to increase pressure on Biden to endorse or reject a plan favored by liberals to pack the high court with additional justices if he and his party recapture the White House and control of the Senate. Biden has declined to answer questions on expanding the number of justices.But rallies were a crucial element of Trump’s upset victory in 2016, and polls suggest the president would need to capture similar magic in the final weeks of this year’s campaign if he hopes to be re-elected.Biden holds a 54%-42% lead nationally among likely voters, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday. Trump’s diagnosis further cemented voters’ unease about his handling of the pandemic.Two-thirds of registered voters say the president failed to take appropriate precautions against the virus, 62% distrust his comments about the disease, and 73% say they’re worried that they or an immediate family member will contract Covid-19.Biden and other Democrats have been hammering Trump over his decision to resume rallies, where there is typically little effort among the audience to socially distance. Biden said in a statement before the event that Trump brought to Florida “reckless behavior, divisive rhetoric and fear mongering.”The president’s team is banking on the Barrett nomination to move the race back onto more favorable terrain.“This is a big deal, not just for the court, not just for the country, but also for the campaign politically, it’s given a real shot in the arm to our grassroots efforts,” said Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien.But the pervasive impact of coronavirus was looming over the opening day of Barrett’s confirmation hearing on Monday, underscoring the challenge at hand. Coverage of the opening day focused on the appearance of Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican who attended the proceedings despite testing positive for coronavirus earlier this month.Lee was one of 11 people -- including fellow Judiciary Committee members Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- known to have contracted the virus after attending a White House event celebrating Barrett’s nomination.Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican locked in a tight re-election battle, chaired the hearing days after refusing to submit to a coronavirus test before a debate with his Democratic opponent. And 87-year-old Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley has also refused to get tested despite interactions with other committee members who contracted the disease. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris appeared at the hearing virtually, citing concerns over the infection risk.Recovery as Political Asset?Trump has even pitched his recovery from the virus as a political asset, claiming that, unlike Biden, he was now “immune” to the deadly disease. The president’s repetition of that claim on Twitter prompted the social media network to add a disclaimer to his post.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that it has “limited information about reinfections with the virus that causes Covid-19.” It said there were no confirmed reports of reinfection within three months of initial infection, suggesting that recovery from the novel coronavirus may be like other similar diseases that offer some level of immunity.Before he began speaking in Florida on Monday night, Trump tossed masks into the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-donald-trump-boasts-at-florida-campaign-rally-of-feeling-so-powerful/story-nLGPgNcoDj36Pb2dyh02wM.html
13-10-2020||World||US plows ahead with mail-in voting despite ballot errors||Tens of thousands of ballots in Ohio and New York with the wrong candidate or voter names. Votes thrown in the trash in Pennsylvania and scores of lawsuits over the counts.Three weeks before the US presidential vote, the immense surge in demand for mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus is testing the country’s ability to pull off a credible election.President Donald Trump says voting by mail is ripe for fraud and has promised to challenge ballot counts.“Out of control. A Rigged Election!!!” Trump tweeted on Friday after news that ballots with the wrong candidates were sent to 50,000 residents of Columbus, Ohio, a key state Trump needs to win for reelection.But election analysts say that, despite those headline cases, so far the process is going well. “There’s going to be execution errors along the way,” said Kevin Kosar, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.“The good news is, these mistakes are happening, but they are being caught early,” he said.Primary horror stories Nearly 75 million mail-in ballots have been sent or requested so far this year, more than double the 33 million in 2016, according to the US Elections Project of the University of Florida on Monday.But errors and delays in getting the ballots printed and mailed, cases of mishandled ballots like in Pennsylvania, and reports of people receiving more than one ballot have stoked attacks on the concept at large.Horror stories from the primaries earlier this year, particularly in New York and Wisconsin, support the concerns. In both states tens of thousands of people either did not get their mail ballots or received them too late to vote. The postal service did not put postmarks on thousands of ballots to show they had been mailed on time. Amber McReynolds, chief executive of the National Vote At Home Institute, said a few cases have blown up in the press and social media, but “are not widespread.”“It’s 2020 and everybody is highly sensitive,” she said.The Ohio and New York ballot problems were simple printing and envelop insertion errors that could have been avoided with better management.“Is everything going to be perfect all the time? No. There never has been a perfect election,” McReynolds said.“If we got two issues in two counties out of 8,000 jurisdictions, then the bigger story is it’s working effectively in the majority of places.”McReynolds, former head of elections in Denver, Colorado who helped set up the state’s universal by-mail voting system, said everyone is focused this year on mailed ballots.But in-person voting has its own problems, she argued, especially machine breakdowns and long lines, like those seen in Georgia on Monday, a particular issue given the Covid-19 pandemic.“I believe that there are actually more problems in in-person voting,” she said.Lawsuits Still, there will be problems on the November 3 election day. McReynolds said three key battleground states that could decide the winner -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- haven’t given themselves enough time to open, verify, and then count millions of mailed ballots.Kosar says what worries him is the possibly hundreds of lawsuits being pursued over how mailed ballots will be counted, as well as other process issues.Republicans especially have tried to limit the impact of mail-in voting, as surveys show Democrats are much more likely that Republicans to mail their ballot rather than vote in person. In Pennsylvania they battled for a court ruling to throw out ballots if the voter uses the wrong envelope.In South Carolina Republican attorneys won a ruling requiring envelopes for ballots to be signed by witnesses as well as the voter.The issue of rejected ballots could be crucial. The 2000 presidential battle between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore was decided by a 537 vote margin in Florida, and hinged on the Supreme Court blocking a broad recount that could have restored thousands of rejected ballots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plows-ahead-with-mail-in-voting-despite-ballot-errors/story-RCRK5WGg49hf5wEF2nNdcI.html
13-10-2020||World||Microsoft attempts takedown of global criminal botnet||Microsoft announced legal action Monday seeking to disrupt a major cybercrime digital network that uses more than 1 million zombie computers to loot bank accounts and spread ransomware, which experts consider a major threat to the US presidential election.The operation to knock offline command-and-control servers for a global botnet that uses an infrastructure known as Trickbot to infect computers with malware was initiated with an order that Microsoft obtained in Virginia federal court on Oct. 6. Microsoft argued that the crime network is abusing its trademark.“It is very hard to tell how effective it will be but we are confident it will have a very long-lasting effect,” said Jean-Ian Boutin, head of threat research at ESET, one of several cybersecurity firms that partnered with Microsoft to map the command-and-control servers. “We’re sure that they are going to notice and it will be hard for them to get back to the state that the botnet was in.”Cybersecurity experts said that Microsoft’s use of a US court order to persuade internet providers to take down the botnet servers is laudable. But they add that it’s not apt to be successful because too many won’t comply and because Trickbot’s operators have a decentralized fall-back system and employ encrypted routing.Paul Vixie of Farsight Security said via email “experience tells me it won’t scale — there are too many IP’s behind uncooperative national borders.” And the cybersecurity firm Intel 471 reported no significant hit on Trickbot operations Monday and predicted ”little medium- to long-term impact” in a report shared with The Associated Press.But ransomware expert Brett Callow of the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft said that a temporary Trickbot disruption could, at least during the election, limit attacks and prevent the activation of ransomware on systems already infected.The announcement follows a Washington Post report Friday of a major — but ultimately unsuccessful — effort by the US military’s Cyber Command to dismantle Trickbot beginning last month with direct attacks rather than asking providers to deny hosting to domains used by command-and-control servers.A US policy called “persistent engagement” authorizes US cyberwarriors to engage hostile hackers in cyberspace and disrupt their operations with code, something Cybercom did against Russian misinformation jockeys during US midterm elections in 2018.Created in 2016 and used by a loose consortium of Russian-speaking cybercriminals, Trickbot is a digital superstructure for sowing malware in the computers of unwitting individuals and websites. In recent months, its operators have been increasingly renting it out to other criminals who have used it to sow ransomware, which encrypts data on target networks, crippling them until the victims pay up.One of the biggest reported victims of a ransomware variety sowed by Trickbot called Ryuk was the hospital chain Universal Health Services, which said all 250 of its US facilities were hobbled in an attack last month that forced doctors and nurses to resort to paper and pencil.US Department of Homeland Security officials list ransomware as a major threat to the Nov. 3 presidential election. They fear an attack could freeze up state or local voter registration systems, disrupting voting, or knock out result-reporting websites.While cybersecurity experts say the operators of Trickbot and affiliated digital crime syndicates are Russian speakers mostly based in eastern Europe, they caution that they are motivated by profit, not politics. They do, however, operate with impunity with no Kremlin interference as long as their targets are abroad.“In today’s world, Trickbot is a type of a plague,” said Alex Holden, founder of Milwaukee-based Hold Security, which tracks its activity closely on the dark web, “and a government that ignores a global plague is more than complacent.”Trickbot is “malware-as-a-service,” its modular architecture lets it be used as a delivery mechanism for a wide array of criminal activity. It began mostly as a so-called banking Trojan that attempts to steal credentials from online bank account so criminals can fraudulently transfer cash.But recently, researchers have noted a rise in Trickbot’s use in ransomware attacks targeting everything from municipal and state governments to school districts and hospitals. Ryuk and another type of ransomware called Conti — also distributed via Trickbot — dominated attacks on the US public sector in September, said Callow of Emsisoft.Holden said the reported Cybercom disruption — involving efforts to confuse its configuration through code injections — succeeded in temporarily breaking down communications between command-and-control servers and most of the bots.“But that’s hardly a decisive victory,” he said, adding that the botnet rebounded with new victims and ransomware.The disruption — in two waves that began Sept. 22 — was first reported by cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs.The AP could not immediately confirm the reported Cybercom involvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-attempts-takedown-of-global-criminal-botnet/story-1eUvwafIJXpEaZlsTMmHbP.html
13-10-2020||World||Donald Trump tests negative for coronavirus, isn’t infectious, says doctor||Donald Trump tested negative on consecutive days for Covid-19 and isn’t infectious, his doctor said Monday as the president traveled to Florida for his first campaign rally since he was hospitalized for the virus.In a memo released by the White House, Sean Conley said the tests, along with guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, informed the conclusion that Trump doesn’t risk infecting others.Conley did not say on which days Trump tested negative and the White House declined to comment when asked. Trump was tested using an antigen test, according to the doctor’s memo, which are considered to be less accurate than molecular tests.Also Read: US Election 2020: Nice if decision to scrap presidential debate reversed, says White HouseTrump has come under criticism from his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, and others for what they call a cavalier attitude about the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 215,000 people in the USThe president on Saturday made his first public appearance since testing positive, delivering a campaign-style speech before hundreds of people gathered closely together on the South Lawn of the White House. Conley had said in a memo Saturday night that Trump was no longer considered a transmission risk, but did not say whether the president had tested negative at the time.In a call with supporters Sunday evening, Trump said he had “tested totally negative.”Trump has forged ahead with plans to hold large events even though a number of top White House officials, senators and others in the president’s circle tested positive for the virus after a crowded Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony -- where he announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court.Monday night’s rally, along with three others planned this week, threaten to advance the spread of the coronavirus, warned Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, in an interview on CNN earlier Monday.“Look at it purely in the context of public health,” Fauci said. “We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that. We’ve seen that when you have situations of congregant settings where there are a lot of people without masks, the data speak for themselves.”Also Read: The mystery of India’s low coronavirus death rateTrump, who boarded Air Force One without wearing a mask, has asserted that his infection and subsequent recovery have made him “immune.” Fauci said it’s “likely” Trump is shielded from contracting the virus again for a certain period of time, but added there have been cases of people becoming re-infected.“As the better part of caution, I think that would be appropriate to do that,” Fauci said when asked if he would recommend Trump and others wear masks and limit exposure to others even after they are no longer contagious.Conley said Trump had tested negative on a rapid test made by Abbott Laboratories, which are commonly used in the White House but are not as sensitive as molecular screenings, including PCR tests. The Food and Drug Administration’s website says the antigen tests “are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection compared to molecular tests.”Yet Conley cited clinical and laboratory data and other tests “indicate a lack of detectable viral replication.” He wrote that “it’s important to note” that the Covid-19 test wasn’t used “in isolation for the determination of the president’s current negative status.”The White House has faced pressure to release more information about the president’s condition. For example, Conley’s memo did not say when Trump last tested negative before he tested positive on Oct. 1, a key piece of information that can help determine whom he might have exposed.The White House has cited patient privacy protections in declining to reveal the date of Trump’s last negative test.Conley also did not say whether Trump is still taking medications. A bandage could be seen on one of the president’s hands at Joint Base Andrews before he departed for Florida.The report on Trump’s negative test came one week after he was released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-isn-t-infectious-says-doctor/story-7xYPrnWVUWJgjUvuEAE50L.html
13-10-2020||World||Rushing a Covid-19 vaccine is a terrible idea. Here’s why||The coronavirus pandemic has upended lives and disrupted the global economy. The sooner we can get a vaccine, the sooner we have a chance at returning to normal. That doesn’t mean we should needlessly rush it.Vaccine development and approval normally takes several years, but it has been squeezed into a period of less than year. In Donald Trump’s America, that’s not soon enough -- but there is a way to speed things up even further. The Food and Drug Administration, as the gatekeeper for any new medicine coming to market, can hasten the regulatory process in the event of an urgent need and award approval before a trial is complete. Trump wants Covid-19 vaccine developers to take this path.Companies from AstraZeneca Plc to Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. (working with BioNTech SE) are all in hot pursuit of a vaccine, with Pfizer among the likeliest to file for early approval, perhaps as soon as this month. The difference, though, between seeking approval based on interim data and final analysis is only a matter of a few weeks or at most a couple of months. With all that’s riding on the success of a vaccine, it’s worth waiting for a full set of results. There are good scientific reasons for doing so and risks in not. Let’s take Pfizer’s case as a way to show why:Vaccine Effectiveness: Pfizer’s trial, like most, can be hailed a success for early approval if cough and fever are reduced in people on the vaccine compared with those on placebo; it doesn’t need to show that it can reduce severe disease. Pfizer would only get that kind of data over the full course of a trial. While it’s possible that if milder symptoms are reduced, more severe ones would be as well, ending early means that regulators will have to take this on faith. It would be worthwhile to see at least a few severe cases emerge in the trial to assess whether the vaccine genuinely prevents more concerning illness and to rule out the possibility of a rare side effect. A Crucial Cohort: Older adults are among the populations most vulnerable to Covid-19 and will receive many doses of any approved vaccine. It’s not uncommon for vaccines to be less effective in old people because their immune systems don’t work as well. Stopping a trial early means there will likely be very limited data on whether a particularly crucial vaccine clears the bar in an essential group. Only 43% of Pfizer’s subjects are 56 or older. Far fewer are likely to be over 70, where the risks rise exponentially. The average age of infection has fallen substantially over the course of the pandemic because older adults tend to be more careful, which could cut further into the amount of information available. The same issue applies to the about 10% of younger patients who develop more severe disease. At-Risk Underrepresentation: A similar and even more acute issue involves ethnic minorities and African Americans, which account for a higher percentage of severe cases of Covid-19. While Pfizer has expanded its trial to 44,000 from 30,000 to increase the number of participants from these populations, it has only just done this. It is unlikely that the drugmaker will have enough data for its vaccine in these populations if it decides to file for regulatory approval before the full trial has completed. Only 27% of patients in its U.S. centers, which account for the vast majority of its trial sites, are from diverse backgrounds.Limited Resources: If the protection from a vaccine that’s approved early – whether made by Pfizer or anyone else – fades over time or proves to be less impressive than those that follow, the end result would be the depletion of valuable raw materials that could have been devoted to better options. Approval is just one step in getting a vaccine to people across the planet. Vast resources, from human and financial capital to glass vials and rubber stoppers, may be used up on a sub-optimal vaccine, hurting the rollout of more effective treatments and even crucial non-Covid vaccination efforts.Public Trust: Skepticism about vaccines already abounds among certain parts of the general public; others are concerned that rushing one for Covid-19 may end up cutting corners or increasing risks. If a vaccine that was approved early turns out to be sub-optimal, these attitudes could harden. At worst, a bad outcome could shake confidence in vaccinations as a whole, putting the hard-won success of eradicating or diminishing so many infectious diseases at risk.Lost Opportunities: An early approval without much data on long-term safety and broad effectiveness – still possible even with the FDA’s recently revealed guidance that requires a median of two months of follow-up in a trial’s participants – may hamper the development of other vaccines. Fewer people will want to enter a trial that could give them a placebo if there’s an authorized shot. That’s particularly concerning because several potentially promising vaccines -- including “ultramodern” vaccines such as those from Arcturus and Imperial College London, as well as efforts from Novavax Inc. and a partnership between GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Sanofi that use tried-and-true technology – have yet to start late-stage trials.Like everyone else on the planet, I want to get back to normal as soon as possible, and a vaccine will help get us there. But I only want a vaccine that has been through all the rigors of a full-sized trial. Yes, vaccine front-runners like Pfizer have the right to file for early approval if they are eligible to do so. But a little patience would help deliver much more information and give other vaccine hopefuls a chance to prove their worth as well. We would all be better off for it. (This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

13-10-2020||World||Donald Trump ready for first rally after contracting coronavirus||Just a week after his release from the hospital, President Donald Trump is returning to the campaign trail Monday for the first time since contracting the coronavirus as he tries to stage a late comeback in the election’s final stretch.Trump, facing a stubborn deficit in national and battleground state polling, will be headlining a rally in Sanford, Florida — the first stop in a busy week that will include events in Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina and Wisconsin.The robust schedule underscores the work Trump needs to do as he tries to win over voters just three weeks before Election Day. And it comes amid still-unanswered questions about the impact so much travel so soon could have on the 74-year-old president’s health. The progression of Covid-19 is often unpredictable, and there can be long-term complications.But Trump, eager to return to campaigning, has proclaimed himself cured and says he is now “immune” to the virus — claims that are impossible to prove given limitations in what scientists know about the coronavirus.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said Monday on CNN that those who recover from Covid-19 are likely to be immune for a limited period of time, but there are cases emerging of people getting reinfected weeks or months later.Fauci, speaking as Trump was prepared to depart the White House for Florida, questioned the wisdom of holding such an event. He noted that test positivity rates are climbing in parts of the Sun Belt.“We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that,” Fauci said.In a memo released over the weekend, Trump’s doctor, Navy Cmdr. Sean Conley, said the president met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for safely discontinuing isolation. He said that by “currently recognized standards,” he was no longer considered a transmission risk.But some medical experts have voiced skepticism that Trump could be declared contagion-free so soon. And it was unclear what — if any — added precautions and safety measures the campaign planned to take to prevent the trip from further spreading a virus that has already infected so many of the president’s closest aides and allies, including his campaign manager and the head of the Republican Party.Florida is seen as critical to Trump’s reelection chances. Trump narrowly beat his 2016 rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, in the state by just over 112,000 votes. Some recent polls have suggested a close race in the state, while others have put Democrat Joe Biden ahead.Trump’s decision to so quickly return to the campaign trail drew criticism from Biden and other Democrats.“President Trump comes to Sanford today bringing nothing but reckless behavior, divisive rhetoric, and fear mongering,” Biden said in a statement. “But, equally dangerous is what he fails to bring: no plan to get this virus that has taken the lives of over 15,000 Floridians under control.”Florida state Rep. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat who is running for state Senate and who recently recovered from his own Covid-19 infection, said in a conference call with reporters that Trump should not be coming to Florida.“It’s reckless and irresponsible,” Jones said.Florida lawyer Dan Uhfelder, who has dressed as the Grim Reaper on beaches to highlight the coronavirus threat, filed a lawsuit Monday trying to stop Trump from holding his Sanford rally. It seeks to have the event classified as a public nuisance.Trump, for his part, is eager to show the world that he is no longer sidelined by a virus that he has consistently played down and that has killed 215,000 people across the nation.Since his release from a military hospital after three days of around-the-clock care that included access to experimental antibody treatments unavailable to the public, Trump has used his personal experience to try to convince the public that he was right all along.He has repeatedly told Americans who contract the virus that they’re “going to get better really fast,” although hundreds of people in the US die of the virus every day.Trump held his first public event since his diagnosis on Saturday, addressing a crowd of hundreds of people on the South Lawn from a White House balcony. Appearing without a mask and with bandages still visible on his hands, likely from intravenous injections, Trump spoke for just 18 minutes — far less than his usual campaign rallies, which can last upwards of 90 minutes.He told the crowd the virus is “disappearing,” even as cases have been on the rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-ready-for-first-rally-since-contracting-coronavirus/story-V31vy07tvEOPYYVzQWJYQI.html
13-10-2020||World||UK unveils 3-level lockdown plan; Liverpool at highest risk||The British government carved England into three tiers of coronavirus risk on Monday in a bid to slow a resurgent outbreak, putting the northern city of Liverpool into the highest risk category and shutting its pubs, gyms and betting shops.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the three-tier national system was designed to “simplify and standardize” a confusing patchwork of local rules, as the country faces a “crucial phase” in which hospitals are now filling up with more Covid-19 patients than in March, when he ordered a national lockdown.“These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet, and we must act now,” he said.Shops, schools and universities would remain open in all areas. Johnson told lawmakers that the goal of the new system was to save lives and prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed without “shuttering our lives and our society” through a new national lockdown.But pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses pushed back, with some industry leaders threatening a legal challenge against the rules and arguing that they are not to blame for rising infections.After falling during the summer, coronavirus cases are rising in the UK as winter approaches, with northwest and northeast England seeing the steepest increases. Liverpool has one of the country’s most severe outbreaks, with about 600 cases per 100,000 people, even more than the hard-hit European cities of Madrid and Brussels.Under the new measures, areas in England are classified at medium, high or very high risk, and placed under restrictions of varying severity.Areas in the lowest tier will follow existing national restrictions, including a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants and a ban on more than six people gathering. In areas at high risk, members of different households are barred from meeting indoors.The “very high” risk tier will face restrictions including closing pubs — apart from those that serve meals — and, if local authorities want, other venues such as gyms and casinos.Liverpool was the only area put into the top category Monday, but Johnson said authorities were still talking with other local leaders across the north of England.Pubs, gyms, leisure centers, betting shops and casinos in Liverpool will close beginning Wednesday.Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said local authorities supported tougher restrictions as long as they were accompanied by improved test-and-trace measures to suppress clusters of infections — something he said the government had agreed to.“As well as protecting lives and doing things to tackle the virus, we also need to protect livelihoods, so we argued really strongly for a stronger financial package,” said Anderson, a member of the opposition Labour Party. “Unfortunately, that wasn’t listened to.”The government has announced a support package to pay two-thirds of the salaries of employees of companies that are told to close, but many in the pub and restaurant sector say that is not enough to save already struggling businesses.Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said he doubted the new measures would go far enough to “get control of this virus, to protect jobs or retain public trust.”The UK has experienced Europe’s deadliest outbreak, with an official death toll of 42,875. Health officials say Britain is at a tipping point in the outbreak, with strong action needed to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed at a time when they are already at their busiest with flu and other winter illnesses.Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service in England, said there are currently more people hospitalized with the virus than there were when the country went into its national lockdown in March.He said three temporary Covid-19 hospitals in northern England that were mothballed when the outbreak receded over the summer are being readied to admit patients once again in the coming weeks.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said Monday that while northern England has the highest infection rates, cases are on the rise across the country. Infections have risen most rapidly among older teenagers and young adults, who generally suffer mild symptoms, but are spreading to older and more at-risk groups.“This is a nationwide phenomenon now,” Van-Tam said.Bar and restaurant owners say the government has not shared any evidence backing up the claim that they are the major transmission sources of the virus.Manchester City Council leader Richard Leese said data from the city’s public health officials “seems to demonstrate that there is not a particular connection between bars and restaurants and the transmission of COVID.”But Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said “most of the outbreaks are happening within and between households, and then after that, it’s in the retail and hospitality sector.”He said the new measures would take several weeks to drive down the number of hospitalizations and deaths — if they were strong enough to make a difference at all.“The outbreak is a bit like a super-tanker,” Semple told the BBC. “You put the brakes on, but it takes a long time before you see the effect.”The measures announced Monday apply to England. The rest of the UK is under similar, and sometimes tougher, restrictions. In Scotland’s two biggest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, pubs have been closed for 16 days to suppress the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-unveils-3-level-lockdown-plan-liverpool-at-highest-risk/story-lBsqUDmTyk6kuniaZoKjhP.html
13-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un breaks down in rare apology to North Koreans||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un became visibly emotional during a speech at a military parade over the weekend as he thanked troops for their sacrifices and apologised to citizens for failing to improve their lives.At a speech on Saturday during celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party, Kim thanked thousands of gathered troops for responding to recent damaging storms, and for helping to prevent a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country.In video footage edited and released by the state television station, Kim appeared tearful and at one point seemed to choke up.Kim said he was grateful that not a single North Korean had been infected with the virus, a claim that the US and South Korean officials have previously cast doubts on.The impact of anti-coronavirus measures, international sanctions, and several typhoons combined to prevent the government from following through on promises to improve citizens’ lives, Kim said.“My efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life,” he said. “Our people, however, have always believed and absolutely trusted me, and supported my choice and determination, whatever it is.”North Korea’s economy, already severely restricted by international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, took a further hit as the country shut down nearly all border traffic in an effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.The United Nations has said that as much as 40% of the population faces food shortages, which may have been exacerbated by severe summer floods and typhoons.In a scene common to many such events in North Korea, most people in the audience also had tears streaming down their faces.As he addressed an unprecedented night-time military parade, Kim wished the neighbouring South Korea would “hold hands” again after the coronavirus pandemic is over. It was a mixed signal, as the North Korean leader also unveiled a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and new multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), as well as fast, manoeuvrable short-range missiles that would be ideal for striking targets in the South.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-breaks-down-in-rare-apology-to-north-koreans/story-7qHcWjUe9hAoB1v7ruXDPL.html
13-10-2020||World||Donald Trump vs Joe Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more||Amid the tumult of the 2020 presidential campaign, one dynamic has remained constant: The Nov. 3 election offers voters a choice between substantially different policy paths.President Donald Trump, like many fellow Republicans, holds out tax reductions and regulatory cuts as economic imperatives and frames himself as a conservative champion in the culture wars. The president has offered few details about how he would pull the levers of government in a second term. His most consistent argument focuses on stopping Democratic opponent Joe Biden and his party from pushing US policy leftward.Biden, for his part, is not the socialist caricature depicted by Trump. But he is every bit a center-left Democrat who frames the federal government as the force to combat the coronavirus, rebuild the economy and address centuries of institutional racism and systemic inequalities. The former vice president and US senator also offers his deal-making past as evidence he can do it again from the Oval Office.A look at where the rivals stand on key issues:ECONOMY, TAXESLow unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump’s calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market has clawed its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the pandemic began exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-2009 Great Recession.Trump has predicted that the US economy will rebound in the third and fourth quarters of this year and is set to take off like a “rocket ship” in 2021. He promises that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics will soon be available, allowing life to get back to normal. His push for a payroll tax cut over the summer was thwarted by stiff bipartisan opposition. But winning a second term — and a mandate from voters — could help him resurrect the idea.First and foremost, Biden argues that the economy cannot fully recover until Covid-19 is contained. For the long-term recovery, he pitches sweeping federal action to avoid an extended recession and to address longstanding wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans.His biggest-ticket plans include a $2 trillion, four-year push to eliminate carbon pollution in the US energy grid by 2035 and a new government health insurance plan open to all working-age Americans (with generous subsidies). He proposes new spending on education, infrastructure and small businesses, along with raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.Biden would cover some but not all of the new costs by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. He wants a corporate income tax rate of 28% (lower than before but higher than now) and broad income and payroll tax hikes for individuals with more than $400,000 of annual taxable income. All that would generate an estimated $4 trillion or more over 10 years.Biden frames immigration as an economic matter as well. He wants to expand legal immigration slots and offer a citizenship path for about 11 million residents who are in the country illegally but who, Biden notes, are already economic contributors as workers and consumers.EDUCATIONTrump has pushed for schools to fully reopen for in-person learning and announced that the federal government will begin distributing millions of rapid coronavirus tests to states. He urged governors to use them to reopen schools for students in kindergarten through 12th grade.Trump has also used his call for schools to fully reopen as an opportunity to spotlight his support for charter schools and school choice. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime proponent of charter schools and school voucher programs, has suggested that families be allowed to take federal money allotted to school districts that don’t open and spend it on private schools that do open. For most of Trump’s first term, his administration sought major increases to federal charter school grant aid. Congress responded with relatively small increases.With higher education, Trump has repeatedly complained that campuses are beset by “radical left indoctrination.” He has threatened to defund universities and said he would ask the Treasury Department to reexamine the tax-exempt status and federal funding of unspecified schools.Biden wants schools to get more federal aid for pandemic-related costs through the same federal law used after national disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.Beyond COVID, Biden wants the federal government to partner with states to make public higher education tuition-free for any student in a household earning up to $125,000 annually. The assistance would extend to everyone attending two-year schools, regardless of income. He also proposes sharply increasing aid for historically Black colleges. His overall education plans carry a 10-year price tag of about $850 billion.He calls for universal access to prekindergarten programs for 3- and 4-year-olds; tripling Title I spending for schools with higher concentrations of students from low-income households; more support for non-classroom positions like on-campus social workers; federal infrastructure spending for public school buildings; and covering schools’ costs to comply with federal disability laws. Biden also opposes taxpayer money being routed to for-profit charter school businesses, and he’s pledged that his secretary of education will have classroom teaching experience.HEALTH CAREAs a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would “immediately” replace President Barack Obama’s health care law with a plan of his own that would provide “insurance for everybody.” Americans are still waiting for his plan.Trump recently returned to health care amid disapproval of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and growing uncertainty about the future of the Affordable Care Act, which his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn. He is reiterating his 4-year-old promises for quality health care at affordable prices, lower prescription drug costs, more consumer choice and greater transparency.He also announced executive orders calling for an end to surprise medical bills and declaring it the policy of the US government to protect people with preexisting conditions, even if Obamacare is struck down. However, protections for preexisting conditions are already the law, and Trump would have to go to Congress to cement a new policy through legislation. In the first presidential debate, Trump also held out the repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate to have health insurance as significant progress, while ignoring questions about his lack of a comprehensive plan.Biden wants to expand Obama’s law to provide more generous coverage to a greater number of people and add a “Medicare-like public option” that would compete with private insurers and be available to working-age Americans. Biden estimates that would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 law, and progressives, who want a single-payer system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.Biden also has sought to turn the current Supreme Court vacancy into a health care matter, noting that the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a key vote in upholding the 2010 health care law, while Trump’s nominee, federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett, has criticized the court’s reasoning in that decision.CORONAVIRUSOver the course of the summer, Trump went from acknowledging that the pandemic may “get worse before it gets better” to declaring that the U.S. is “rounding the corner” on the crisis. Then he tested positive for the virus himself.The pandemic remains the biggest obstacle for his reelection hopes, and his bout with the virus just weeks before Election Day only brightened the spotlight on the issue.Roughly 7 in 10 Americans think the nation is on the wrong track, and just 39% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the crisis that has killed more than 207,000 people in the US, according to a recent poll The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Congress approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in March and April, and Democrats and the White House have been at loggerheads over another significant round of funding, with Trump sending mixed messages on what he wants.Trump has largely placed responsibility with governors for leading the response.Biden draws some of his sharpest contrasts with Trump on the pandemic, arguing that the presidency and federal government exist for such crises and that Trump has been an abject failure responsible for tens of thousands of preventable deaths.Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments. He’s also promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, a wartime law a president can use to direct certain private-sector activity. Additionally, Biden promises to elevate the government’s scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the U.S. rejoin the World Health Organization. He’s also willing to use executive power for a national mask mandate, but whether that is enforceable is questionable.ABORTIONYears before his run for the White House, Trump described himself as a strong abortion rights proponent. But since coming to Washington, he has been cheered by anti-abortion groups for his administration’s efforts to restrict access to the procedure.As a candidate and as president, Trump has consistently expressed his opposition to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide and said the issue should be decided by states.He has expressed support for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits Medicaid from being used to pay for abortions in most circumstances, and he’s sought to restrict access to two drugs that are used to induce abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancies.In his Republican National Convention speech in August, Trump declared that “children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.” Nominating Barrett, a 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, has the anti-abortion movement hopeful that the high court — should she win confirmation — will tilt decisively to the right and pave the way for the court to eventually overturn the Roe case.Biden has declined to offer his own list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, but he’s said repeatedly that he supports Roe v. Wade’s finding that the Constitution establishes a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy. He’s endorsed calls for Congress to codify that right, a move that would keep abortion legal statutorily even if the court struck down the constitutional protections.A practicing Catholic, Biden talked publicly for years of his personal struggle over abortion as a moral issue. He cited that as a reason he supported the Hyde Amendment ban on federal taxpayer funding for abortion services. But he reversed that position early in his 2020 campaign after coming under pressure from women’s groups and Democratic activists. Biden said he wasn’t bowing to pressure but instead argued that Republican legislatures around the country had restricted abortion access to the point that the Hyde Amendment had become an untenable barrier for poor or working-class women to access a constitutional right.TRADETrump views the signing of two major trade deals — an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and Phase 1 of a China agreement — as signature achievements of his presidency. US and China signed Phase 1 in January, less than two months before the pandemic put an enormous strain on US-China relations. Trump says Phase 1 led to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in US agricultural products, energy and other American products. In return, the US canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones, toys and laptop computers. The US also cut in half, to 7.5%, the tariff rate levied on $120 billion in other China imports.Phase 2 of the deal is expected to focus on some tougher issues between the countries, including Trump’s wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the “China virus,” it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade. Trump recently said he’s currently “not interested” in talking to China.Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of “fair trade” abroad — a twist on decades of “free trade” talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic firms (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term.He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms’ research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals. He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world’s other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the US, is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president.FOREIGN POLICYDuring his first term, Trump built his foreign policy around the mantra of “America First.”But in the final lap before Election Day, Trump has been offering himself as an international peacemaker for nudging the Gulf monarchies of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to sign agreements with Israel opening business and diplomatic relations. Trump says other Arab nations are on the cusp of opening formal relations with Israel.He also counts as major achievements building more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) of his promised wall along the US-Mexico border, cajoling more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense spending and reducing the US military footprint in Afghanistan and other hot spots. He also announced his intended withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Trump can officially withdraw the US from the Paris agreement — it sets the goal of holding global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit — as an example of an agreement that “disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.” The deal, which was signed by Obama, stipulates that no nation can leave until four years after it signed on. For the US, that’s Nov. 4 — one day after the US election.The president has also made clear his desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than the timeline laid out in the Feb. 29 peace agreement with the Taliban, which set the path for US troops to leave the country in 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. There are currently about 4,500 US troops in Afghanistan, and Trump has said he wants them all to be withdrawn by the end of the year.Trump also counts his engagement with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as a monumental achievement. The president has not been able to prod Kim to give up his nation’s nuclear program, but he has met Kim three times — something Trump critics say has only legitimized the authoritarian leader.Biden says he would begin “the day after the election” rebuilding relationships with allies ruffled by Trump’s approach, which Biden mocks as “America alone.” Biden’s top priority is reestablishing the foundations of NATO, the post-World War II alliance of Western powers that Biden said is necessary to counter Russia’s aggressive, expansionist aims in eastern Europe and Asia.Biden also says he would immediately confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country’s interference in US elections. Biden pledges to “end forever wars” but clarifies that US special forces — as opposed to large-scale ground missions — remain a vital part of world stability. He calls for rebuilding a decimated US diplomatic corps, rejoining the Paris climate accord and pushing China and other large economies to reduce carbon pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-vs-joe-biden-where-they-stand-on-health-economy-more/story-RXYsSVMZzMN3JAsQpUoPOK.html
13-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett vows to interpret laws ‘as they are written’||Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett declared Monday that Americans “deserve an independent Supreme Court that interprets our Constitution and laws as they are written,” encapsulating her conservative approach to the law that has Republicans excited about the prospect of her taking the place of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before Election Day.Barrett spoke about her judicial philosophy, her experience and her large family at the end of the first day of her fast-tracked confirmation hearings that Senate Democrats are using to try and brand her a threat to Americans’ health care during the coronavirus pandemic.After sitting in silence through nearly four hours of opening statements from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the 48-year-old federal appeals court judge laid out her approach to the bench, which she has likened to that of her conservative mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia.“Courts have a vital responsibility to the rule of rule of law, which is critical to a free society. But courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life,” Barrett said in a statement she delivered after removing the protective mask she wore most of the day.“The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try,.”She told senators that she is “forever grateful” for Ginsburg’s trailblazing path as a woman on the court.Yet Sen. Kamala Harris, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, said the court is “often the last refuge for equal justice” and a Barrett nomination puts in jeopardy everything Ginsburg fought to protect.Testifying from her office because of the pandemic, Harris said that not only health care but voting rights, workers’ rights, abortion rights and the very idea of justice are at stake.Republicans called Barrett a thoughtful judge with impeccable credentials.Barring a dramatic development, Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm her to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. If she is confirmed quickly, she could be on the court when it hears the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, a week after the election.One after another, Democrats sought to tie her nomination to the upcoming court case.“Health care coverage for millions of Americans is at stake with this nomination,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s senior Democrat.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said the nomination is a “judicial torpedo aimed” at the law’s protection for people with pre-existing health conditions among its provisions. The Trump administration wants the court to strike down the entire law popularly known as “Obamacare” on Nov. 10. Barrett has criticized the court’s two earlier major rulings supporting the law.Among Republicans, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, dismissed warnings Barrett will undo the Obama-era healthcare law as “outrageous.”Trump himself seemed to be watching, tweeting several times about the hearing. In one message, he tweeted that he’d have a “FAR BETTER” health care plan, with lower costs and protections for pre-existing conditions. But he has not, as yet, discussed an actual health care plan.Republicans also warned against making Barrett’s Catholicism an issue in the confirmation debate, especially in regard to her stance on abortion, with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri lambasting what he called a “pattern and practice of religious bigotry” by Democrats. However, Democratic senators made clear in advance of the hearing that they didn’t plan to question the judge on the specifics of her religious faith.Democratic presidential nominee Biden, also a practicing Catholic, told reporters ahead of a campaign trip to Ohio that he doesn’t think “there’s any question about her faith.”Barrett’s religious views and past leadership role in a Catholic faith community pose a challenge for Democrats as they try to probe her judicial approach to abortion, gay marriage and other social issues without veering into inappropriate questions of her faith.The Senate Judiciary Committee, meeting on a federal holiday, kicked off four days of statements and testimony in an environment that has been altered by the coronavirus pandemic. Some senators were taking part remotely, and the hearing room itself was arranged with health concerns in mind.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., opened the hearing acknowledging “the COVID problem in America is real.” But he said, “We do have a country that needs to move forward safely.”Graham acknowledged the obvious: “This is going to be a long, contentious week.”Protesters rallied outside the Senate buildings with the hearing room largely closed to the public. Capitol Police said 22 people were arrested and charged on suspicion of crowding, obstructing or other violations.Republicans are moving at a breakneck pace to seat Barrett before the Nov. 3 election to secure Trump’s pick, which would put her on the bench for any election-related challenges.Democrats are trying in vain to delay the fast-track confirmation by raising fresh concerns about the safety of meeting during the pandemic after two GOP senators on the panel tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, one of those who tested positive, was in the hearing room Monday after his spokesman said he was symptom-free. The other affected senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, was participating remotely, though he too is symptom-free, his spokesman said. Both tested positive 10 days ago.Trump chose Barrett after the death last month of Ginsburg, a liberal icon. It’s the opportunity to entrench a conservative majority on the court for years to come with his third justice.Outside groups are pushing Democrats to make a strong case against what they call an illegitimate confirmation, when people are already voting in some states, saying the winner of the presidency should make the pick. No Supreme Court justice has ever been confirmed so close to a presidential contest.The country is getting an extended look at Barrett this week in hearings like none other during the heated election environment and the pandemic limiting public access.Faith and family punctuated her testimony, and she said she would bring “a few new perspectives” as the first mother of school-age children on the nine-member court.Barrett said she uses her children as a test when deciding cases, asking herself how she would view the decision if one of her seven children were the party she was ruling against.“Even though I would not like the result, would I understand that the decision was fairly reasoned and grounded in the law?” she said.The hearing followed a White House event announcing her nomination just over two weeks ago, in which most of the audience did not wear masks. The event has been labeled a “superspreader” for the coronavirus.More than two dozen people linked to the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event, including the two GOP senators, have contracted COVID-19 since then. Barrett and her family went maskless at the event. She and her husband, Jesse, tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, two administration officials have said.Democrats already were enraged that Republicans are moving so quickly having refused to consider President Barack Obama nominee after Scalia’s death in February 2016, well before that year’s election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-vows-to-interpret-laws-as-they-are-written/story-JPmq5l7QGnLcocwk4bv0YI.html
13-10-2020||World||UN warns against pursuing herd immunity to stop coronavirus, says ‘allowing dangerous virus to run free simply unethical’||The head of the World Health Organization warned against the idea that herd immunity might be a realistic strategy to stop the pandemic, dismissing such proposals as “simply unethical.”At a media briefing on Monday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said health officials typically aim to achieve herd immunity by vaccination. Tedros noted that to obtain herd immunity from a highly infectious disease such as measles, for example, about 95% of the population must be immunized.“Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it,” he said. Some researchers have argued that allowing Covid-19 to spread in populations that are not obviously vulnerable will help build up herd immunity and is a more realistic way to stop the pandemic, instead of the restrictive lockdowns that have proved economically devastating.“Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak,” Tedros said.Tedros said that too little was known about immunity to Covid-19 to know if herd immunity is even achievable.“We have some clues, but we don’t have the complete picture,” he said, noting that WHO had documented instances of people becoming reinfected with coronavirus after recovering from an initial bout of the virus. Tedros said that while most people appear to develop some kind of immune response, it’s unclear how long that lasts or how robust that protection is — and that different people have varying responses.“Allowing a dangerous virus that we don’t fully understand to run free is simply unethical,” he said.WHO estimates less than 10% of the population has any immunity to the coronavirus, meaning the vast majority of the world remains susceptible.Tedros also noted countries had reported record-high daily figures of Covid-19 to the UN health agency for the last four days, citing surges in Europe and the Americas in particular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-against-pursuing-herd-immunity-to-stop-coronavirus-says-allowing-dangerous-virus-to-run-free-simply-unethical/story-P20aQKnsIhcH88A0AIdYHL.html
13-10-2020||India||BJP to rely on technology to bolster PM Modi’s rallies in poll-bound Bihar||To ensure physical distancing norms are not violated during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rallies in election-bound Bihar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will rely on technology to relay the rallies live across the length and the breadth of the state. Efforts are also underway to devise a strategy to handle the large rush of people who are expected to attend the PM’s rallies, said a person aware of the details.The PM’s rallies, which are expected to draw large crowds, will be telecast live even in far off places with limited access to media and the internet. About four lakh party workers who have smart phones have been deputed to broadcast the rallies in smaller groups or in select places in villages or towns.“The idea is to limit the number of people from attending in person, yet allowing them to be connected,” said a person aware of the details. Adherence to protocol of wearing masks, keeping physical distance and use of sanitisers will be strictly adhered to. In all his speeches, including the radio broadcast, Mann Ki Baat, the PM has been stressing on the need to not let the guard against the coronavirus down; and has been advocating do gaz ki doori or six feet physical distance.So far, the number and schedule of the PM’s rallies has not been firmed up; but he is expected to address a dozen rallies in the state that goes to polls in three phases, starting from October 28.According to people aware of the details, the PM’s first rally is likely to be a joint address along with Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-rely-on-technology-to-bolster-pm-modi-s-rallies-in-poll-bound-bihar/story-7lke4K32SARlIUg1tTaV2N.html

13-10-2020||India||Calcutta high court seeks police report on BJP leader’s murder; TMC rally chokes Titagarh||A division bench of the Calcutta high court on Tuesday sought a report from the West Bengal police on the ongoing probe into the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manish Shukla at Titagarh in North 24 Parganas district on the night of October 4. Shukla, 39, was an outgoing councillor of the Titagarh municipality and also a lawyer at Barrackpore court. He was gunned down on the busy BT Road by motorcycle-borne assailants who fired 18 shots. Priyanka Tibrewal, a lawyer and BJP leader, filed a petition at the Calcutta high court last week seeking a CBI investigation into Shukla’s murder. The CBI probe should take place under the supervision of the high court, the petition said. The matter came up for hearing on Tuesday. The bench headed by Justice Sanjib Banerjee asked the police to submit a report in a sealed envelope during the next hearing. The West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is probing the case. Last Thursday, the CID arrested Subodh Yadav, a resident of Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas. This was the fourth arrest since early October 6. Three suspects, Muhammad Khurram, Sheikh Gulab and Muhammad Nasir Khan were arrested earlier. All three have criminal records. Two days ago, a CID team went to Bihar to interrogate a jailed convict named Subodh Singh who is involved in dacoities and murders in several states, including Bengal. It is suspected that though Singh is lodged in Nalanda Jail he made phone calls to the shooters. The CID team wanted to bring Singh to Kolkata for interrogation but the Bihar Police turned down the request, said an officer aware of the developments. The CID may move court to get Singh’s custody. The murder has triggered political tension in the Barrackpore Lok Sabha constituency of which Titagarh is a part. In Shukla’s murder, nine people have been named in the First Information Report (FIR) on the basis of the complaint lodged by his father Chandramani Shukla. The outgoing chairman of Barrackpore municipality, Uttam Das and his counterpart in Titagarh municipality, Prashanta Choudhury, have been named in the complaint. The two Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders have denied the allegation saying the BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP Arjun Singh is blaming them because they built movements to stop him from making further inroads in the district before the 2019 assembly election. On Tuesday afternoon, the TMC organised a huge procession, which it called a ‘peace rally,’ in Titagarh. More than a thousand people took part in it, ignoring health advisories in force due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Urban Development minister Firhad Hakim also participated in the procession. “It is a strategy by the TMC to shield the culprits and regain control on the region,” said Singh who left the TMC in 2018 and joined the saffron camp. He defeated TMC’s sitting Barrackpore MP Dinesh Trivedi in 2019. Singh has alleged that the CID is trying to frame him in the murder case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-high-court-seeks-police-report-on-bjp-leader-s-murder-tmc-rally-chokes-city/story-pgSs84TN0bQNtR35YkdEzL.html
13-10-2020||India||Former J-K CM Mehbooba Mufti’s release welcomed widely, press conference likely on Friday||Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti was released on Tuesday, more than 14 months after she was detained following the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status on August 5, 2019.Mufti, 61, is the last of the J&K prominent mainstream political leaders to have been set free after the constitutional changes split the region into two Union territories.“After more than a year of detention, our party president Mehbooba Mufti released today,” said Najmu Saqib, PDP spokesperson. Government spokesman Rohit Kansal earlier announced the government’s decision about her release on Twitter. Her party said that she would be addressing a press conference on Friday.Shortly after her release, Mufti released an audio statement on social media, saying she will continue to fight for the revocation of Article 370.  After being released from fourteen long months of illegal detention, a small message for my people. pic.twitter.com/gIfrf82Thw“I am free today after more than a year. During this time, the dark decision of August 5, 2019, the black day, would always pain my heart and soul. I realise that the people of J&K would have the same feeling. Nobody among us can forget the day’s assault and humiliation. Now, we all will have to reiterate that the unconstitutional and undemocratic decision of August 5 and that which was snatched from us by Delhi Darbar will have to be reversed. Also, we will have to carry on our struggle for the solution of Kashmir’s issues for which thousands gave their lives. I agree this path is not easy but I am hopeful that our resolve will help us in this. Now that I have been released, I also demand the release of the people of Jammu and Kashmir who have been jailed in different prisons of the country. As Ms Mufti’s illegal detention finally comes to an end, Id like to thank everybody who supported me in these tough times. I owe a debt of gratitude to you all. This is Iltija signing off. فی امان اﷲ May allah protect youMufti’s party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), ran a coalition government in the undivided state with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) until the alliance collapsed in June 2018 that prompted the imposition of Governor’s Rule.The former CM was arrested on August 5 from her official residence and lodged at Chesmashahi huts. She was moved to a government building close to the MLA hostel, where other detainees were held, in November.In April this year, Mufti was moved to her official residence at Fairview on Gupkar Road. Iltija Mufti, Mehbooba’s daughter who has been handling her mother’s Twitter handle since the detention, expressed her gratitude to those who supported her and signed off from the handle.“As Ms Mufti’s illegal detention finally comes to an end, Id like to thank everybody who supported me in these tough times. I owe a debt of gratitude to you all. This is Iltija signing off. May allah protect you,” she wrote. Happy to learn that Mehbooba Mufti ji’s detention has come to an end and she has been released.Mufti’s release came two weeks after the Supreme Court asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration if the former chief minister’s detention under PSA can be extended beyond a year and, if so, “how long do you propose to extend it”. The bench had fixed the next date of hearing on Thursday.Iltija had moved the Supreme Court in September seeking to modify her petition challenging her mother’s continued detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA) from February 5 and the subsequent two extensions.Mufti was initially put under preventive detention under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and then just before her detention was to expire in February 2020, the government invoked the Public Safety Act on February 5 to keep her behind the bars. This law empowers authorities to hold any person from thee months to two years without any trial. I’m pleased to hear that @MehboobaMufti Sahiba has been released after more than a year in detention. Her continued detention was a travesty & was against the basic tenets of democracy. Welcome out Mehbooba.The administration had extended her detention by three months on July 31 2020, even as it had released People’s Conference chief Sajjad Gani Lone.Political leaders in and outside Kashmir, including those from Opposition Congress, like Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, have been demanding her release.Nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders were detained hours before the central government abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to the region, and bifurcated the state into two Union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature, and Ladakh without one.Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, the two other former chief ministers and National Conference leaders, were later released on March 13 and March 24 2020, respectively. Mufti’s release has been widely welcomed.“I’m pleased to hear that MehboobaMufti Sahiba has been released after more than a year in detention. Her continued detention was a travesty & was against the basic tenets of democracy. Welcome out Mehbooba,” NC vice president Omar Abdullah wrote.“MehboobaMufti has apparently been released.

13-10-2020||India||‘I never watch my own shows!’||Actor Amit Sial has his hands full. Being on a work spree, the ‘Jamtara’ actor recently shot for his new OTT show, a web film and completed dubbing for his upcoming series. Last seen in ‘Hostages’ and ‘Inside Edge’ Amit says that he relishes being in front of the camera but have a strong aversion to watch his work on screen. “Mera bas chale to har din shoot karoon…as I enjoy the process and it gives me a real thrill. But, after the shooting is done I shut myself and try to get a good sleep! It’s only while dubbing I see a bit of myself on screen but beyond that I have never watched any work of mine except,” he said. Post lockdown, the actor shot for a series ‘Simple Murder’ in Hyderabad and New Delhi with Zeeshan Ayub, Vikram Kochhar, Priya Anand and Sushant Singh. “We shot the interiors in Ramoji Film City as it was much safe there, then we moved to Delhi for outdoors. Thereafter, I shot for a web-film in Nashik which was again at safe locations,” shared Amit. In between he dubbed for the sequel of ‘Mirzapur’. “It’s always very challenging to do a sequel. When you set a benchmark and audience lap it up but then the entire team needs to go above the standards that have been already set. Rest, audience is the king!” Last year, he shot for his part in Lucknow and Varanasi. It was due to lockdown that the sequel to his other hit series ‘Jamtara’ couldn’t be shot. “The second season is in pipeline and we are working on the dates as it has ensemble cast and it has to be shot at real locations in Jharkhand.” Then he awaits for the third installment of ‘Inside Edge’ that has already been wrapped. Amit recently returned from a holiday-cum-work trip. “I went to Goa which was a vacation combined with personal reasons. I am shifting my parents there as it is much safer in Covid-era than Mumbai. My brother will stay with them while I’ll keep visiting them. After settling them, I will be able to work much freely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-never-watch-my-own-shows/story-50M8FfNGumtu3kZHG6qJvM.html

Mufti’s release came after her preventive detention for more than 14 months ahead of the abrogation of Article 370 in August last year.Rohit Kansal, Jammu and Kashmir administration’s spokesperson, tweeted about Mufti’s release.Mufti, a former chief minister of the erstwhile state, was arrested along with other leaders hours ahead of the Centre abrogating Article 370 on August 5, 2019, and bifurcating Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. She was first detained under Sections 107 and 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and then booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA).“I’m pleased to hear that @MehboobaMufti Sahiba has been released after more than a year in detention.

13-10-2020||India||Freeze bank accounts, provide for post-summons mediation in cheque bounce cases: Amicus to SC||Freezing bank accounts of accused, encouraging mediation and exploring alternative options to issue summons were some of the suggestions placed before the Supreme Court on Monday by the Amici Curiae to deal with the backlog of cheque bounce cases.The two Amici Curiae, senior counsel Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar noted in their report that a significant percentage of cheque bounce cases are pending at the stage of service of summons due to the lack of current address and whereabouts of the accused.“It would be expedient to direct that banks, while issuing dishonour slips, under the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act), disclose the current mobile number, email address and postal address of the drawer of the cheque. Service of summons may be affected through SMS, WhatsApp, on the mobile number, email and postal address of the accused,” the report said.The Central government, the Reserve Bank of India and the Indian Banks Association should consider establishment of a nodal service agency for effective service of summons through electronic processes, it added.The Supreme Court had on March 5 taken suo motu cognizance of the pressing need for speedy trial and disposal of cases instituted under Section 138 of the NI Act.Section 138 criminalises dishonour of cheque when such a cheque given for discharge of a debt or liability is returned by the bank on account of insufficiency of funds in the concerned bank account.The apex court in its March 5 order noted that the huge pendency in cheque bounce cases under Section 138 posed great perils to the justice delivery system and appointed Luthra and Parameshwar as Amicus Curiae to assist the court and invite suggestions and solutions to deal with the issue.Amicus Curiae, which literally translates as friend of the court, is a neutral lawyer appointed by the court to assist it in cases which require specific expertise.The report by the two lawyers suggested that when a person against whom a warrant is issued has absconded or has concealed himself such that the warrant cannot be executed, then Magistrates could consider ordering attachment of the bank accounts of the accused to the extent of the cheque amount.“The Magistrate could direct the concerned bank that the account of the accused, to the extent of the cheque amount shall stand frozen. If this procedure is adopted, it would act as a deterrent for the accused from evading the summons and trial,” it said.The Amici Curiae also said that magistrates could direct parties to resort to mediation while issuing summons.“In such cases, the summons may reflect a date for mediation and also a date for trial. A Standard Operating Procedure for post-summons mediation will have to be developed in consultation with the relevant stakeholders keeping in mind that the mediation is time-bound, cost-effective and does not become another tool in the hands of the accused to delay the trial,” the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freeze-bank-accounts-provide-for-post-summons-mediation-in-cheque-bounce-cases-amicus-to-sc/story-h4SVkKaG1rXJ8bb9RPmBrI.html

It will follow external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s recent meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo on the margins of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in Tokyo earlier this month. Also read: India, China bet on dialogue to resolve border row in eastern LadakhFS @harshvshringla & US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun reviewed status & progress of our diverse & growing bilateral relationship.They discussed ways to strengthen cooperation in the UN, especially during India's membership of the UNSC for the period 2021-2022. pic.twitter.com/TjRCBvtYzVSrivastava also said in his tweets that Shringla and Biegun reviewed the “status & progress of our diverse & growing bilateral relationship” during their bilateral consultations on a diverse range of issues.The two officials also highlighted “convergences & shared interests” between the two sides and reiterated their commitment to the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership between India and the US, he added.Beigun’s visit has coincided with a push by the US to institutionalise cooperation with India in the Indo-Pacific, primarily to counter China’s aggressive activities across the region. During his visit to Tokyo, Pompeo had spoken about institutionalising the Quad, currently an informal grouping, and expanding it to include more like-minded countries.While delivering an address on Monday night, Beigun had said India and the US “have been too cautious” while developing the Quad, though the recent ministerial meeting of the grouping in Tokyo had made the US confident that efforts had begun to create more “strategic linkages”.Beigun also described China as “an elephant in the room” as India and the US work towards an “organic and deeper partnership” based on a “fundamental alignment along shared security and geopolitical goals, shared interests and shared values”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-shringla-us-deputy-secretary-discuss-upcoming-2-2-dialogue/story-vtGLpkryVnixoXcEked2VI.html

The test positivity rate (TPR) climbed to 18.16%, according to the statistics released by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. At a time when Covid-19 cases are going down in the country, in Kerala, the infection is increasing sharply, data shows. Out of 48,253 samples tested on Tuesday, 8,764 people tested positive with a TPR of 18.16% against the national average of 8.5 %. The state’s active caseload is 95,407, the third highest in the country after Maharashtra and Karnataka. But there is some relief also as the number of patients who recovered crossed 2 lakh.“Infection among children is high and private tuition is behind it. Parents and teachers will have to take extra caution. We can’t remain in shutdown mode always. We have opened the tourism sector partially and many destinations have set up testing kiosks,” the CM said. He said post-Covid-19 care centres will be opened as some of those who have recovered often complain about health complications. He said the recent hike was on expected lines and asked people to take utmost care and heed directives of the health ministry.Experts said the next few weeks will be critical for the state and cases may peak by this month end. Once a model for coronavirus management, cases started increasing in September and more than half of the caseload was added during this period. They said low testing rate, easing of curbs and overconfidence marred the state’s pandemic battle that was once lauded by many including international media. The Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter has reiterated its demand for a medical emergency in the state. With 8,764 new Covid-19 cases, the total has gone up to 3.03,896. Nearly 2, 07, 357 people have recovered and active cases now stand at 95,407. With 21 fatalities, the death toll has gone up to 1046.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-covid-19-cases-cross-3-lakh-mark-tpr-remains-high-at-18-16/story-J8qDXIRQjgXlAe7dBEZhpL.html

I owe a debt of gratitude to you all. This is Iltija signing off. May Allah protect you,” Mufti’s daughter said. Ms Mehbooba Mufti, former Chief Minister J&K to whom this twitter handle belongs has been detained since 5th August 2019 without access to the account. This handle is now operated by myself, Iltija daughter of Ms Mufti with due authorisation.The Jammu and Kashmir administration had extended her detention by three months in July. Mufti’s release came two weeks after the Supreme Court asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration if the former chief minister’s detention under PSA can be extended beyond a year and, if so, “how long do you propose to extend it”. The bench had fixed the next date of hearing on Thursday.National Conference leader Omar Abdullah welcomed Mufti’s release. “I’m pleased to hear that @MehboobaMufti Sahiba has been released after more than a year in detention. Her continued detention was a travesty & was against the basic tenets of democracy. Welcome out Mehbooba,” Omar Abdullah tweeted.Omar Abdullah, who along with his father Farooq Abdullah, was also among the hundreds of political leaders who were detained hours before the Centre moved Parliament to scrap Article 370, divided the state into two Union Territories and imposed restrictions in the Kashmir Valley in August last year. Omar, also a former chief minister, was released on March 25 and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah was released on March 13. I’m pleased to hear that @MehboobaMufti Sahiba has been released after more than a year in detention. Her continued detention was a travesty & was against the basic tenets of democracy.

She was lodged at Cheshma Shahi guest house and then shifted to another government guest house at MA Link Road in Srinagar.

13-10-2020||India||‘Negligence by UP police in Hathras case among CBI’s focus area’: Official||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team is focused on five vital points after taking over investigation of the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, police officials’ privy to the investigation said here.Sharing details, a senior CBI official, who did not want to be named, said the initial two focus points are to establish and collect proper evidence related to the commission of the two crimes — gang rape and murder. He said murder has already been established as the post-mortem report confirmed that the victim had multiple injuries that resulted in her death nearly 15 days after the attack.“Contradictory theories have surfaced about the gang rape allegations. The CBI will try to collect concrete evidence to establish the gang rape by taking opinion from forensic experts or whatsoever facts surface during the investigation and by recreating the crime sequence. The CBI team will strictly stick to the facts and evidence that they come across during the probe,” he explained.The official said the third point will be to find out whether any tampering was done with evidence and facts that have surfaced so far in the case.The fourth point, he said, is to zero in on the real accused behind the two crimes. “The fifth focus point will be to find out the negligence on the part of the local police and others,” he said. The CBI had on Sunday registered a case on the request of the Uttar Pradesh government and after a notification from the Central government. The FIR was registered against accused Sandip Singh under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 307 for attempt to murder, 302 for murder and 376D for gang rape. Besides, Section 3 of the SC/ST Act for atrocities on a scheduled caste woman had been included in the FIR.The case was registered with the CBI’s Ghaziabad unit and the investigation team is being led by Seema Pahuja, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negligence-by-up-police-in-hathras-case-among-cbi-s-focus-area-official/story-xkZBk1rCYO13mfVqRiWt2L.html
13-10-2020||India||Centre has taken number of measures in 6 years to curb pollution: Environment ministry||The Centre has taken a slew of measures in the last six years to curb pollution, the environment ministry said on Tuesday, after Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia blamed the Union government for its “inaction on the issue”.Reacting to Sisodia’s attack as Delhi’s air quality entered the “red” zone, the ministry said the government believes in working towards getting rid of air pollution.“Central government believes in working to end pollution. The government has taken various anti-air pollution initiatives in the last six years, which include construction of the Eastern and Western peripheral expressways, which has reduced pollution by preventing 60,000 undestined heavy vehicles (trucks) passing through Delhi every day,” ministry spokesperson Gaurav Khare said.Earlier in the day, Sisodia attacked the Centre, saying all of north India would have to pay for its “inaction on the issue of air pollution”.“Pollution and stubble-burning are not just issues pertaining to Delhi but this affects the whole of north India. It is a matter of regret that the central government did not take any action during the year and now, the whole country will pay for it,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said.Responding to his allegations, Khare said the environment ministry shut down the Badarpur power plant, which directly reduced pollution, and introduced BS-VI standard-compliant vehicles and fuel with an investment of Rs 65,000 crore, which reduced vehicular pollution to a great extent.“Machines for stubble-cutting worth Rs 1,400 crore have been provided to Punjab and Haryana farmers and it has resulted in reduction of about 15 per cent and 20 per cent pollution from stubble-burning respectively,” he said.Listing all measures taken by the Centre in this regard, Khare said the zig-zag technology in 2,800 brick klins in the National Capital Region (NCR) was introduced, which resulted in lesser pollution, 2,600 NCR industries were brought on piped natural gas (PNG), the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, introduced for the first time in 2016, reduced dust pollution and hundreds of dust suppressants and water sprinkling vehicles were provided by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).Delhi’s air quality hit an eight-month low and was recorded just a notch above the “very poor” category on Tuesday.The air quality index (AQI) of the city hit “very poor” levels in the morning and stood at 306 at 11 am. Thereafter, the pollution levels dipped slightly due to an improvement in the ventilation index.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.“The development of strong surface-level inversion and sudden local, calm surface wind conditions led to a low-ventilation coefficient and accumulation of pollutants near the surface,” the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said. Around 675 farm fires were observed in Punjab, Haryana and other border regions of the national capital on Monday, but the wind direction was not favourable for transport of pollutants. Hence, only a marginal contribution in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration is expected, the SAFAR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-taken-number-of-measures-in-6-years-to-curb-pollution-environment-ministry/story-ZyMyLzkf29X0mEn7aXleoI.html

This is a record,” said DGP Abhay. Of the 1,054 quintals, 413 quintals were seized from Koraput district while another 240 quintals were from Malkangiri, considered the hotbed of the cultivation. “ISRO satellites are helping us locate Ganja cultivation,” the DGP said.As per the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) records, Andhra Pradesh had seized around 780 quintals of cannabis in 2017, the highest so far. Though the records of 2020 are yet to be released by the NCB, Odisha police officials said the force would top the cannabis seizure chart as there are two more months to go before the year ends.“We hope to seize around 12,00 quintals of cannabis by the end of this year. If we add seizure by other agencies such as state excise department, DRI and NCB then the figure would be an all-time high,” said additional DGP of state CID Soumendra Priyadarshi.“Our aim is not just to seize the cannabis, but go after the money trail and destroy the entire drug network. Very soon we would start destruction of cannabis cultivation in the hilly areas of the state,” he said.Police officials said on an average, 414 quintals of cannabis have been seized every year over the last 5 years in Odisha, compared to 312 in the last 10 years. “Action against drug trafficking remains among the highest priorities of the Odisha government. For the last couple of years, the Odisha police have been using ISRO’s data shared by the Narcotics Control Bureau to various agencies across the country to launch a crackdown on the illegal ganja and poppy cultivation. The satellite mapping of poppy cultivation has been stabilised in the last 10 years for which we are able to get accurate information. As cannabis mapping is a recent one, it will take some more time to get accurate data. Once it is done, we will be able to carry out drives with much precision,” said Abhay.The cultivation of cannabis starts in September, at the end of monsoon season when there is less humidity and the temperature drops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-helping-us-locate-cannabis-odisha-top-cop-after-record-haul/story-Voc2iuJr5kpkUCJWdFKC3H.html
13-10-2020||India||‘Shocked, surprised’: Sharad Pawar writes to PM Modi over Maharashtra guv’s letter to Thackeray||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s letter to the state’s chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, saying he was “shocked and surprised” at the language used.Governor Koshyari had written to Thackeray on Monday regarding the reopening of places of worship in the western state. Pawar, who is an ally of Thackeray’s Shiv Sena, talked about the “intemperate language” used by Koshyari.“In the very Preamble of our Constitution the word ‘secular’ is added that equates and shields all religions and hence the Chair of the Chief Minister must uphold such tenets of the Constitution. Unfortunately Hon. Governor’s letter to the Chief Minister invokes the connotation as if written to the leader of a political party. I firmly believe that in a democracy, free exchange of views between the Hon. Governor and the Hon. Chief Minister must take place,” Pawar said in his letter to PM Modi. It was brought to my notice through the media, a letter written by the Hon. Governor of Maharashtra to the @CMOMaharashtraIn this letter the Hon. Governor has sought the intervention of the Chief Minister to open up religious places for the public. pic.twitter.com/1he2VOatx3“However the tone and tenor used must always be in keeping with the stature of the constitutional post occupied by the individuals. Looking at the turn of events the Chief Minister in fact was left with no option but to release his reply to the Hon Governor in the press. I fully endorse the decision of the Hon.Chief Minister on this issue,” he said.The NCP leader said he has not discussed this matter either with the Koshyari or Thackeray, however, he felt that “I must share my pain with you and the public at the erosion of standards of conduct by the high constitutional office of the Hon. Governor.”Pawar also added the governor’s letter to Thackeray in his letter to PM Modi. “You have been a strong votary of Hindutva. You had publicly espoused your devotion for Lord Rama by visiting Ayodhya after taking charge as Chief Minister. You had visited the Vitthal Rukmini Mandir in Pandharpur and performed the puja on Ashadhi Ekadashi,” Koshyari had said. “I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turned ‘secular ‘ yourselves, the term you hated?” the governor had asked.Also read | In Thackeray’s comeback to Guv, Kangana Ranaut’s comment is his ammoThackeray responded to Koshyari’s letter on the issue said he does not need a “certificate” on Hindutva from the governor and that his Hindutva does not permit him to welcome a person who called Mumbai ‘Pakistan occupied Kashmir’.The last bit in Thackeray’s letter was an apparent reference to Koshyari’s meeting with Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut in September after she was criticised by many Maharashtra politicians for comparing Mumbai with PoK. Ranaut had made the comment criticising Mumbai Police for its investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocked-surprised-sharad-pawar-writes-to-pm-modi-over-maharashtra-guv-s-letter-to-thackeray/story-N3NgP9NhhGf3PpXNu4M3aI.html

It means that ‘special charges’ will be levied, making the tickets costlier by 10-30 per cent as compared to the fares of Mail/Express trains, depending on the class of travel.According to current norms, ‘special charges’ are fixed as a percentage of fare at the rate of 10% of basic fare for second class and 30% of basic fare for all other classes.“To clear the festive rush, the ministry of railways has approved 196 pairs (392 trains) of “Festival Special” services over Indian Railways to be operated from 20th October 2020 and 30th November 2020. The fare for these Festival Special services shall be that applicable for special trains.

13-10-2020||India||In Thackeray’s comeback to Guv, Kangana Ranaut’s comment is his ammo||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday responded sharply to barbs from Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government’s decision on holding back permission to reopen temples in the state, telling him that it was for the government to decide after careful consideration of the Covid-19 situation in the state.Koshyari had yesterday asked Thackeray to permit places of worship to open, throwing multiple darts at the chief minister for holding back approvals for reopening places of worship. Maharashtra has over 2 lakh active Covid cases, the highest in the country.Shiv Sena’s Thackeray, a strident champion of Hindutva for decades, is often criticised by its ally-turned-foe BJP for toning down his shrill pitch on Hindutva after forming the government in Maharashtra last year in alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party.Also Read: Governor asked Uddhav Thackeray if he had turned secular. He delivers a biting responseKoshyari’s letter appeared to echo this sentiment when it complained how Maharashtra had opened bars, restaurants and beaches but “our Gods and Goddesses have been condemned to stay in the lockdown”. Or when Koshyari wondered if Thackeray - who he said, had been a strong votary of Hindutva - had “suddenly turned ‘secular’ yourself, the term you hated”.Thackeray’s unusually blunt response sent to Raj Bhavan on Tuesday didn’t pull any punches. He told the governor that the three representations forwarded by him would be considered but pointed that they were all from BJP leaders. Then came the comeback.“And yes, I am someone who follows Hindutva… My Hindutva doesn’t need your certification,” the chief minister told Koshyari who was a BJP politician in Uttarakhand.Thackeray also turned a hugely-controversial comment by actor Kangana Ranaut into ammunition, underlining that his Hindutva does not permit him to welcome a person who called Mumbai “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”. Thackeray’s jibe was seen as a reference to Koshyari’s meeting with Ranaut last month after she was criticised by many Maharashtra politicians for comparing Mumbai with PoK.The controversy over Ranaut’s remark dates back to early September when the row over the police investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was at its peak. Kangana Ranaut had turned into a sharp critic of Mumbai Police for its handling of the case. When Sena leader Sanjay Raut told her not to return to the city if she had no faith in the Mumbai Police, Ranaut had tweeted her counterattack, asking “why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan occupied Kashmir?”.The comparison had riled the Shiv Sena, which alleged that Ranaut was a proxy for Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who supported her, and got her protection by central police personnel. The bitter back-and-forth between the Sena and Ranaut had escalated by several notches after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation last month rushed to demolish portions of her bungalow that the civic body alleged was unauthorised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-thackeray-s-comeback-to-guv-kangana-ranaut-s-comment-is-his-ammo/story-bn3bO3hu5liFOFFmOSN3gO.html
13-10-2020||India||Impact factor of newspapers still very high: CVoter survey||In a world that measures human attention in microseconds, the print media continues to offer great value to its readers. According to the CVoter Media Consumption Survey 2020, readers derive utility and value out of reportage even on those matters which are conventionally considered to be the domain of electronic media. For example, even after watching a match live on a sports channel 52% respondents still liked to read about it in the newspaper. Live match broadcast and the snazzy expert commentary embedded in it notwithstanding, a carefully worded print report still appeals to over a majority of readers.Impact of print advertisements?The sustained lure of static and printed word despite stiff competition from the electronic media has important implications for the advertisements published. Sixty-five per cent of respondents in the representative sample agreed with the statement that information in print advertisements were more useful to them. Twenty-five per cent respondents disagreed with the statement and found the information less or equally useful. These responses can be interpreted in two ways; first, newspaper advertisements are more useful to the target audience for a variety of factors such as recall, storage of information and undivided attention. Second, the newspaper advertisements appeal to the more cerebral part of the market language notwithstanding. This indicates a higher probability of positive correlation between the advertisement and potential sales due to the greater purchasing or influencing power of the reader.Do readers focus on certain sections?The Indian reader is discerning when it comes to the sections of the newspaper it prefers. Over 71% of the respondents stated that they have a preferred section of the newspaper that they read first. In other words, newspapers readers are highly likely to jump to a page or section of their preference. This guarantees a significant number of eyeballs in direct correlation to the popularity of a certain section or page.Importance of current affairs and newsThe mainstay of print media continues to be the coverage of news and current affairs channels. Seventy-five per cent of respondents preferred newspapers for a holistic coverage of news and current affairs. In other words, 3/4th of those surveyed prefer newspapers for “news” reporting. Hence when it comes to pure play news and current affairs, the newspapers remain the medium of choice and not also-ran as is being made out in some quarters. The electronic media’s centre of gravity has shifted towards reality television mixed with sensationalism. While this is a good strategy for boosting viewership, it does significant damage to the credibility of the medium. Hence, we observe that the impact factor of newspapers is still very high and continues to be in the poll position. This impact factor however is very tough to quantify in absolute figures although in comparatives such as the question asked in the survey the picture becomes clearer.In conclusion, it is a significant achievement of the print media to hold its own against a technologically superior adversary. Good old values of integrity, credibility and detailed coverage seem to be carrying the day in this age of views per post or TRP.Manu Sharma works with CVoter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impact-factor-of-newspapers-still-very-high-cvoter-survey/story-PbAJypya5rlav0ORKf6ExM.html
13-10-2020||India||Centre permits 20 states to raise Rs 68,825 crore via borrowing to meet GST shortfall||The Centre on Tuesday permitted 20 states to raise Rs 68,825 crore through open market borrowings to bridge the GST revenue shortfall. The decision came a day after the GST Council meeting failed to reach a consensus on the stalemate over the Centre’s proposal of states borrowing against future GST collections to make up for the shortfall. The projected total compensation shortfall in the current fiscal stands at Rs 2.35 lakh crore. The Centre had in August given two options to the states -- to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from the market. It had also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing. The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, has granted permission to 20 states to raise an additional amount of Rs 68,825 crore through open market borrowings, an official statement said on Tuesday. “Additional borrowing permission has been granted at the rate of 0.50 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to those States who have opted for Option- 1 out of the two options suggested by the Ministry of Finance to meet the shortfall arising out of GST implementation,” it said. In the meeting of the GST Council held on August 27, it said, these two options were put forward and were subsequently communicated to the states on August 29. “Twenty States have given their preferences for Option-1. These States are - Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Eight States are yet to exercise an option,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-permits-20-states-to-raise-rs-68-825-crore-via-borrowing-to-meet-gst-shortfall/story-TfIcdQosE9befgz5IvB3iO.html

This is doing great damage to the institution,” he said.He gave examples of how television (TV) channels report bail matters and articles are written immediately before hearing in Supreme Court, specifically citing the example of the Rafale case.“Today, when I watch TV, I see them playing conversations stated to be made by the accused. This can be very damaging to the bail plea of the accused. Another example is of Rafale in which immediately before the hearing, an article is published commenting on the case with details of documents. All this amounts to contempt of court,” he said. He requested the court to examine and address the problem.Also read: India, China bet on dialogue to resolve border row in eastern LadakhSenior counsel Rajeev Dhavan, who was appearing on behalf of Bhushan, opposed the AG saying the case before the court is limited to contempt of court and issue regarding commenting on sub-judice (pending) cases has already been settled by the apex court in previous judgments. He, therefore, said that the issue should not be re-examined in the present case.The contempt case against Bhushan itself has its genesis in an interview given by Prashant Bhushan to Tehelka magazine in which he claimed that half of the previous 16 Chief Justices of India were corrupt. Senior advocate Harish Salve had brought Bhushan’s statement to the notice of the court based on which the top court initiated contempt of court case against the activist lawyer in November 2009.The case was listed by the top court before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra on July 24, 2020, more than eight years after it was last heard.Bhushan refused to apologise for his statement but offered an explanation to the court on his controversial remark. The apex court, on August 10, rejected Bhushan’s explanation and decided to proceed with the case and hear it in detail.When the case was heard on August 17, the court said that certain larger legal issues need to be settled, including whether allegations of corruption against judges can be made by way of public statements and the procedure to be adopted when such allegations are raised against the conduct of a sitting judge.On August 25, Bhushan’s counsel requested that the case should be placed before a Constitution bench since it involves substantial legal issues.The three-judge bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, could not, however, take the case to finality because justice Mishra retired from office on September 2.The matter then came to be listed before a new bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar. When it was heard on September 10, the court appointed Venugopal as Amicus Curiae taking into account the importance of the issues involved in the case.The parties to the case will now sit with the AG and frame the issues to be considered by the court. The case is likely to be heard next on November 4.The top court had, on August 31, imposed a fine of Rs. 1 on Bhushan in another contempt of court case initiated against him for his tweets criticising the Supreme Court and current CJI, SA Bobde. Bhushan had refused to tender an apology in that case too despite opportunities afforded by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-trial-causing-great-damage-to-judiciary-attorney-general-kk-venugopal/story-XXroXLeMrdHYAKP85SjsgL.html

The two sides said they had a better understanding of each other’s position in the sensitive sector after the latest round of talks, even as the border row is in its sixth month and efforts to disengage and de-escalate have made no breakthrough. Both sides talked for more than 12 hours on Monday. “The two sides had a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the western Sector of India-China border areas. They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other’s positions,” said the statement.

The police have also detained four persons, who were allegedly involved in the crime. The incident came to light on Monday evening when police visited the village in Pathna block under Ranga police station in Sahibganj district, around 400-km from capital Ranchi, after getting information about the incident through social media. Family members of the girl did not file any formal complaint with the police even after she was out of home with her one of the friends from Wednesday last, police claimed. A friend of the deceased, who was with her since Wednesday, narrated the entire story to police. On the basis of her statement, police lodged FIR on Monday late evening. The Sahibganj superintendent of police (SP), Anuranjan Kispotta said, “As per the narration of the deceased’s friend, both the girls went to meet their boyfriends on Wednesday. When they were returning on Friday night, five persons from their village committed the crime, as per her friend’s statement. The body of the girl was found on Saturday and family members buried it on Sunday.” Police sources said the assailants had thrown the body on the roof of an under construction house in the village. The sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) PK Mishra, who visited the village on Tuesday, said, “On statement of the deceased’s friend, we have detained four youths from the village. Further action would be taken on the basis of the medical report.” Mishra said a medical board has been set up by the Sahibganj deputy commissioner (DC) and body has been sent there. Mishra said parents of the deceased, who are in their fifties, were not in position to tell what happened to their daughters and where her daughter went on Wednesday last. However, BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi has alleged that police are trying to cover up the incident. He claimed, “The mother of the girl went to Ranga police station to lodge a complaint but she was made to return saying to sort out the issue in Panchayat. After getting no help from police, they buried the body.” Marandi said the incident took place under Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren’s assembly constituency. “When CM’s constituency is not safe, one can imagine what will happen in other parts of the state,” he said, demanding immediate action in the case. Meanwhile, BJP Ranchi Mahanagar took out a candle march against the Sahibganj incident at Albert Ekka Chowk in Ranchi on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspected-gang-raped-minor-s-body-exhumed-for-medical-test-in-jharkhand/story-lUQzU2u8ir32H30BfRfBxK.html

The cops, however, denied that he was forced to drink urine but admitted that the attack did take place.The main accused in the case has been arrested while the hunt for others is on, said police.“The police were informed about the assault on two people by some locals in Rora village. The cops have arrested the prime accused, Sonu Yadav.

13-10-2020||India||SC seeks Centre’s response on plea for law to regulate access of minors to social media||The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the response of the Central government on a petition praying for a suitable legal framework to regulate access of minors to social media platforms.The petitioners, Skand Bajpai and Abhyudaya Mishra, who are two law students from Uttar Pradesh, said that minor children fall easy prey to online “predators” and are often manipulated and exploited on social media platforms.“There exists no law in India to regulate minors’ access to social media. Since minors are prone to exploitation and harassment for not being able to comprehend the consequences of their actions on social media platforms, they need to be protected by law,” the petition, which was filed in July, stated.Formulate an appropriate law regulating minor’s access to social media by laying down appropriate age limit for such access, the petitioners prayed.A 3-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde issued a notice to the Centre and the case is now likely to be heard again in December.The age of attaining majority in India is 18 while most social media platforms allow individuals who are 13 years old or more to create accounts.“As per the terms and conditions of Facebook, an individual aged not less than 13 years or any other lawful age as per law applicable can hold an account on their platforms. Individuals agree and provide consent for several conducts on such platforms. (But) the age of consent in India stands at the age of majority and, therefore, minor’s consent is void ab initio (from the beginning),” the plea said.The petition also highlighted the issue of revenge porn and sought criminalisation of the same.“There is a need to deter people from engaging in revenge porn. Several nation states have already expressly criminalised revenge porn. However, in India there exists no gender-neutral legislation on this and revenge porn acts as a tool for coercion, exploitation and extortion,” it was submitted.The petitioners pointed out that sexually explicit content including private graphic information, rape videos etc are sold online through social media platforms. Accounts selling such content have mushroomed on social media and when one account gets reported or blocked, another is created to carry on the trade, the plea claimed.“These accounts in this trade and business are largely public accounts open to all members of the social media community. A simple search of the keyword “pic seller” or other similar words, would land one in a pool of results all related to this trade,” the petition stated.Further, such accounts also send ‘follow requests’ to random people on social media as a means of advertisement and promotion and also comment on the posts of public figures inviting people to subscribe to their illegal services, it added.The petitioners submitted that individuals who have been affected by such leaked videos or photographs of their private life have many a time committed suicide or tried to inflict self-harm.Bajpai and Mishra, therefore, prayed for an efficient mechanism to be put in place to investigate and punish persons behind such social media profiles. They also sought amendments to existing laws to increase the accountability of intermediaries.“The Ministry of Education should work in collaboration with Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, to upgrade the National Education Policy and inculcate adolescent sex education as a compulsory subject, further directing them to introduce a subject related to online safety, security and conduct,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-plea-for-law-to-regulate-access-of-minors-to-social-media/story-ztwNWaV4aDB24TAoBE2NWN.html

He was later remanded to ED custody till September 19. But he had tested positive for Covid-19 on September 14 so his ED custody was suspended and he was sent to judicial custody instead and treated at a hospital.On Tuesday, Deepak Kochhar was discharged from the hospital and produced before the special PMLA court, where ED sought his custody for interrogation. The plea was opposed by Deepak Kochhar’s lawyer Vijay Aggrawal. Besides, Chanda Kochhar submitted that Deepak Kochhar was too weak to be in ED custody.Also Read: ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case: Delhi HC asks ED to respond to Deepak Kochhar’s plea to quash FIRThe court, after hearing both sides, held that the investigating agency should get a fair chance. The court said that it would not grant more days to ED, but would consider that the agency was granted custody of Deepak till September 19 which had to be suspended. Hence the court remanded him to ED custody till October 17.The ED started a probe into money laundering after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case of corruption against the Kochhar couple. CBI had initiated an inquiry in 2017 against the couple, after allegations surfaced that ICICI had sanctioned a credit facility of about Rs 3,250 crores to various entities in contravention to the rules and policies. In its FIR registered in January last year, CBI alleged that six high-value loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were given by ICICI Bank to Videocon group companies between 2009 and 2011. It was alleged that in 2009, a credit facility to Videocon was extended in contravention of rules and policies by the sanction committee. At that time Chanda Kochhar was one of the members of the sanction committee.Further, a loan of Rs 300 crore was disbursed to M/s Videocon international electronics limited, Videocon Group Company on September 7, 2009. It is alleged that an amount of Rs 64 crore—out of a loan of Rs 300 crore, was transferred to M/s NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd by Videocon Industries Limited (VIL) on September 8, 2009. Also Read: Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak tests positive for Covid-19, admitted to Delhi hospitalThe ED which investigated the allegations, said that VIL transferred the money to NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRL) through Supreme Energy Private Limited (SEPL), which was later acquired by Pinnacle Energy, a family trust of Deepak Kochhar’s. The agency also claimed that NRL was owned, controlled and managed by Deepak Kochhar. “The loan funds travelled from VIL to NRL through SEPL, but two intermediary companies were brought in for purpose of layering. The proceeds, Rs 64 crore, received by NRL were utilised for the purchase of properties,” ED claimed in its remand application while seeking Deepak Kochhar’s custody in September.Further, the agency claimed, “A residential property, an apartment at CCI Chambers was purchased for Rs 5.25 crore on February 19, 1996 by Credential Finance Limited (CFL) (A company in which Videocon Group had substantial interest along with Deepak and Chanda Kochhar and their family). CFL defaulted in repayment of the loan of Rs 4.7 crore availed from SBI (for which the said apartment was placed as security). Videocon paid off the dues in 2009, the ownership of the apartment was transferred to M/s Quality Appliances Pvt Ltd (QAPL), now known as M/s Quality Techno Advisors Pvt Ltd (QTAPL), a Videocon group company) from CFL. On November 26, 2016, total shareholding of QTAPL was acquired by Quality advisors (a family trust of Deepak Kochhar’s set up by Chanda Kochhar’s mother) for a nominal consideration of Rs 11 lakh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icici-bank-money-laundering-case-deepak-kochhar-remanded-to-ed-custody-till-october-17/story-JkFGQAKFyYPMY4antAiIrO.html

The new low in daily cases is the result of collaborative action by states and UTs under the Centre’s strategy of comprehensive and aggressive testing, prompt tracking and surveillance, hospitalization and adherence to the Standard Treatment Protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across the public and private hospitals and for home isolation,” the ministry said. The ministry said that 76% of new cases are from 10 states and Union territories. “Karnataka has overtaken Maharashtra with the highest number of new reported cases. Both still are contributing more than 7,000 new cases. The states which are reporting spurt in cases are Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. Also, 77,760 new recoveries were added in a span of 24 hours, according to data. With this, the total number of recoveries has surged to 62,27,295,” it added.The higher number of single-day recoveries is also reflected in the continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which is at present 86.78%, it added. “Besides, 78% of the new recovered cases are in 10 States and UTs. Maharashtra contributes more than 15,000 to the single-day recovery followed by Karnataka with more than 12,000 recoveries. The number of fatalities due to Covid-19 has been lower than 1000 mark for the successive days,” it said.There were 706 Covid-19 related deaths in the 24 hours and of these, nearly 79% are concentrated in 10 states and UTs. “More than 23% of new fatalities reported are from Maharashtra. The state contributed more than 15,000 to the single-day recovery followed by Karnataka with more than 12,000 recoveries,” the ministry added.India’s total Covid-19 caseload mounted to 7,175,880 and its death toll climbed to 109,856, according to the health ministry’s dashboard on Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-positivity-rate-on-constant-downward-trend-health-ministry/story-JE3b8bHBqncaZYLYWMSfxK.html
13-10-2020||India||Scientists radio-tag a crane, track its journey from Gujarat to Northern Kazakhstan and back||In a first, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun has tracked the journey of a common crane from Gujarat to its breeding site in Northern Kazakhstan and back to Gujarat where it returned on World Migratory Bird Day (October 10, 2020). This female common crane (a migratory bird) named Vadla was tagged with a transmitter in March this year by WII scientists to access the impact of power lines on such migratory birds. Suresh Kumar, a senior scientist from the Endangered Species Management department in WII who led the project said, “This project aims to study the impact of power lines on large birds like cranes and flamingos. The primary purpose is to see how these cranes fly across these power lines as there are reports of cranes and flamingos colliding with power lines and dying, which is a major issue.” Kumar said that the project is funded by the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. He further said that this is the first of such study where scientists are trying to assess these impacts and trying to identify the critical power line stretches that could potentially affect these birds. “One of the ways in which we are trying to understand this is by deploying transmitters on these birds to see how they move around when they are here. Now, one such bird that we had tagged in March this year, left for its breeding ground from Gujarat and has now returned. While tagging we did not know about its breeding ground, as it was being done for the first time… it ended up in Northern Kazakhstan from where it has returned,” Kumar said. The scientist further said that they now know the migratory route of the bird, the spots where the crane stopped at night for resting, “They are now trying to gather more information about the sites, as many of them are extremely remote like deserts in Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. With the broad idea of the crane’s behaviour, we will analyse all the data we get in a more detailed manner in the near future.” Prakash Javadekar, Union minister for environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) took to social media on Tuesday morning and tweeted, “A common crane named Vadla, migrated to a breeding site in Kazakhstan and then returned exactly to the site of her tagging in Gujarat on World Migratory Bird Day Oct 10. Isn’t it amazing and Kudos to Dr. Suresh Kumar and his team who tracked Vadla.” The theme of this year’s World Migratory Bird Day was Birds Connect Our World. The common crane is a medium-sized crane which is found in the Indian subcontinent, Asia, Africa, Europe. These cranes which are migratory in nature usually breed during May. Power lines have been a big threat to the birds in the country. Studying the Great Indian Bustard, the MoEFCC last year had released a report stating that high voltage transmission lines with vertical alignment are the biggest threat to the Great Indian Bustard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-radio-tag-a-crane-track-its-journey-from-gujarat-to-northern-kazakhstan-and-back/story-LxAv09Fz368nAN2clKSD2H.html

13-10-2020||India||Government body claims cow dung chip reduces radiation from mobile handsets||The chief of a federal body on animal husbandry has unveiled a chip made of cow dung, claiming it reduces radiation from mobile handsets. Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog chairman Vallabhbhai Kathiria showcased the chip while launching “Kamdhenu Deepawali Abhiyan”, a campaign to promote products made of cow dung. “Cow dung is anti-radiation. If you bring this home and place it in (on) your phone, it (the phone) will become radiation-free,” Kathiria said, showcasing the product at a press conference on Monday. The Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog is a body under the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, set up by the Narendra Modi government for “conservation, protection and development of cows and their progeny”, according to its website. Also Read: 3 friends from Delhi killed in crash trying to save a cow on roadKathiria said the chips are not certified by any scientific body but have been tested in laboratories. “You can test its effectiveness in any laboratory and even in colleges,” he said. Over 500 ‘gaushalas’, or cow shelters, are making these anti-radiation chips, he said. Scientists say that rigorous scientific tests, including peer review, would be necessary to demonstrate qualities like radiation absorption capacity of cow dung. “I don’t know anything about this, but any claim needs to pass rigourous scientific tests based on facts, whether it is a cow dung chip or a corona vaccine,” said Samir Brahmachari, a biophysicist and former director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The cow is revered by many Hindus, and some believe its by-products, such as urine, promotes health and well-being. Some uses of cow dung have been scientifically proven. For example, cow manure can be naturally treated to remove methane, a greenhouse gas, according to the US Environment Protection Agency. Also Read: IMA asks health minister to give proof on AYUSH, yoga-based treatment of CovidHowever, many claims regarding cow dung and cow urine remain untested by modern standards of science. In February, Swami Chakrapani Maharaj, president of the Hindu Mahasabha, a conservative Hindu organisation, declared that “consuming cow urine and cow dung will stop the effect of infectious coronavirus”. Meera Nanda, an Indian historian of science, describes this as a conviction that “India has always known everything that is worth knowing”. According to her, this has prevented Indians “from developing an ethos of honest inquiry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-body-claims-cow-dung-chip-reduces-radiation-from-mobile-handsets/story-pa0IGicBvWzykyNjEUkSFO.html

Anand said. White Knight Corps is the first line of defence along the LoC south of Pir Panjal range. Right from Akhnoor in Jammu district to the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch, 16 Corps has the operational responsibility of nearly 300 km long de-facto border with Pakistan.While the standoff with China in eastern Ladakh has been on since May, Pakistan has intensified ceasefire violations along the LoC in Jammu region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-corps-gets-a-new-commander-amid-a-spike-in-loc-ceasefire-violations-by-pakistan/story-1IYe9sLUGagwZaeaQLmsbP.html
13-10-2020||India||Health ministry issues guidelines to manage seasonal epidemic infections with Covid-19||With co-infection cases increasingly being reported by doctors, the Union health ministry has issued guidelines for the management of co-infection of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with other seasonal epidemic-prone diseases such as dengue, malaria, seasonal influenza (H1N1), etc.ALSO READ: Changing season got you sick? 6 things you can do to ease your flu symptoms“Given the seasonal pattern of epidemic-prone diseases observed every year in our country, diseases like dengue, malaria, seasonal influenza, leptospirosis, chikungunya, enteric fever, etc. can not only present a diagnostic dilemma but may co-exist in Covid-19 cases. This poses challenges in the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of Covid-19, and may have a bearing on clinical management and patient outcomes,” a health ministry statement read.“The scope of this document is to provide clear guidelines on prevention and treatment of co-infections…” the statement further read.Also Read: Covid-19 reinfection casts doubt on virus immunity: StudyThe document is based on the standards set up by international health agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), which say that apart from fever, patients could present other symptoms mimicking Covid-19 making the diagnosis difficult.“This document has been put out largely as a reference material to benefit treating doctors who are dealing with such cases on a daily basis,” said a health ministry official in the know of things.Approach to diagnosis of suspected co-infection A high index of suspicion must be maintained for these epidemic-prone diseases prevalent in a particular geographic region during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Bacterial co-infections must also be suspected in moderate or severe cases of Covid-19 not responding to treatment. Malaria/Dengue Confirmation of malaria or dengue infection does not rule out the possibility of the patient not suffering from Covid-19. Similarly, a high index of suspicion of malaria or dengue must be there when a fever is diagnosed as a symptom of Covid-19, particularly during the rainy and post-rainy season. Seasonal influenza Both Covid-19 and seasonal influenza present symptoms influenza like illness ((ILI/SARI), hence all ILI and SARI cases in areas reporting Covid-19 cases must be evaluated and tested for both Covid-19 and seasonal influenza. Also Read: How long can I expect a Covid-19 illness to last?ChikungunyaChikungunya manifests itself with an acute onset of moderate to high-grade continuous fever and malaise followed by rash, myalgia (muscle pain) and arthralgia (joint pain). Respiratory failure may ensue in late stages. Co-infection with Covid-19 may be suspected in chikungunya-endemic areas during monsoon. Leptospirosis (rat fever)Leptospirosis, apart from the symptom of fever, also has a tendency to manifest as acute respiratory illness, leading to respiratory distress and shock. In areas where leptospirosis is known to cause outbreaks during monsoon or post-monsoon, doctors need to keep in mind this co-infection while evaluating a patient. Scrub typhus Scrub typhus is known to be prevalent in the foothills of Himalayas in places such as Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Manipur, Nagaland, Meghalaya, etc. However, in the recent past, scrub typhus outbreaks have also been reported from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The clinical picture consists of sudden high-grade fever, severe headache, apathy, myalgia and generalised lymphadenopathy (swelling of lymph nodes). The patients may develop complications that include interstitial pneumonia (30% to 65% of cases), meningoencephalitis (brain swelling) and myocarditis (swelling of heart muscles). Bacterial infections Few patients with Covid-19 experience a secondary bacterial infection. In such cases, empiric antibiotic therapy needs to be considered.“Despite the possibility of above mentioned co-infections, in present times of the pandemic, the approach to diagnosis for Covid-19 essentially remains the same. Testing protocol as per the ministry of health and family welfare and Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines will be followed. However, in addition, further tests for a likely co-infection will also be undertaken, whenever suspected,” the ministry guidelines read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-issues-guidelines-to-manage-seasonal-epidemic-infections-with-covid-19/story-DNhVgF3Pe3sFWgCLiL4MAL.html
13-10-2020||India||Priest held for alleged sexual assault on woman in Kerala||The Kerala police on Tuesday arrested a Christian priest for allegedly sexually assaulting a 22-year-old woman in Idukki on Monday. Police said the priest Reji Palakkadan, also an Ayurveda practitioner, was held following a complaint filed by the woman’s parents.Palakkadan was running an Ayurveda clinic in Adimali as part of the church and the woman had visited the facility for treatment on Monday, police said. In their complaint, the parents said their daughter was assaulted by the priest in the name of treatment. The accused also threatened her not to reveal the incident to anyone. But she later narrated her plight to her parents who then filed a complaint with the police. Circle Inspector Anil George said the accused was booked under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty). “The accused priest was known as a doctor in the area. We will also examine his educational qualifications and other details. He will be produced in the court later in the day” George said. The church is yet to react to the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priest-held-for-alleged-sexual-assault-on-woman-in-kerala/story-fN8sBOSkNMpU3AwvoLIW3K.html
13-10-2020||India||No second chance to failed class 9,11 ISCE Board students: SC||The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday refused to allow a second chance to failed students of Grades 9 and 11, whose schools are affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), to appear for examinations in a bid to improve their scores and get promoted to the next class. A failed Grade 11 student, whose school is affiliated to the CISCE, had moved the apex court citing a similar relief provided by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) because of the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The student’s petition had prayed for an exception to the rule before the court, while citing the CBSE’s notification dated May 13. The CBSE as a “one-time measure” had extended its relief to both Grade 9 and 11 students this academic year owing to the contagion. The three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, dismissed the petition after the CISCE authorities submitted that granting the prayer would open a floodgate of similar requests by other failed students of Grades 9 and 11. The CISCE pointed out that around 10,000 such students from across 2,500 schools would seek to avail of the relief. The CISCE’s counsel, senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, argued that 90% of the syllabi of Grades 10 and 12 were covered by schools and any relief at this stage would hamper the academic year of the successful candidates. “We do not provide retest as a policy decision,” the CISCE argued. The bench, which also comprised Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, observed, “We can’t direct the board (CISCE) and create a situation, where lakhs of students seek a retest to improve their marks. How many such students will be there? It will lead to a chaotic situation.” Alakh Alok Srivastava, the petitioner’s lawyer, urged the SC to take a compassionate view and urged the latter to direct the CISCE to take a leaf out of the CBSE’s May 13 order. Srivastava pleaded that the petitioner would be able to cope up with his studies as both the CISCE and the CBSE authorities have decided to reduce their syllabi by 30% in all subjects and a move was in the works to further lessen them by 50% because of the raging viral outbreak. “It is not open for this court to issue any writ or direction to the CISCE to follow a decision by another board (CBSE),” the bench observed. The bench heard the submissions from both the parties and agreed with the CISCE’s contention while dismissing the petition of the unsuccessful Grade 9 candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-second-chance-to-failed-class-9-11-isce-board-students-sc/story-nCMgDBtPbrIdaQHFmfzEoO.html
13-10-2020||India||Parliament panel to visit Ladakh on October 28-29 amid India-China standoff||A group of parliamentarians is set to visit the Ladakh sector to get first-hand insights into aspects related to high-altitude clothing for soldiers, housing and rations at a time when India and China are locked in a border row and efforts to reduce friction have made no headway, officials familiar with the developments said Tuesday. The members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), headed by Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, are likely to visit Leh on October 28-29, the officials said. The visit was finalised after Chowdhury wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla last month suggesting that the PAC visit the Ladakh sector to interact with soldiers deployed there and understand their working conditions and requirements. Also Read: PLA rotates LAC troops, shows handThe committee is currently examining a recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that had pointed out deficiencies in high-altitude clothing and equipment and the need to equip soldiers with proper gear. The PAC discussed some issues related to rations and clothing with chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat during a meeting on September 6, the officials said. At this meeting, the PAC chairman asked the CDS to consider a tour for the MPs to the Ladakh sector, following which Chowdhury wrote to Birla. The PAC is expected to meet on October 23 to finalise its itinerary. In a report tabled in Parliament in February, the national auditor had drawn attention to the shortage of essential gear, clothing and rations being faced by soldiers deployed in high-altitude areas such as Siachen and Ladakh. Also Read: India, China hold seventh military talksThere was a critical shortage of snow goggles and troops were not issued multi-purpose boots between November 2015 and September 2016, a press statement issued by the CAG had then said. However, reacting to the CAG report, senior army officials had said that the deficiencies had been taken care of and each soldier deployed in Siachen was supplied with gear worth Rs 1 lakh. The MPs are likely to be briefed by senior army officials and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) scientists during the visit. The PAC scrutinises the appropriation accounts of the government and the reports prepared by the CAG. The PAC’s Leh visit comes at a time when both Indian and Chinese forces have made arrangements for a long haul in the eastern Ladakh theatre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-panel-to-visit-ladakh-on-october-28-29-amid-india-china-standoff/story-DmxN35t5yORO9iqiFbw2MJ.html

13-10-2020||India||Khushbu Sundar fifth Congress spokesperson to leave since March 2019||Actor-turned-politician Khushbu Sundar is the fifth Congress spokesperson to have jumped ship or been sacked since Marc h 2019 ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last year. First to switch sides was Gandhi family loyalist Tom Vadakkan who joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in March 2019, accusing the Congress of questioning the integrity of the armed forces after the Balakot air strikes. Vadakkan, once considered close to Vincent George, a longtime aide of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, had been associated with the party’s media department for nearly 20 years, many of them under leaders such as Pranab Mukherjee and VN Gadgil. In the recent organisational reshuffle in the BJP, Vadakkan was named as one of the party spokespersons. Vadakkan’s exit was followed by that of Priyanka Chaturvedi who quit the Congress to join the Shiv Sena in April 2019. Chaturvedi, who was the convenor of the Congress media cell, was upset over the reinstatement of some Uttar Pradesh party workers who had misbehaved with her earlier during a press conference in Mathura. The Shiv Sena later nominated her to the Rajya Sabha. Then, it was the turn of former Jharkhand Congress chief and spokesperson Ajoy Kumar who joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in September 2019 just before the assembly elections in the tribal-dominated state. He had complained about the functioning of the party’s Jharkhand leadership. However a year later, Kumar returned to the Congress fold this September. Announcing his return to the Congress on Twitter, he said, “Silence becomes cowardice when occasion demands speaking out the whole truth & acting accordingly. – Mahatma Gandhi. Driven by my conscience to speak up against injustice & institutional capture, I’ve been inspired by Shri Rahul Gandhi & decided to come back to INCIndia today.” But before Kumar’s return, the Congress in June this year removed Sanjay Jha as party spokesperson after he publicly criticised the party’s functioning and questioned the leadership. Jha had written an article in Times of India on June 7, saying it is a false claim that the Congress had an internal platform for frank exchange of ideas to get the party back on track. “It is a false claim that there exists a robust internal democratic process that listens to individual voices, and more importantly, is continuously focused on party renewal, political strategy, tactical warfare, leadership development and resuscitation starting at the grassroots, the erstwhile USP of the Congress,” he wrote in the article. And on Monday, Sundar became the fifth Congress spokesperson to leave. Soon after her joining the BJP, she told reporters that if the nation has to move forward, we need somebody like Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take the country in the right direction. “My expectation from BJP isn’t about what party is going to do for me, but about what party is going to do for people of the country. When you have 128 crore people actually believing in one man and that’s our PM, I think they’re doing something absolutely right,” she added. Earlier, in her resignation letter to the Congress president, Sundar wrote, “Few elements seated at higher levels within the party, people who have no connectivity with the ground reality or public recognition are dictating terms and people like me who wanted to work for the party sincerely, are being pushed and suppressed.” The actor had earned the ire of Congress leaders from Tamil Nadu after she took a divergent stand on the issue of the National Education Policy (NEP). While the Congress had strongly opposed the policy, she welcomed it. Sundar later apologised to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi but insisted she would “rather speak the fact than be a head nodding robot or a puppet”. A Congress functionary blamed the managers of the communications department for the exit of the spokespersons who are also faces of the party in the media. “It is surprising to see that these spokespersons find it difficult to defend the leadership and hence prefer to jump ship. Our media managers have also failed in keeping their house in order,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khushbu-sundar-fifth-congress-spokesperson-to-leave-since-march-2019/story-z3oA6JUSGhiYG4RTs4qKIN.html
13-10-2020||India||In Andhra, stalker sets woman on fire, she pulls him in. Both dead||A 24-year-old woman, working as a nurse at a Covid-19 care centre at Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, was set on fire by a stalker at her residence on Monday night, the police said. The stalker, who sustained 80 per cent burn injuries while setting the woman ablaze, also succumbed to his burns while undergoing treatment at Government General Hospital in Guntur in the early hours of Tuesday. Assistant Commissioner of Police M Ramesh told Hindustan Times that the woman had been in love with the man for the last four years, but a few months ago, she wanted to end the relationship with him. “Yet, the man had been stalking her and harassing her to marry him,” he said. On October 5, the woman lodged a complaint with the Governorpet police in Vijayawada alleging that the man was continuing to harass her, though she had been spurning his love. “He was called to the police station and warned against stalking her. After he gave an undertaking that he would not trouble her again, the woman withdrew the complaint,” the ACP said. On Monday night, when the woman returned to her room nearer to the Covid-19 care centre where she was working, the stalker appeared again and argued with her for filing a police complaint against him. “It was evident that he came prepared to kill her. During the course of argument, he took out a bottle of petrol he had brought with him, poured it over her and set her ablaze. The woman caught hold of him tightly so that he could not escape after killing her. Listening to their cries, neighbours rushed there and separated them before dousing the fire,” Ramesh said. While the woman died on the spot, the stalker was severely injured and was rushed to the government hospital Guntur after initial treatment in Vijayawada. “He died in the early hours of Tuesday,” the police official said. The ACP said while the police booked a case of murder (Section 302 of the IPC) against the stalker initially and after his death, another case was registered under Section 174 of Criminal Procedure Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-andhra-stalker-sets-woman-on-fire-she-pulls-him-in-both-dead/story-dmkApLzIwVsaMZJ00TTNOP.html

But since the past week, it has come below 5% and on Monday when we conducted over one lakh tests, the rate was just 1.41%,” Sarma told journalists at a press conference. Till Monday, Assam’s Covid-19 tally stood at 195,304 cases with 166,036 recoveries and 826 deaths. The recovery rate in the state is 85% and the mortality rate is 0.42%. Till Monday nearly 39.50 lakh samples had been tested across the state and the total test per million is 115,179. The rate of doubling of cases has slowed down to 46.4 days at present. “If we are able to stay vigilant over the next few days, we can say the Covid-19 curve in Assam has started flattening for the first time. If all guidelines are followed during the coming Durga Puja season and there is no substantial rise in cases, it would be significant,” said Sarma. The minister said that while 826 people have been declared dead due to Covid-19 till date by the death audit board (DAB) nearly 1000 more have died in the state due to post-Covid complications or illnesses and accidents not related to the disease. “We are expecting to get the first set of Covid vaccines between January and July next year. Frontline workers and senior citizens above 60 years would be the first recipients. It is expected that more than one vaccine would be available around that time,” said Sarma. The minister also announced a fresh set of guidelines that have to be followed during the Durga Puja festivities that begin next week. They include mandatory permission from district authorities to organize puja, construction of airy and spacious pandals with separate entry and exit points and mandatory Covid-19 tests for priests before and after the puja festivities. “Anyone entering puja enclosures will have to wear masks and sanitize their hands and no more than 50 people will be allowed at one time in the pandals,” said Sarma. “Puja mandaps will have to close at 10 pm, pillion riding by men won’t be allowed during the festival, no cultural programmes or competitions will be allowed, but aarti can be performed at the pandals,” he added. Other guidelines include closure of restaurants at 9 pm during festive season, ban on mass immersions of idols as well as ban on processions carrying idols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-positivity-drops-in-assam-minister-says-curve-is-flattening/story-PViDliqlgbCCEOaJeLU2SI.html
13-10-2020||India||Health Ministry guidelines for co-infection management of Covid-19 with seasonal epidemic-prone diseases||The Ministry of Health on Tuesday issued guidelines for the management of co-infection of Covid-19 with other seasonal epidemic-prone diseases.With the aim of providing clear guidelines on prevention and treatment of co-infections of coronavirus with other diseases, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said, “As per the World Health Organisation (WHO) case definition, a Covid case may present with acute onset of fever and cough, or, acute onset of any three or more of the following signs or symptoms: fever, cough, general weakness or fatigue, headache, myalgia, sore throat, coryza, dyspnoea, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, altered mental status.”“This case definition, although sensitive, is not very specific. Seasonal epidemic prone diseases, as cited in the foregoing paragraphs may all present as febrile illness, with symptoms that mimic Covid-19. If there is a co-infection, then apart from the febrile illness there may be constellation of signs and symptoms that may lead to difficulty in diagnosis. A comparative analysis of disease onset, symptoms, signs, warning signs, complications and diagnosis is given at Annexure,” the ministry added.The seasonal pattern of epidemic prone diseases observed each year includes diseases like Dengue, Malaria, Seasonal Influenza, Leptospirosis, Chikungunya and Enteric fever. They can co-exist with the current Covid-19 pandemic and can also pose clinical and laboratory diagnostic issues.The Health Ministry has listed approaches to diagnose suspected co-infection which include, a high index of suspicion for epidemic prone diseases existing in specific regions during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Bacterial co-infections must also be suspected in moderate or severe cases of Covid-19 not responding to treatment.“It should also be considered that malaria and dengue can coexist with other infections, and thus a diagnosis of either of these does not rule out the possibility of the patient not suffering from Covid-19. Similarly, a high index of suspicion of malaria and dengue must be there when a fever case is diagnosed as Covid-19, particularly during the rainy and post rainy season in areas endemic for these diseases,” the Ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-guidelines-for-co-infection-management-of-covid-19-with-seasonal-epidemic-prone-diseases/story-RmOtFgNCJkr6z4RHV37CyH.html

13-10-2020||India||Rice procurement up 33%, but MSP eludes other crops||The government has bought over 4 million tonne of paddy from nearly 350,000 farmers, who have been paid minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 8,032 crore till October 11 since procurement of crops began on September 24. The quantity procured so far is 33% higher than the corresponding period last year, according to data cited by the farm ministry. While the procurement of the kharif staple is robustly continuing, farmers in Punjab and Haryana, however, continue to protest a set of laws enacted by Parliament to deregulate agricultural markets, which they fear will weaken the MSP system, whereby farm produce is bought by the government at assured prices. The Centre would also procure pulses, oilseeds and copra at MSP prices beyond the quantity approved so far from any state where the market rate falls below MSP under its price support scheme, the agriculture ministry said a statement. Also Read: Haryana farmers fret as basmati prices fall to ₹1,800 per quintalDespite this, several summer-sown crops, such as soybean and maize, are selling below minimum set by the government because the government procures too little of non-cereals. The government “continues to procure kharif 2020-21 crops at its MSP from farmers as per its existing MSP schemes” and procurement is “going on smoothly”, a farm ministry statement said, pointing to the higher procurement trend. Till October 11, the government through its food agencies has additionally procured 606.56 tonne of two pulses—moong and urad—with an MSP value of Rs 4.36 crore.The government has also approved requests from 10 states to procure 3.70 million tonne of pulses and oilseeds. These states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. The government has also sanctioned the procurement of 100,000 tonne of copra, a perennial crop, from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Also Read: Farm bills: Farmers set preconditions after government outreach for talksCrops, such as soybean, ragi, maize and cotton, are selling up to 30% below MSPs, data from Agmarknet, the agriculture ministry’s portal that tracks prices in mandis or wholesale markets, shows. Poor returns from crops have been a lingering problem for farmers, especially during episodes of glut, such as now. MSPs, which are fixed at 50% over cost for nearly two dozen crops, don’t necessarily lead to higher farm incomes as the government’s procurement at MSP rates is largely restricted to wheat and rice. For most other crops, farmers are mostly price takers, meaning they are forced to accept whatever the markets dictate. “Nudging the private sector towards triggering a market-clearing price that is closer or equal to MSP will depend on the extent of government’s procurement,” economist Abhijit Sen said. For commodities, such as pulses and oilseeds, the government’s procurement is insufficient to improve market rates. For instance, the nearly 3.70 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds they government has approved for procurement at MSP is less than 15% of the total production—too small a quantity to make a difference in prices offered by private entities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rice-procurement-up-33-but-msp-eludes-other-crops/story-NdKDCLtLkTPY66KF5UBpaL.html

This is what separated him from others,” PM Modi said.The PM also credited the Padma Bhushan awardee with bringing farmers together. This, he said, was because Dr Balasaheb had seen the pain of poor and farmers closely.PM Modi also warned people of Maharashtra on the danger of coronavirus. “The danger of coronavirus still persists. In Maharashtra, the situation is a little more worrying. I appeal to all, don’t be careless about wearing masks and social distancing.

13-10-2020||India||Man climbs 2 floors, throws acid on 3 sisters sleeping at home: Cop||Three Dalit sisters - aged 8, 12 and 17 years - were attacked with inflammable liquid, suspected to be acid, while they were sleeping inside their house in Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda district in the early hours of Tuesday, said police officials. There have been no arrests in the incident as yet. Officers said the preliminary enquiry suggested that the inflammable liquid was thrown from the open window of the house; the eldest sister suffered major injuries on face and chest while two other sisters have minor injuries on hands. They said all three have been admitted to the Gonda district hospital where they are being treated and investigation is underway.The officials confirmed the three sisters are from Dhobi community and fall under the scheduled caste category.A police official at DGP headquarters in Lucknow said the incident took place in Paska village under Paraspur police station limits of Gonda at around 2.30 am on intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. He said the initial probe revealed that the girls were sleeping in the room on the second floor of the house and the attacker climbed up to throw acid from the open window.He said the sequence of events suggested that the attacker was aware about the family and knew that the girl sleeps in a room on the second floor. He said the police team have yet to trace the attacker and reason behind the crime. The eldest girl, the officer added, would probably help in tracing the accused and clarify the reason behind the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-climbed-2-floors-to-throw-acid-on-3-dalit-sisters-in-up-s-gonda-cops/story-nfykSBWiV1J6Q3j2RJBVIJ.html
13-10-2020||India||Amid fluid opposition tie-ups in UP, SP-RLD may forge long-term alliance||Donning their signature red caps, a group of Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders from Lucknow and west UP rallied around Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Chaudhary on the stage at the RLD’s Loktantra Bachao Mahapanchayat (Save Democracy rally) in Muzaffarnagar last Thursday.It was at this rally that Jayant asked his clansmen (Jats) in the region to return to their political home (the RLD) to oust the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from power at the Centre and in the state.Then, on Friday night, the RLD declared Praveen Kumar Singh as its candidate for the Bulandshahr assembly seat after the SP announced that it would leave the seat for the RLD. Bypolls will be held for seven assembly seats, including Bulandshahr, in UP on November 3.“On all other (six) seats, the RLD will support the Samajwadi Party,” said RLD national secretary Girish Kumar Chaudhary.These moves signal that the SP and RLD alliance, the only one among Opposition parties in UP at present, may turn out to be a long-term one.“We will be allies in the 2022 UP assembly polls as well,” said Anil Dubey, the RLD’s national general secretary.The SP contested the 2017 UP assembly polls in alliance with the Congress and won only 47 seats, losing 177 seats in comparison to its 2012 tally of 224 seats. The RLD went alone in the polls and won only one seat which was eight below its 2012 mark.Soon after, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary became friends. The two came together for the first time in the 2018 UP Lok Sabha and assembly bypolls for four seats -- Gorakhpur, Phulpur, and Kairana (all Lok Sabha) and Noorpur (assembly). They wrested all the four seats from the BJP.In 2019, when Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav firmed up an alliance, the RLD was nowhere in the picture initially. However, Akhilesh Yadav convinced her to take the RLD on board. The SP-BSP gave three seats (Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Mathura) to the RLD to contest. The RLD could not win any of these seats. The SP’s tally remained at five, the same as in 2014, but it lost in its bastions of Kannauj and Firozabad. The BSP, on the other hand, won 11 seats, against none in 2014.Soon afterwards, Mayawati walked out of the alliance, but the RLD continued with the SP. In the 2019 UP assembly bypolls for 11 seats, SP retained the Rampur seat and wrested Jalalpur and Zaidpur from the BJP. The BJP won the eight other seats.Now, the SP and the RLD are contesting the 2020 assembly bypolls together. Malhani (Jaunpur) was the only one of the seven seats that the SP had won in 2017. The BJP had bagged the six others. The SP-RLD alliance is looking to retain Malhani and win more seats this time.Commenting on the SP-RLD tie-up, SK Dwivedi, a political analyst and former head of the department of political science at Lucknow University, said: “It is good that the two parties and their leaders, Akhilesh and Jayant, have behaved in a mature way without any tension and bickering between the two parties since they came together. This, despite the fact that both their fathers — Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ajit Singh — were sworn adversaries in politics. Akhilesh should look to bring more such regional players into the alliance.”Samajwadi Party national secretary Rajendra Chaudhary and his RLD counterpart Anil Dubey said that the two parties will be together for the 2022 UP assembly polls as well.The RLD and SP are currently campaigning together for the RLD’s Bulandshahr candidate Praveen Kumar Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-fluid-opposition-tie-ups-in-up-sp-rld-may-forge-long-term-alliance/story-XtG20U8PPISSleadAstZzL.html
13-10-2020||India||Act against BJD leaders violating Covid norms, BJP MP tells Naveen Patnaik||Smarting over the sealing of her office in Bhubaneswar over alleged violation of Covid-19 guidelines, BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi wrote to chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday for his ‘partial’ attitude in taking action while overlooking similar violations of Biju Janata Dal MLAs and ministers.Sarangi’s office in Bhubaneswar was sealed on October 10 after video clips emerged of celebration of her birthday in her office the previous day in which her supporters were seen without masks and violating social distancing guidelines. Soon after Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation sealed the office, a livid Sarangi started her office by the roadside to protest the action.In a stinging letter to the CM, the first-time BJP MP raised questions on the selective nature of the BMC in enforcing the rules even as the guidelines were reportedly violated by the BJD leaders frequently on several occasions.“I appreciate the alacrity with which BMC has taken this action; however, it is the selective nature of BMC’s action which raises suspicion regarding the intent behind such enforcement. I have come across innumerable instances of violation of Covid-19 regulations at BJD party headquarters as well as by the Ministers, MLAs and party workers. While no action has been initiated against such violations, the sealing of my office, that too without detection of a single Covid positive case in my office or among my supporters who were present in the office, does deserve answers from your government,” she wrote“The action of sealing the office of a sitting MP smacks of partiality and vindictiveness. Given the flagrant violations at BJD party office, I would also be looking at when the BJD party office will be sealed,” Sarangi said in the letter,” the MP said in her letter.Sarangi gave examples of alleged violations of Covid-19 regulations by minister of state for home, Divyashankar Mishra as well similar violations during the funeral event of BJD MLA Pradeep Maharathy, who died last week. “While a case has been filed against MLA Uma Samantray, minister(Sameer Dash) has been allowed to go scot-free. He had tested positive only a few days before and how he was allowed to participate in the funeral without specifically being tested negative. What action has been taken for such an unusual congregation at Swargadwar? she asked.Sarangi said the sealing of her office was intended to prevent her from discharging her responsibilities as a public representative. “I am now forced to hold my office on the roads of Bhubaneswar for the next 15 days. Under any circumstances the wheel of progress/development will not stop,” she said.However, BJD MP from Jagatsinghpur, Rajashree Mallick defended party MLA Umakanta Samantray and other leaders over the alleged violation of Covid-19 guidelines while attending the funeral of late senior leader Pradeep Maharathy at Swargadwar in Puri. “Uma has done nothing wrong in attending the funeral,” said Mallick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/act-against-bjd-leaders-violating-covid-norms-bjp-mp-tells-naveen-patnaik/story-vfdqFKXqNi1kIInFnTrZQL.html

Vardhan had earlier said that the government is working in collaboration with the state governments to collect data so as to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, once they are ready. “Our utmost priority is how to ensure a vaccine for each and everybody in the country,” he had said.Click here complete coronavirus coverage In the latest episode of weekly Sunday Samwad, the health minister informed the citizens about the key factors that will be taken into account to ascertain the priority groups. “Prioritisation of groups to be vaccinated shall be based on key considerations, first is occupational hazard at the risk of exposure to the infection and second is the risk of developing severe disease and increased mortality,” he said. On the number of vaccines that will be available, the health minister on Sunday said that given the population size of the country, India may have to tie up with more than one vaccine manufacturer to ensure that everyone is able to access the shot. “All Covid-19 vaccines currently in India are in the phases 1, 2 or 3 of trials with results awaited. Adequate safety and efficacy data is required for emergency use authorization vaccine approval for ensuring patient safety. Further course of action will be based on data generated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-expected-in-early-2021-distribution-plan-in-works-harsh-vardhan/story-B8cvFQSdvm9J97NAbDyngK.html

According to Gamlin, once someone has raised an issue or lodged a complaint about difficulty in accessing a building or a facility by uploading a picture and briefly describing the problem, the social justice ministry team would forward it to the concerned authorities. If the matter is not addressed soon, it will be taken up with the head of the department of the particular body. Reminders will be sent and the it would be followed up till the issue is addressed.Gamlin also asked every ministry and department to designate a senior officer as the nodal officer so that issues can be taken up and resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/app-to-help-ease-accessibility-issues-differently-abled-face-in-buildings-transport-system/story-ZTydvddJVqsVFi5ZMNgumM.html
13-10-2020||India||Eight firms submit bids for consultant to chart UP’s $1 trillion economy roadmap||A top management institute is among eight bidders that have submitted their proposals to the Uttar Pradesh government for selection as the consultant to perform the ‘herculean task’ of working out a roadmap to boost the state’s gross domestic product (GSDP) to one trillion dollars in the next five years.“The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, is one among the eight bidders for the consultant and the state government will soon decide the date and time for technical presentation, evaluation and opening of financial bids,” confirmed a senior officer.With most agreeing that working out a roadmap to boost the size of GSDP to one trillion dollars is a challenging one, especially in view of the impact of Covid-19 on the state’s economy, the response to the state government’s request for proposal (RFP) is being considered encouraging.“The consultant will face a great challenge to suggest an out of the box idea for a roadmap to boost the size of GSDP to one trillion dollars. It looks like an aspirational goal rather than an achievable target. It will need a growth rate of nearly 45% per annum,” said Yashvir Tyagi, retired professor of economics, Lucknow University.The RFP document asks the consultant to design ‘monthly, quarterly and annual key performance indicators, how to measure them, and who should measure them and its online reporting mechanism’. It also asked the consultant to ‘make critical assessment (e.g. SWOT analysis) of existing institutional framework in the state to participate in the entire process towards achieving the mission…’It further asked the consultant to ‘develop strategic framework based on status and recent trends, determine multipliers between sectoral growth and impact on GSDP and assign targets and how to achieve them for each sector towards one trillion (dollar) economy’.The state government has already made it clear to the bidders that the work to boost the size of the state’s GSDP to one trillion dollars will be a herculean task.About the state’s economy, the RFP said, “The state has already embarked upon the journey of growth and prosperity. Resultantly, in 2018-19, GSDP has already touched Rs 15.80 lakh crore ($230 billion) with a rich growth rate of 7% over the previous year. However, it would be a challenging task to boost the size of the GSDP by nearly five times to reach the target of one trillion dollars in five years (2020-2025), discounting for dollar fluctuations and global trends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-firms-submit-bids-for-consultant-to-chart-up-s-1-trillion-economy-roadmap/story-1gIklnVYZ1mFGWEG3Ke4XN.html

13-10-2020||India||Bombay HC refuses pre-arrest bail to head of firm accused of cheating IITM of Rs. 2.62 cr||The Bombay high court last week refused anticipatory bail to the managing director of a private firm accused of causing wrongful loss of Rs. 2.62 crore to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune by supplying sub-standard digital display boards to the institute.The anti-corruption wing of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had booked Anil Girkar, managing director of M/s.Video Wall India Private Ltd., his wife Manisha, also a director in the firm, along with some scientists and engineers of IITM in connection with the alleged fraud.The CBI alleged that in 2012, the firm was awarded a contract to supply 12 high quality digital display boards and three indoor LCD display for displaying data of current air quality, meteorological data, forecast at different places in Pune, as part of IITM’s SAFAR - System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research - project. The firm, however, supplied sub-standard displays and the officers concerned at IITM fraudulently approved the items as quality products, as contemplated under the tender.The couple had moved HC after the sessions judge at Pune rejected their anticipatory bail applications on August 14, 2020.They had questioned the belated allegation of fraud and escalation of prices. It was argued on their behalf that the contract was awarded to them after their bid was scrutinized by an expert committee.They also contended that there was no need of custodial interrogation of the applicants, since the supply was made by their firm as per specifications mentioned in the tender notice. The contract was successfully discharged and after completing the work of operation and maintenance for five years, in 2017 it was also given an extension for three years, and this sequence of events clearly leads to an inference that there was no deficiency on their part, they said.Advocate Hiten Venegaokar, who represented CBI, on the other hand pointed out that the tender document envisaged supply of branded products by certain Japanese and German manufacturers, but the firm supplied China-made cheap display boards. He also pointed out that the firm imported the boards from a Chinese firm for a total amount of Rs. 24.67 lakh, and charged IITM Rs. 2.98 crore for the same - about eight times the procurement cost.Justice Bharati Dangre accepted the contention. The judge noted that the tender required the display boards with brightness of 9,000 NIT, but those supplied had brightness of only 6000 NIT. Similarly frame refresh rate was required to be at least 4,000 Hz, as against the actual of 60 Hz.“The (internal) enquiry (at IITM) therefore revealed that what was supplied was sub-standard material. It was lacking in the particulars specified in the tender notice and in the supply order,” said justice Dangre while rejecting Girkar’s pre-arrest bail plea.HC, however, granted anticipatory bail to his wife, Anita, on the ground that she had no role to play in the entire transaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-head-of-firm-accused-of-cheating-iitm-of-rs-2-62-cr/story-xQzlTsjzspmYxqSJq2s22L.html

13-10-2020||India||Covid-19: Vaccine candidates and therapies and where they stand||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) roared back as the world reopened after spending months under lockdown. This underscored an urgent need for treatment and vaccines.Billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said that normalcy will come only when second generation of Covid-19 vaccine will be rolled out. The World Health Organisation (WHO), meanwhile, believes that a Covid-19 vaccine will be ready for registration by the end of 2020 or early next year at the earliest.The virus that was first detected in China late last year has now touched nearly every corner of the globe. As of October 12, 37.7 million had been infected by Covid-19.The race to develop a vaccine is moving ahead at an unprecedented pace, with over 150 candidates in development and some two dozen candidates already being tested in people, according to news agency Reuters. However, there are still no word on a vaccine’s availability.Here are some of the drugs, therapies and vaccines under development to fight Covid-19:Remdesivir: The antiviral drug given by infusion previously failed as an Ebola treatment but showed promise against certain coronaviruses in animal studies. In a randomised trial, remdesivir led to significant reduction in recovery time of hospitalised patients compared with a placebo, demonstrating that it does impact Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. More than a dozen trials are underway in China, Europe and the United States with positive results starting to emerge.Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The HCQ is widely used for treating malaria, but it has now been found to have anti-viral as well as anti-inflammatory activity. During trials, the HCQ successfully blocked the novel coronavirus’ entry into cells. Subsequent studies have found little benefit in patients treated with the drug. Health experts caution that HCQ should never be used without a prescription and could lead to dangerous side effects. Dozens of clinical trials to assess benefits of the drug to Covid-19 patients are ongoing, but several major trials were halted following a safety warning by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in May.Aspirin, Clopidogrel (Plavix), Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Atorvastatin (Lipitor), Omeprazole (Prilosec): These have been put under trial in the United Kingdom. The drugs try to mitigate the effect of Covid-19 on heart muscles. These cardioprotective drugs will be tried on 3,000 patients in the UK, with a completion date of March 30, 2021.BCG tuberculosis vaccine: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin tuberculosis vaccine induces a broad innate immune-system response, which has been shown to protect against infection or severe illness with other respiratory pathogens. Large trials of the drug were conducted in Australia and the Netherlands to understand its efficacy in fighting the vius that causes Covid-19. In a small trial in the United Arab Emirates, none of the 71 hospital staff who received a BCG booster shot in early March had been infected with the virus by late June, compared with 18 of 201 staff who did not receive the vaccine and tested Covid-19 positive.Convalescent plasma: This is a method which is being considered by health experts to treat Covid-19. Blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients is transfused into patients who are currently ill, in the hope that freshly-made antibodies will help fight the virus. The method has been used for more than 100 years and carries little risk of harm or side effects. In Delhi, the government led by Arvind Kejriwal has opened centres where plasma is donated. Kejriwal has also urged people of Delhi to come out in large numbers to donate the plasma which can then be used to treat patients suffering from Covid-19.NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells: The non-drug therapy pairs NKG2D receptor for the immune system’s natural killer (NK) cells that play a major role attacking foreign invaders like cancer or viruses, with the ACE-2 receptor that the coronavirus uses to enter human cells. The therapy is being tested by Chinese firm Chongqing Sidemu Biotechnology Technology Co Ltd. More than 90 patients are undergoing tests to know whether this cell therapy can prevent the Sars-CoV-2 virus from entering cells and multiplying.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-candidates-and-therapies-and-where-they-stand/story-hUGWVbUvQZhjQVX5gEfpPL.html

13-10-2020||India||Mumbai power outage: Electricity restored in suburban areas after a wait of 15 hours||Over 15 hours after a power outage in Mumbai, electricity was restored in parts of the city, Navi Mumbai and Thane around 2am Tuesday. In Mumbai, suburban areas of Mulund, Bhandup, Vikhroli and some parts of Malad and Santacruz had no power or faced frequent power cuts till late Monday night. At midnight, state energy minister Nitin Raut stated that the staff was working on a war-footing to restore power in parts of Mulund, Thane and Navi Mumbai. He had earlier said that the areas did not receive power supply as around 500MW of Tata Power plant was not in sync with the system yet. Also Read: Power outage in Mumbai: Why did city’s islanding system for uninterrupted electricity supply fail?Later he tweeted, “Tata’s generation started and picking up. I am personally monitoring the situation and assure you that it will gain momentum in an hour.” Millions of residents were affected after a major outage in Mumbai on Monday morning took place due to “multiple trippings” at the substations supplying power to Mumbai, bringing it to a complete standstill. While power was restored in some parts in three hours, many parts were in the dark till late at night. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday evening ordered a probe in the incident. He also asked officials to remain alert since heavy rainfall is predicted in Mumbai. Monday’s blackout from around 10.05am paralysed India’s financial capital, already straining under the Covid-19 pandemic, stranding thousands of train passengers; affecting hospitals, online exams and mobile telephone services; disrupting the new normal of work-from-home and trapping people in elevators.

Last week, in advance of Secretary Pompeo’s meeting with minister Jaishankar and their Japanese and Australian counterparts in Tokyo, I read remarks by the esteemed, retired Indian diplomat Ashok Kantha. I was particularly struck by a comment he made.”“I could not agree more with Ambassador Kantha. We have been too cautious. Last week’s important and successful Quad ministerial leaves the United States confident that perhaps, just maybe, we can say that we are present at the creation of those strategic linkages to which Ambassador Kantha refers,” he added.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had last week met for the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, US) ministerial dialogue in Tokyo last week.Biegun further said that Washington appreciates New Delhi’s strategic autonomy adding that there is “enormous opportunity” in the United States’ security relationship with India.“In thinking about the future, it is no secret that I see enormous opportunity in the United States’ security relationship with India. India has a strong and proud tradition of strategic autonomy, and we respect that,” the US Deputy Secretary of State said.He added that the Trump administration does not “seek to change” India’s traditions. “Rather we want to explore how to empower them and India’s ability to defend its own sovereignty and democracy and to advance Indian interests, across the Indo-Pacific region. As the United States assesses our own interests and how they intersect with India’s, we have seen the conditions emerge for an organic and deeper partnership--not an alliance on the post-war model, but a fundamental alignment along shared security and geopolitical goals, shared interests, and shared values,” Biegun added.Beigun, on Monday, arrived in New Delhi for his three-day visit with an aim to advance the United States-India Comprehensive Global Strategic PartnershipExternal affairs minister Jaishankar on Monday met with visiting Biegun and exchanged views on world politics and regional issues.“... Appreciated the steady progress of our bilateral cooperation.

DS Meena, divisional forest officer of Narendra Nagar forest division in the district said that the incident occurred late on Sunday night when the girl went to the washroom outside the house by herself. “The incident occurred around 9:30 pm on Sunday night when the 7-year-old was attacked by a leopard outside her house. The girl was going to use the washroom outside the house when the animal dragged her away. Her body was later recovered from a nearby forest area on Sunday night itself and sent for post-mortem examination on Monday afternoon,” said the DFO. Villagers protested after the incident demanding that the leopard be declared as a man-eater and eliminated. They have been cautioned against letting their children come out of houses without being accompanied by elders. The DFO further said that the forest department has installed a cage and camera traps to track the leopard’s movements and catch it. On October 7, a 7-year-old girl was killed in a leopard attack outside her house in Berinag division of Pithoragarh district. On October 1, a 14-year-old boy was killed by a leopard in Pauri Garhwal district when he was grazing cattle in the forest area. On September 24, a leopard killed an 11-year-old girl in Pithoragarh district when she was collecting fodder near her house. On September 19, a 7-year-old girl was mauled to death by a leopard when she was playing near her house in Almora district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-year-old-girl-in-tehri-becomes-fifth-leopard-victim-in-less-than-a-month-in-uttarakhand/story-7hzSDiTzWc1egNQYIixA5I.html

Abdullah made the remarks during a television interview.The NC said that its leader’s comments were twisted. It said that Abdullah never justified the expansionist or aggressive intention, what is being claimed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Our patron was highlighting the anger of the people because of the abrogation of Article 370 last year. He has been doing that the past month. He said that nobody is ready to accept these changes in Jammu and Kashmir,” a spokesperson of the NC said, according to Hindustan Times’ Hindi language publication Hindustan.“Our leader never said that Article 370 will be restored with the help of China, which was claimed by BJP leader Shambit Patra at a press conference. He also presented some earlier statements of Mr Farooq Abdullah in a wrong manner,” Hindustan further quoted the spokesperson as saying.ALSO WATCH | BJP slams Farooq Abdullah’s Article 370 & China remark, says it’s ‘seditious’Abdullah said in a television interview on Sunday he wished that with China’s support, Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir, will be restored.In the interview, Abdullah noted that China was not happy with the nullification of Article 370, which was scrapped in August last year by Parliament.“As far as China is concerned, I didn’t bring {the} Chinese president here. Our Prime Minister invited him to Gujarat and even did jhoola sawari with him. He [PM Modi] even took him to Chennai and had food with him,” he had said.The former chief minister of J&K said that China “never accepted” the nullification of Article 370. “They said till you restore Article 370, we won’t stop because it has now become an open issue,” he said.“May Allah wish that our people get help from their might and our Articles 370 and 35-A get restored,” Abdullah said.The BJP termed the comments “seditious”. “It is saddening as well as worrying. A sitting MP is using such words for the country. He thinks that China’s aggression is because abrogation of Article 370 has happened. He categorically states that since Indian Parliament abrogated Article 370, China is disturbed and that is why China’s aggression is justified. He seems to justify the expansionist tendencies of China,” BJP leader Sambit Patra said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-abdullah-never-said-article-370-will-be-restored-with-china-s-help-clarifies-national-conference/story-LtEekST6Km1b4fEOrwMfdM.html

13-10-2020||India||Balwinder Singh a target in TMC’s fight against BJP, says Akal Takht jathedar||Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Monday condemned the October 8 incident at Howrah in which a Sikh man’s turban fell off while he was arrested for carrying a pistol at a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) agitation.The incident triggered outrage as the pagri (turban) and kesh (unshorn hair) are an integral part of the Sikh faith. Akali Dal leaders have alleged that the man, Balwinder Singh, was dragged by his hair. The Akal Takht is the highest temporal seat of Sikhism and its jathedar is the leader of the clergy. The National Commission for Minorities on Monday also sought a report from the state government on this incident within 15 days Balwinder Singh is in police custody and has been charged with carrying a pistol, the licence for which is not valid in West Bengal. In a video message circulated among members of the Sikh community, Giani Harpreet Singh has accused the West Bengal government of making Balwinder Singh a target in the political fight between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP. “In the ongoing fight between TMC and BJP, Balwinder has been made a target by the Mamata Banerjee government. This is absolutely unacceptable. He has licence for the weapon and it is valid across India,” he said in Punjabi. “The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa has gone to Bengal and talked to police officials. It seems the Bengal government, especially the chief minister, has made up her mind to play with the life of the young Sikh. Her fight is with the BJP. Let her continue with that fight but this man should not be made a target,” said the jathedar. “The incident has caused anger and frustration among Sikhs across the world. Balwinder Singh is an innocent man. Mamata Banerjee should do justice and release the man without any condition,” he added. Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who is also an Akali Dal leader, has challenged the charges brought by the state police against the accused. He wrote a four-page complaint to Virendra, the director general of police, on Monday. “I have shown the local police copies of the original licence and the district magistrate’s office at Rajouri, Kashmir, has also confirmed that area validity of the licence was extended to cover all states. I have filed a police complaint. I will also file a writ petition in the Calcutta high court,” Sirsa told HT. He shared photos of the original licence on his social media page along with videos in which Balwinder Singh’s wife appealed for his release. HT tried to contact Virendra several times on Monday afternoon but nobody picked up the phone in his office. The letter sent to chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay by the national commission for minorities said it sought the report on the basis of a complaint received from Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga. A copy of the letter was also sent to Virendra. Bagga is one of the spokespersons of the Delhi unit of the BJP. He shared an image of the letter on Twitter. A delegation of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee met West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday and sought his intervention. “Concerned at adversarial stance @WBPolice @HomeBengal with all out effort to garner and manipulate support for inhuman treatment meted out #BalvinderSingh. Time @MamataOfficial for healing touch rather than be in justification mode. Law allows capping of such wrongs,” Dhankhar tweeted on Monday. In a second tweet he referred to a Supreme Court judgement and recalled that Rabindranath Tagore returned his Nobel prize after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre by the British. “Apex Court dictum in D K Basu was outraged @MamataOfficial. Recall Kabiguru felt pain of Jallianawala Bagh massacre thousand Kms away here & renounced his title. Time to vindicate Tagore so that we hold our ‘head high’ and not ‘in shame’ Time to be in rectification mode,” wrote Dhankar. After the October 8 incident, Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal tweeted, “Strongly condemn the vicious attack on a Sikh security official Balwinder Singh & disrespect of his #turban by West Bengal Police. The dishonour has infuriated Sikhs across the world. I urge @MamataOfficial ji to take exemplary action against the erring policemen.” TMC leaders refused to comment on the developments on Monday, saying the government was looking into these issues. On Sunday, the state home department said that a certain political party was adding communal colour to the incident. “Our Sikh brothers and sisters live here in West Bengal in perfect peace and harmony, in happiness and tranquility, with respect from all of us for their faith and practices. A recent incident when one isolated individual got caught with one illegally carried firearm in an agitation that was not authorised and is now being twisted out of context, distorted and given communal colours in fractious and partisan interests,” tweeted the state home department. “One political party is giving communal colour to the subject in narrow partisan interests in a manner that Bengal does not believe in. Policing was done as per law, but highest respect for the Sikh panth and ways from the state government is affirmed,” the tweet added without naming the BJP. The home department did not make any statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/balwinder-singh-a-target-in-tmc-s-fight-against-bjp-says-akal-takht-jathedar/story-fZK8DupzdBChsdaeL3qDXM.html
13-10-2020||India||Key posts vacant as RTI law completes 15 years||Around one-third of information commissions in India are headless, one-fourth of information commission posts are lying vacant and in Jharkhand and Tripura, the commissions are defunct, two reports on 15 years of the Right To Information (RTI) law said on Monday.The transparency law came into force on October 10, 2005, giving a statutory right to citizens to seek a response from the government to questions they had; in a way, it became the biggest tool of grievance redressal. With the passage of time, the burden of replying to the applications increased, which lengthened the response time, leading to a higher backlog of RTI applications. In these 15 years, around 33 million RTI applications were filed with various government departments across the country, said Transparency International India (TII), an anti-corruption watchdog; the number is based on annual reports of information commissions across India.Only about 9% of these RTI applications resulted in a second appeal, meaning that over 90% of the applicants were satisfied with the government’s response, which transparency law activists said is RTI’s biggest achievement.The first appeal against a dissatisfactory RTI reply is filed with the government department from where the reply is sought. And, the second appeal is with the information commissions, an independent body that can direct departments to provide the information and impose a fine for delay in providing it.As India headed into the 15th year of RTI amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the information commissions received severe setbacks.The Jharkhand information commission is without a commissioner since May 8, 2020, when the incumbent, acting chief information commissioner Himanshu Chaudhary, retired. “We have invited applications in January but the appointment is pending in the absence of clear directives from the assembly secretariat,” said Sudhir Kumar Ranjan, joint secretary, Jharkhand’s personnel department. The appointment is stuck as the state Assembly is yet to appoint leader of opposition, who is a member of the appointments committee headed by the chief minister.The Tripura information commission also has not had a single commissioner since April 2020, after G Kameswara Rao, former chief secretary, retired. State government officials said they were in the process of making the appointment.A report by Satark Nagarik Sangathan (SNS), a citizens’ group working to promote transparency in government functioning, said nine states including Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan do not have a chief information commissioner, whose appointment under the RTI law is a statutory requirement. “The absence of a commissioner has serious ramifications for the effective functioning of the information commissions since the RTI Act envisages a critical role for the chief, including, superintendence, management and direction of commission’s affairs,” the SNS report said.The Central Information Commission (CIC), which hears second appeals against all central government departments and union territories, has also been without a head since August 17, 2020.The department of personnel and training said the process of appointing a chief has started.Anjali Bhardwaj of SNS said showing complete lack of political will, the governments are not making appointments of commissioners in a timely manner leading to backlog of 220,000 cases till July 31, 2020. “Today, one of the challenges the transparency regime faces is the attack on transparency watchdogs,” she said.The TII report said 24% of the information commissioner posts in 28 states were lying vacant despite a Supreme Court order on February 15, 2019, directing all states and the Centre to fill all the vacant posts within six months, saying seeking information was a “fundamental right”. The court also lamented that most of the information commissioners appointed under the public service category were retired bureaucrats while asking states to select people from diverse backgrounds in the commissions.During the Covid pandemic, only 10 of the 28 information commissions worked and in these commissions, very few appeals were heard because of technical snags. “Instead of providing respite during Covid, the transparency watchdogs in most states stopped functioning. The pandemic has further undermined one of the most important governance legislations,” said SR Wadwa, chairman of TII.The SNS report said despite the RTI law being in place for 15 years, many information commissions are not very transparent about their functioning. “Many commissions still provide very less information on their orders and appeals, making analysis of their work difficult,” said Bhardwaj, adding that the Bihar information commission does not even have a website.Several studies on RTI done in the past decade show that the transparency law has improved governance and checked petty corruption, but its misuse has also increased manifold. Now, most public information officers are reluctant to give information to serial RTI applicants.RTI has proved to be “curative” and “preventive” for corruption and improved governance, but its misuse has emerged as a major obstacle in its effectiveness, said Padma awardee RTI activist Subhash Aggarwal.“There is a need to increase RTI fees and seek identity documents as some states such as Punjab and Odisha have done to prevent the misuse,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-posts-vacant-as-rti-law-completes-15-years/story-RlFF1F88q2qRkmdP6Sg1fN.html
13-10-2020||India||BJP attacks Farooq Abdullah, says China remark ‘seditious’||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday termed as “seditious” a statement by National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah that he hoped, with China’s support, Article 370 will be restored in Jammu & Kashmir.Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, in an interview to India Today TV on Sunday said China “never accepted” the nullification of Article 370.“They said till you restore Article 370, we won’t stop because it has now become an open issue,” he said.“May Allah wish that our people get help from their might and our Articles 370 and 35A get restored,” he added.Lashing out at Farooq Abdullah for the statement, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said the comments were “saddening as well as worrying”.“He is a former chief minister and sitting MP and yet in an interview said that Article 370 that has been abrogated in Parliament should be installed with the help of China. A sitting MP is using such words for the country. He thinks that China’s aggression is because Article 370 has been nullified. He categorically states that since Indian Parliament abrogated Article 370, China is disturbed and that is why China’s aggression is justified. He seems to justify the expansionist tendencies of China.”Terming Farooq Abdullah’s statement as “seditious” he added: “If you have reservations about the democratic process you’re allowed to talk about it but to say that you will join hands with another country to reinstall something is condemnable. This is also seditious.”Nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders, including Farooq Abdullah, were put in months-long detention on August 5, 2019, hours before Parliament nullified Article 370 and split the state into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.National Conference (NC) general secretary Ali Mohamad Sagar said that the party has always sided with India, and said that all conditions of the accession of Jammu and Kashmir must be fulfilled.“On a political basis, BJP divided Jammu and Kashmir and split into two Union Territories(UTs). Farooq Abdullah spoke in this context. Just focussing on a single word won’t do. Farooq sahab said that till tomorrow they were friends with China. Now today, China is saying that Ladakh is disputed. So instead of putting blame on Farooq Abdullah, they should introspect... They should maintain the secular image of the country and take due care of the aspirations of its only Muslim majority state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-attacks-farooq-abdullah-says-china-remark-seditious/story-nUdoZ1qWbQgSYzScXeyOcJ.html

Asymptomatic negatives will also be monitored for symptoms, of which those who show symptoms will be tested, as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines for testing.The revised strategy advises on-priority identification of workplace clusters where everyone will be screened for Covid-19 after risk assessment in all the districts, and 100% first time testing, or saturation testing, to be done using a rapid antigen test (RAT) only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-panel-suggests-covid-19-testing-at-offices-with-two-or-more-infections/story-XE5YryqTtd6f7BQj1o9E5N.html
13-10-2020||India||Centre calls farm groups for dialogue tomorrow||The Union government has invited at least 31 farmers’ organisations and their leaders from Punjab for talks in the national capital on October 14, the second attempt in a month to reach out to farmers protesting against a set of laws enacted by Parliament to liberalise agricultural markets.The government has proposed talks by a team led by agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal, who signed off on the letter of invitation to the farm leaders on October 10. The top bureaucrat in the agriculture ministry wrote to farmers’ organisations in Punjab on October 8 for a meeting, which was rejected.Farmers’ groups said they did not participate in the meeting because in its October 8 letter, the government had said that “farmers had misunderstood the laws”. “Farmers very well understand the laws and the intention behind them, which is why we rejected the meeting,” said Avik Saha, the coordinator of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella platform of protesting farmers’ groups in Punjab and Haryana.Saha said farm organizations then received a redrafted, two-line letter from the agriculture secretary on October 10. “In Punjab, farmers have been agitating over issues related to agriculture over past several days. The government of India has always been serious about agriculture and farmers. This is why the government is interested in holding talks with you,” the letter from the farm secretary, which HT has reviewed, states.The AIKSCC said it would not participate in talks unless key demands are met. “We are preparing our charter of demands which we will release soon,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal faction). Saha said “there can be no talks on the merit of these laws”. He said the pre-conditions farmers will set are (a) repeal of the laws, (b) legal backing for minimum support prices (MSPs) and (c) any talks will have to be with a committee authorized by the Cabinet.Influential farm leaders from Punjab invited to the talks include Balbir Singh Rajewal, head of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), Ruldu Singh Mansa, president of Punjab Kisan Union, Major Singh Punnawal of the Kulhind Kisan Sabha and Indrajit Singh Kot Buddha of Kisan Sangharsh Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-calls-farm-groups-for-dialogue-tomorrow/story-3ApJjTFUvkHi3B9O3aRvkI.html
13-10-2020||India||CBI to probe ‘derogatory’ remarks against Andhra judiciary||The Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the abusive posts on social media and alleged derogatory statements made by some YSR Congress Party leaders against the state’s judiciary.A division bench of the high court, comprising justice Rakesh Kumar and Justice J Uma Devi, observed that since the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police had failed to act against those who had made derogatory comments against the judiciary, it was entrusting the case to CBI for an impartial inquiry.The bench directed that CBI take up the investigation, initiate proceedings against the people who made such statements and submit a report to the high court within eight weeks. It asked the state government to cooperate with CBI in the probe.On October 8, the high court concluded arguments on a petition filed by the high court’s registrar general stating that the CID had not taken any steps on complaints over derogatory posts against judges on social media platforms.According to senior high court advocate Lakshmi Narayana, the high court had observed that the CID filed a first information report (FIR) only against a few social media activists although more than 90 people had been found to have made abusive comments against the judiciary for delivering judgements against the state government.“The CID also failed to ensure deletion of abusive comments on the social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It also did not initiate any action against the YSRC leaders who made comments against the media,” he said.During the hearing, the high court bench found fault with the alleged remarks made by assembly speaker Tammineni Sitharam, deputy chief minister Narayana Swamy, MPs Vijayasai Reddy and N Suresh and former MLA Amanchi Krishnamohan, among others, against the judiciary.It observed that they amounted to a direct attack on judiciary.It also observed that the CID was booking cases against people who criticise the government in social media while not acting on the specific complaint by the HC.Advocate general S Sriram and CID counsel Niranjan Reddy said they had no objection to the court ordering a CBI probe.Interestingly, on Saturday evening, the state government released to the media a copy of the letter written by chief minister Jagan Reddy to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde making allegations against the second senior most judge in the apex court, NV Ramana and referring to roster management by the latter in the Andhra High Court.The letter alleged that several judgements given by the high court were against the state government and attached copies of orders issued in such cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-to-probe-derogatory-remarks-against-andhra-judiciary/story-bIodSWIN0jGr48zg39oETL.html
13-10-2020||India||Supreme Court seeks reply on farm laws||The Supreme Court set the ball rollingon Mondayon the challenge to the three crucial farm reform laws enacted by the Centre, seeking a response in four weeks to three separate petitions.On a petition filed by a group of farmers from Chhattisgarh, led by Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress vice president Rakesh Vaishnav, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde agreed that since the issue was already pending consideration with the Chhattisgarh and Allahabad high courts, it would be prudent to examine the constitutional questions of law arising from the three laws at one forum.The three laws are the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. These were enacted by Parliament on September 24 and have since been notified after receiving Presidential assent.The top two law officers of the country – attorney general KK Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta -- appeared for the Centre along with additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj, anticipating this order.The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said: “You (Centre) have to file a response somewhere, whether before this court or any high courts.” A-G Venugopal requested for six weeks’ time to file a reply but the bench posted the petitions for hearing after four weeks.The court also issued notice on two separate petitions raising a similar challenge. These were filed by two Members of Parliament – Tiruchi Siva from Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Manoj Kumar Jha from Bihar’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).The court did not entertain a petition filed by a lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, claiming that “no cause of action” was pointed out in his plea. He was allowed to withdraw it. The presence of three law officers to represent for Centre was noted by the bench. “We find AG, SG and ASG in a case where there is no cause of action. In common parlance it is called overkill.” The court is of the view that “mere passing of the law does not give rise to cause of action” for a law to be challenged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-seeks-reply-on-farm-laws/story-dx6gqnYkJG7PyansFlhUxO.html

Those who want to eat Halal meat can eat Halal meat. Those who want to eat Jhatka meat can eat Jhatka meat,” the bench, which also comprised justice Dinesh Maheshwari, said.The petition was filed by an organisation, Akhand Bharat Morcha, challenging Section 28 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.Section 28 provides that killing of animals in a manner required by the religion of any community will not be an offence under the Act.Various forms of animal slaughter such as Halal and Jhatka get the protection afforded by Section 28.Halal, an Arabic word which translates to “permissible” or “lawful,” signifies what is allowed under Islamic law. It is particularly associated with Islamic dietary practices and method in which meat is prepared. Jhatka is the method more common for the Hindu and Sikh community.The court pointed out to the petitioner that Section 28 protects not just Halal but Jhatka too.The petitioner argued that killing by Halal causes more suffering to the animal than by Jhatka, and that such exemptions should not be allowed in a secular country.The bench declined to entertain the plea.“Your petition is mischievous in character,” the top court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-against-halal-meat-supreme-court-says-it-cannot-dictate-food-habits/story-bGhO8oNi90Oj85l89M4ThK.html
13-10-2020||India||Grid failure brings Mumbai to a halt||A massive power outage crippled businesses, public transport, schools, colleges, hospitals and water supply in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) on Monday, affecting over 20 million residents. The outage, lasting more than eight hours in some areas, was triggered by the tripping of Line 2 at the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited’s 400 KV transmission system in Kalwa in neighbouring Thane district, which supplies 1,600 megawatts (MW) to Mumbai and adjoining areas. The system has two lines, of which one was shut in the morning for maintenance (there was a voltage fluctuation in this line at 4.33 am that led to it being shut), effectively putting the load on the second line that handles 633 megawatts of load. This line tripped at 9.58 am, which automatically led to a load transfer to the backup 900 MW Pune-Kharghar line. This too tripped at 10 am, leading to the outage that threw life out of gear in India’s financial hub. Mumbai has a complex power distribution matrix. The Kalwa-Padghe line generates around 50% of the city’s daily demand of 2,500 MW to 3,000 MW, depending on the season. The remainder of the city’s power is brought in from other sources and is supplied to four distributors – private and state-owned. All four could not supply power to their customers. The immediate impact was on the city’s suburban train system. The three main local networks – Western line, Central line and Harbour line – stopped functioning within minutes of each other, leaving thousands stranded during the peak morning hours. Services – which have been curtailed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic – resumed two hours and 20 minutes later at 12.26 pm. Railway officials said outstation services were not affected by the outage as there were none operating at the time. Over 700 traffic signals stopped working in the city, leading to traffic moving at a snail’s pace at key junctions. “As CCTV cameras were not functioning, we had to communicate and take updates over the phone,” said a traffic police officer posted at the control room. Pravin Padwal, additional commissioner of police (traffic), said the entire traffic police force of 2,800 personnel was deployed to manually control the traffic. Police officers said the force’s emergency response system (100) – which handles 5,500 calls a day – collapsed for nearly three hours. Health services, especially in civic-run hospitals, were affected as a result of the power outage across the city. Major civic-run cancelled minor surgeries. Resident doctors felt the heat as they had to examine patients in the Out Patient Department in PPE suits in the dark. Exams at several colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai had to be rescheduled. In some cases, exams had to be called off after they had begun. CM Uddhav Thackeray ordered a probe into the power failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grid-failure-brings-mumbai-to-a-halt/story-LkyZ8ZdS8Ay3qsExKagytJ.html
13-10-2020||India||Congress panel to discuss internal poll process||The newly constituted central election authority (CEA) of the Congress will meet on Wednesday to discuss the process to be adopted to conduct organisational elections in the next few months in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, people aware of the matter said.The party has already asked all state units to send an updated list of All India Congress Committee (AICC) delegates who form the electoral college for the organisational polls.The CEA has also asked the party’s data and technology department to help it in verifying the details of the AICC members, said a Congress functionary on the condition of anonymity.Also read: Congress likely to elect new president in JanuaryThe meeting on Wednesday at the party’s headquarters in Delhi will lay the groundwork for the elections to the president’s post and also the Congress Working Committee (CWC), he added.While carrying out a major organisational reshuffle on September 11, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had formed the CEA for holding the internal polls. The five-member CEA is headed by Madhusudan Mistry and its members are Rajesh Mishra, Krishna Byre Gowda, S Jothimani and Arvinder Singh Lovely, one of the 23 signatories to a letter written to Sonia Gandhi last month seeking a complete overhaul of the party.At a stormy Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on August 24, both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had asked the party’s highest decision-making body to hold the organisational elections within a month but some members, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, maintained that it was not feasible because of the pandemic. Finally, an upper limit of six months was fixed for completing the internal elections.Hyderabad-based political analyst C Narasimha Rao said organisational elections are good for internal democracy of any political party.Also read: Congress at its historic low, needs 24x7 leader, says Kapil Sibal“In Congress, nomination had become an integral part for many decades now.

13-10-2020||India||Delhiwale: The bard of #bored||Is there a better time than the pandemic? Of course, this question only applies to people of his kind—writers. After all, what does such a person need but a room of one’s own, a lot of quietude to concentrate, and little intrusion from family and friends?The lockdown nature of life these days does seem desirable then—for a writer.“But there’s such a background hum of anxiety,” says Siddharth Kapila, talking of “pain and death all around”, and of how in a time like this “a week of productivity is followed by weeks of stress and listlessness.”In his late 30s, Mr Kapila gave up his law practice a few years ago to focus on writing, “which is not merely a hobby for me.” He has two addresses in the city—his parents’ home in Bengali Market and a small first floor studio in Greater Kailash. In fact, this evening he is talking on WhatsApp video from the isolation of this pad. Working on a book about Hindu pilgrimage sites across the Ganga river, Mr Kapila’s last book-related trip was to Benares, some weeks before Covid-19 hit our part of the world. “But now I don’t go out, not even in Delhi... particularly because my parents are in their 70s, and I don’t want to risk bringing the infection home.”Besides writing, Mr Kapila spends a big part of his time cooking. His lockdown-era Instagram feed is crammed with dishes (eggs benedict, chicken schnitzel, shrimp scampi spaghetti...)Recently he cooked up something new—a poem. “I was having coffee by the window, watching the morning light outside. I got inspired by the moment and wrote this poem within 10 minutes.”Insisting he is no poet, Mr Kapila agrees to share the said poem, which might speak to those of us who strongly relate to hashtags as contemporary as he used while posting these verses on his social media feed—#bored, #tired, #quarantinetime, and #covidtimes.POEMA rectangle of sunlight,A pile of books unread,Hope and despair,Shadow and light,Morning or evening,Can you tell?We chug along,With the help of small windows of hope,Hoping still to go back to the time as it was before,But we can’t. Not yet.So patiently we sip our coffee. And wait.We read, we get on. We live. We wait,To move into a bright new world filled with wonder,Of books all read and windows burst wide open,The light flooding inside.This too shall pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-bard-of-bored/story-5Xe6niASbYZdT4LHmipA0I.html
13-10-2020||India||CEA proposes relaxing air pollution control deadline for thermal power plants||The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has proposed that coal-fired power plants across the country install air pollution control equipment in phases, with their immediate installation required only in areas with high levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels and a major respiratory irritant.Other thermal power plants, located in areas where S02 levels are under control, can defer the installation of such equipment, the CEA said in a new report, which comes just two years before the deadline set by the environment ministry for all coal-fired power plants to meet safe emission norms.Deferring the installation of air pollution control equipment can lead to delays in reducing air pollution concentrations across the country, according to experts.SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that caused the Great Smog of London in 1952 and has been responsible for smog episodes in China and India. Sulfates makes up over 10% of the fine particles in both Asian countries and often much more during heavy pollution episodes.India is already three years behind in implementing emission standards notified in 2015 by the environment ministry and which were supposed to take force in 2017.The deadline was delayed to 2022 following resistance by the thermal power industry. The environment ministry agreed to extend the deadline to 2022 and approached the SC, which also ordered an extension.But a CEA report seen by HT recommends that flue-gas desulphurization (FGD)—a technology to remove SO2 from exhaust be installed on a priority basis only in areas where SO2 concentrations are above 40 micrograms per cubic metres (24-hour average).The report doesn’t address the issue of SO2 emissions’ contribution to generation of secondary particulate matter 2.5, a major pollutant in the air that has been identified as a major health challenge by scientists.“Sulphur dioxide when emitted, as it travels because of atmospheric chemistry, turns into particulate matter in the presence of ammonia. It has been found that sulphate levels in many parts of the country are high, which is why controlling SO2 is important,” said Mukesh Sharma, a professor in the department of civil engineering at Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur.SO2’s contribution to particulate pollution has been overlooked in the CEA report. In 2017, a paper in Nature journal warned of the rising SO2 problem in India. The paper, titled India Is Overtaking China as the World’s Largest Emitter of Anthropogenic Sulfur Dioxide, said China and India are on opposite trajectories when it comes to sulphurous pollution. Since 2007, emissions in China have declined by 75% while those in India have increased by 50%. With these changes, India has been surpassing China as the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2.Some of the reasons for phasing the installation of pollution control equipment, particularly FGD, cited by CEA in the report include lack of time to develop indigenous manufacturing facilities; the need to import the equipment which creates a market for mainly foreign companies and an investment of ₹1 lakh crore needed for large-scale emissions control from thermal power plants. This will lead to a drain on foreign exchange resources, the report says.China began installation of desulphurization equipment in 1996 and by 2015, 83% of its total thermal power capacity was fitted with emission control equipment. The report suggests that the ministry of power held a meeting on January 21, 2020 where it was decided that CEA will submit a paper on graded installation of FGDs which will then be taken up by the ministry of power with the ministry of environment.“The MoP has to discuss these timelines with the environment ministry and only then can they be implemented,” said a senior CEA official who declined to be identified.“It is worrying to see CEA coming up with illogical and unscientific arguments to dilute the implementation of norms after five years of the notification and after it was given the job of monitoring and ensuring implementation of the 2015 norms,” said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/compliance-date-for-thermal-plants-deferred/story-FpmzTOtA6UcB0OCBLtpiGJ.html
13-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||What explains the coronavirus disease’s trajectory in Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru? All five cities, among India’s largest and most important, have been badly hit by the viral disease – and all five would appear to be witnessing a prolonged run of the disease, with some ebbs and flows. This columnist has hypothesised about this in the past, proffering factors such as population density as a possible explanation. A recent (October 5) article in peer reviewed journal Nature Medicine by Benjamin Rader from the Boston University’s School of Public Health, Samuel V Scarpino from the Network Science Institute at Boston’s Northeastern University, Moritz Kramer at the Department of Zoology at Oxford University, and others, claims that the “degree to which cases of Covid-19 are compressed into a short period of time (peakedness of the epidemic) is strongly shaped by population aggregation and heterogeneity”. It adds that “epidemics in crowded cities have larger total attack rates than [in] less populated cities”, that “in general, epidemics in coastal cities were less peaked and larger and more prolonged”, and that infection trajectories in rural areas were likely to be peaked.Also read: Expert panel suggests Covid-19 testing at offices with two or more infectionsThis could explain why some cities see sharp spikes (or peakedness as the researchers term it; this typically happens in less crowded and less heterogeneous cities, according to the study), while others, such as the Indian cities named above (crowded, and where a heterogeneous population tends to move about), see prolonged attacks. In some ways, this is vindication of the density hypothesis – densely populated cities do tend to see extended runs of the pandemic according to the study – but it is also much more. That is because the study also looks at so-called mean crowding (a measure of both density and its variation across an area), mobility data (sourced from Google in some cases), and applies a mathematical model to calculate the epidemic’s peakedness within cities. The model even took into account the impact of lockdowns or other restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the disease.The study’s authors explain that this “multivariate model” successfully explained trajectories of the coronavirus disease in Chinese cities and Italian provinces. But that’s not the most interesting part of the study. That would be the fact that the researchers went on to apply the model to 310 cities around the world and calculated their “predicted epidemic peakedness”. This is a number between 0 and 1, where a number closer to 1 shows high peakedness, and a number closer to zero a prolonged run of the pandemic. In this case, spike (or peakedness) should not be confused for actual numbers. A spike refers to a sudden rise and an equally sudden fall in cases; a prolonged outbreak refers to an extended run for the disease. It’s easy to see how the latter could witness higher daily cases, say, than the former.Also read: Rushing a Covid-19 vaccine is a terrible idea. Here’s whySo, what do the predictive scores show?New York has a score of 0.0035. Mumbai’s is 0.011. Delhi’s is actually lower than Mumbai’s at 0.008. Hyderabad’s score is 0.012. Chennai is at 0.016. Kolkata at 0.011. The researchers do not appear to have calculated the score for Bengaluru, but given the pattern of scores of other Indian cities, it is easy to see what it could be.One of my first reactions after going through the study was that it would be interesting to see it redone with more data (from more cities). The researchers seem to think so too. “As with all modelling studies, further data generated during the epidemic might change our parameter estimates, and large-scale serological data would help verify our findings.”That it would – and it’s another reason why India should carry out widespread antibody tests at regular intervals to assess the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-t795mrid2ygSr6jzQfmM6L.html
13-10-2020||India||PLA rotates LAC troops, shows hand||The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has started rotating troops on the north bank of Pangong Tso, signalling that it has no immediate plans of either disengagement or de-escalation in Ladakh. The 7th round of India-China military-diplomatic talks began in Chushul on Monday with the XIV Corps Commander meeting the South Xinjiang military district commander to discuss comprehensive disengagement.According to military commanders, the PLA has moved an additional brigade north of Pangong Tso for rotating troops from the Finger Four mountainous spur to keep up the morale of the deployed troops. “Given that both sides are deployed at {an altitude of} nearly 18,000 feet on Finger Four and the weather is deteriorating, the PLA is rotating 200 troops at a time so that front-line troops are fresh and motivated. This clearly means that PLA has no plans for disengagement at least this winter,” said a senior official who requested anonymity .Also read: 54 done, BRO rushes to build 48 bridges that can shoulder T-90 main battle tanksThe assessment of the Indian side is that comprehensive disengagement will be a long-drawn process despite the inherent risk of a flare-up as the PLA will occupy positions south of Pangong Tso the moment they are vacated by the Indian Army. While PLA has come up to its perception of the Line of Actual Control(LAC) on the north bank, Indian Army troops have come up to its perception of the LAC on the south bank by pre-empting the PLA all along the Rezang La Rechin la ridgeline.Even though winter is expected to set in by the end of this month and take a turn for the worse, the Indian Army is prepared to stay on the heights all along the 1,597 km LAC in Ladakh. The Indian army commanders have learned from the fact that the Sumdorong Chu standoff in Arunachal Pradesh that started in 1986 was fully resolved through comprehensive disengagement by November 1995 — after nine years of continuous deployment. While the Sumdorong Chu standoff was resolved, the Indian Army has been sitting on the Saltoro Ridge since Operation Meghdoot was launched in April 1984 — 36 years and counting.While the PLA aggression in the Galwan Valley and north of Pangong Tso was pre-planned with military objectives in mind, the Chinese were not prepared for either the June 15 flare-up or the August 29-30 pre-emption. It is quite evident that PLA commanders thought that the Indian Army would accept the aggression as fait accompli and move on. However, with both sides deployed in full at the LAC in Ladakh, the chances of an accident are high and thus distance is being kept between the front-line troops.Also read: PLA rotating troops on north Pangong Tso, signals disengagement is far offEven though the PLA’s Western Theatre Command is deployed all along the Ladakh LAC and in depth, the Chinese problems have been complicated by the standoff with the US over Taiwan. The PLA is currently stretched, with its South and Northern Theatre Commands also deployed to pressurize Taiwan, with the US Navy active in the South China Sea. What happens next in Taiwan largely depends on the US posture after the November Presidential election outcome, but either way American policy towards China has hardened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-rotates-lac-troops-shows-hand/story-BTArWOVpwKeuPCrPcVY9FJ.html
13-10-2020||India||Mathura Mosque case: Now, an appeal before a district judge||An appeal has been made before the court of a district judge, Mathura, against a civil court order of September 30 that dismissed a legal suit for the removal of Idgah Masjid, which the plaintiffs claim “was built on the land of Shri Krishna Janambhoomi.” The district judge’s court has sought the records from the lower court and has fixed October 16 as the date of hearing, said Hari Shankar Jain, counsel for the petitioners. The petitioners, who belong to other districts, had filed a case seeking removal of the mosque from the site, claiming that it was built after razing a temple by then Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The plaintiffs have sought a declaration that the land, measuring 13.37 acres, be vested in deity Sri Krishna Virajman.Earlier, the civil court had dismissed the petition on September 30, after hearing arguments, said Bhagat Singh Arya, additional district government counsel. The suit claiming ownership of the entire land of 13.37 acres land which is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Sri Krishna, the 8th incarnation of Lord Vishnu, was filed on September 25 through the next friend of the child deity, one Ranjana Agnihotri, an advocate and a resident of Lucknow. Six other devotees were also plaintiffs to the suit.They had sought cancellation of a settlement entered into between the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan which is the governing body of the temple complex and the Committee of Management of Trust of Shahi Idgah (Idgah Trust) in 1968.The suit stated that Lord Shri Krishna was born in a prison of King Kans and the entire area under dispute is known as ‘Katra Keshav Dev’. Katra Keshav Dev is sacred for the devotees of Lord Shri Krishna and the Hindu community. Hindu rulers have always paid homage to the birthplace of Lord Shree Krishna and from time to time they constructed/ renovated temple at the spot, the petition said.It was submitted that the Idgah Trust with the help of some Muslims encroached upon the land belonging to Shri Krishna Janmasthan Trust and the deity and erected a superstructure at the place.The birthplace of Lord Krishna lies beneath the structure raised by the trust, the suit added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mathura-mosque-case-now-an-appeal-before-a-district-judge/story-p3QjOHSNrZgFXrOxmePNjP.html
13-10-2020||India||Top film houses move High Court against 2 channels||Many of Bollywood’s biggest production houses and industry bodies came together on Monday to move the Delhi high court seeking to restrain two television news channels from making or publishing alleged “irresponsible, derogatory and defamatory remarks” against the film industry.The lawsuit — filed by four industry associations and 34 production houses, including those owned by Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Karan Johar, Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor, Farhan Akhtar, Rohit Shetty, Vinod Chopra, and Ashutosh Gowariker — also asked for the channels to be barred from conducting a “media trial”. The Film & Television Producers Guild Of India (PGI), Cine & TV Artistes’ Association (CINTAA), Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC), Screenwriters Association (SWA), Yash Raj Films, and Reliance Big Entertainment, were among the other petitioners. The petitioners sought directions against Republic TV, its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and consulting editor Pradeep Bhandari; Times Now, its editor-in-chief Rahul Shivshankar, and group editor Navika Kumar, as well as social media platforms.“The plea comes in the wake of these channels using highly derogatory words and expressions for Bollywood such as ‘dirt’, ‘filth’, ‘scum’, ‘druggies’ and expressions such as ‘it is Bollywood where the dirt needs to be cleaned’, ‘all the perfumes of Arabia cannot take away the stench and the stink of this filth and scum of the underbelly of Bollywood’, ‘This is the dirtiest industry in the country’, and ‘cocaine and LSD drenched Bollywood’,” read the petition, filed by law firm DSK Legal. The matter is likely to be heard this week.“We are seeking an apology and stay on the kind of coverage that’s being done on news channels,” said Ramesh Taurani, board member, IFTPC. Amit Behl, senior joint secretary of CINTAA, said the film industry comprised hard-working individuals and couldn’t accept being collectively labelled with allegations. “All of us stand united against attempts to defame the entire filmmaking community,” he added.The petition came after roughly four months of media controversy over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in his Mumbai home on June 14. The incident is currently being probed by several government agencies – including the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau. Some sections of the media have blamed Bollywood stars for the death of the 34-year-old actor and, based on private chats and messages, implied that some top film stars and producers were part of a drug ring. Kumar and Shivshankar said they did nothing wrong. “Cases against journalists of Times Now that have only sought justice for those who are wronged are a bad precedent. The mighty may think they can weaken the resolve of the fearless at Times Now but they are wrong,” Shivshankar tweeted.“If fighting for justice invites court cases, bring it on. All the A-listers can come together but India will continue to fight for the truth. You can’t intimidate us @TimesNow & can’t take away the viewers who believe in us. Let truth prevail,” Kumar tweeted. “Even after the case involving the unfortunate death of actor Mr. Sushant Singh Rajput (which appears to have triggered the diatribe against Bollywood) was transferred to the CBI, these defendants indulged in what could be aptly described as a frenzy suggesting that the CBI would start making arrests,” the petition read.The petition said it didn’t seek a blanket gag order on media reportage in the Rajput case but wanted an injunction on publication of material that violated applicable laws. The plea said Bollywood was a huge source of revenue, foreign exchange and employment. “The livelihood of persons associated with Bollywood is being severely impacted by the smear campaign being run by the defendants,” the petition said.The suit alleged that the defendants conducted and published private investigations and effectively acted as courts to condemn people connected with Bollywood as guilty based on alleged evidence, making a mockery of the criminal justice system.“The privacy of the members of Bollywood is being invaded, and their reputations are being irreparably damaged by painting the entire Bollywood as criminals, seeped in drug culture, and making being part of Bollywood as synonymous with criminal acts in the public imagination,” the plea read.The suit contended this was not the first time legal action was initiated against the defendants and some of them were penalised earlier for alleged irresponsible reportage and defamatory content.The petition came days after actor Rhea Chakraborty – Rajput’s girlfriend – got bail in a drug case. Chakraborty’s lawyer also threatened to take action against people who implicated the 28-year-old actor in Rajput’s death and the drug racket. Others who have filed the suit are Screenwriters Association (SWA); Aamir Khan Productions; Ad-Labs Films; Ajay Devgn Fflims; Andolan Films; Anil Kapoor Film and Communication Network; Arbaaz Khan Productions; Ashutosh Gowariker Productions; BSK Network and Entertainment; Cape of Good Films; Clean Slate Filmz and Dharma Productions.The list also included Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures; Excel Entertainment; Filmkraft Productions; Hope Production; Kabir Khan Films; Luv Films; Macguffin Pictures; Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment; One India Stories; R.S. Entertainment (Ramesh Sippy Entertainment); Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Pictures; Red Chillies Entertainment; Reel Life Productions; Reliance Big Entertainment and Rohit Shetty Picturez.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-film-houses-move-high-court-against-2-channels/story-3qwsKIHRGKaM73HwG4ZRKK.html
13-10-2020||India||Nagaland students ban movement of govt vehicles; put stir on hold after minister’s death||Student organizations in Nagaland on Monday launched an indefinite ban on movement of government registered vehicles (NL 10 and NL 11) in protest against the government’s failure to mainstream the services of over 2,500 teachers under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) of 2010 and 2013 batches into the School Education Cadre. The ban, sounded by the Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) along with the Eastern Naga Students’ Federation (ENSF), is being imposed across the state. On Monday, NSF president Ninoto Awomi informed that the strike went off without any untoward incident. However, several vehicles with government registration numbers were spotted plying and were seized. The seized vehicles are being kept at the NSF Solidarity Park, near the State Civil Secretariat in Kohima, and will be released only after the state government complies with the demand of the two apex student bodies. Awomi said sources informed them that the state cabinet was meeting over the issue but the organizations were yet to receive any response from the government. The NSF and ENSF have been mediating the issue between the teachers and the state government since 2018. The government had communicated earlier that the formalities were being worked out, but the student bodies are adamant that the government should issue a time-bound commitment. The indefinite stir, however, was put on abeyance on Monday evening following the death of a state minister. NSF and ENSF have announced that they have decided to keep their agitation in abeyance considering the demise of Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Justice and Law, CM Chang, as a mark of respect for the departed leader. The student bodies will resume the agitation from October 19. The two federations directed their respective units and subordinate bodies to put in place all necessary preparations in order to ensure that the next phase of agitation is carried out successfully. Meanwhile, stating that the government was doing whatever is possible despite various constraints, the Department of School Education, Nagaland, appealed to the student bodies to understand the difficulties being faced by the state and withdraw the agitation in the interest of all stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-students-ban-movement-of-govt-vehicles-put-stir-on-hold-after-minister-s-death/story-zoGlrld1uTSvX1tc1WQPFK.html

13-10-2020||India||Top US diplomat calls for expansion of Quad group||The United States and India are ready for a “fundamental alignment” based on “shared interests and shared goals” US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun said on Monday. Biegun said this was not about “an alliance on the postwar model” but an alignment “along shared security and geopolitical goals.” At policy institute Ananta Centre’s virtual Indo-US Forum on Monday, Biegun explained: “As the US assesses our own interests and how they intersect with India’s we have seen the conditions emerge for an organic and deeper partnership.”Washington’s highest-ranking diplomat also called for an expansion of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, better known as the Quad, which is an informal grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the US. “Any country that seeks a free and open Indo-Pacific and is willing to take steps to ensure that should be welcome to work with us,” he said. “The Quad is a partnership driven by shared interests, not binding obligations, and is not intended to be an exclusive grouping.” Governments, he said, have been “too cautious” about the Quad. The US respects that India has a “strong and proud tradition of strategic autonomy,” Biegun said. He saw “enormous opportunity” in the bilateral security relationship. “We do not seek to change India’s traditions,” he stressed. “Rather we want to explore how to empower them and India’s ability to defend its own sovereignty and democracy and to advance Indian interests, across the Indo-Pacific region.” As the Indo-US relationship advances, he added, China was the “elephant in the room.” Elaborating on the kind of alignment he envisaged, Biegun said future security partnerships did not necessarily need to follow the postwar model “with a heavy in-country US troop presence.” The US benefited from close links with countries, “like India,” that share the US vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific and “seek to provide for their own defence.” In this context, he said, the US “benefits from an India that is as strong and prosperous.” Cooperation can come in many new ways given advances in technology, shifts in global economic influence and changing geopolitics. He said the US was prepared to do more to strengthen “India’s ability to defend itself and by promoting interoperability among our militaries through regular exercises and exchanges, common defense platforms, and co-development.” He said he hoped the coming bilateral 2+2 ministerial meeting of the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers would allow India and the US to “explore next steps on some of these issues.” Biegun said the Quad members stand for a “vision of a Pax Indo-Pacifica, a region at peace, protected and made prosperous in equal measure by those who comprise the Indo-Pacific” and represented four democratic anchors of the region. He said the outcome of the US presidential elections, now less than a month away, would make no difference to the bilateral relationship. “The vital partnership between the US and India will continue and deepen over the decades to come,” he said. “I have never been more optimistic regarding the future possibilities of the India-U.S. relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-us-diplomat-calls-for-expansion-of-quad-group/story-R06qlCO6ft59K6GMJPkEPM.html
13-10-2020||India||Sexual offences:Govt reply sought on equal protection for transgender persons||The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the central government on a public interest litigation (PIL) that demanded equal protection under the law for sexual offences against transgender persons.The petition, filed by advocate Reepak Kansal, challenged the constitutional validity of Section 354A (punishing sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), specifically clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of sub-section (1) as it excluded transgender persons from being treated as victims of sexual harassment. “There is no provision or section in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which may protect the third gender from the sexual assault by male/ female or another transgender,” stated the petition.The bench, headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde and also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, appreciated the thought behind the petition. The bench said it was a “good case” that needed hearing.Arguing for Kansal, senior advocate Vikas Singh told the bench that in 2014, the top court passed a landmark ruling by recognising members of the transgender community as the third sex and confirming the rights of the marginalised community. “This gave them a distinct identity. However, they are still deprived of equal protection of law when it comes to sexual offences they face from within the community and outside,” he argued.The bench asked Singh to file details of cases where the court passed orders in the absence of laws to deal with issues. In the hearing conducted via video conferencing, the bench referred to the framing of the Vishaka guidelines to deal with sexual harassment of women at work places in 1997 and the decriminalization of homosexuality in 2018.“In spite of declaring transgender people to be a ‘third gender’ by this court, there is no provision/ section in the Indian Penal Code which may protect the third gender from the sexual assault by male/ female or another transgender,” the petition said.The petition said that the motive behind the 2014 judgment was to grant “equity and equality” to members of the transgender community and equal protection before law. “However, this was not being realized under the sexual harassment law contained under Section 354A IPC. This amounted to violation of Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of transgender persons in being treated differently by the law,” the petition added.In November 2019, Parliament passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act that laid out the rights and protections for the marginalised community.But Section 18(d) of the act made sexual offences against transgender persons punishable with a minimum term of six months, extendable up to two years. The act used the term “sexual abuse” and failed to make any distinction between the various offences under this category making sexual harassment, abuse or rape, all punishable with maximum term of two years. Activists argued that this section was discriminatory because IPC provisions for violence committed against women is up to seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sexual-offences-govt-reply-sought-on-equal-protection-for-transgender-persons/story-tIbRzrccRG08O0vk17FcNK.html
13-10-2020||India||High Court pulls up UP govt for Hathras night cremation||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Monday criticised the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to forcibly cremate a Dalit rape victim in the middle of the night in Hathras district, as it started hearing the sensitive case that roiled India and sparked angry street protests. A division bench of justices Pankaj Mithal and Rajan Roy recorded the statements of five family members of the 19-year-old woman who died roughly three weeks ago, and senior state government officials. It fixed November 2 as the next date of hearing. Media was barred from the heavily secured hearing attended by roughly 15 people. The victim’s family also demanded that the high-profile trial be shifted out of the state, said their lawyer Seema Kushwaha.The court took serious note of the Hathras district administration’s decision of cremating the woman’s body at 2.30am on September 30, said Seema Kushwaha, the victim family’s lawyer. “During the hearing, the court asked the officials ‘if the girl belonged to your family, then would you have done the same thing’?” said Kushwaha.HT could not independently verify the exact observation by the bench because the media was not allowed inside the courtroom.The bench also asked the government whether the victim would be cremated at night if she belonged to a rich family, instead of a poor one, according to Kushwaha. Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar told the court that the decision to cremate the victim was taken due to the law and order considerations and there was no pressure from the state government. The government had received intelligence inputs that law and order could deteriorate due to protesters the next morning, the court was told in an affidavit. “A police officer of the level of additional director general of police will appear before the court at the next hearing. The court has exempted the family from appearance at the next hearing,” said additional advocate general Vinod Kumar Shahi, who represented the state government. “The family members of the victim have presented their side. We have presented our side,” he added.Senior advocate J N Mathur, who was appointed amicus curie by the court, pleaded that every citizen had the right to be cremated with dignity by the family members as per their religious practices. He cited Article 25 of the Constitution on the right to practice one’s religion freely. The family, through Kushwaha, told the court that police presence in the village was enough to control any situation, especially when the district’s borders were sealed.In court, Kushwaha presented three demands: keep facts related to the probe and the special investigation team’s (SIT) report confidential, transfer the trial out of Uttar Pradesh and provide security for the kin until the case concluded. “The family wants the case to be transferred to Delhi or Mumbai,” she told reporters outside the court.The victim, who hailed from the Valmiki caste, was raped on September 14 by four men from the dominant Thakur caste when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder. She died in Delhi in the early hours of September 29. At 2.30am the next day, the police forcibly cremated her in a field near the village – triggering protests by Opposition parties and Dalit groups. The government set up an SIT and a separate probe into an alleged international conspiracy to defame the state administration, and suspended five police officers. The government has also denied the woman was raped, citing a forensic report, though experts have noted lapses in protocol and pointed to her dying declaration, where she said she was raped. Four accused – all from the Thakur caste – are in jail. The HC took suo-motu (on its own) cognisance of the case on October 1. On Monday, the court recorded the statements of the woman’s father, mother and three brothers. All travelled from Hathras to Lucknow under tight security in a convoy of six cars. The court also recorded the statements of additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi, director general of police HC Awasthy, additional director general of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar, Laxkar and Hathras superintendent of police Vineet Jaiswal.Mathur said the court ordered the state government to ensure that such incidents of rape did not take place in the future. In response, Awanish Awasthi assured the judges that the government would finalise a plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-pulls-up-up-govt-for-hathras-night-cremation/story-XnnWzQ4qms0o2emz1ZPeoK.html
13-10-2020||India||India, China hold seventh military talks||Senior military commanders from India and China on Monday met for the seventh time in eastern Ladakh in their latest attempt to reduce friction in the sensitive theatre where India and China have deployed more than 50,000 soldiers each along with advanced weapons and systems, officials familiar with the developments said. The talks between delegations led by corps commander-ranked officers began at 12 pm at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and were on when this report was filed. At the last round of military talks on September 21, the Indian side demanded comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April. The Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army have been locked in a border row for more than five months and efforts to reduce friction have made no headway so far, with both sides prepared for a long haul through the winter months. Monday’s talks took place weeks after China hardened its position and asserted that it recognises the 1959 LAC, which has never been accepted by India. China’s hardened stance has dimmed hopes for an early resolution of the border row, as reported by HT on October 5. China’s assertion that it abides by the LAC as proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959 has complicated the border row in eastern Ladakh, and called into question Beijing’s intent to restore status quo ante and de-escalate the conflict, experts previously told HT. Monday’s dialogue was the last round of military talks to be led by the current commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, Lieutenant General Harinder Singh. He has completed his one-year term and is heading to Dehradun on October 15 as the commandant of the Indian Military Academy. Lieutenant General PGK Menon, who attended the talks on Monday and previously on September 21, will be Singh’s successor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-hold-seventh-military-talks/story-rT2lzi1o1ZBNgNd6ABMPUM.html
13-10-2020||India||Very poor air chokes parts of NW India||New Delhi: For the past four days, several parts of northwest India have started recording “poor” air quality—a result of north-westerly calm winds and crop fires flaring across Punjab and Haryana. On Monday air quality deteriorated further with Baghpat, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh; Kurukshetra and Panipat in Haryana recording “very poor” category air.Also Read: Delhi: Pollution levels likely to dip today, reach moderate levelHarvesting has only begun in the north-western states; crop fires are likely to peak next week when harvesting is mid-way, farm leaders said.Though NASA satellite images show widespread fires in Punjab and Haryana, IMD expects impact from the smoke may reduce over the next 3 to 4 days because of a likely change in wind direction from north-westerly to easterly. Moisture in the air is also likely to increase for a few days until wind direction changes back to north-westerly.The air quality early warning system under the union ministry of earth sciences (MoES) had forecast on Sunday that air quality in Delhi would improve after wind direction changes to easterly. But dispersal of pollutants was impacted by very low wind speed. “Winds have been blowing under 5 kmph at Safdarjung. It’s not suitable for dispersion yet,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“Though winds are changing, the wind speed is very low so dispersion is not happening as we had expected. While we do not expect any further deterioration in air quality in the next two to three days, we can’t say air quality will improve. Winds were calm during the evening for the last 4 to 5 days. So even though the contribution from crop fires to air pollution isn’t as high now air quality has deteriorated due to lack of dispersion,” said Vijay Soni, a scientist at the air pollution division of India Meteorological Department (IMD).Delhi, Agra, Bulandshahr, Bahadurgarh, Ballabgarh, Bhiwadi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Karnal and other north-western towns also recorded poor air on Sunday.Night or minimum temperature is also likely to rise as moisture laden, warmer winds enter the north-western region from Monday, added Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.“Harvesting has only started now in Punjab. It will peak next week when crop fires will also rise. We have been saying for a long time that in the absence of a direct subsidy crop fires will continue because a subsidy on the straw management machinery is not enough for small farmers,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, Bharatiya Kisan Union general secretary, Punjab.Also Read: Monsoon withdrawal delayed till October 20: IMDMeanwhile, the Supreme Court in an order dated October 7 issued notices to Centre and north-western states on the issue of crop stubble burning. SC directed Tushar Mehta, solicitor general appearing on behalf of the Centre to file replies to an application on the issue. SC has also summoned chief secretaries of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and Haryana on the next date of hearing. One of the prayers of the applicant, Vikrant Tongad is to formulate a mechanism wherein an incentive of Rs 100 per quintal would be part of the total minimum support price which can be withheld until farmer can assure that there is no stubble fire in his farm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nw-india-could-get-a-brief-breather-from-dirty-air-due-to-changing-winds/story-lIsyreWCOCdrmzmBEw2iHJ.html
13-10-2020||Editorials||The new culture wars | HT Editorial||Thirty-four of Bollywood’s top production companies, many helmed by the biggest stars, and four industry bodies, on Monday, filed a lawsuit in the Delhi High Court against “media trials”. They have also sought directions against two news channels, seen as close to the ruling dispensation, for their “irresponsible, defamatory and derogatory” remarks against Bollywood and its personalities. Select media coverage, in the wake of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide, portrayed the industry as a den of crime, drugs, and nepotism.The case is significant for two distinct reasons. One, it will throw open the question of free speech and its limits. While it is tempting to frame the issue only in terms of free expression — and media platforms must be allowed to publish and broadcast all forms of investigative stories and diverse views — the fact is that this right to free speech comes with a degree of responsibility as constitutionally stipulated. To accuse people of murder, without any evidence, cannot be constructed as free speech. Some media outlets have also, often, provided a platform for hate speech. While the State cannot be trusted to regulate the media — for it will become a way to exercise control — self-regulation has failed too. The case must trigger a conversation on the need for a statutory-but-independent regulatory mechanism for television news.India is also in the midst of a larger culture war. The political Right, which believes it is through culture that society and eventually politics is shaped, appears to view Bollywood as representative of the ancient regime, with its focus on pluralism and the presence of liberals as well as Muslim figures. The fact that the industry has a range of underlying issues — from a history of shady financing to nepotism — allows the Right to stoke public distrust. The effort appears to be to delegitimise existing Bollywood power structures and create a parallel, more pliant, “nationalist” industry which will shape ideological and cultural consciousness as desired by dominant political actors. This newspaper does not endorse any illegal activity that may be taking place in the film industry. But the fact is that Bollywood has been an internal unifying thread for citizens, a secular space, an important economic hub generating employment and revenue, and a huge asset for India’s soft power. It may need reform, but to paint the industry as evil is both wrong and dangerous. Bollywood unifying to defend itself is positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-new-culture-wars-ht-editorial/story-rwGehnGgBjFsbBtBErFL1H.html
13-10-2020||Editorials||Article 370 and 35-A: Why Farooq Abdullah is wrong | HT Editorial||Former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) chief minister and National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah, while reiterating his opposition to the constitutional changes in J&K, particularly the effective nullification of Article 370, spoke about how China has opposed the changes too. He, then, added that, “May Allah wish that our people get help from their might and our Articles 370 and 35-A get restored.”This is a deeply disturbing statement from a leader who has served as a Union minister, a three-time chief minister, and a long-standing parliamentarian in both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. The change in Kashmir is purely an internal matter of India. This newspaper has been critical of the Centre’s actions in Kashmir — particularly the detention of leaders and curtailment of liberty — and asked for a restoration of political normalcy. But this battle must be fought within the Indian constitutional and political scheme, through agitation, public opinion-building, political alliances and judicial recourse. To turn to a foreign power — which is at the moment an aggressor and has undermined India’s territorial integrity and sovereignty — is wrong and unwise. Mr Abdullah’s statement will deepen the mistrust that exists about Kashmir’s leaders among citizens elsewhere in the country. It will galvanise a nationalist backlash — and it is no surprise that the Bharatiya Janata Party has termed his remarks “seditious”. And it will erode the moral standing and political authority of Kashmir’s democratic parties. Mr Abdullah may be speaking out of pain and anger, but he would do well to revise his stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/article-370-and-35-a-why-farooq-abdullah-is-wrong/story-boc9xegS78p9EpufnD1iFO.html
13-10-2020||Editorials||DU’s cut-offs reflect a broken system | HT Editorial||Delhi University (DU)’s first cut-off list for admission to its undergraduate programmes was announced on October 10, and it touched the 100% ceiling for the third time since 2011. Cut-offs are decided by calculating the best of four subjects’ marks in Class 12 board exams. This year, 1,57,934 students scored over 90% marks, while 38,686 got more than 95% marks in the Central Board of Secondary Education-conducted exams. Under pressure to give their students a fair chance, many other boards have also declared their results, based on the average of highest marks.What explains the high cut-offs? One, there is a higher number of applications vis-a-vis the number of seats. Two, the Class 12 evaluation process is distorted, leading to such high marks. Three, colleges set high cut-offs to prevent “over admissions”. Four, there is a paucity of good-quality public universities. And finally, students are attracted to Delhi due to its academic and physical infrastructure, extra-curricular activities, and scholarships; the opportunity to interact with a diverse student population; and eventually access better job opportunities. The phenomenon of high cut-offs is not just an academic-administrative problem. It is a subset of more critical issues that ail the education system, and the lack of democratisation of resources. To improve, the Centre and states must invest more in public education; boost academic infrastructure across the country; make the Class 12 evaluation process more holistic; and ensure that all students, irrespective of where they are studying, get a level-playing field when it comes to availing good teachers and infrastructure. Only then will the rush for DU will end.—||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/du-s-cut-offs-reflect-a-broken-system/story-B45GmgYov3RRox9glXEykI.html
