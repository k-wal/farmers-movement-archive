18-10-2020||News||The Opposition must respect Parliament||The recent Parliament session was short, but optically an important signal that public representatives were doing their duty at a time of Covid-19. It was short in days, but high on productivity — despite many efforts to derail and disrupt. The suspension of question hour was characterised as an attack on democracy when it was an effort to promote productivity in a short session. There were no restrictions to unstarred questions, special mentions and zero hours.The new spin to the “death of Parliament” narrative is that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has undermined Parliament. This is built on the fact that he does not speak frequently in Parliament and uses Twitter and the radio to directly connect with the people.The number of times a PM speaks in Parliament is not a measure of his political or governance effectiveness. Nor does this undermine Parliament as an institution. Parliament is a platform for all parliamentarians, not just the PM and the government. So many ministers and Members of Parliament (MPs) participated in the debates and discussions during the short session. It is insult to those who have taken great effort to contribute to Parliament and committee meetings to have some in the Opposition imply that this does not matter as long as the PM speaks. The PM also spoke on appropriate occasions, particularly replying to the President’s address and budget. We should celebrate that the short session was as effective as any other in the past. Instead, we find a few disgruntled Opposition leaders expressing outrage as things did not go their way. What the Opposition wants is to put the brakes on the government’s legislative programmes. The PM is adept at using technology to communicate directly with the people. To suggest that this outreach is a substitute to Parliament is probably the silliest one in the attempt to undermine Parliament. One other criticism is that the government is misusing ordinances to bypass Parliament. Every ordinance issued by the government has to be brought before Parliament as a Bill, unless the government wants the ordinance to lapse, which would be absurd. In every case, ordinances issued by this government were essential for some urgent policy goals. One was the three farm reforms bills. The three ordinances were issued in June. The opposition to these came when they were introduced in Parliament in September. This smacks of sheer political opportunism by some in the Opposition. There will be a legal-constitutional problem if ordinances are repeatedly re-issued as a tactic to bypass Parliament. This government has not resorted to this. In any case, the Supreme Court (SC) has held such a practice to be a fraud on the Constitution. The Opposition narrative accepts that ordinances were used by earlier governments but the Modi government has used these “excessively.” That is factually incorrect. Governments in the past have relied on them to a far greater degree than the present one. For example, in 1975, 29 ordinances and in 1993 and 1997, 34 ordinances were passed. All governments use ordinances for urgent legislations when Parliament isn’t in session.This suggests that there is an attempt to rake up old controversies which the SC has earlier pronounced on. Among these are the alleged abuse of money bills, when the fact is there is no such misuse. In the Aadhaar bill, 2016, there were valid reasons to label it a money bill, whose constitutionality was upheld by the apex court. In fact, the most transformative legislative changes carried out by this government have been through ordinary bills — the farm reforms bill and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which was passed last year. Many Opposition parties supported these in the Rajya Sabha. On that day, 109 members of the National Democratic Alliance and its friendly parties, and only 70 members of the Opposition were present in the House. Some disruptive Opposition parties don’t wish to engage with the government in finding a constructive solution on these bills and nor do they have political support to stop them. And so instead of debating and engaging in a competition of ideas and ideology, their strategy is based on obstruction under the garb of sanctimonious outrage. Any genuine discourse on ways to improve and strengthen our democracy is a good thing. In the current context, the disrespectful conduct of some Opposition leaders needs to be examined and explained. This, more than anything else, threatens to lower the prestige of Parliament. Mercifully, people can see through these tactics. They will elect and re-elect those who value and respect our democracy and undertake their obligations to public service with sincerity and respect. The voters have indicated that in 2014 and again in 2019. The declining numbers of disrupters in Parliament is the voters’ way of signalling this fact. I hope Opposition parties will stop this strategy and get back to doing what is expected of them — join the debate and competition of ideas in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-opposition-must-respect-parliament/story-UfNQanI3QyK3SkgFdU9xKO.html

It was difficult for us to identify the man. We sent the body to Rajawadi Hospital, Ghatkopar for post-mortem and learnt that the man was killed with a sharp-edged object.”According to police, the initial report suggested that the killer stabbed the deceased on the left side of his chest and only one stab caused his death. Following this, the case was filed under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.An officer said, “We had no clue about the identity of deceased, so we took photos of him as well as his clothes and circulated to all police stations. Later, we received information from Bhandup police station about a missing complaint registered on October 9 and the description of the clothes matched.”“After that we contacted the family to come to Rajawadi Hospital for identification.

18-10-2020||Mumbai||Employee of e-wallet service provider arrested in Mumbai for stealing customers’ passwords and duping them||The state cyber police on Saturday arrested an employee of an e-commerce payment service provider for allegedly stealing passwords of customer’s and later using them for unauthorised transactions. The accused Mohammed Munna Ansari, 25, is a field sales executive at the company, and under the pretext of resolving technical errors in the app of customers, he would reset their password and memorise it. Later he would use the password to illegally transfer money into desired accounts. The probe has revealed that he has similarly carried out 4-5 unauthorised transactions. His partner, who taught him the trick of how to withdraw money using someone else’s password, is wanted in the case. Ansari has been arrested on the complaint of one Rajesh Patel, a milk shop owner in Andheri (West). Patel has lodged a complaint with the cyber police in September after he discovered that five unauthorised transactions worth over ₹50,000 were carried out between August 19 and September 20 from his e-wallet account. On October 5 when Patel checked his email account he found an August 19 email from the company alerting him of a suspicious login on his account from an unknown device. Patel had missed this email, cyber police said. The cyber police officers arrested Ansari after analysing the details of the beneficiary account. His interrogation revealed that as he was working for the company and thus got details of the customers. “He would visit customers and under the pretext of resolving errors in their apps, would reset the password and memorise the new password. Later he would log in to the customer’s account from another device and make unauthorised transactions. He is believed to have similarly stolen money from 4-5 such customers,” said a police source. The number of victims may increase as the investigation progresses. The person who taught Ansari how to do this con job is wanted in the case and would soon be arrested, the police said. Ansari has booked under sections 420, 34 of Indian Penal Code and 43A, 66 and 66C of Information Technology Act. His mobile phone has been seized by the police to secure evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/employee-of-e-wallet-service-provider-arrested-in-mumbai-for-stealing-customers-passwords-and-duping-them/story-CUGl2LvUxc4Ugx16zaPGDP.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks banks to disburse loans and refund interest to farmers||In a major relief to over a lakh farmers who were being held at ransom by banks refusing to disburse loans for the ongoing Kharif season, till the farmers paid interest on the previous loans, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has directed the banks to release the loan amount. Court has also restrained the banks from demanding interest on the previous loan and directed the banks to return the interest collected from the farmers.The farmers eligible for loan waiver under the Mahatma Phule Karjmukti Yojna approached the court after banks refused to disburse the new loans to them even though the state had issued a government resolution in January 2020, stating that it would pay the banks the previous loan amount under the scheme. A division bench of justices SV Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Kishore Tangade, a resident of Aurangabad, was informed by advocate Satish Talekar that banks were resorting to arm twisting tactics with the farmers. Talekar submitted that the though the banks had been asked by the state government not to seek interest on the previous loans from October 1, 2019, and to disburse new loans to the farmers, the banks were holding the farmers to ransom and telling them that new loans would be released only if the farmers paid interest accrued after October 1 on the previous loans.Citing the example of Aurangabad District Central Cooperative Bank Ltd, Talekar informed the court that even though it had passed an interim order on July 9 directing banks not to ask for interest and disburse new loans, the said bank was adamant and refused to release the new loans till the farmers paid interest accrued after October 1, 2019. Talekar submitted that as the Kharif season was underway and the delaying tactics by banks would result in huge losses to the farmers who would not be able to take benefit of the season, due to lack of funds, the court should initiate contempt proceedings against such banks. Senior counsel RS Deshmukh for the bank submitted that after the interim order, the bank had released loans to around 98,000 farmers, but was not releasing loans to chronic defaulters. Though the bank intends to challenge the order wherein they have been restrained from demanding interest on the previous loans after October 1, 2019, in light of the interim order they had stopped demanding interest. After hearing the submission, the court observed that 2020 was a tumultuous year due to Covid but with timely rains, the agriculturists would suffer if they do not get short term loans on time. In light of this, the court directed the banks to not only disburse loans to the remaining beneficiary at the earliest but also refund the interest collected by them to the tune of ₹5 crore immediately to the farmers. The court then disposed of the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-banks-to-disburse-loans-and-refund-interest-to-farmers/story-EhaK5dY7LXIPGhzmxgboVL.html

The interviews were fixed in March and April, but due to the virus outbreak, many of them could neither be held on the scheduled dates nor could be rescheduled.In their letter to the V-C, PUTA said that there was no justification for not holding the pending interviews “when Unlock 5 has already been announced by the Government of India and most of the restrictions have been removed from October 15.”The letter also stated that if the schedule was not finalised by November 3, PUTA would sit on a dharna protest at 12noon on that day in front of wherever the vice-chancellor was operating from.V-C Raj Kumar said, “We have already initiated the process and the schedule of interviews will be finalised soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cas-promotions-puta-threatens-to-hold-dharna-if-interview-schedule-not-finalised-by-november-3/story-EJKAN1g0njqefPm8uLaMzI.html
18-10-2020||City||Ludhiana residents move human rights panel over contaminated water||Irked over contaminated water supply for around two weeks, residents of Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar Block - E filed a complaint with the Punjab State Human Rights Commission on Sunday.The residents rued that despite several complaints submitted with the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) and Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board (PWSSB), the authorities have failed to find a solution for the problem, due to which they are falling ill.They said a foul smell emanated from the water and amid the Covid-19 pandemic and rising dengue cases, the fear of water-borne diseases was haunting them.One of the residents, Aamarjit Singh, said, “Supply of potable water is fundamental right of the residents. We made several requests to the authorities, but they have still failed to find a solution. They have not even been able to find the cause so far. We were forced to submit a complaint with the human rights commission and have also sought action against officials concerned.”Another resident, Arvind Sharma, said, “My grandson fell ill last week by consuming contaminated water. Many others in our locality are also falling ill, but authorities are not paying heed to the problem.” “Residents are forced to purchase mineral water because of this. Earlier, we had filed a complaint with the principal secretary of the local bodies department. But, as the authorities failed to resolve the problem, we have submitted a complaint with the human rights commission,” he added.LIT officials said that PWSSB officials are working on the issue.PWSSB sub-divisional officer (SDO) Gurpreet Singh, said, “We have checked sewer lines in the area but there is no problem in them. Now, we will be inspecting house connections of residents. Only a few houses are now getting contaminated water supply in the area and we are constantly working to resolve the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-move-human-rights-panel-over-contaminated-water/story-QBlH6LHswScqNsiouTB8YO.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||23-yr-old student from Mumbai hopes recent judgment by SC will help him get admission in IIT-B||In what could come as a major relief and success for a 23-year-old student belonging to the reserved category, who was denied admission to a post-graduate diploma course in the Industrial Design Centre of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B), a recent Supreme Court judgement could ensure that he gets his way.After the institute failed to intimate the student Prathmesh Pedamkar him about his selection for admission on time, the student approached the Bombay high court as IIT-B refused to accommodate him. However, IIT-B informed the HC that they could not make an exception for him, the court asked the student’s lawyer to bring past judgements that directed institutes to admit students, though the seats were filled up. The apex court judgement will be placed before the HC on Monday. The Apex court judgement of December 2019 in a similar case has held that if the student is not at fault, an institute is bound to grant the student admission in the current academic year by increasing a seat or granting him admission in the next academic year based on the selection procedure he/she underwent this year.According to the petition by Pedamkar, he had worked hard to get admitted to the masters in diploma course at the IDC in IIT-B. Due to the pandemic the entire selection process of the institute which was to start in May had got postponed and had completed only in July with his personal interview.Pedamkar’s advocate Ashraf Shaikh had informed the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that though the institute had not put up the revised schedule for the selection process, it kept the applicant students informed through email and mobile phone messages. Shaikh submitted that his client had managed to reach the final stage of selection through this method and was told that he would be intimated through the same method if he was shortlisted for the 17 seats on offer.On August 21, after waiting for a month, Pedamkar who had not got any email or SMS from the institute contacted the authorities only to be told that he had not responded to the mail sent to him on August 2 and hence lost his seat after being selected for admission. Pedamkar then sought details of the email and a copy of the sent email, but the institute did not oblige. Hence he approached the Navi Mumbai Cyber Cell to find out whether he had received the email from IIT-B. The cyber cell, however, declined his request for want of a court order. Pedamkar then approached the high court as the institute refused to grant him admission belatedly as the reserved category seat had been filled up by another candidate.The institute had however maintained that though the mail to Pedamkar had not reached him, it was his duty to check the IIT-B and IDC website to ascertain whether he was selected. The institute further submitted that though there were 19 students who had not received the mail, 14 of them secured their admission before August 6 after finding their name on the website. In light of this and there was no additional seat, the institute refused to grant him admission this year. It also refused to grant admission next year stating that Pedamkar would have to undergo the selection process again.As IIT-B was adamant on not admitting Pedamkar, the court said it wanted to help Pedamakar but for that Shaikh should find previous orders of the SC or any other HC wherein an institute was asked to accommodate a student beyond its intake capacity.The Supreme Court judgement passed on December 19, 2019, pertaining to admission of a student the MBBS course. The student had approached the SC after her petition for admission in the Delhi HC had got delayed and the date for admission had passed. The SC bench of justices Arun Mishra, MR Shah and B R Gavai held that though the date for admission had passed, keeping a meritorious student had to be put in the original position of getting the seat if he/she had lost the seat for no fault of his/her own.The SC issued the following order:1. The Court under exceptional circumstances and in rarest of rare cases direct the admission in the same year by directing to increase the seats, however, it should not be more than one or two seats and such admissions can be ordered within a reasonable time.2. Such relief can be granted only in exceptional circumstances and in the rarest of rare cases. In case of such an eventuality, the Court may also pass an order cancelling the admission given to a candidate who is at the bottom of the merit list of the category3. Wherever the court finds that the action of the authorities has been arbitrary and in breach of the rules and regulations or the prospectus affecting the rights of the students and that a candidate is found to be meritorious and such candidate/student has approached the court at the earliest and without any delay, the court can mould the relief and direct the admission to be granted to such a candidate in the next academic year by issuing appropriate directions.4. if it is found that the management was at fault and wrongly denied the admission to the meritorious candidate, in that case, the Court may direct to reduce the number of seats in the management quota of that year, meaning thereby the student/students who was/were denied admission illegally to be accommodated in the next academic year out of the seats allotted in the management quota.5. Grant of the compensation could be an additional remedy but not a substitute for restitutional remedies. Therefore, in an appropriate case, the Court may award the compensation to such a meritorious candidate who for no fault of his/her has to lose one full academic year and who could not be granted any relief of admission in the same academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/23-yr-old-student-from-mumbai-hopes-recent-judgment-by-sc-will-help-him-get-admission-in-iit-b/story-yCvyVvbpZwbty9PNYksFPK.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: NCB arrests South African national in drugs case||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday arrested a South African national, Agisilaos Demetriades, with small quantities of drugs in connection with drug case into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput (SSR). The accused is the brother of a Bollywood actor’s girlfriend. Demetriades was in constant touch with several drug peddlers who supplied drugs to Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik and others arrested in the SSR case, said NCB officers. Mumbai zonal director of NCB, Sameer Wankhede, confirmed the arrest. Following a tip-off, the Mumbai NCB team raided a resort at Lonavala and arrested Demetriades. He was staying with his fiancé. NCB recovered 0.8 gram black colour sticky substance purported to be charas. The agency also conducted a search at his residence in Khar and recovered Alprazolam tablets, said an NCB officer. After checking his call records, it was found that he had contacted Anuj Keswani and Dwayne, both of whom have been arrested in the SSR case. Demetriades said he had supplied drugs to Kaizan Ibrahim. An NCB officer said, “Demetriades was dealing in a variety of drugs. Electronic evidence showed that he was in touch with Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda, who are linked with accused Rhea and Showik Chakraborty.” Demetriades was produced before a court and has been remanded in NCB custody for three days. The agency has so far arrested 23 people including actor Chakraborty and her brother Showik, Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, domestic help Dipesh Sawant, and drug peddlers Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar among others. Chakraborty was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 7 while her brother is still in jail. On October 15, NCB arrested Jai Madhok, a management professional and drug peddler who dealt in cocaine and hashish. Madhok’s name came up during various statements of drug peddlers recorded in the case. Madhok was involved in cocaine and hashish consumption as well as distribution, along with Dharma Productions’ former executive producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad and Ankush Arenja, both were earlier arrested in the SSR case. Madhok has direct links with Nigerian nationals and procured cocaine for himself and also distributed the contraband to his friends. During interrogation, Madhok said he was in touch with Sam alias Rahil Vishram who used to supply hashish to him. He then supplied the hashish to his few friends to earn money. When NCB officers checked Madhok’s financial transactions, they found that he had made many transactions for payment of drugs. Last month, NCB recorded statements of Bollywood actors Rakul Preet Singh, Deepika Padukone, Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan. Statement of Padukone’s manager Karishma Prakash was also recorded. The agency is probing the drug angle into Rajput’s death. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-ncb-arrests-south-african-national-in-drugs-case/story-708MpQs6D7HHiDJWbcqxxO.html

Meanwhile, the Congress has demanded action against the ‘anti-constitutional’ stand by the governor.Raut on Sunday said that after the stance taken by Shah, a message would have been sent out to governors across the country. “The controversy could have been avoided, had it not been commenced by Governor. We did not start, ours was a reaction. However, the issue has now ended for us after an earful by Union home minister Amit Shah, whose ministry handles matters related to governors and Raj Bhavans. We respect Shah as he never hesitates to put up the truth frankly. We respect his stand on the issue and draw the curtain on it now,” he said.Shah had, on Saturday, in an interview to a media group said that Governor BS Koshyari should have chosen his words carefully in the letter he wrote to Thackeray. “I have read the letter. He has made a passing reference. I believe some restraint could have been exercised,” Shah said.Koshyari had written to Thackeray last week raising the issue of reopening of places of worship in Maharashtra. “I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turned ‘secular ‘ yourselves, the term you hated?” Koshyari had asked Thackeray in his letter. In his response, Thackeray said he does not need a “certificate” on Hindutva from the governor and added, “Do you mean that opening up religious places is Hindutva, and not opening them means being secular? Secularism is a crucial base of the oath you took as Governor. Do you not believe it?” The Congress has demanded that the governor be called back by the Central government. “If the Central government is convinced that the honourable governor has crossed his brief, he should be called back to safeguard the constitutional framework,” said Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Meanwhile, Sawant has also raised questions as to why the Railways was dilly-dallying in commencing local train services to women commuters despite having agreed amicably during a meeting on October 13. “The railway officers agreed to allow women commuters board train from October 17, the first day of Navratri, during non-peak hours. The meeting was chaired by the chief secretary of Maharashtra and both the sides had agreed. Why are BJP leaders, who have been insisting on opening temples, silent on the delay? And why do not they ask their leader Piyush Goyal, who heads the railway ministry, to intervene?” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-s-secular-taunt-issue-has-ended-for-us-after-amit-shah-s-stand-says-sanjay-raut/story-5fSc1YYV060qGiPWhZlYEP.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Mental illness common on campus, academic pressure, anxiety most common cause, finds survey by IIT-Bombay magazine||A significant number of students at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), who were surveyed by student magazine Insight, said mental health problems were common in the institute. Academic pressure and anxieties about career are some of the top causes for mental health problems among students, finds the survey aimed at understanding students’ experience with mental health in the institute. Of the 450 students, who responded to the survey, 85% said problems in mental health were common in IIT-B and 93% said mental health problems were real psychological problems. When asked about the possible causes for their mental health illness, 71.3% said academic pressure was the reason and 52.2% said decisions about professional future was the cause. The survey, published in a special edition on account of the World Mental Health Day on October 10, registers anonymous responses from students to a range of objective and subjective questions on whether they had experienced negative emotions, for how long and reasons for feeling such emotions. It comes close in the heels of an article chronicling the personal experiences of alumni members with mental health that was published by Insight in September.“The idea behind the special issue is to get people to talk about mental health and address the stigma around it,” said Amogh Gawaskar, chief editor of Insight IIT-B. Students at IIT-B have the option of getting help in-house by approaching the student wellness centre which has nine counsellors. However, stigma and scepticism made students wary of seeking help, found the survey. When asked if students sought help while facing a mental health illness, 44.6% said they did not as they feared judgement and were sceptical of the effectiveness of counselling. “The proportion of the students currently suffering from a mental disorder (35.9%) is the most crucial and requires active intervention,” read the article by Insight. To beat the stigma, Insight has now invited anonymous or candid accounts of students who are currently suffering from a mental illness or have suffered at some time on how to seek help and work through the illness. “These stories will be published on a self-help portal that will be launched soon. It will help people find a voice and navigate a mental illness,” said Gawaskar.Juhu-based clinical psychologist Neha Patel said academic pressure was common among students and led to anxiety and depression. “Students, especially those at IITs, have worked their whole life to get into the institute. Competition is deeply ingrained in their psyches by the society and the parents. So when they are in the campus, pressures build-up to get the best job or outperform colleagues,” said Patel, adding that this anxiety also drives students towards drug use, which is further detrimental to mental health. “The most important thing is to seek professional help. To take the pressure off, students should be encouraged to balance academics with other interests,” said Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mental-illness-common-on-campus-academic-pressure-anxiety-most-common-cause-finds-survey-by-iit-bombay-magazine/story-Cc6hmepa4LCvt1sbIKBJqK.html

However, in pre-Covid times, a routine day at our OPDs meant a footfall of over 10,000. It’s a decision worth waiting for some more time till it is amply clear that the worst is over and the curve has actually flattened. Any hasty decision may backfire, amounting to risking precious lives.”The director said that considering the upcoming festive season, a surge in numbers could not be ruled out.4 lakh provided teleconsultations since May 19On catering to non-Covid patients during the pandemic, the director was quoted saying, “It is a misconception that the health needs of non-Covid patients have not been addressed because physical OPDs were closed. On an average, 1,800-2,500 patients reached out through teleconsultation on a daily basis, and PGIMER has provided OPD consultation to almost 4 lakh patients since May 19. In addition, 27,722 surgeries have been performed and 30,389 patients have availed treatment.”Physical OPD services in the gynaecology, radiotherapy and ophthalmology departments have been functional throughout the pandemic, he said, adding that initiatives way beyond their bed strength had been taken by them.To avoid crowding in the OPDs, the institute is ramping up the infrastructure required to ensure social distancing by creating separate screening and holding areas, which is almost ready now, the director said.Consultations were on with various stakeholders to work out the modalities to reopen physical OPDs through staggered steps to ensure safety of patients, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anticipating-surge-in-covid-cases-pgimer-says-time-not-right-to-reopen-opds/story-CM8IZRMFyizOEcztw1VquK.html

The teenager’s parents were away at a market and she was alone at home when she took the extreme step. Inspector Nidhan Singh, SHO, Jagraon City police station, said they received informed about a suicide by a young girl on Sunday evening, following which they reached the spot and initiated investigation.According to her parents, who are government teachers, they had left for the market while their daughter was studying in her room on the first floor of the house. After returning home, they asked her to come downstairs. But, she did not respond to their calls. When the couple went to their daughter’s room, they were shocked to find her hanging from the ceiling fan. They lowered her after cutting the rope and rushed her to a local hospital, where doctors declared the girl dead.The couple told the police that their daughter wanted to enrol in MBBS, but did not get the desired rank in the recent NEET, which pushed her into depression. They said their daughter was a bright student and among the toppers in her Class 10 and 12 examinations. But, she had fallen sick before NEET, which did not allow her to perform well in the exam. Despite the unexpected result, they did not scold her and encouraged her to try again next year, they said.The inspector said the girl was survived by her parents and a 10-year-old brother. Police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure following the statement of her parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dejected-over-neet-result-18-year-old-jagraon-girl-hangs-herself/story-95s7VshYDs6XHbjRgn67XL.html
18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Ramlila goes virtual in fight against Ravana & Corona||With Covid-19 posing a new set of challenges, the Ordnance Cable Factory (OCF) Sanskritik Manch, which stages Ramlila in Sector 29, has turned to technology to take on Ravana and the pandemic in one go.The group’s artistes have already started shooting and uploading Ramlila episodes on YouTube and Facebook. OCF’s general secretary Rajiv Sharma said this way, devout audiences won’t have to miss out on the performance and they can watch it from the safety of their homes amid the pandemic. Jyoti Bhardwaj, who plays the role of Ravana in this Ramlila, said that their troupe was already familiar with the lines and had the costumes and props from previous years, so they decided to put together the production for a virtual audience. “We will be uploading around seven to eight episodes, of 20-25 minutes each, depicting the important moments in Ramlila. The first episode is already out and we have amassed over 1,500 views for it.”Bhardwaj added that they are using a pair of DSLR cameras to shoot the Ramlila. It is being shot on the stage of their Ramlila ground in Sector 29-A. His son Chirayu Bhardwaj is editing the videos and posting it online.Many organisers still waryDespite getting permission from the administration, many organisers are still wary of going ahead with the performances. Chandigarh Kendriya Ramleela Mahasabha president Bhagwati Prashad Gaur said that even though almost all of the 50-60 Ramlila associations in the city have got permission from authorities, only a handful have started staging the shows. “Sectors 7, 20, 22 30, 46 and Manimajra are holding Ramlilas but the other organisations are still hesitant. Most Ramlilas have people with government jobs and they are worried that any violation of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) may land them in trouble.”Houseful at some placesThe Sector 20 Azaad Dramatic Club entered the second day of their Ramlila performance on Sunday. Ashok Choudhary, who plays the role Ravana here, says, “We have around 200 seats, which are already beginning to fill up. Ramlilas usually draw lean crowds in the initial few days, but since many of our neighboring Ramlilas aren’t being organised this year, we are drawing big crowds from the other sectors too,” he said.Financial troublesDirector of the Navyug Ramlila and Dusshera Committee Sector 7, Pardeep Kumar, said he has been organising the Ramlila from October 14, right after the group got the permissions. However with donations going down this year, they have been struggling. “Due to delay in permissions, we did not have time to collect donations for the Ramlila this year. In addition to it, the cost of sanitising the premises and ensuring the SOPs also costs a lot of money. So, we urge the administration to help us with the sanitising bit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-ramlila-goes-virtual-in-fight-against-ravana-corona/story-tXZe0IcjrkRRfO0v6BbnaP.html

18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh municipal corporation proposes major relaxations in rural building bylaws||The municipal corporation is considering bringing in major relaxations in the city’s building bylaws for allowing higher ground coverage, additional floor, basement and covered area in residential and commercial properties in the villages. The MC commissioner had constituted a committee headed by the additional commissioner in July 2019 to examine and recommend amendments in the Chandigarh Rural Rehabilitation Construction and Reconstruction Building bylaws, 2017. “The situation is grave in villages that have recently been transferred to MC where no bylaws existed earlier. The recommendations of the committee and the MC engineering wing will be tabled before the MC General House meet on October 20. After approval, the recommendations and the plan will be submitted for UT chief architect’s approval, and thereafter the administration’s approval will be sought,” said an MC official.Up to 5 marla plots exempted from setbacksAs per MC’s proposal, plots having area up to 125 square yards (5 marla) will be exempted from setbacks and allowed 100% coverage subject to proper light and ventilation. “According to 2017 bylaws, the setbacks are fixed for all types of plots. In smaller plots of 1 marla or 2 marla, such prescribed setbacks are not feasible. Their owners, therefore, do not submit plans for approval as these are not sanctionable, and consequently these are termed ‘illegal constructions’,” added the official.Similarly, a 100% ground coverage has been recommended for commercial establishments subject to the deposit of conversion charges. “At present, 50 square metre of a village building is allowed to be used for commercial purposes. Owners of big plots (shops) don’t submit their building plans, which leads to revenue losses in the form of conversion charges, which is ₹2,400/square yard,” the official said.Provision for basements in plots has also been proposed. “The corporation charges commercial rates on basements, and no provision for them in the bylaws means revenue loss for MC,” added the official.Currently, ground plus two floors are allowed in village houses. In the new proposal, additional floor has been recommended so that ground plus three floors can be constructed.Compoundable violationsThe new proposal also seeks the imposition of a composition fee for allowing minor sanctionable variations in buildings, which are not part of the sanctioned building plan of the property.“Composition fee of ₹500 per sanctionable deviation will be imposed, so that compoundable violations can be regularised,” the official said.Mandatory certificatesThe MC will sanction an occupation certificate (OC), which will be made mandatory, after the submission of a completion certificate by the owner duly signed by supervisor architect, structural engineer and plumber.A plinth-level certificate will have to be obtained and in case of absence of non-issuance of certificate, a penalty of ₹10,000 on plots with area up to 250 sq yard and ₹25,000 above 250 sq yard will be imposed.BOXCHANGES PROPOSED100% ground coverage in houses with area up to 125 sq yard100% ground coverage for commercial establishmentsAllowing basement in housesAdditional floor in houses with ground plus two floors to be allowedCompoundable violations to be regularised with composition feeOccupation certificate, plinth-level certificates to be made mandatory||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-municipal-corporations-proposes-major-relaxations-in-rural-building-bylaws/story-GszotkE8hiGdr5ovK8NLTK.html

Addressing a Facebook Live event on Sunday, Javadekar said the central government had taken a number of measures to tackle pollution. “Pollution is an issue in every country and the chief causes of pollution in India pertain to traffic, industries, waste management, dust and stubble burning,” Javadekar said. He said the government implemented BS-VI in the country, which will lead to decrease in pollution. He also said that the expansion of Metro services and the introduction of CNG buses have contributed in bringing down pollution levels. “E-buses and Metro are coming up in all major cities, which cause zero pollution. There are over two lakh e-vehicles in the country. I also use an e-vehicle,” the minister said. Javadekar said that while these measures were improving the air quality, public participation is required to make these initiatives a success. He added, “People’s participation is very important for reducing air pollution. Proper maintenance of vehicles, using cycles for shorter commutes, walking and not being dependent on cars every time; all these small steps can go a long way in helping bring down pollution levels in your city.” He also asked people to plant more trees in their neighbourhoods, as increased tree cover aids in reducing pollution. Javadekar also urged people to download Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) mobile application ‘Sameer’, to remain up to date about all details of real time air quality. He said that the first step towards solving a problem is to accept it and take measures to control it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/javadekar-urges-public-participation-in-fight-against-pollution/story-MBsyym55g4J2ocd6qO555I.html

District lead bank manager Ved Ratna said that as per the reports submitted by a few banks, the CDR of these banks had gone down despite regular financing. “The government has deposited over ₹4,000 crore as many upcoming projects like Jewar airport and Smart City will be kicked off soon. On the other hand, we don’t have as many entrepreneurs who want finances from banks. As a result, the CDR is expected to go down to 57% by the end of this quarter,” he said. He said banks in the district had disbursed over ₹511 crore to 6,535 individuals under the government-backed emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS). “This collateral-free, government-backed scheme was launched in May to enable small businesses to resume operations. Later, based on industry demand, the ambit of the scheme was expanded to include micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with turnover of up to ₹250 crore from ₹100 crore, in line with the new MSME definition and individuals for business purposes. Of these 6,535 persons, who have got loans from banks, over 5,000 are MSME entrepreneurs and the banks have given them loans of ₹449 crore,” he said. Ratna further said that loans have also been extended under ₹20-lakh crore Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan stimulus package, to street vendors, for tiding them out from the financial crisis in the post-Covid situation. “The GB Nagar district administration had already identified as many as 3,153 small vendors eligible for loans. So far, we have disbursed ₹1.8 crore among 1,800 of them. Under the scheme, a loan amount of ₹10,000 is being extended to street vendors, which can be repaid in 12 instalments with an interest rate of 7%,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/heavy-govt-deposits-bring-down-banks-credit-debit-ratio-in-gb-nagar/story-8TxqeGb18Ky0uVLAz9636I.html

Industrialists including DS Chawla, president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), and Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (FICO), also participated in the protest.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) also came out in support of the aggrieved family. District president of Youth Akali Dal, Gurdeep Singh Gosha, and Maheshinder Singh Grewal, member of SAD core committee, also protested.Protesting under the banner ‘Justice for Angad’, the family members said that after Angad tested positive for dengue, the hospital continuously misguided them during the treatment. They added that it was only when the situation got out of hand and his condition deteriorated that Dr Baldeep, the owner of Deep Hosiptal, who Angad was consulting for treatment, referred him to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH).“It was only when we reached DMCH that we found out that Angad’s condition was critical. He died due to negligence on the part of Deep hospital as they did not disclose his condition to us. We do not want any anyone else to suffer or die due to the negligence of the hospital so we are demanding action against the doctor and hospital,” said Angad’s father-in-law, Upkar Singh Ahuja, who is also the president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU).Ahuja said that the licence of the doctor should be cancelled and he should be arrested. Further, an inquiry should be marked to check the number of patients who might have died due to the negligence of the hospital in the past. We are also seeking legal advice on the matter, he added.Dr Baldeep Singh, the owner of Deep Hospital, said that the family was not misguided about the patient’s condition and he was personally monitoring Angad. “It is only when his condition started deteriorating slightly, that I referred him to DMCH. The patient’s condition deteriorated after that, as stated by DMCH. The patient’s dengue was severe. Also, there was kidney injury and he tested positive for Hepatitis-B in DMC. I am ready to face inquiry as there was no negligence on the part of the hospital and we have the test reports of the patient while he was in the hospital,” he saidAngad, the managing director of Big Ben Group, died during treatment at DMCH on October 8.

18-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Discom cuts power supply to over 5,000 defaulters||NOIDA: The Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) has recovered over ₹3.64 crore from 1,778 consumers in its recently launched disconnection drive in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. The fortnight-long drive, which started on October 13, saw the power supply of more than 5,000 households disconnected as part of the process to recover dues.Virendra Nath Singh, PVVNL chief engineer, said the disconnection drive is being undertaken to snap electricity connections of nearly 60,000 consumers who have not cleared their dues despite repeated reminders. “During the ongoing crackdown to reduce major power loss, our officials disconnected power supply to 5,004 consumers, who had not cleared electricity dues of ₹10.99 crore,” he said. As on October 8, nearly 60,000 consumers owed dues amounting to ₹33.75 crore to PVVNL.Singh also said that out of 5,004 disconnected power lines, 1,148 are from urban areas of Noida. “Electricity supply to 3,856 consumers in rural areas was disconnected on Wednesday as they have not cleared dues of ₹8.48 crore despite repeated reminders. It is appreciable that our officials have recovered more than ₹1.94 crore from 1,028 consumers in only five days from rural areas, where recovery rates are very low,” he said. The chief engineer also said that no untoward incident has taken place during the disconnection drive so far as the PVVNL raiding teams were assisted by local police to avert any resistance from the defaulting consumers, particularly in the rural areas. The power distribution company has also decided to regularly inspect electricity meters of heavy load connections, as it is the main reason for mounting AT&C (Aggregate Technical and Commercial) loss. The overall line loss in Noida is about 17.8%, officials said. “Despite being the biggest revenue-generating power region, the line loss has mounted due to power theft in areas coming under 60 identified electricity feeders. We have taken these areas on priority for launching crackdown on power thieves, besides launching disconnection drives,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-discom-cuts-power-supply-to-over-5-000-defaulters/story-hBF0IDkGjvUSgfDFoZtEzK.html

The move comes after it won a case against a contractor who had applied for the project, dragging the authority to Allahabad high court. The authority won the case in arbitration directed for by the high court.“The authority had, in 2010, wanted to construct a fully-automatic multi-level car parking at the Golf Course, but due to technical issues the work could not be started, and the contractor filed a case at the Allahabad high court. The case is resolved now and the authority has decided not to build the parking facility,” said Rajeev Tyagi, general manager of the Noida authority.In 2010 the authority had signed a memorandum of understanding with a private contractor for the construction of the parking. Subsequently the authority sought help from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi to check whether the company can build the fully automatic parking building at Golf Course.“The IIT Delhi, in its report, had said that the contractor is not technically qualified to construct such a parking facility. As a result, the authority asked the contractor not to build the same. However, the same year, the contractor filed a case in the Allahabad high court and also sought ₹39 crore in claims from the authority. The court appointed an arbitrator to settle the matter. The arbitrator finally resolved the case and rejected the claim made by the contractor,” said Tyagi, who pursued the case on behalf of the authority at the arbitrator’s court.The arbitrator also directed the contractor to pay ₹14.44 lakh to the authority as legal fees, said officials of the authority.“The arbitrator has directed the contractor to pay ₹14.44 lakh in next two months to Noida authority, which had been fighting this case since the last ten years. We put all technical issues strongly before the court and the matter is finally settled,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-multi-level-parking-project-for-sector-38-golf-course-scrapped/story-nklanlyiIzfR13dVm2j21H.html

Complainant Ram Vilas is a native of Sutyana village in Greater Noida and is posted in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. Vilas said that his son had put up an ad on a website for renting out his apartment in Greater Noida after he was transferred in Gwalior in September. “Soon, a person contacted me and enquired about the house.

He said he would like to rent my flat but wanted my identification card’s e-copy on whatsapp to ensure I was a genuine person,” Vilas said in the FIR. Vilas claimed he had agreed to the request. The deal, however, was not signed as the suspect said he had found another flat. However, a few days later the CRPF official started getting calls from unknown people accusing him of fraud. “I received around 5-6 calls from people who accused me of cheating. I was in a shock to know this. I informed them that I am a police official and there must be a mistake,” he said. He suspected the role of the stranger who had taken his identity card and filed the complaint. Bhuvnesh Kumar, Station House Officer at Ecotech 3 police station, said that based on complaint an FIR has been registered against the suspect under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code. “It appears the suspect used the CRPF official’s ID and mobile phone number to cheat people.

Motor Accident claim cases too can be settled,” said Verma.Para-legal volunteers (PLV) too reported a rise in cases of domestic violence and conflicts. “Several domestic abuse cases have been reported. In some cases, it was found that some men consuming alcohol at home due to the lockdown verbally abused their spouse and family. In some cases, women were beaten up by their husbands. Though we arranged for counselling but in some cases, couples have planned for divorce. I have requested such couples to get their cases resolved at the e-lok adalat,” Mool Chand Tyagi, a PLV, said Friday.“There are around 50 PLVs in the district. Over 200 domestic conflicts involving couples were reported at these PLVs. Majority of cases have been resolved after PLVs arranged counselling with panel advocates and some tele-counsellors of the Gautam Buddha University and other institutions. But in around 20 to 30 cases, issues could not be resolved, hence PLVs have been directed to motivate them for e-lok adalats,” said Sushil Kumar, secretary, DLSA.“Further, PLVs have been directed to spread awareness among all residents about the e-lok adalat. We identify separated couples through village pradhans or local residents and motivate them to use this opportunity for mediation,” said Kumar.“Advocates and family courts have been directed to motivate the divorce petitioners for mediation through e-lok adalat,” said Kumar.Accident claims too will be taken up and settled at E-Lok Adalat. “Economically impoverished accident victims who face problems in video conferencing will be helped by PLVs,” said Kumar.On Sunday, a mini lok adalat was held for taking up petty cases. “At least 1,396 petty cases were resolved on Sunday,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-e-lok-adalat-to-be-held-on-november-1-for-matrimonial-and-accident-claim-cases/story-uW8XV5BpMPwbNgk7ACVzoI.html

It permits landing even when the visibility is down to 350 metres . The advanced CAT-3 ILS, however, works at even as low as 50-metre visibility.Even as in March this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court directed the chief of defence staff, department of civil aviation, department of military affairs, ministry of defence, Airports Authority of India and other stakeholders to examine and decide on installation of the advanced ILS, nothing has moved forward. The stakeholders have now stated that they are facing “technical issues” in the installation of CAT-3 ILS.Sanjeev Vashisht, member of Chandigarh International Airport Advisory Committee, said: “There are issues in the installation of CAT-3 ILS as the airforce has to first remove some obstructions. In the present situation, they cannot be removed. But CAT-2 ILS is operational at the airport.”In April last year, round-the-clock operations began at the airport, allowing landing of wide-bodied aircraft, including Boeing 787-800 (Dreamliner) and Airbus 330, but even after 18 months, no big aircraft is in the pipeline.The same month, after various stakeholders approved the installation of CAT-3 ILS, the board of directors, Airport Authority of India, had approved to allot the work to Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division, but the agency failed to get permission from the ministry of defence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brace-for-flight-cancellations-at-chandigarh-airport-this-winter-too/story-K2j2nx5mdb4mHNzmLByTWL.html

On October 11, he was transporting fly ash from the NTPC plant in Dadri to a private company in Phase 2.“We got a call in the evening at around 4pm from the private company’s plant in Phase 2 telling us about our brother’s death in an accident,” said Jitendta Tomar, the deceased’s brother.He said that a few days before the accident, his brother had told him of a disagreement and brawl with three other people working at the private company. “Those men had threatened revenge and dire consequences after which my brother refused to transport material to that company. However, on October 11, upon his employer’s request, he agreed. At the site, a malfunction in the unloading machine allegedly resulted in his death,” said Jitendra.But the family doesn’t believe that this was an accident and they feel that the three people who had argued with Lokesh Tomar were behind his death. Based on the complaint of the family, a case has been registered at the Phase 2 police station under section 304A of the IPC (causing death by negligence).“A probe in the matter is underway, Prima facie it seems to be an accident but the case is being looked into and necessary action will be taken,” said Anita Chauhan, station house officer, Phase 2 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-driver-killed-in-accident-family-alleges-foul-play/story-gTyX4loO39j8OX88pmendP.html
18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC plans to levy garbage collection fee||The Chandigarh municipal corporation will soon start charging user fee for door-to-door collection of garbage in areas from where it is already lifting solid waste.Charges will be added to the water bills or property tax bills, and are likely to imposed on 34,000 houses and 3,000 shops in these areas. “The charges are likely to be ₹50 to ₹100 for houses, and ₹200 to ₹2,000 for commercial establishments. These will be finalised after discussions in the MC General House,” said Dr Amritpal Singh, medical officer of health.According to the Solid Waste Management Bylaws 2018, the user fee for collection, transportation and disposal of solid waste is to be charged from residential and commercial establishments. The proposal will be tabled before the General House on October 20. Once it gets the nod, the financially struggling MC aims to earn additional ₹90 lakh per month. Areas to be covered, for nowDoor-to-door garbage collection in most sectors is so far being done by private agents, who collect user charges.The MC has started the process in 13 villages and residential areas of some sectors besides several markets.For now, the user fee is to be imposed in Dhanas, Sarangpur, Khuda Lahora, Khuda Jassu, Daria, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Raipur Khurd, Behlana, Makhan Majra, Maloya, Railpur Kalan. The markets where the MC is collecting garbage include Sectors 7- 9, 16, 21-24, 26, 28-33, 36-38 and 49.If the MC extends the facility to other sectors, then there will a trial run in the first month, and user charges will be applied from the first day of the next month.The civic body currently has 100 garbage collection vehicles, which are being used in villages. With Chandigarh Smart City Limited allotting the tender for purchase of 390 more vehicles recently, the MC expects to get 200 of them by the month end.Property owners to do self-assessmentOwners of residential or commercial properties will have to submit a self-declaration about the number of households or economic units on their premises within one month. If they fail to do so, the MC will carry out the assessment on its own, and impose administrative/penalty charges of ₹5,000 each household on the owner or occupant.Pvt collectors, Cong oppose moveThe MC move to impose user charges has elicited opposition from garbage collectors and the Congress. Safai Karamchari Union leader KK Chaddha, said, “We condemn this move. We plan to strike work from October 23 in the city on this issue as well as selective tagging of safai karamcharis through GPS-enabled watches.”Congress councillor Satish Kainth said: “When the MC is not executing proper garbage collection, how can it impose user charges? We will oppose this move.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-plans-to-levy-garbage-collection-fee/story-iilt4IWoOdv5jV9xaQ4jFM.html

They held placards thanking Thane civic body for this move. The initiative was a part of Thane civic commissioner’s drive to make the city clean and free of illegal hawkers. These hawkers were shifted to the designated space for hawkers and vendors across the city.Anirudha Asanare, resident of Satyashankar society said, “I have been staying in the vicinity for over 11 years and have been noticing the hawkers selling fruits and vegetables on their handcarts right outside the society gates. Repeated complaints were made to the civic body over the years, but to no avail. On Friday the civic body successfully removed them and they have not returned for three days now.”At the beginning of September, a special drive was initiated by the Thane commissioner to evict illegal structures across the city. As a part of this initiative, these hawkers were asked to move to the designated space provided to them in the vicinity. “We have hawker zones and no hawker zones marked in the city. We have set up special structures for the hawkers as well. They have been moved from the illegal places and provided space there. We have also recently begun with the cleanliness drive. The efforts to ensure a cleaner and better city will continue,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation.Kasber Augustine, citizen activist, said, “This is a welcome move from the civic body.

18-10-2020||Noida||Five persons arrested for bank loan racket operating from a car||Knowledge Park police on Saturday arrested five persons involved in bank loan fraud operating from a car in Greater Noida. The suspects would advertise low cost bank loans through social media and would convince people to pay a processing fee for the loan in advance, said police. Once the money was transferred, the suspects ceased all communication with the victims. To avoid electronic surveillance, the suspects would keep moving in the car. The suspects were identified as Rabupura resident Tinku Bhati (25), Bulandshahr resident Jasmendra Pal Singh (24), Ankit (27) from Rajasthan, Ankul (24) and Ashish (25) who are from Aligarh. They allegedly met while searching for a job in Greater Noida and lived in a rented accommodation.Varun Pawar, station house officer (SHO) of Knowledge Park police station, said, “We had no complainant in this case. On Saturday evening the police team was conducting a routine checking drive near Knowledge Park T-Point. They stopped a Volkswagen Polo car for checking and found the five persons in the vehicle,” he said.Pawar said the team found 15 mobile phones, two laptops, three debit cards, one pen drive, ₹1,000 from their possession. “The police team found the 15 mobile phones unusual. They first believed the suspects were mobile phone snatchers and brought them to police station for questioning,” he said. Police said the suspects were questioned separately and they admitted to running a call centre from the car. “They used to advertise on social media to facilitate loan at minimum interest rates. They pretended to be representatives of a finance company. Once a person called in, the suspects sought their identity cards asked him to pay ₹2,500, and sometimes more, as loan processing fee. Once the money was transferred, the suspects used to block their numbers and stop all communication,” he said. The suspects are believed to have cheated over 200 people in the last six months. Police said the seized Volkswagen Polo is registered in the name of a Ghaziabad resident. “Primary investigation shows the suspects had got the car financed using a fake identity. We are investigating the matter from all angles,” Pawar said. A case has been registered against them under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC and Section 66 of the IT Act. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/five-persons-arrested-for-bank-loan-racket-operating-from-a-car/story-wJxN3X5KXMscQlpt6Pd1GK.html

18-10-2020||Noida||Noida: Teams formed to check pollution at construction sites||NOIDA: As air pollution has started to increase in the region, the Noida and Greater Noida authorities have formed teams to keep tabs on polluting sites on a daily basis. Both cities were in the ‘poor’ category on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI), with Noida at 252 and Greater Noida at 278.The Noida authority said Sunday it has intensified action against those flouting construction guidelines, causing air pollution in the city. Officials said they had started acting against violators on Thursday, when the authority imposed the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) in the city to contain air pollution, when it imposed a penalty of ₹42,500 against violators. On Friday and Saturday, it imposed penalties of a total of ₹11.5 lakh against different entities, including waste management firms, individuals, private companies and others.On Sunday, Noida imposed a total fine of ₹3,75,400 against nine firms for flouting National Green Tribunal guidelines in the city.Noida authority’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari said she has directed staff to carry out monitoring on all construction sites and take effective steps to implement Grap measures to control pollution, ordered for by the Supreme Court in 2016 for the National Capital Region (NCR). “All project engineers are working as nodal officers in their respective areas and taking appropriate action in this regard,” said Maheshwari, who directed staff to take up water sprinkling and mechanical sweeping on roads and ensure anti-smog guns at all construction sites, among other measures.Noida is spread across 20,000 hectares and is divided into 10 work circles. Each circle is headed by a project engineer along with his team of junior engineers, who report to the general manager or the chief engineer of the authority. Officials said the authority has started using treated water to sprinkle on city roads so that dust settles down.Anti-smog guns have been set up at Chilla elevated road, Bhangel elevated road, sectors 71/51 underpass, an under-construction building in Sector 96, underpass construction sites in sectors 44 and 151 being built along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.“We have deployed anti-smog guns at all our construction sites to make sure that dust does not fly about, causing air pollution. We are taking adequate measures to reduce air pollution,” said Rajeev Tyagi, general manager of the Noida authority.Residents, meanwhile, demanded that the authority clean and sprinkle water in all roads, be it main or small.“The authority must sprinkle water on dust in the city’s small as well as arterial road. It should also make sure that anti-smog guns are functioning properly, to reduce pollution, besides other measures,” said PS Jain, president of confederation of NCR residents’ welfare associations (Conrwa), an umbrella body of RWAs.The neighbouring city of Greater Noida, developed on 38,000 hectares, has been divided into eight zones for better monitoring of all construction sites, including private and government.“We have appointed zonal-in charges for all eight zones for requisite steps to contain air pollution. We have also requested residents to call at 0120-2336046, 47 and 48 and WhatsApp number –8800203912 – on which they can register their complaints related with air pollution, burning of garbage in open and flouting of norms causing air pollution. We will take prompt action against violators and impose penalty,” said Deep Chandar, additional CEO of Greater Noida authority.The Greater Noida authority has decided to clean a total length of 133.37 kms of road via mechanical sweeping, that include the 130 metre-wide road that connects Greater Noida West with Dadri road, and another that connects Greater Noida with Ghaziabad.“We imposed a total of ₹50,000 penalty on Thursday, ₹11 lakh penalty against two developers on Friday and ₹1 lakh penalty against violators on Saturday. Action against violators will continue,” said Chandar. Greater Noida on Sunday did not impose any penalty for violations.However, residents said the action is not adequate.“We spot so many violations daily on roads as well as construction sites, with construction material lying uncovered with sheets, though it is mandatory in order to control pollution. Also, the anti-smog guns hardly function. The authority should take stringent action,” said Vivek Raman president of Greater Noida West entrepreneur association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-teams-formed-to-check-pollution-at-construction-sites/story-VtAPhp6UwcGrbnLFwtAR8N.html
18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn bungled as Covid cases surged in September||As the Covid-19 pandemic surged in Chandigarh in September, the UT administration was not able to get in touch with those testing positive within 24 hours of reporting, which further delayed contact tracing.This along with many other issues was highlighted by a team of two experts deputed by the central government in early September to find gaps and assist the local administration in dealing with the pandemic. Last month saw a major surge in infection, with the record being set on September 13 (449 cases) while the highest number of active cases (3,171) was reported on September 16. Though the number of cases started declining in the last couple of weeks, the month accounted for 61% (7,266) of the cases reported between March 18 (first case) and September 30. Also, in comparison to 41 deaths in August, Chandigarh witnessed 106 deaths in September.The central team observed that initially in the zones where there were less number of cases or during the initial phases of the epidemic, the authorities were able to contact all positive cases in 24 hours. However, as the cases were surging, not all patients were being contacted within 24 hours of reporting, and this also resulted in delayed testing of their household contacts. Some positive patients even complained that the health department did not contact them and they didn’t even know whom to contact in case of any problem.The experts also found that asymptomatic household contacts were being tested the very next day (after exposure), resulting in negative results in many instances, and contacts were developing symptoms at a later date. Negative reports tend to give false reassurance to those tested, and mixing of these asymptomatic cases after the end of the quarantine period could also lead to spread of the disease, the team had observed. Testing issues at GMCH, PGIAlso, the testing capacity at the government’s tertiary level hospital was only 150 a day, which led to a huge backlog. “The RT-PCR testing capacity of Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, was only about 150 samples a day, which was hindering testing of household contacts. There was a huge backlog of testing of household contacts in the south zone, because of a large number of positive cases and limited testing capacity of GMCH,” the committee noted. Also, the non availability of rapid antigen testing at the PGIMER Emergency led to intermixing of positive and negative cases for a period of at least 10-12 hours, which is an average turnaround time for RT-PCR results, it was observed. The PGIMER has since started rapid antigen testing in the Emergency.Covid care facilities poorly managedWhen it comes to Covid care, the facilities are categorised into three levels. Level-1 is for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, Level 2 is for mild to moderately symptomatic cases, and Level 3 is for critical patients needing ICU or ventilator, including pregnant and aged patients.The expert committee found that the Level-2 centre at GMCH had cases that could be stepped down to Level 1 and cases in Level-3 centre at the civil hospital in Sector 48 could be managed at a Level-2 facility. “Covid hospital was being burdened with asymptomatic stable patients but requiring treatment for non-Covid problems, which can be easily handled at Level-2 centres,” the report further stated. It was also observed that Covid care centres maintained by the UT health department were better managed as compared to those maintained by GMCH. ‘Need for more such studies’The detailed report was procured under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by RK Garg, president of Second Innings Association. He said the two-member team was the only one that made on-the-spot study and was able to find out the details. “More such teams should be deployed once again to assess the prevailing situation, and to see if recommendations have been implemented and are working perfectly,” he said. UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “We have gone through all suggestions made by the central team, and all departments involved in Covid-19 management in Chandigarh are complying with them. Various indicators, such as recovery rate and fatality rate, have improved due to steps taken by the administration.”As reported recently, the doubling time of new Covid-19 cases in the city has improved to 130 days from 19 days in mid-September. A higher number suggests slowdown in spread of infection .However, cases per million in Chandigarh stand at 11,519, double the national average of 5,621. Other issuesDuplication of work as three different departments (SDM, MC and health) chased for the same information from patients.Though positive patients were being contacted, the negative reports were not being provided to people, leading to confusion.Active surveillance on daily basis not being carried out in containment zones. In some buffer zones, thermal scanners and sanitisers were not present at the entry and exit points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-bungled-as-covid-cases-surged-in-september/story-8BEo4EnTnujBF8uw9SQIJM.html
18-10-2020||City||Ludhiana MC mulling re-introduction of mechanical sweeping||For providing better sanitisation services, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) is mulling reintroducing mechanical sweeping in the city. The civic body is also planning to bring in IT reforms for providing online services to the residents. Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal held a meeting in this regard at MC Zone D office on Sunday. Officials of an IT company officials also gave a presentation to MC officers for upgrading the system and infrastructure. As per the information, MC provides 67 services to residents and many of those are being offered offline. Residents have to make rounds of the MC office for availing services such as TS1 certificates (NOC) and change of ownership of properties. Officials said that MC is also making efforts to revive the mechanical sweeping project in the city, which was put to halt in 2018 after objections were raised on the working of the company and payment of bills. The MC was spending ₹70 lakh per month on mechanical sweeping at that time and had spent around ₹16.5 crore in the past, which was a heavy financial burden on the fund-starved corporation. Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said, “We are working to provide better online services to the residents so that they need not visit MC offices for getting their work done. The IT infrastructure would be developed and more online services would be initiated. Also, we are trying to simplify the process to avail certain facilities.” MC team to visit Mohali to learn about mechanical sweepingMC commissioner Sabharwal said that a five-member committee of health branch officials has been formed which will visit Mohali to look at the mechanical sweeping project being taken up by the Mohali civic body. The learnings of the visit would be beneficial while planning the project for the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-mulling-re-introduction-of-mechanical-sweeping/story-OQ1P6BpdMnyOEjPAx7WHkJ.html

We are also in the process of making a list of repeat offenders and areas where the maximum number of such cases were reported. We will explore possibilities of imposing stringent sections on repeat offenders,” said KK Rao, commissioner of police. According to the police, over 900 cartons of illicit liquor were recovered last week during the drive. Meanwhile, a gang allegedly involved in fake labelling was also arrested on Saturday in Manesar which used to paste fake label of ‘for sale in CSD only’ on rum bottles after buying empty bottles from scrap dealers and sell them as ‘canteen liquor’, said the police. “On Sunday, our team arrested three men who had allegedly packed 520 cartons of IMFL stored in a godown in Surat Nagar phase 2 near Sector 5. They were using fake labels (of Army canteen) on the used bottles and were packing these bottles which are sold at higher prices outside,” said Sangwan. Nuh police have also intensified checking at the border areas. Narender Bijarnia, superintendent of police, Nuh, said that they have deployed teams at all the borders and are checking suspected vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahead-of-festive-season-gurugram-police-intensify-checking-drive-to-stop-liquor-smuggling/story-8TnNAyBZXi41FblNECnbfL.html

18-10-2020||Gurugram||MCG set to take control of 260 parks due to poor upkeep||Around 260 of the 483 parks maintained by residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) may soon be taken over by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG) ward committee, officials said on Sunday.In January, the MCG had formed a regulation and monitoring committee for supervising parks and community centres in Gurugram. The committee is responsible for issuing funds to the RWAs for the upkeep of parks. The committee, which is empowered to hand over the maintenance of parks to the MCG’s ward committee in cases of infighting, discrepancy or below-par maintenance, has drawn up a list of parks to be transferred to the ward committees. Each ward committee consists of the local councillor, experts, few MCG officials, residents and representatives of RWAs.Currently, there are 808 parks in the city, of which 483 are maintained by RWAs and 325 by the MCG. Earlier this month, 15 more parks were transferred by the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) to the MCG.“Wherever RWAs were found to be working to their optimum capacity, we have continued to retain the maintenance of parks with them and wherever this was not the case, or there were some internal issues within the functioning of RWAs, we have recommended transferring such parks to the MCG ward committee. The list has been compiled and shared with senior MCG officials for their perusal,” said Devender Bhadana, executive engineer, horticulture wing, MCG.According to a senior MCG official privy to the matter, a final decision on the matter would be taken next month, once air pollution levels in the city stabilise and the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures reduce.The maintenance of parks and community centres has remained a major point of contention between RWAs and MCG. On January 10, during an MCG meeting, all 35 MCG councillors unanimously approved the decision of taking back the maintenance of all parks and community centres, citing lack of upkeep, from RWAs both verbally and in writing.A week later, around 60 RWAs had submitted a memorandum to Gurugram member of Parliament Rao Inderjit Singh, protesting against the MCG’s decision. The matter became political, with several Haryana politicians also opposing the MCG’s decision on social media and calling for protests.Subsequently, MCG set up a regulation and monitoring committee to oversee the functioning of parks in the city, while the decision to take back all parks and community centres from RWAs was dismissed.There are 60 community centres in the city, of which 22 are maintained by RWAs and 38 by the MCG.This was not the first time that the MCG initiated such a move. Last August, councillors during a House meeting, citing lack of maintenance, had raised the issue of handing over all parks from RWAs to MCG’s ward committee.“The decision by the MCG to take back parks that are not well-maintained from the RWAs is a positive move as it will ensure that the standards and upkeep of parks remain at a high level. However, the MCG should consider introducing the practice of rewarding RWAs that maintain parks at the highest standard with monetary incentives as it will push more RWAs to increase the standard of their parks to even a higher level, similar to the system they have adopted for property tax targets,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council, an umbrella body of RWAs in Gurugram.In May 2017, seven RWAs were rewarded Rs 5 lakh each for ensuring that more than 80% of residents in the area paid their property taxes to the civic body. Under the same criteria, two RWAs were also rewarded with Rs 5 lakh each this September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-set-to-take-control-of-260-parks-due-to-poor-upkeep/story-81wvN9S9Zoeszqd7798RQJ.html
18-10-2020||Gurugram||Cops to check illegal sale of crackers in Gurugram||The police on Sunday launched a drive to check illegal sale of firecrackers, in view of the rising pollution level and the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to curb pollution during winter.The commissioner of police, in meetings with deputy commissioners of police, assistant commissioners of police and 40 station house officers (SHOs), asked them to take steps to ensure supply of green firecrackers to all licensed shops and encourage people to stick to the guidelines issued regarding bursting of crackers.The Supreme Court in 2018 had banned conventional firecrackers in Delhi-NCR due to rising pollution levels and had allowed only green firecrackers, which cause 30% less pollution, during allotted time slots for bursting crackers.So far, no licences have been issued by the district administration this year to traders for selling firecrackers.The SHOs have been asked to hold meetings with residents’ welfare associations in their areas, to ensure that residents do not burst firecrackers indiscriminately and also to keep a check on the illegal sale of firecrackers.The police have formed 20 teams for the purpose and are also undertaking checks at borders to ensure crackers are not being smuggled into the city. Police commissioner KK Rao said that nearly 1,500 police personnel have been deployed on the ground during the festive season, to ensure safe celebrations. “The SHOs have been asked to personally patrol their area concerned and be in touch with RWA members where the celebrations are taking place, and to ensure the women are safe and no snatching incident is reported. Any person found indulging in illegal activity, be it bursting crackers, smuggling liquor, gambling or loitering around in residential areas, will be booked,” Rao said.Personnel will also be deployed in plain clothes to keep a check on hooliganism and street crimes, the police said.“The crime teams have been instructed to keep a close watch on history sheeters who have been indulging in smuggling, snatching and gambling during this season. Also, they have been asked to inform women to be careful while moving out wearing heavy jewellery,” he said.At least 20 personnel from each police station, including the SHO, will patrol their areas and will send daily report to the Rao’s office, as per the plan. The police station numbers have been shared with RWAs to ensure a quick response.Rao said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, social gatherings will be limited and mask swill be mandatory. The police said they are waiting for the administration to issue guidelines in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-to-check-illegal-sale-of-crackers-in-gurugram/story-c3zCeShHgwC8nffNFzzeHP.html
18-10-2020||Gurugram||Air quality remains poor||Air quality in the city remained in the ‘poor’ category on Sunday, with Gurugram recording an air quality index (AQI) of 273, which was slightly better than the 280 reported on Saturday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin.The average concentration of ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in the air stood at 266 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3), while a maximum of 327ug/m3 was recorded by the air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan. The air quality is expected to deteriorate further due to an expected increase in farm stubble fires.The Graded Response Action Plan, to check the rising air pollution, is already in place, as directed by the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA), since October 15.Air quality in neighbouring Faridabad stood at 277, while the AQI in Dharuhera was 287, as per CPCB data.An AQI between 401 and 500 is considered ‘severe’, between 301 and 400 as ‘very poor’, between 201 and 300 as ‘poor’, between 101 and 200 as ‘moderate’, between 51 and 100 as ‘satisfactory’ and between 0 and 50 as ‘good’.A forecast on Sunday by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) stated that synergized stubble burning fire counts from Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring regions has increased, with 1,230 incidents reported. “Though fire emission has increased and transport-level wind direction is also favourable, an increase in transport level, wind speed, as well as local Delhi surface winds, are likely to maintain the stubble contribution in Delhi PM2.5 around the same level,” it said.Pollution department officials said that weather conditions and a check on farm fires over the next week will play a key role in the quality of air. “If the weather is good and wind speed is high, the AQI will improve but the farm fires also play a role in wind quality and these need to be curbed. Locally, steps are being taken to check pollution by various agencies,” Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-remains-poor/story-Coyob5Te2k9zjfbOss28cK.html

18-10-2020||Bhopal||Kamal Nath calls female minister ‘item’, CM Chouhan announces ‘maun vrat’ in protest||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday announced a ‘maun vrat (observing silence)’ in protest against former chief minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath who referred to a female minister as an “item” at an election rally in Gwalior-Chambal region. Chauhan said his predecessor committed a “crime”. “Ex-chief minister committed a crime. Incumbent CM will repent for it,” said the chief minister announcing his ‘maun vrat’ protest at an election meeting held at Vrindavan Vatika in Gwalior on Sunday. It all began at an election meeting held by the Congress in Dabra legislative assembly constituency, one of 16 legislative assembly constituencies in Gwalior-Chambal region, which was addressed by former chief minister Kamal Nath. Nath was drawing a comparison between Congress candidate Suresh Raje and BJP candidate and woman and child development minister in Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet Imrati Devi. Nath said, “Suresh Raje is a simple man. He is down to earth. He is not like the person. What is the name of the person?” As crowd responded to his question citing Imrati Devi’s name, Kamal Nath called her an “item”, saying, “Why should I name her? You know her better than I know… Ye kya item hai...” Also read: Covid-19 community transmission occurred in some districts - Harsh VardhanA delegation of the state BJP, led by its general secretary Kavita Patidar, lodged a complaint with the state chief electoral officer and demanded action against Nath. The chief minister, in his election meeting in Gwalior, said, “My brothers and sisters! I can tolerate any insult to me but Kamal Nath! You have done a great injustice. You have insulted a daughter of Gwalior district. Imrati Devi was born to a poor family. She worked as a labourer and then became an MLA and minister. She was born as a member of the scheduled caste but no one has the right to insult a daughter of the poor.” Chouhan said, “Kamal Nath seth (rich trader) says Imrati Devi is an item. He should feel ashamed. Will someone be allowed to play with the dignity of a woman and daughter? Today is the second day of Navratra (during which) we worship mother Goddess... This is our land where it is said women are honoured, divinity blossoms here…This is India where when Draupadi was insulted it ensued Mahabharat and a clan was annihilated (ek vansh ka vinash ho gaya).” Chouhan said, “insult to sister Imrati is an insult to every sister of Madhya Pradesh. People of the state in general and BJP workers, in particular, will not tolerate this.” State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Kamal Nath ji didn’t mention name of Imrati Devi while citing ‘Ye kya item hai’. He clearly said he would not name anyone. But BJP, which doesn’t have any real issue to raise during the by-polls, misinterpreted the word ‘item’ for its political gains.” Saluja said, “The fact is that the BJP is insulting the womenfolk by associating the word ‘item’ with Imrati Devi and it should apologize to people for its actions. Congress will lodge a complaint with the Election Commission on this.”Imrati Devi, who held the same portfolio in the Kamal Nath government, resigned from the state assembly on March 10 this year along with 21 other Congress MLAs including five ministers which led to fall of the Congress government. All 22 ex-MLAs joined the BJP and are now fielded as BJP candidates in state legislative assembly by-polls which will be held in 28 assembly constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/kamal-nath-calls-female-minister-item-cm-chouhan-announces-maun-vrat-in-protest/story-YjWSJP6QqXCSIzZH4o8dNO.html

18-10-2020||Chandigarh||HRTC conductor exam: Question paper leaked by candidate, police launch probe||The Shimla police on Sunday launched a probe after the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) conductor recruitment paper was leaked on social media soon after the exam began.A candidate at an exam centre at APG University, Shimla, allegedly sneaked in a smartphone. He clicked the photo of a few pages of the question paper and circulated it on WhatsApp. The same also surfaced on other social media sites within minutes.The paper was leaked 20-30 minutes after the exam began at 10am.The accused has been arrested and is being interrogated by the Shimla police.The exam was being conducted by Himachal Pradesh Staff Selection Commission (HPSSC), Hamirpur. More than 60,000 candidates, vying for 568 posts of conductors in the state road transport corporation, appeared in the exam at 304 centres across the state.HPSSC chairman said he has ordered to lodge an FIR into the incident. He said the decision to cancel the exam or not will be taken later.Sources revealed that the HPSSC was also probing similar cases of paper leak from some centres in Solan and Kangra.The incident has raised questions over the security arrangements being made by the HPSSC at exam centres.

However, now when they (BJP) are in power, first there were irregularities in patwari recruitment exam and now the conductor exam has also come under the scanner,” he said adding that this was unnecessary harassment of jobless youth.CM calls for strict actionTaking cognisance of the paper leak, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said those responsible would not be spared and strong legal action would be taken against them. He added that the government would ensure complete transparency in the written examinations so that such incidents do not occur in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hrtc-conductor-exam-question-paper-leaked-by-candidate-police-launch-probe/story-iIaW04WGThN5AXeHl1YgVM.html
18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Bickering in Himachal Congress ahead of panchayat polls||With elections to Panchayati Raj institutions and civic bodies round the corner, fault lines in the Himachal Congress have become apparent yet again with former state part chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu expressing dissatisfaction with the working of the state Congress committee and lobbying for a change in leadership.Sukhu on Sunday spearheaded a closed-door meeting with a group of former legislators from Shimla district, which has eight assembly segments, to chalk out future. Former Jubbal-Kotkhai legislator Rohit Thakur, former Chopal legislator Subash Manglait , former Shimla legislator Harbhajjan Singh Bhajji, former Kasumpti legislator Sohan Lal and Deepak Rathore, who unsuccessfully contested the election from Theog during the last assembly elections, attended the meeting. Sukhu’s supporters had held similar meetings in Mandi and Kangra last month.The incumbent Himachal Congress chief, Kuldeep Rathore, had replaced Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last year. Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh had demanded Sukhu’s replacement. The Naduan MLA is the longest-serving state Congress president.Legislators and leaders loyal to Sukhu are keen that high command either appoint him as state party chief or leader of opposition in the state assembly. A Congress leader in attendance, requesting anonymity, said, “We discussed the way forward for reviving the Congress. We need strong leadership in the state to take the party forward. The party has suffered a humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and has lost two bypolls.”Rathore, 55, who hails from Kumarsain in Theog, was once considered close to Congress Rajya Sabha member Anand Sharma. However, upon taking reins of the party he aligned himself with former chief minister Virbhadra Singh.The clamour for change in the state Congress leadership had become shriller after the saffron party made a clean sweep in all four Lok Sabha seats - Shimla, Kangra, Mandi and Hamirpur. The BJP had won with a record margin of around 3 lakh votes in each seat and had secured around 72% of the polled vote share.Rathore underplays meetingsRathore, however, underplayed the meetings held by his rival group. “Party leaders are free to hold meetings. This is not tantamount to indiscipline,” he said.Congress leaders had voiced their dissent when newly appointed party in-charge for Himachal affairs Rajiv Shukla had made his maiden visit to the party headquarters, Rajiv Bhawan, on September 25. Shukla has been gathering feedback from leaders and workers. Congress senior leader Asha Kumari, who was formerly in-charge of party affairs in Punjab and five-time legislator Harshwardhan Chauhan are other contenders for the post of state Congress chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bickering-in-himachal-congress-ahead-of-panchayat-polls/story-26igSj4OacCSZGup4lNSjP.html

The development came hours after the Special Task Force (STF) arrested Dheerendra Singh from Lucknow.Surendra Singh, who was on his way to Lucknow on Sunday, said over the phone, “Yes, I have been called to Lucknow. The party’s state unit chief will ask about the incident that took place at Durjanpur village (in Ballia). I will present a true account of the incident. I will tell him about a series of incidents which led to the chaos during the meeting and then the unfortunate incident.”On Thursday, Dheerendra Pratap Singh, who calls himself a BJP worker, allegedly shot a 46-year-old man dead in an open meeting in the presence of officials after a dispute over allocation of two fair price shops in Durjanpur village of Ballia.On Friday, the BJP MLA, who represents Bairia assembly constituency in Ballia, had said that Dheerendra had fired in self-defence. He had claimed that had Dheerendra not opened fire, dozens of women of his family would have been killed in the incident.Also read: ‘B-team of BJP, vote splitters’ - Tejashwi’s veiled attack on LJPSurendra Singh on Saturday visited Revati police station in Ballia and demanded that an FIR should be registered based on the application moved by Dheerendra Singh’s female relatives who, he alleged, sustained injuries in stone-pelting during the Thursday incident. He also took them to the district hospital and got their medical examination done.Surendra Singh on Sunday said, “I am carrying with me the medical reports of five women (Dheerendra’s relatives) who were injured in the stone-pelting incident. I will present it there (before the state unit BJP chief).”He claimed that the true account of the incident was not being presented by the media. “If the media presented a true account, the women would get justice,” he said.When he was asked for his comment on Singh’s arrest, the phone got disconnected. An aide of the state BJP chief too confirmed that Surendra Singh had been called by the party.“Yes, he has been called for his outspoken remarks. The party isn’t happy with him,” the aide said. “Had he not fired from his licensed firearm, he and his family would have been lynched,” the MLA said.BJP party leaders admitted MLA Surendra Singh to have a habit of passing controversial remarks. It isn’t clear if the party leadership was contemplating any action against him.“Since the party expressed displeasure over his remarks, the MLA has been singing a different tune. He has since said that the law would take its course in case of those who violate it,” a party leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ballia-shooting-case-bjp-mla-says-he-ll-present-true-account-of-incident-before-party-leadership/story-aQmvhTFfgvZSk36HM2UEDN.html

18-10-2020||City||Go all out to negate effect of new farm laws, Cong MLAs tell CM at CLP meet||Chandigarh Punjab Congress MLAs on Sunday asked the Capt Amarinder Singh government to take all possible steps, including a Bill, to negate the effect of the three agriculture marketing laws enacted by the Centre on farmers in the state. The MLAs were unanimous in their view at the meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh here. They asked the chief minister to reject the three anti-farmer legislations and bring a new Bill or make suitable amendments in the existing laws to provide for strict action, including imprisonment, against those who purchase wheat or paddy below the minimum support price (MSP). They also said the CM should leave no stone unturned to invalidate the contentious agriculture marketing laws even if it means running the risk of dismissal of the state government by the Centre. The MLAs who spoke included Barindermeet Singh Pahra, Pargat Singh, Angad Saini, Darshan Singh Brar, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Fatehjang Singh Bajwa. Amarinder, who addressed the CLP, said the state government will fight this till the Supreme Court. “The views of the MLAs will be taken into account while finalising the strategy to battle the farm laws, in consultation with legal and independent experts, including former Union minister P Chidambaram and other lawyers,” he said, refusing to go into the specifics of the legislative action planned by his government. Advocate general Atul Nanda was also present. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar later said the MLAs spoke in once voice on the need to stand with the farmers and the chief minister was also clear that he will not let any harm come to farmers irrespective of the cost. “The state government will take care of farmers and no cost is too high,” he said. At the CLP meeting, several MLAs also stressed the need for aggressively countering the false propaganda being spread by the opposition parties, particularly the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), against the state government and party on the Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 2017, and other related issues. The party MLAs suggested that the role of Akalis in the enactment of the Centre’s three new laws and the Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013, should be exposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/go-all-out-to-negate-effect-of-new-farm-laws-cong-mlas-tell-cm-at-clp-meet/story-rUw4T4Hqa6FN4XziqmO13H.html
18-10-2020||City||Illegal paddy inflow: 13 FIRs registered, over 822 tonnes of paddy confiscated||Patiala Patiala police have registered at least 13 FIRs (first information reports) and confiscated 822.5 tonnes of paddy that was being brought in illegally from other states into Punjab in last two days. Police have also arrested 20 people, mainly drivers, besides impounding 32 goods carriers. Traders purchase paddy at lower rates outside Punjab and then sell it at much higher price in grain markets across Punjab, causing losses to the exchequer.Patiala’s senior superintendent of police Vikramjeet Singh Duggal said the police have launched a widespread drive to check the malpractice. “It has been learnt that goods carriers loaded with paddy from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are entering Punjab from different interstate routes,” the SSP said. He further police in coordination with the district administration identified various spots across Punjab-Haryana border such as Shambu, Pehowa, Balbera, Cheeka, Dhabbi Gujjran and Patran in Patiala district and put up special check post at these places. “Flying squads consisting of police, revenue and mandi officials were formed to check the illegal practice,” he said. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the paddy is first purchased at lower rates in other states and then transported to Punjab for sale at a higher price. This practice causes undue burden on the state exchequer on one hand, while causing great deal of indirect loss to the Punjab farmers on the other,” the SSP said. Ghanour’s deputy superintendent of police Jaswinder Singh Tiwana said most of the heavy vehicles carrying paddy were coming from UP and Bihar.“The traders purchase paddy at ₹900-1,100 per quintal from these states and sell it at ₹1,860 per quintal in Punjab,” he said. The cases have been registered under Section 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. “We have initiated the process of identifying the traders,” the DSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-paddy-inflow-13-firs-registered-over-822-tonnes-of-paddy-confiscated/story-xZjTu3VnT8XI4JJTNjhwMJ.html
18-10-2020||Election:||‘B-team of BJP, vote splitters’: Tejashwi Yadav’s veiled attack on LJP||With the BJP asserting that the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) is not part of the NDA in Bihar, leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday took an indirect dig on the party describing it as a “B-team” of the BJP and a “vote splitter”. Without taking name of the LJP or its president Chirag Paswan, Tejashwi asked the voters at his rallies in Mokama, Sheikhpura, Jamui and Nawada to be cautious of the “B-team” of the BJP. “You all should be cautious of the B team of the BJP. They are vote katwas (vote splitters),” Tejashwi said, indirectly referring to the LJP. He also took a jibe at chief minister Nitish Kumar for the latter’s repeated attacks on the RJD by portraying its rule for 15 years as a “misrule” and asserting how the “lantern age” (lantern is RJD’s poll symbol) in Bihar was passe now. He called it an attempt by the JD(U) strongman to keep his election narrative focused on his development model of 15 years versus the 15 years of the RJD government. Also read: Eye on 2022 assembly polls, SP announces Uttarakhand executive body“Chief minister Nitish Kumar says the lantern age is over. I want to tell him that the age of the arrow (poll symbol of the JD(U)) is also over. The missiles have now replaced arrows. This is an age of missiles,” he said, making an oblique inference as to how people were also tired of CM Kumar’s government for its inaction and wanted a replacement to step into modernity. In many meetings in recent past, Tejashwi had said that CM Kumar had become tired and cannot handle the state. Tejashwi cited how the state was ridden with unemployment, poverty and migration. Earlier in the day, the 31-year-old Yadav scion started his campaign with his first meeting at Mokama where he canvassed for party’s nominee and strongman Anant Singh who is incarcerated in various criminal cases at Beur jail in Patna. He is charged under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) after recovery of sophisticated arms and ammunition last year. Reports said Tejashwi did not name Singh in his election speech, instead restricted his speech more on making promises. “People should give us an opportunity to serve for the next five years. I promise to give employment to 10 lakh youths in government with my first signature on coming to power. We’ll also implement same pay, same work practice for contractual teachers, ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers,” he said. Also read: Bihar candidates’ affidavits show some aged by a decade since last electionTejashwi also promised that the old pension for beneficiaries would be raised from Rs 400 to Rs 1,000 if his party assumes power. Mokama constituency is dominated by the sitting MLA Singh’s caste men Bhumihars as well as Yadavs and other OBCs. Singh is a four-time MLA from Mokama and contesting for the fifth time from his traditional seat. Singh’s wife, Neelam Devi, who had unsuccessfully contested the last parliamentary polls from Munger seat, and also filed her nomination papers from Mokama seat this time before withdrawing it, was present at the dais with Tejashwi, reports said. Singh’s candidature as an RJD nominee has given ammunition to the ruling JD(U) and the BJP to accuse the principal opposition party of promoting don-turned politicians. Besides, the RJD’s chief ministerial candidate also slammed the chief minister, accusing him of betraying people’s mandate in 2015 by realigning with the BJP in 2017. “Our paltu chacha (turncoat) not only betrayed the mandate of the Grand Alliance government but also cheated the people of the state,” he said at the rallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/b-team-of-bjp-vote-splitters-tejashwi-yadav-s-veiled-attack-on-ljp/story-QfULcG2Hmwy83A0NyZhQKN.html

18-10-2020||Mumbai||Parents rely on school recommendations for ed-tech solutions: Survey||Close to 42% parents trust education apps recommended by schools and teachers states a nationwide survey conducted with participation of over 10,000 parents.The survey was conducted by Flowbook, an online education platform to understand online education, its reach and benefits to students and parents post-Covid-19.Interestingly, 54% parents said they were aware and were clear on what to expect from an online or ed-tech company before using its services. Another 18% parents looked for accessibility and convenience. The 44% make their decision based on the customer experience and the home environment so that their children can easily adapt to the app. In western India which consists of Maharashtra, 68% parents said that they were aware of how to use technology for educational purposes. In rural India, however, the awareness about online learning existed in only 34% parents surveyed. While asked about the amount of money that parents were willing to spend on the education of their children, up to 64% parents said that they would spend about 25% of their income. Many parents who could not use ed-tech platforms (38%) said that the higher costs involved in subscribing to them are a key reason. Arjun Reddy, chief executive officer of Flowbook said, “The survey has helped us to understand that India is adopting the online model of studies and the lockdown has somehow benefited to experience the same. Heavily priced models make a business sustainable in the short run. But what really helps the majority of Indian parents is a monthly model where parents retain the choice to pay or discontinue if they don’t find value in what is being offered to their children.”Parents said that with the risks around the physical reopening of schools, many were still preferring online study platforms, along with their regular online school. “Children cannot go for coaching and thus need additional guidance with respect to studies. Online platforms allow them to choose their subjects and get help,” said Ritu Saha, a Malad-based parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-rely-on-school-recommendations-for-ed-tech-solutions-survey/story-Yh7rMtJv4JQ9i01CV2z5GM.html

After reviewing damage to crops and interacting with farmers, Pawar said that the Centre will need to offer financial assistance as the loss is huge and the state government has limitations. Heavy rains and floods have claimed at least 48 lives in Maharashtra’s Pune, Aurangabad and Konkan divisions last week while crops on lakhs of hectares have been damaged extensively, leading to farmers demanding immediate relief. After taking stock of the situation on the ground on the first day of his tour, Pawar said that the rain has damaged agriculture on large scale and its impact will be felt long term. “While the state government will offer it help, it has limitations. I have come across Prime Minister Modi’s statement of all possible assurance to Maharashtra. Therefore, I have decided to meet the Prime Minister in Delhi within the next 10 days along with MPs,” Pawar told farmers. “Standing crops have been destroyed and the land has been damaged. Everything needs to be rectified. The state government cannot do it alone. We will speak to the Centre as well regarding a long-term package and immediate assistance,” said Pawar, whose party is a coalition partner in the Thackeray-led state government.The BJP, however, targeted Pawar for passing on the responsibility to the Centre. “If the Centre takes all the responsibility, then, what are you doing,” asked BJP state unit chief Chandrakantdada Patil while demanding the state government to come forward and assist farmers.PM Narendra Modi has already assured help after he interacted with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. “Spoke to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray Ji regarding the situation arising due to flooding and heavy rain in parts of the state. My thoughts and prayers are with those sisters and brothers affected. Reiterated Centre’s support in the ongoing rescue and relief work,” Modi had tweeted on Friday. Besides Pawar, the chief minister will also be visiting flood affected areas of Solapur and Osmanabad on Monday and Tuesday. The announcement of Thackeray’s visit comes amid severe criticism from opposition that CM has not been stepping out to take stock of situation on the ground. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis too will be on tour of flood-affected areas, starting with Baramati in Pune district, Solapur and Osmanabad. In Western Maharashtra alone, 29 people have lost lives while 16 persons died in central Maharashtra’s Aurangabad division and three in coastal Konkan. Farmers’ leader and president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana Raju Shetti offered immediate assistance to people as the rain impacted crop which was ready for harvest. Meanwhile, farmers in Nanded stopped a convoy of minister for rehabilitation Vijay Wadettiwar demanding immediate assistance. “The state government wants to help farmers and therefore, the administration has been asked to carry out panchanamas. Once it is done, we will ask Centre also to help,” said Wadettiwar as angry farmers shouted slogan against the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/agri-loss-unprecedented-says-pawar-as-he-promises-to-meet-pm-for-centre-s-help-for-rain-affected-areas/story-2UxlMiwvFbN1fs9cun0WmM.html

18-10-2020||Jaipur||No Kota Dussehra fair this year, 2nd cancellation in 126 years||The grandeur of yearly month-long famous Kota Dussehra fair will not be seen this year along with the Dussehra fairs in Kullu and Mysore due to restrictions in place to contain Covid-19. The cancellation of the Kota Dussehra mela is only the second such instance in its 126 year history, said experts.Kota Dussehra fair is not only the biggest Dussehra fair of Rajasthan but is also in the league of famous Dussehra fairs in the country. The main cultural event of the coaching city witnesses a footfall of over 50,000 to 1 lakh visitors every day during the fair at the Dussehra ‘mela’ ground in Kota city.Commissioner of the Kota municipal corporation (KMC), south, Kirti Rathore said the fair had been cancelled due to the restrictions placed on holding any kind of large religious congregation and government events in order to maintain social distancing norms to prevent further spread of Covid-19. She, however, added that some traditional Dussehra rituals will be performed symbolically, but there will be no month-long fair like every year.The effigies of Ravana and his son Meghnad and brother Kumbhkaran will be around 11 feet high during the effigy burning event, which will be attended by a limited number of officials and stakeholders, said Rathore. She added that the procession of Lord Lakshminarayanji will also be taken in a vehicle by a few people instead of a grand procession.Kota Dussehra fair begins during Navratri and reaches its peak on Dussehra day when over a lakh people in number witness the burning of tall effigies of the mythological demon king.Historian and also a member of Indian trust for art and cultural heritage, Firoz Ahmad says “Kota Dussehra fair was also cancelled in the year 1971 during Indo-Pak war due to a blackout in Kota and if the fair is cancelled this year also then it would be the second such instance in its history”.The cancellation of the fair will be a disappointment for the locals and traders from across the country as well for those who put up their shops during the fair.“Nearly 1500 traders from across the country put up their stalls in the fair and trade worth Rs 150 crore takes place during the fair but such trade activity will not be held this year due to Kota Dussehra fair cancellation,” said Mahesh Gautam Lalli, ex corporator and also former member of Kota Dussehra mela committee. He claimed that the fair witnesses a footfall of over 16 lakh visitors every year.Also Read: Maha Yagya at Vaishno Devi shrine as Navratri begins, Vedic hymns fill airCommissioner Kirti Rathore explains a few reasons that make Kota Dussehra fair a special attraction.“While most Dussehra events last for maximum a week to 10 days, Kota Dussehra fair is probably the only one which runs for nearly a month, during which a spree of cultural programs is held and famous artists perform.”“The height of Ravana’s statue and that of his family members also remains the highest in the state, with the Ravana statue being as high as 100 feet,” she said.Firoz Ahmad says that Kota Dussehra fair started in 1893 in the reign of ex-ruler of Kota, Maharao Ummed Singh on the existing Kota Dussehra mela ground and it is among the rare Dussehra fairs left in the country in which scions of erstwhile royal family participates.“A colorful royal procession of Lord Lakshminarayan comprising of horse, camel carts, music bands, artists and folk artists and led by the scion of ex-Kota royal family in an open jeep is carried out from Kota Garh Palace to the Kota Dussehra fair ground,” Ahmad said.Also Read: DDMA allows Durga Puja, Ramlila with Covid riders The fair is so popular and deeply embedded in the culture of Kota that the former state government had given the Kota Dussehra mela grounds a facelift with an expenditure of Rs 70 crore, 3 years ago, to develop it on the lines of Pragati maidan in Delhi.Earlier, there used to be an open undeveloped stretch of land at the Kota Dussehra mela grounds, which now has been transformed into an elegant campus after construction of heritage boundary wall, shops, cemented grounds, roads and theaters, said Lalli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/no-kota-dussehra-fair-this-year-2nd-cancellation-in-126-years/story-odTCo8hIBukpn2fSUcqWOI.html

Extra caution necessary during festivities It is being recorded by authorities that during the Ganeshotsav and post the festival, Covid-19 cases increased. One of my closest friends lost his family member due to the virus. Against this background, we have decided to celebrate festivals at home itself. We are not even going to buy food items from outside, but will prepare the delicacies at home. To avoid the eleventh-hour rush, we have decided to do online shopping. We have even appealed to our extended family to avoid home visits during this Diwali. Vivek Patil Avoid visiting hometowns, villages Though Diwali is auspicious and one of the major festivals, I think people should avoid meeting each other during the festival this year. It is a tradition that people go to their native villages and towns during festivals. But this year, it should be avoided. The Covid-19 virus spread is mainly in urban areas like Mumbai, Pune and other cities. If people visited their native places, it would help to spread viruses in rural areas. We should strictly follow the prevention guidelines given by local and central authorities. Smita Bhatane Do early shopping to avoid virus spread The government is taking adequate steps and giving instructions to be followed during festivals. I think it is true and we experienced it during the Ganesh festival. People should keep festival celebrations low key. To avoid the rush, people should engage in early shopping to avoid the typical rush during the last week of the festival. We have strictly decided not to visit relatives and will do video chat with them during the festival. Vinay Kulkarni Mask usage, a necessity Each year we used to go to West Bengal to celebrate the Diwali festival with relatives. But this year, we are planning to drop the plan. We might go outstation around Pune for a day, but will prefer to do one day return and avoid contact with anybody else. I think it is necessary to wear a mask, but many people on streets are seen ignoring this important prevention. In some places, people have masks but they put it on their chin instead of covering their nose and mouth. I strictly instruct these people, mainly vendors, to wear masks properly. Rachna Gupta Avoid unnecessary travel Wearing a mask and sanitising hands regularly is a key for keeping Covid-19 infection away. If hundreds of people used a mask and avoided travelling unnecessarily, it would help to get control the virus spread. Diwali is an annual festival, but the coronavirus pandemic is not a yearly affair. People just need to tone down the festivities and avoid unnecessary travel during vacation time. Ranjit Nair Diwali 2020 at home All our relatives have decided to not visit each other this year. We will celebrate Diwali at home only and make delicious dishes. Due to commercialisation, from last many years, we used to purchase sweets from outside. This year is a good time to prepare our traditional menus during Diwali. We have decided not to go outside for shopping. As it is, I and my husband both are engaged in work from home. We haven’t used office wear or other clothes for the last few months which are lying idle in cupboard. Geeta Kumar No Diwali celebrations in society Every Diwali, we use to burst crackers and build a play fort in our society. Considering the Covid-19 situation, I convinced my kids not to play with any other children in the parking lot. Even other families from our residential society have decided to not arrange any common Diwali function.

To ensure safe treatment, the civic body has reserved 40 beds for these patients as more might come following the contact tracing process.Dr Shreyas Kapale, medical officer, jumbo facility at College of Engineering, Pune (COEP), said, “The entire block has been reserved for leprosy patients who have tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection.”“These patients are ‘healed’ so they are not infectious. They have deformities as their fingers and toes are missing which makes it difficult to take saturation levels like in case of a normal patient using a pulse oximeter. So, we have to correlate the heart rate, consciousness level and respiration rate factors,” he said.The 21 patients were found during a contact tracing programme at the Dr Bandorawalla Government Leprosy Hospital which is also a rehabilitation centre for leprosy patients.A senior official requesting anonymity said, “Initially we had four patients who could not find a hospital bed due to their deformities. After being denied admission, the patients were admitted at the jumbo facility following the intervention from additional commissioner. After the four patients were admitted, we traced contacts and found more patients who might have come in contact at the rehabilitation centre.”About 128 leprosy patients were screened during the contact tracing process, of which 17 more patients were found positive.Dr Kapale said that the medication for leprosy and Covid-19 do not interfere in the treatment process. The staff for the block is different and they do not mingle with the other employees.Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We will provide all required Covid-19 treatment for people suffering from leprosy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/21-leprosy-patients-undergo-covid-19-treatment-at-reserved-facility-at-jumbo-centre-in-pune/story-tjTcA7xoZlGWCuRIDzaGRN.html
18-10-2020||Election:||BJP following ‘coalition dharma’ by attacking me despite ‘anger’ against Nitish: Chirag Paswan||Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan on Sunday downplayed the BJP’s recent attacks on him, claiming that it was only following the “coalition dharma” as an ally of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.“I do not need to exhibit my relations with the prime minister. From the time when my father was in the hospital to his last rites, I can never forget what he (PM) has done for me,” Paswan said in a series of tweets in Hindi.With the BJP working overtime to dispel the impression of having any tacit understanding with the LJP, Paswan claimed that Kumar has been trying to create distance between the saffron party and him.He said the thrust of Kumar’s campaign has been on showing a distance between Modi and him.Paswan said the chief minister, also the JD(U) president, should be thankful to his ally for following the coalition dharma by giving him a “certificate” every day that it has no links with the LJP president despite “so much anger” against Kumar.“I do not want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be in any dilemma due to me. He should follow his coalition dharma. He can say anything against me without any inhibition to satisfy Chief Minister Nitish Kumar,” he said.He added that he is committed to Modi’s mantra of development.Modi is set to address a number of poll rallies with Kumar and other coalition leaders in the coming days in Bihar.The LJP’s decision to fight the Bihar polls independently after walking out of the NDA, which includes the BJP and the JD(U), has muddied the waters ahead of the upcoming assembly polls.Paswan has been making determined efforts to target the JD(U) by putting up candidates against it, while his party is not contesting on seats where the BJP is in the fray.The BJP has in the last few days accused Paswan of trying to spread confusion by harping on his claimed proximity to its senior leaders and reiterated that Kumar will become the state’s chief minister again if their alliance gets the mandate.On the other hand, Paswan has been claiming that an alliance of the BJP and the LJP will come to power after the polls.The Bihar Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in three phases on October 28, November 3 and November 7. The counting of votes will take place on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bjp-following-coalition-dharma-by-attacking-me-despite-anger-against-nitish-chirag-paswan/story-iwMjJQhSjfHRaociHcZwYM.html

We are getting hardly 30% of the business, but this will eventually improve with time,” said Sherry Bhatia, President, HRAWI.The Maharashtra government allowed hotels and restaurants to reopen from October 5 after a gap of close to seven months. However, it restricted operation at 33 % capacity for Mumbai eateries and hotels and 50% for such businesses across the state in order to enforce social distancing norms deemed necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection.“Since travelling is restricted, we have lost a big clientele in this bargain. In addition, since we are operating within 33-50% of total capacity, this is also impacting our business,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, director, Pritam Hotels.Also Read: Could have exercised restraint in his words’: Amit Shah on Maharashtra guv Koshyari’s letter to ThackerayThere are four lakh hotels and restaurants in Maharashtra, of which, barely 30% have resumed operation.

Many will open gradually as the situation unfolds itself,” said Shetty.Savio D’sa, a consultant in the hospitality industry says almost all the hotels and restaurants are running into losses. “This situation is better than before as some income is being generated unlike in the lockdown period, where there was absolutely no income,” said D’sa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-30-business-for-maharashtra-hotels-and-restaurants-in-slow-turnaround/story-QvGqLMr5lVtiInM9eUyDaK.html

18-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi wakes up to hazy skies, air quality remains ‘poor’||Delhi’s air quality continued to be in the ‘poor’ category on Sunday, with the air quality index settling at 276 at 7am, according to government data. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that the hourly average air quality index of Delhi at 7am was 276 on Sunday. On Saturday evening, the overall air quality index of the city was 287, also in the ‘poor’ category. Air quality The situation is likely to be similar on Sunday. “The wind direction was north-westerly on Saturday and will continue to remain so for the next couple of days. Stubble fires will impact Delhi’s air,” said Vijay Soni, scientist at India Meteorology Department (air quality management division).Air quality in land-locked Delhi-National Capital Region deteriorates rapidly every year with the onset of winter weather conditions, vehicular emissions, and stubble burning of crops from neighbouring states such as Haryana, UP and Punjab. Coupled with low wind speed, pollutants are not dispersed easily, blanketing the region in toxic smog and hazeData shows that action against stubble fires has not been as widespread this year, as compared to previous years. Far fewer subsidised straw management machines have reached farmers in Punjab and Haryana this year compared to the past two years -- potentially exacerbating the worsening air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-wakes-up-to-hazy-sky-air-quality-remains-poor/story-XeEPqd6jnrVjdz0zZfsSLM.html

To maintain a follow-up, we have decided to open the state’s first post-Covid care centre at the largest tertiary health care,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.“Besides consultation and treatment, the health experts will further investigate the adverse effect of Covid-19 in the patients, especially those with co-morbid conditions such as heart disease, kidney failure and diabetes. If required, we will open more such centres in Punjab,” Dr Bhaskar added.Amritsar GMCH medical superintendent Dr JP Attri said, “It was observed that the patients, who got chest infection during Covid-19 infection got lung fibrosis post- recovery. Besides, many patients face social stigma after getting discharged from hospital and it affects their mental health or causes trauma or depression in them.”“Patients from at least six districts of Punjab seek treatment at GMCH Amritsar. It was observed at over 25% of seriously ill Covid-19 patients, who were admitted at level-3 stage at the hospital, got complications and needed immediate one or other kind of post-Covid treatment. To tackle such complications, we have roped in doctors from the departments of medicine, psychiatry and chest and tuberculosis for the specialised centre, which will be open on all working days. The centre will provide all types of medical tests, including ECG, X-ray, ultrasound, etc,” Dr Attri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-first-post-covid-care-centre-to-come-up-at-gmc-amritsar/story-K8wFEFzcN4UdQ3B0jPAuVM.html
18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab BJP general secretary Malwinder Kang resigns in protest against Centre’s new agriculture laws||The Punjab Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit’s general secretary and a prominent Sikh face in its state core committee, Malvinder Singh Kang, on Saturday resigned from the primary membership of the party in protest against the Central government’s recently enacted agriculture laws. A two-time student council president of Panjab University, Chandigarh, from the Panjab University Students Union (PUSU), Kang said he was feeling suffocated after enactment of the farm laws and repeatedly raised the issue before the party leadership, but to no avail. A right-hand man of state BJP president Ashwani Sharma, Kang stunned the party with his exit as he was in touch with the state leaders throughout the day before announcing his resignation around 5pm on a news channel. His exit is being considered as a big setback for the BJP in Punjab and is likely to further weaken the party’s position in the perception game on the agriculture laws. The BJP leadership had been maintaining that those agitating against the laws were misguided by the political parties. Kang is likely to join the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the coming days and is learnt to have held a meeting with the top party leaders. “The only logic the Punjab BJP leaders have is whatever Narendra Modi does is good for the state. I kept on telling that people of Punjab and Haryana were on the streets against these laws and the party should talk to them. I even raised the issue in a meeting chaired by RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya a few days back, but nobody paid heed,” Kang told HT. ‘I cannot be a bhakt’ Kang claimed that no state BJP leader, including state BJP chief, has the guts to speak at national level and neither they have their own plan for the state. “The Punjab leaders need to understand that Punjabiat comes first. In one of the party’s core committee meetings, when I questioned these laws, Tarun Chugh (now national general secretary) snubbed me saying we should not speak Pakistan’s language,” said Kang. A two-time PU senator, Kang hails from Madhya Pradesh and joined student politics Chandigarh. He remained general secretary of the BJP’s youth wing and was directly elevated as general secretary. State BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, when contacted, said everyone has the right to choose their political path. “But as far as his claims are concerned, the BJP is the only party where you can put your voice across all platforms. But it’s not necessary that the party would agree with all the voices,” said Sharma. The BJP leaders are seeing Akalis’ hand in the development, especially keeping in view the SAD leaders, including spokespersons, circulated Kang’s resignation on social media. Kang is learnt to be eyeing ticket for the 2022 assembly election from Mohali where he lives. The BJP was banking on him ahead of the polls due to a dearth of Sikh faces in its cadre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-bjp-general-secretary-malwinder-kang-resigns-in-protest-against-centre-s-farm-laws/story-q4gSqemDZruBT1UE0wUh3M.html

Deshpande was reported missing on October 11. He is survived by his parents and sister. On October 11, Deshpande left his house in Thane, saying he needed to go to Titwala for official work. When he didn’t return, his father filed a missing person report on the same day at Naupada police station. On October 12, Kalyan government Railway police (GRP) received a call at 6.30am about a man lying on the tracks between Titwala and Khadavli railway stations. The man was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Kalyan GRP circulated his description among police personnel groups and on Saturday, Naupada police identified him as Deshpande. Assistant police inspector Valmiki Shardul of Kalyan GRP said a probe is underway to ascertain if Deshpande’s death was accidental. Deshpande had worked with Cox and Kings for 10 years and had been questioned by Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing. There are allegations that the company had carried out fraud of approximately ₹20,000 crore. Cox and Kings was also under the Enforcement Directorate’s scanner (ED) for its involvement in alleged money laundering by Yes Bank.

18-10-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh bypolls: Congress releases its manifesto||The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Saturday promised jobs and pensions to kin of those who died due to Covid-19 in its 52-point ‘Vachan Patra’ (manifesto) released for the November 3 assembly bypolls to 28 seats in the state. The manifesto— which focuses on Covid-19 victims, farmers, unemployed youth, women and businessmen—was released by the state Congress president and former chief minister Kamal Nath. Releasing a list of promises “fulfilled” during the 15 months of the last Congress government state (December 2018-March 2020) in the state, Nath said, “During the 15-month tenure, Congress fulfilled 574 out of 974 promises made in the manifesto released before the 2018 assembly election.” He added, “We don’t believe in making false promises like Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.” Nath also said that Congress opposed the three farm bills and the amendments in the labour laws approved in the monsoon session of Parliament, and said the same would not be implemented in Madhya Pradesh, if Congress returns to power in the state. Congress needs to win all the 28 assembly seats in the bypolls on November 3 to cross the majority mark of 116 in the 230-member state assembly.“If Congress comes to power, it will start Corona Samajik Suraksha Pension Yojna for the next of kin of the people who lost their lives due to Covid-19. Similarly, jobs will be provided to a family member of Covid victims. The Congress-led state government will also help the family members of victims in setting up their own businesses,” Nath said. The manifesto mentions that businessmen affected by the pandemic will be provided loans worth ₹50,000 without any interest to revive. The manifesto also promised to not charge unemployed youth any fee while applying for government jobs. Nath also said if the party is voted to power again in the state, the farm loan waiver scheme— under which loans up to ₹2 lakh for farmers will be forgone— will be resumed. Like the Congress-led Chhattisgarh government, Gaudhan Sewa Yojna ( under which cow dung is procured by the state government at ₹2 per kg) will start in Madhya Pradesh as well, the manifesto further declared. Besides promising development of the Gwalior-Chambal division, where by-polls will be held on 16 of the 28 assembly seats, the Congress also said that it will notify Keer, Meena and Pardhi tribes as Scheduled Tribes (ST). In its manifesto, the Congress also promised to start an annual award of ₹1 lakh person for a person working in the field of women empowerment, safety, security and welfare. MP Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “Earlier in September, MP Congress committee had released the sample draft on local manifestos for all the 28 assembly seats, but that was not the final agenda plan. The final draft of the manifesto was released on Saturday. Nobody raised any question from the party. It is BJP working on manufacturing propaganda against our list of promises.” The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government termed Congress’ manifesto “a document of lies” (kapat patra). State home minister Narottam Mishra said, “Congress promises are just going to be on paper and they have no intention to fulfill them. Earlier, they had cheated voters in the name of the farm loan waiver, and now nobody in the state is going to believe the new promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-congress-releases-its-manifesto/story-BTiykLyqxYEGMgx7nvw0ZM.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar may come under ED scanner amid money laundering probe||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has launched a probe into money laundering allegations against various corporations of the Maharashtra irrigation department in connection with alleged irregularities in 12 projects under Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, according to people aware of the developments.ED has sought tenders for dam projects, revised administrative approvals, and bills paid to the contractors linked to Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Krishna Valley irrigation project, and Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation between 1999 and 2009, from officials of the water resources department, an ED official said on condition of anonymity.The probe is likely to bring deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar under scanner after irregularities in the department came to light in 2012. Pawar was the water resources minister between 1999 and 2009. In December last year, the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) gave the deputy CM a clean chit in the case. An affidavit to this effect was filed in the high court on November 27, a day before the MVA government came to power in the state on November 28.The probe coincides with the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government ordering a probe into former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s water conservation project, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan.The development comes weeks after the Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) gave a clean chit to Pawar and others in the ₹25,000-crore Maharashtra State Cooperative banks irregularities case. The EOW last month filed a closure report in the case, calling it to be a civil matter. ED has opposed EOW’s move in the court.Pawar, who was touring the flood-affected areas of Solapur and Pune district on Saturday, declined to comment on the ED probe and said that a probe into Jalyukt Shivar was not ordered out of any spite. “A few ministers in the cabinet raised issues that if CAG itself raised questions on it (Jalyukt Shivar) then the ambitious project on which crores were spent must be probed. Therefore, the chief minister has ordered an open inquiry into it through a special investigation team (SIT). There is no feeling of spite or grudge against anybody in this,” Pawar told reporters.Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena leader and one of the architects of the three-party alliance, refused to comment on the probe. “It won’t be correct for me to respond to it; the state government will respond to it. I know that the state government’s investigation agencies have given a clean chit,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-may-come-under-ed-scanner-amid-money-laundering-probe/story-M3h38mQlOWF1KxottvCWzL.html

The university has also zeroed in on a new online exam service provider to conduct the exams for the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL) students. The exams were postponed owing to a technical glitch, which MU officials said was caused due to a cyber attack. The new service provider will conduct exams tor fresh candidates. Vinod Patil, MU’s controller of examinations, however, did not divulge any details on the name of the new service provider. “Only a few hundred students will be appearing for the backlog exams. So IDOL teachers will conduct the exams on all the three dates on Google forms. Exams for fresh candidates, including TYBCom (third-year Bachelor of Commerce), TYBA (Bachelor of Arts) as well as MCom (Master of Commerce) and MA (Master of Arts) will be conducted by the new service provider,” said a senior official. This decision comes days after all the exams conducted by IDOL had to be rescheduled, as thousands of students could not appear owing to technical glitches. On October 7, around 9,000 TYBCom and TYBA students from IDOL and various other MU departments could not attempt their paper due to “technical glitches”. Many students complained about not being able to log on to the exam link on the examination application. In a statement released on the same day, the university blamed the glitch on a cyber attack on the examination software. No further information has been shared on the issue by the varsity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/university-of-mumbai-s-distance-education-institute-locks-in-new-exam-service-provider-pending-exams-to-be-held-through-google-forms/story-APYzKqxnK4ljK0U3k6LkrJ.html

The accused has been identified as Vivek Sadare, a resident of DN Nagar, Andheri (West).Dayanand Bangar, senior inspector from Oshiwara police station, said that they received a complaint from a doctor last month saying that two men came to his clinic posing as BMC officials and questioned him about non-payment of signboard charges.According to Dr Sanjay Chaudhary, the complainant, the conmen told the doctor that he had not paid signboard charges — charges for putting up his board outside the dispensary — to BMC since the past two years and therefore, he will have to pay the charges along with a fine.“The accused told him that the total amount to be paid was ₹26,600. The next day, one of the accused went to the dispensary and collected the amount,” Bangar added.Chaudhary later realised that the two had conned him, and approached the police. A team led by sub-inspectors Mahendra Puri and Tushar Sawant checked footages of all CCTV cameras installed in the area and identified Sadare and arrested him from DN Nagar on Thursday. Police said the accused has another case of cheating registered against him at Khar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/choreographer-arrested-for-posing-as-mumbai-civic-corporation-official-cheating-doctor/story-UtSPeYWL8398iuTubVRH5N.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Settlement no ground for setting aside conviction in non-compoundable cases: Bombay high court||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has refused to set aside the convictions of two rival groups, who fought and injured each other’s members. The court was hearing separate petitions filed by members of two groups from Kandhar in Nanded district of Maharashtra, seeking an order to strike down their convictions on the ground of an amicable settlement between them. A branch of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar held that the HC had no power to set aside the convictions on the ground of amicable settlement of the disputes. “If after conviction, the parties settle the dispute and offences are non-compoundable, the conviction cannot be set aside,” said the bench. In non-compoundable cases, charges cannot be withdrawn if all the parties agree for a settlement. “Even this court (high court) has no power under section 482 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) to set aside the convictions on account of such compromise, as there is substantive appeal provided to challenge the conviction,” said the bench. In May 2009, several members from both the groups suffered serious injuries after a fight. They had lodged cross-complaints with the local police. All the accused were tried together and convicted under sections 149 (unlawful assembly), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon or means) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon or means) of the Indian Penal Code by the local judicial magistrate in 2015. Both the sides had appealed against the decision and arrived at an amicable settlement during pendency of the appeals. In their appeal, they had urged the additional sessions judge at Kandhar to strike down their convictions on the ground of their settlement. They had moved HC ten days back, after the additional sessions judge rejected their pleas. The HC, too, rejected their petitions observing that convictions in compoundable offence cannot be truck down on the basis of settlement between the parties. HC clarified that when appeal is preferred by the convicts, the compromise can be considered by the appeal court if the parties succeed in showing that only compoundable offences were made against them. The bench added that even if the parties are not able to make out the case for a compoundable offence, it is always open to the appeal court to take a lenient view due to such settlement and accordingly modify the sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/settlement-no-ground-for-setting-aside-conviction-in-non-compoundable-cases-bombay-high-court/story-SaBp17cjpYYtpWYgNcSYHO.html

It has also asked power distribution utilities to make their submissions based on the report by Tuesday, following which MERC will conduct a hearing on Wednesday to probe the reasons behind Monday’s incident, if the standard protocols were followed and the reasons for non-restoration of power supply in some parts. It will also probe if Mumbai’s islanding system worked as envisaged, the status of the system and its relevance in the changing scenario, what will be the action plan to prevent such an occurrence in the future and what protocols were followed by the distribution agencies while restoring power. Mumbai boasts of an islanding system through which the power supplied to the city gets isolated in case of a state-wide grid failure.

18-10-2020||Mumbai||Import of 3 fire-fighting vehicles for Mumbai delayed by 3-4 months amid Covid-19 pandemic||Three fire-fighting vehicles that the Mumbai Fire Brigade is importing from the Netherlands and Germany will arrive three to four months late due to the pandemic. The vehicles suit Mumbai’s urban conditions and were expected between August and January 2021. They will now arrive between December this year and May 2021. The specialised vehicles include one with a water tower with booms that can extend up to 55 metres and will help fight fires in congested localities. The chassis and super structure of this vehicle are being imported from Germany. The vehicle was expected to arrive between November and December, but will now arrive in February 2021. Booms of this vehicle can go over other structures and deep into the fire pit. In buildings with glass facades, booms can break the facade and extend into difficult corners of the floor on fire. A vehicle like this one would be effective in fires like the one that gutted south Mumbai’s cutlery market in Masjid Bunder in the first week of October, and took over 40 hours to douse. A senior civic officer said, “In case of that fire, the structure that caught fire was in the centre portion, surrounded by smaller structures, and was very difficult to reach. The 55-metre water tower will help in such situations.”Mumbai Fire Brigade has also purchased three water transportation vehicles with submersible pumps that can draw out water from a water body — such as the sea or a lake — up to 3 kilometres away through hoses. The vehicle has a special system to lay and recover hoses, with submersible pumps that can lift water from a depth of 30 metres. The system is from the Netherlands and is expected to arrive in December or January, after which it will be mounted on a vehicle that is presently being assembled in Palghar by a fire-fighting equipment manufacturer. The fire brigade has also purchased a special-purpose vehicle to fight fires in high-rise buildings, with capacity to boost water up to 150 metres, which is approximately the 50th floor of a building with high-power pumps. While this vehicle will be put together by a local company in Pune, the pumps are being imported from Germany and are expected in May 2021. A senior civic officer said, “After the lockdown, there was no progress for the first few months about these imports. We have been following up with the companies we are purchasing equipment from, and apart from the delay in delivery, everything else is going as per plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/import-of-3-fire-fighting-vehicles-for-mumbai-delayed-by-3-4-months-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-OkJcAccs180PrzSYM4SUMN.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Background PM2.5 levels were highest in Mumbai among 6 cities between February and April: Study||A study has found that Mumbai recorded the highest background PM2.5 concentration among six Indian cities, between February and April. Background levels are the permanent concentration in any city when anthropogenic (human-induced) emissions are at their lowest.According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the Indian Institute of Tropical Management (IITM) Pune, the level of permanent concentration of PM2.5 was highest for Mumbai at 33 microgrammes per cubic metre (μg/m3) and lowest for Chennai (6 μg/m3). Following Mumbai were Ahmedabad (32 μg/m3), Pune (29 μg/m3), Delhi (22 μg/m3), and Kolkata (18 μg/m3). Data for the six cities was collected from February 20 to April 14, allowing a comparison of levels before and during the lockdown. The data has been published in a research paper by IITM. PM2.5 is breathable particulate matter which is 2.5 microns in size or smaller; and can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments. The national safe standard for PM2.5 is 40 µg/m³ for 24 hours.The findings were presented at a discussion organised by the non-profit organisation Natural Resources Defense Council on Thursday. SAFAR project director and scientist Gufran Beig told HT, “Even though Mumbai may have high pollutant dispersion due to advantages such as sea breeze, its background air already has higher PM2.5 concentration than other cities, even landlocked ones such as Delhi.”The period of IITM’s study — February 20 to April 14 — covered both pre-lockdown conditions (when human-induced emission sources were present) and those during lockdown. The data suggests those exposed to higher baseline levels of particulate pollution are at greater risk of dying from Covid-19. During the first phase of the lockdown (March 24 to April 14), 909 Covid-19 related deaths and 27,251 cases were recorded in Mumbai. Ahmedabad recorded 645 deaths and 9,724 cases in the same period. The lowest number of deaths were reported from Chennai (70) while the fewest cases were from Kolkata (1,570). “Our study results indicate that, in general, cities with a high PM2.5 baseline level are associated with a higher number of deaths due to Covid-19 during the study period, and those cities which have a smaller magnitude of PM2.5 baseline level have relatively lesser numbers of mortality,” said Beig. “However, considering all uncertainties involved (testing capability, health infrastructure, environmental and climatological conditions etc.), more studies are needed to determine what is the cause of high baseline levels for a few cities along with connection between PM2.5 rise and Covid-19 deaths,” he added. Beig further explained that baseline pollution represents the lowest levels of ambient air pollution or a level that would have been naturally present and remained under photochemical equilibrium. “Lockdown created an unprecedented emission scenario with near negligible magnitude, which was virtually impossible under normal scenarios and paved the way to determine the baseline levels, but this is the level we are chronically exposed to naturally and it is more dangerous because these levels cannot be curbed through human intervention,” he said.Independent experts said the high background PM2.5 level in Mumbai clearly indicates elevated pollution levels in the air-shed of the city. “This is influenced by the pollution sources across the region, long-range movement of pollutants, and pollutants that are precursor to the formation of secondary pollutants. It is therefore important to have national or regional level policies to reduce the background pollutant concentration otherwise the city will always be fighting hard to reduce levels especially below the background level,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi.SAFAR’s analysis also revealed the baseline values of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which were highest for Delhi (8 parts per billion) followed by Ahmedabad (6 ppb), Mumbai (5 ppb) and lowest for Kolkata and Chennai (1.7 ppb). The high magnitude of NO2 (8 ppb) in Delhi implies the dominant role of fossil fuel emissions from transport sources in inﬂuencing the base level of NO2, the study said.Meteorological conditions Even though Mumbai recorded the second highest wind speed (11.4 km/hr), lowest average maximum temperature (32.5 degrees Celsius) and third lowest average humidity levels (69%) among the six cities during the first phase of the lockdown, it still recorded the highest PM2.5 baseline levels. “In general, meteorology and topography of a city plays a major role in dispersion of pollutants but in this case all six cities observed calm, steady and consistent weather immediately after the lockdown when pollutants sharply dropped and remained steady until some restrictions were relaxed. So in this case, the drop in pollutants or baseline levels is more due to human-induced sources dropping significantly,” said Beig.Sources of high PM2.5 baseline levels in Mumbai’s air SAFAR recorded the emission inventory for PM2.5 pollutants in Mumbai’s air during 2019. While the transport sector was the most dominant source at 30.49%, sources titled ‘others’ including open fires, brick kilns, textile plants, dust storms, sea-spray etc. — all inside and outside the air shed — accounted for 20.88%. The residential sector, including biofuel or solid fuel emissions for domestic cooking and other activities, accounted for 15.52%. Remaining sources (14.8%) were from windblown dust and 13.08% from industrial emissions. “Overall, the lockdown saw about 85-90% reduction in human-induced sources. The baseline may factor in some amount of household biofuel emissions,” said Beig.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/background-pm2-5-levels-was-highest-in-mumbai-among-6-cities-between-february-and-april-study/story-YhR0p81NoFfAu3ZdIPr8gP.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||ED starts investigation into irrigation scam in Maharashtra||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has commenced a probe into the money-laundering allegations against various corporations of the state irrigation department in a scam that came to light in 2012. The probe is likely to bring the role of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar under the scanner, as he headed the water resources department during 1999 and 2009. Interestingly, the move coincides with the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government ordering an open probe into former CM Devendra Fadnavis’s pet water conservation project, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan. ED officials have already asked water resources department officials to provide tenders for dam projects, revised administrative approvals, and bills paid to the contractors linked to Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Krishna Valley irrigation project, and Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation between 1999 and 2009.A senior ED official, who did not wish to be named, confirmed that as part of its probe, the agency has asked the office of the state water resources department to provide all documents. When asked if any officer from the department has been summoned as they have not provided the details yet, the ED official said that the summons is not for questioning, but a reminder to explain what documents are required for the probe.The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has already given a clean chit to Pawar in December last year in connection to alleged irregularities related to twelve projects under Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation.According to an affidavit filed in the high court on November 27, the NCP leader was cleared of all allegations in the Vidarbha irrigation scam by the Maharashtra ACB. The affidavit was filed just a day before the MVA government came to power in the state on November 28.The development from ED also comes weeks after Mumbai Police’s Economic Offenses Wing (EOW) gave a clean chit to Pawar and others in the ₹25,000-crore Maharashtra State Cooperative banks scam. EOW last month filed a closure report in the case, claiming it to be a civil matter. ED has opposed EOW’s move in the court.Pawar, who was touring the flood-affected areas of Solapur and Pune district on Saturday, declined to comment on the ED probe and said that a probe into Jalyukt Shivar was not ordered out of any spite. “A few ministers in the cabinet raised issues that if CAG itself raised questions on it (Jalyukt Shivar) then the ambitious project on which crores were spent must be probed. Therefore, the chief minister has ordered an open inquiry into it through a special investigation team (SIT). There is no feeling of spite or grudge against anybody in this,” Pawar told reporters.The repercussion of the probe by the Central agency against Pawar was felt in the three-party (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) state government. Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena leader and one of the architects of the three-party alliance, refused to comment on the probe and its impact. “It won’t be correct for me to respond to it; the state government will respond to it. I know that the state government’s investigation agencies have given a clean chit,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-starts-investigation-into-irrigation-scam-in-maharashtra/story-I9vyHL2ckBJrrV3xrA6TaK.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Metro ops to operate at 3rd of pre-Covid passenger capacity, services halved||Metro train services will be only half of the pre-Covid levels and will operate at a third of the passenger capacity once the services restart next week, a top official said on Saturday.Time duration of the operations for the single 11-km line between Ghatkopar to Versova has also been curtailed to 12 hours starting from 0830 hrs daily, Mumbai Metro One’s chief executive Abhau Kumar Mishra told reporters while showing the revamped set up.He said the cut in services, passengers and operational timing is to ensure the passenger safety through proper social distancing which needs to be followed.Only 200 services of trains will run with services in either direction in up to 8 minutes as against 5 minutes and 400 services earlier. As against 1,350 people per service earlier, now the train will carry only 360 people.It can be noted that earlier this week, the Maharashtra government had allowed Metro services in the financial capital to resume from October 15, but the company decided to start it from Monday after finishing all the safety runs.Temperatures inside the coaches will be maintained between 25-27 degree Celsius and passengers are encouraged to use digital tickets, smart cards or QR code-based tickets, an official statement said, adding no plastic token will be issued.The authorities will be carrying out regular disinfection of all the stations and also the coaches, it said.Over 300 workers have worked through the lockdown period for upkeep of the trains and the station infrastructure, Mishra said, adding 32 of them had turned positive for Covid-19 of which four continue to be infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-ops-to-operate-at-3rd-of-pre-covid-passenger-capacity-services-halved/story-KEc7x2XQS7PSfM87gXibVM.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut, sister Rangoli booked for ‘spreading hatred’||The Bandra police on Saturday registered a first information report (FIR) against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister, Rangoli Chandel, for sedition and spreading communal hatred, a day after the Bandra metropolitan magistrate court issued an order to this effect. On Friday, metropolitan magistrate Jaydeo Ghule, acting on a complaint filed by casting director Munawarali alias Sahil Sayyed, directed the police to initiate criminal proceedings against Kangana and her sister.In his order, the magistrate said that a search and seizure may be necessary, and asked the police to take appropriate action under section 156(3) of Code of Criminal Procedure.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut reacts as court orders FIR against her: ‘Pappu sena in Maharashtra seems to be obsessing over me’Sayyed had alleged that over the last few months, Kangana, through her tweets and interviews, defamed the film industry by portraying Bollywood as a “hub of nepotism, favouritism, drug addicts, communally biased and murderers”.He alleged that her statements “created a bad image of Bollywood in the minds of people and even creating a communal divide and rift between people of two communities”. Kangana has been “maliciously bringing religion in all her tweets”, he added.Targetting Rangoli, the casting director said that she had also tweeted objectionable posts intended to create a communal rift. Rangoli also works as Kangana’s manager. Sayyed said that her tweets had hurt the feeling of the Muslim community in the country. He also quoted one of her tweets: “Make the Mullas and secular media stand in line and shoot them…the history may call us Nazis, who cares.”The two were booked under sections 124(A) (sedition), 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, race, place of birth, language etc) and 295(A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class) of the Indian Penal Code.Following the FIR, the actor tweeted, “Who all are fasting on Navratris?...meanwhile another FIR filed against me, Pappu sena in Maharashtra seems to be obsessing over me, don’t miss me so much I will be there soon #Navratri.”Rizwan Siddiquee, Ranaut’s lawyer, said, “The order passed by the learned magistrate shall be legally dealt with on ‘merits’ as per procedure of law.

18-10-2020||Mumbai||Seven months on, Mumbai Metro to be back on track with 200 services from Monday||Seven months after Mumbai Metro-1 ceased operations owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown, it is all set to resume services from Monday. More than 200 services will operate every 6.30 minutes during peak-hours on which 300 commuters will be permitted to travel, the Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), which runs the line between Versova and Ghatkopar, announced on Saturday. Before closing operations in March, MMOPL used to operate around 400 services on the line, with headway of 3-3.5 minutes during the peak hours. Each train would ferry around 1,350 passengers before the pandemic broke out. The services will operate between 8.30am and 8.30pm with a limited access to stations. For instance, at the western express highway, entry will be allowed from gate one near Guru Nanak petrol pump and exit from gates 6 and 7 near Maharaja restaurant. “We will observe the commuting pattern for a week and increase the services, if needed. However, there will be stand-by trains at both terminal stations if there are more than estimated commuters at a time,” said Abhay Mishra, chief executive officer, MMOPL. Commuters will have to leave one seat between them and stand at designated markers to maintain social distancing at all times. Commuters have also been advised to download the Aarogya Setu app and carry a sanitiser bottle at all times. Wearing a mask at the station and on the trains will be mandatory. “Temperatures of passengers will be checked at the gates and sanitisers will be available at several points. We encourage commuters to opt for mobile ticketing,” Mishra said, adding that commuters who have balance available on their smart cards for the tickets will also be able to avail the benefits after verification at the customer care. 32 Metro employees tested positive for Covid-19 In the past six months, 32 metro staffers were tested for Covid-19, of which 28 have recovered, while four are undergoing treatment, MMOPL said on Saturday. Though the services were closed for seven months, these staffers had to carry out maintenance works periodically. MMRDA chief travels on Monorail A day before the Mumbai Monorail resumed services after seven months, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) chief RA Rajeev travelled on the line from Wadala to Sant Gadge Maharaj Chowk on Saturday. The services will resume from Sunday morning. Mumbai Monorail will also introduce contactless ticketing services from Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seven-months-on-mumbai-metro-to-be-back-on-track-with-200-services-from-monday/story-gh1Trg89QTsTqcr3H1AuYN.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Foul smell, akin to gas leak, reported from Mumbai’s eastern suburbs||For the third time in a span of a little over a year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday received complaints about foul odour, akin to a gas leak, from parts of Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Govandi and Bhandup, Chembur, Mulund, Bhandup, and Powai. Many residents took to Twitter to raise their concerns about the smell.Categorising it as an ‘unknown foul smell’, BMC mobilised the Mumbai Fire Brigade, and alerted the Mumbai Police, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and ward officials of the respective areas. By 8.15pm, BMC’s disaster management department said it checked with the complainants and the investigating agencies, and they said the foul odour no longer existed. Earlier in June, a similar incident was reported to the BMC’s disaster management department by residents. Being the second such incident at the time, BMC set up a committee to trace the origin of the leak, but the panel could not determine the cause. The first such incident was reported in September last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/foul-smell-akin-to-gas-leak-reported-from-mumbai-s-eastern-suburbs/story-Si7WuFfoKbCWyaCITXqidI.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Gyms across Maharashtra set to open from Dussehra; Maha Covid-19 tally reaches 1,586,321||The state government on Saturday decided to allow opening of gymnasiums and fitness centres from Dussehra, which falls on October 25, as the Maharashtra Covid-19 case count reached 1,586,321, with the addition of 10,259 infections.Gyms and fitness centres have been asked to strictly follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) and violators will have to face stern action. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who made the announcement, said steam baths, saunas, zumba and yoga classes will remain shut till further orders.The coronavirus toll went up to 41,965 after 250 more casualties were reported on Saturday, of which, 152 were in the last 48 hours, another 47 were from last week, while the remaining 51 were from before that, officials said.The relative decline in fresh cases, since the past few weeks, has resulted in a steady fall in active cases to 185,270. It comes to 11.67% of the total cases. On September 17, the state’s figure of active cases was 301,752.Despite a decline, the state has crossed over 200,000 cases this month on Saturday. In the last 17 days, 203,029 cases have been reported whereas last month (September), the state had recorded 223,068 cases in just 11 days (as on September 11). State health minister Rajesh Tope said it appears that the state has hit a plateau and they are looking at positive outcomes in the future. “We are looking at the current situation positively. It appears to me that the state has hit a plateau as the infection rate is not going up. However, we are still not in a position to make any kind of prediction because everything depends upon how peoples’ cooperation would be in the coming days. A decline in fresh cases will start only if they continue to cooperate,” the health minister said.“Gyms and fitness centres work to keep people healthy, but we have to take all precautions to ensure they will not escalate the problem [coronavirus pandemic]. The number of gyms are significant in urban areas as well as in rural areas and hence the standard operating procedure prepared by the state will have to be strictly followed. The responsibility for the same will be on the owners and those found not following them will face strict action,” the chief minister said during a virtual interaction with representatives from gym and fitness centres on Saturday.He said that the fresh cases of Covid-19 are reducing in the state, but they have to be careful considering the European countries which are experiencing the second wave. “Covid-19 cases are declining and the state government is also giving relaxations from restrictions but we have to be very careful, considering the situation of European countries as a case in point. We cannot afford to become careless with more relaxations coming in,” Thackeray said.Following the spike in Covid-19 cases, the state had augmented the health infrastructure, but as the cases have reduced, beds at many parts in the state are lying vacant. We don’t want any stress on health infrastructure because of any lackadaisical attitude, he added.Mumbai on Saturday recorded 1,791 new covid-19 cases, second highest in the state, and 47 deaths, taking the total number of cases in the city to 240,335, and total deaths to 9,739. There are now 22,664 active cases in the city.Case fatality rate (CFR) of the city is now 4%, a drop from the 5.5% recorded in August and September. Mumbai has 12% of Maharashtra’s active cases and 23% of the total deaths in the state. Recovery rate in Mumbai is 86%, growth rate has dropped to below 1% contrary to the spurt seen in September and is at 0.81%. The doubling rate is 86 days.Until Friday, Mumbai conducted a total of 1,370,767 tests, with a positivity rate of 17.79%. Positivity rate is a percent of positives in comparison to total tests conducted.On Saturday, Nagpur city recorded 1,794 infections, the highest number of cases across the state, pushing its case count to 72,299.Pune city contributed third-highest infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 471 cases, taking its tally to 167,823.With fresh cases, the state is also experiencing a slight decline in Covid-19 casualties. However, Maharashtra still has the highest number of casualties across the country.State’s CFR went up a bit to 2.65% after a gap of more than a month. It is at second position after Punjab. The CFR of Punjab was 3.14% (with 3,980 deaths) till Friday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department.The state has also breached the eight million mark of tests as 79,407 tests were conducted on Saturday. Total tests conducted till date are 8,069,100. The state’s overall positivity rate stood at 19.66%.The number of recovered patients also reached 1,358,606 as 14,238 patients recovered in the last 24 hours. The recovery rate was recorded at 85.65%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gyms-across-maharashtra-set-to-open-from-dussehra/story-tJwrb4yIBvDet62YmcS6jN.html
18-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government, railways to allow Mumbai local train commute for all women passengers from coming week?||Women commuters in the city may be allowed to travel by suburban trains from next week. A meeting of state government officials and Central (CR) and Western Railway (WR) authorities is likely early next week, to discuss the matter.As part of its Mission Begin Again, the Maharashtra government on Friday wrote to Railway authorities, to allow women commuters to travel by local trains during stipulated hours from October 17. Prior to this, in a meeting held last week between state officials and Railway authorities, the subject of allowing women commuters was briefly mentioned. “Allowing women passengers to travel by local trains was mentioned in the meetings. However, there was no concrete discussion regarding permitting them,” said a senior official who had attended the meeting.After receiving the state’s proposal on Friday, CR and WR said this was not immediately possible. “We have received a request letter from the state government and have processed the same. Once approval is received from the Railway Board, we will allow women passengers to travel by local trains,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR. Railway officials have raised concerns over the state’s suggestion that women be allowed to travel between 11am to 3pm and from 7pm till midnight. “The timing that has been given makes it tricky as in the evening, women passengers could arrive before 7pm and wait, leading to overcrowding. An estimate of the increased number of passengers is crucial as services will be increased in a similar manner. We are looking into allowing women commuters to travel from next week after discussions with state government officials,” said a senior Railway official.Meanwhile, passenger associations have welcomed the idea, but reiterated the need to maintain social distancing on trains. “This will reduce crowding in buses and other vehicles. However, before allowing passengers, proper provisions should be made to ensure social distancing and there is no overcrowding inside train compartments,” said Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passenger Association. Mumbai’s local trains, used by around 8 million people daily pre-Covid-19, were suspended on March 23 after the state went into a lockdown to stop the spread of the virus. Some services, however, resumed on June 15, with the state allowing only essential services workers, differently-abled people and cancer patients to use the trains. At present, CR operates 481 daily services, while WR runs 700 services as compared to their regular of 1,774 and 1,367 respectively. CR and WR operate two ladies’ special trains each. In a 12-compartment local train, nearly 30% is reserved as women compartments. The combinations may differ from service to service, but there are usually two and a half general compartments and three quarter-size first class compartments for women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-railways-to-allow-mumbai-local-train-commute-for-all-women-passengers-from-coming-week/story-4JtO2yJrYO8Di13shajCjN.html
18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University library to resume lending books to research scholars||Days after allowing the research scholars to visit campus, Panjab University’s AC Joshi Library will now start lending them books from next week. However, the library will not allow sit-in sessions for now.The decision was taken in a meeting convened by librarian Jivesh Bansal on Saturday.Bansal said, “Lending facilities will be resumed for those research scholars who are permitted to visit departments. They can take books from the library from next week.”For now, only those research scholars who have been enrolled for more than three years have been allowed by PU to visit departments and use laboratories. Scholars of the humanities departments can visit only with the permission of their supervisors.The AC Joshi Library building, which is near PU’s Student Centre, houses more than six lakh volumes and has a seating accommodation of 500 readers. It also has a collection of over 6.4 lakh publications including books, journals, theses/dissertations, rare books, reports, government documents, back files of newspapers, and a prized collection of 1,490 manuscripts.For availing the books from the library, the chairpersons of the respective departments will provide a list of the permitted research scholars to the library.Last month, the Panjab University Research Scholars Association (PURSA) had demanded accommodation in hostels and access to libraries, saying that their work was suffering since March.A research scholar, Priya, who is a representative of PURSA, said, “This will help scholars especially of the humanities departments, who can access books from the library. PURSA had also demanded that the library should be reopened for research scholars.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-library-to-resume-lending-books-to-research-scholars/story-IJJEr856vfXsPLBSHfozzI.html
18-10-2020||Delhi||Move to reserve beds in private hospitals sought to mitigate Covid spread, says Delhi health minister||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said the move to reserve beds for Covid-19 patients in several private hospitals here was to “mitigate the spread of virus” and those levelling allegations on the government were trying to “jeopardise efforts” being made for people’s welfare. A plea in the Delhi High Court has challenged the September 13 order of the Delhi government, directing 33 private hospitals to reserve at least 80 per cent of their total ICU bed strength for Covid-19 patients. “The decision to reserve beds for Covid-19 patients stems out of sheer concern to mitigate spread of virus. Those putting allegations against the Delhi government are trying to jeopardise the efforts made by us for the welfare of our citizens,” he said. Jain made the assertion in a Facebook post and also shared a news article related to the issue. The national capital recorded 22 Covid-19 fatalities on Friday, taking the death toll to 5,946, while 3,428 fresh cases took the infection tally to over 3.24 lakh, authorities said. These fresh cases came out of the 58,145 tests conducted the previous day. On October 10 and September 29 as well, 48 fatalities were reported in the city, the highest number of deaths recorded in a day since July 16, when Delhi saw 58 fatalities. The tally of active cases on Friday slightly rose to 22,814 from 22,605 the previous day. The number of containment zones in Delhi also slightly increased to 2,747 from 2,727 on Thursday. The Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing in the past few days, with the count on several times crossing the 60,000-mark. The government on Friday told the Delhi High Court that the policy decision directing 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients was taken as a stop-gap and temporary measure with an intent to mitigate the surge of coronavirus cases in the national capital. In an affidavit filed before Justice Navin Chawla, the AAP government vehemently denied that the decision, which was stayed by the high court on September 22, was in violation of any fundamental right of the citizens of Delhi and termed the petition by ‘Association of Healthcare Providers’ as wholly misplaced and baseless. The high court granted one week time to the petitioner association, which claims that the 33 private hospitals against whom the order was passed are its members and sought to quash the order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, to file rejoinder to the government’s affidavit and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18. The government has already challenged the single judge’s stay order before a division bench which has listed it for hearing on November 27. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the government, said there is a prediction that in the upcoming festive season, the number of Covid-19 cases will go up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/move-to-reserve-beds-in-private-hospitals-sought-to-mitigate-covid-spread-says-delhi-health-minister/story-YpJsAr7PlIEInwTjlhQJuI.html

For this week, we will see how social distancing measures and other safety precautions are being adhered to. We are expecting full cooperation from the people,” said Dr VK Nagpal, medical superintendent-cum-joint director, UT health department.Measures in place to avoid crowdingDifferent entry and exit points have been marked. The registration time will be from 8am to 11am while the consultation time will be from 9am to 3pm.The counters for registration have been increased from two to four. Patients will be provided with the triple-layer mask and their hands will be mandatorily sanitised before they enter the OPD.Token system will allow only 10 patients in each OPD at one time. Extra security guards will be deployed to regulate the flow of patients, and ensure social distancing and wearing of masks.Meanwhile, two major tertiary-care institutes of the city, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and Government Medical College and Hospital, are yet to take a call on reopening their OPDs.The UT health department is also planning to allow registration of patients through a phone call remotely. “To avoid rush on the premises, we are also mulling that patients could register from a remote location through a phone call and they will be provided a particular time for consultation. It is on the cards and we are working on it,” said a senior UT health official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/government-multi-speciality-hospital-in-chandigarh-reopens-opds-from-monday/story-ADy3CCWNbfUM4dq1tfmbDJ.html

18-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: ED files chargesheet against Tahir Hussain in money laundering case||A Delhi court on Saturday took cognizance of a charge sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain for his alleged role in money laundering, funding protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act; and orchestrating the Delhi riots in February, which claimed 53 lives and left around 400 injured.Additional sessions judge (ASJ) Amitabh Rawat said there was prima facie, sufficient incriminating material to show the involvement of Hussain and co-accused Amit Gupta in these offences. The court directed Tihar jail officials to produce Tahir Hussain before it on October 19. “... cognisance of the offence under Section 3 read with Section 70, punishable under Section 4 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, is taken against accused Tahir Hussain and Amit Gupta,” the court said in its order.Hussain is currently in judicial custody, after being arrested in connection with numerous riot cases, including one filed by the Delhi Police special cell related to conspiracy to engineer the Delhi riots. Also Read| Delhi riots: Cops blow cover of own secret witnessesThe ED told the court that further investigation is on and a supplementary charge sheet may be filed later.Hussain’s counsel, advocate Rizwan, said the charges against his client are all false. “This is a coverup to save the actual perpetrators. Everyone knows and has seen the videos as to on whose directions the riots had taken place,” he said.Gupta’s counsel could not be reached for comment despite repeated attemptsThe agency had arrested Hussain on August 31 to probe allegations that he along with other persons had laundered about ₹1.10 crore by using shell (dummy) companies to fuel the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and also the Delhi riots. Police have maintained that the riots were planned at the anti-CAA protest sites in north-east Delhi. The ED said their investigation is based on multiple police FIRs. It said the investigation conducted under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, has revealed that companies owned/controlled by Hussain and his relatives allegedly transferred huge amounts of money to dubious entities/entry operators, which were returned by them in cash.“The cash received by Hussain through entry operators was used to fuel the anti-CAA protests and Delhi riots. Investigations have also revealed that Hussain and his companies were involved in money laundering in the past as well,” the ED had said on August 31.Also Read| Delhi riots: Police file supplementary charge sheet, name 9 for promoting religious enmityIn June, ED had conducted searches at residences and business premises of Hussain and his relatives in Delhi, Noida and Greater Noida. These searches had allegedly led to the recovery of incriminating documents and evidences, including fake invoices which were used for the fraudulent transfer of money, the ED claimed.The agency is investigating two cases of money laundering – one against Hussain and another against Popular Front of India (PFI), a Muslim organisation with fundamentalist leanings -- for allegedly mobilising funds for north-east Delhi riots.In its probe against PFI, the ED has alleged that about ₹120 crore was funnelled in by the organisation to fuel anti-CAA protests across the country. The PFI has termed the allegations “baseless”.Communal violence had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24 after clashes between CAA supporters and opposers spiraled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and more than 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-ed-files-chargesheet-against-tahir-hussain-in-money-laundering-case/story-g38bIqbeUqe4UHv1K2HSLJ.html

Similarly, BA (Hons) in Economics is available in LSR at 99%, Hindu (98.75%), Miranda (98.5%), and Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) (99%). Students wishing to pursue BCom (Hons) can still apply in Hindu College (98.25%), LSR (99.5%), Hansraj College (98%), Ramjas (98.75%), and SRCC at 98.5%.The process for admissions under the second cut-off will be conducted between Monday and Wednesday.  Seats are available in other popular Humanities courses as well. For instance, seats in the Political Science (Hons) programme are still available in LSR (99.75%), Ramjas (98.75%), Kirori Mal College (98.75%), and off-campus colleges including Gargi (97), Rajdhani College (93.75%), and Aryabhatta College (94.5%).Explaining the reason behind the marginal drop in the cut-off in the second list, Ramjas College principal Manoj Khanna said, “Courses available in the second cut-off have very few seats left in a majority of the colleges, so there has only been a marginal drop in the second list.”“We have announced the same percentage for some BA (Prog) combinations in the second cut-off as in the first cut-off to avoid over-admissions,” he said. In LSR — which had announced a 100% cut-off for admissions to Political Science, Psychology and Economics in the first list — seats are still available in many courses with a marginal drop in the required Class 12 board exam score.

However, the cut-off for admission in BCom (Hons) dropped by 0.5 percentage points for admission to BCom (Hons) in the college. In Hindu College, admission closed for the unreserved category in many courses including English, History, Political Science, Chemistry, and Physics. The College has witnessed a drop of 0.5 percentage points for admission to BA (Hons) in Economics and one percentage point in BCom (Hons) in the second cut-off list. Anju Shrivastava, principal of Hindu College, said the college has either kept cut-offs the same or dropped them marginally in some courses where only a few seats are left to be filled. “For instance, we have the same cut-off for Philosophy in the second cut-off because we have only one seat left in the course against the sanctioned strength,” she said.At least 10 out of 20 courses were closed for the unreserved category in Hansraj College. It includes History, Hindi, Mathematics, Botany, and three combinations of BA (prog). The college has dropped the cut-off for admission to Economics (Hons) and English (Hons) by just 0.25 percentage points. While popular colleges saw a nominal drop in the required percentage between the two cut-offs, the off-campus colleges saw a drop as high as five percentage points.

18-10-2020||Delhi||Ramlila takes an online turn to guard against Covid-19||Unlike previous years, when the Red Fort lawns would be teeming with people enjoying the rides, browsing through the scores of food stalls, and enjoying three of the biggest Ramlila performances in the capital, the area wore an empty look on Saturday — the first day of Navratri celebrations. Pointing towards the empty grounds, Santosh Kumar, a hawker who has been selling his wares in the area for over three decades, said, “During Navratri celebrations, thousands of people would come here to see the Ramlila performance, bringing in good business. Since the celebrations have been cancelled this year due to Covid-19, we will earn less than half of what we used to.” The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had issued an order on October 11 allowing Navratri and Durga Puja functions in the city, while following social distancing norms, limiting attendees, and prohibiting fairs and processions. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDelhi has 327,718 Covid-19 cases till now, including 298,853 recoveries and 5,981 deaths. There were 22,884 active cases on Saturday. Many major committees said there would be no Ramlilas this year. Others said they have limited the number of guests and would ask elderly citizens and children not to come. On Saturday, many performed symbolic ceremonies. Dheeraj Dhar Gupta, general secretary of the Dharmik Lila Committee, which organises Ramlila on the Red Fort grounds, said, “We have been organising Ramlila since 1923 – with the only exception being in 1965, due to the Indo-Pak war. We held a Ganesh Puja on Saturday with a limited number of attendees.” Gupta said, they would be telecasting last year’s Ramlila performances on television from October 18 to 26 at 8.30pm. Suresh Bindal, president of Shri Ramlila Committee Indraprastha Vihar, said, “We have booked an air-conditioned hall this time and will show a three-hour, Ramlila including the journey from Lord Ram’s birth till the defeat of Ravan and bharat milap. The number of artists have been reduced from 70 to 40 this time,” he said, adding the event will be broadcast on their Facebook and YouTube channels as well. Also Read: Move to reserve beds in private hospitals sought to mitigate Covid spread, says Delhi health ministerBindal said, adding that the children and elderly will not be allowed at the venue. Last year, President Ram Nath Kovind had visited the IP Extension Ramlila. Since the fair is located at the Delhi border, Bindal said thousands of people from neighbouring states would turn up taking the footfall to 80,000 until last year. With hardly any fairs during the festive season, many temples are preparing for a surge in the number of devotees. South Delhi’s Kalkaji Mandir has sought help from the police and the district magistrate to manage crowds. Only one entry-exit point is being used instead of the existing four to manage the crowds. “Only 10 people can enter the bhawan at a time after sanitizing their hands. There will be no Prasad and all stalls leading to the mandir are closed. Around 1 lakh people used to visit the temple per day during Navratri celebrations,” said a priest from the Kalkaji Mandir. Arjun Kumar, general secretary of Lav Kush Ramlila Committee which organises an 11-day event every year at the Red Fort, said that since these gatherings involve large congregations, they were not willing to take any risk and won’t have organise the Ramlila this year. Pramod Kohli, treasurer at the Ashok Vihar Ramlila Committee, said, “With a raging pandemic, we didn’t want to take any chances, plus the government order came too late to make the arrangements necessary. The limit was for 200 people, but there are 300 artists involved in putting up the Ramlila, so a physical show would not have been possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ramlila-takes-an-online-turn-to-guard-against-covid-19/story-b6X0zZej7tmMnPm19KwtLI.html

Why does the Delhi government then always shift blame to Punjab and Haryana or the Central government for pollution management,” she said.Also Read: Farm fires contributing 22% to Delhi’s PM 2.5 load, shows dataSharma said the Centre, apart from earmarking ₹1,600 crore this year to tackle the problem of air pollution in Delhi-NCR, had also cracked down on stubble burning, besides undertaking other steps like closing the Badarpur and Panipat Thermal Power Plant,switching from BS4 to BS6 fuel and backing innovation of Pusa decomposer for crop residue etc.This is in addition to the multiple meetings by the Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar with minister of the five states — Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan — to find a solution to the problem.Also Read| Behind Delhi’s polluted air: Early stubble fires, weather“The Delhi government allocated a meagre ₹52 crore in its ₹65,000 crore budget for environment and spent nil from the ₹787 crore that it received from the environment cess it received in 2017, However, the same government spent upwards of ₹73 crore on advertisements and self promotion in the months of July and August only,” Sharma claimed.The AAP did not respond to requests for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-attacks-aap-says-govt-not-doing-enough-to-check-bad-air-in-delhi/story-KsALlqdILwEiYvkoW7f0nO.html
18-10-2020||Delhi||HSRP home delivery system to have live tracking facility, says Delhi transport minister||To ensure timely home delivery of high-security registration plates (HSRP) and fuel-based colour-coded stickers to vehicle owners in the city, the Delhi government has asked manufacturers to add a real-time tracking feature so that the applicant can track the rider, as is done currently on food delivery apps. The direction was issued to the three HSRP manufacturers of Delhi in a meeting held on Friday. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) is working on creating another parallel system, wherein OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) would get HSRPs and colour-coded stickers affixed on old vehicles that come in for servicing at various centres. HSRPs are hologram plates made with a laser-branded permanent identification number, which cannot be copied. The colour-coded stickers are meant to identify vehicles based on their fuel type. The stickers also include details such as the registration number, the registering authority, a laser-branded PIN, and the engine and chassis number of the vehicle.Also Read: Passenger vehicle sales rise 26.5% in SeptemberA senior transport official said there are around 3.2 million vehicles in Delhi — both commercial and private — which are supposed to have these high-security registration plates. The rule applies largely to vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, as vehicles registered after that date are mandatorily equipped with HSRPs and fuel stickers.“The government has made it clear to HSRP manufacturers that an unreliable home delivery system will not be acceptable. We cannot have a situation where people are given a time and date for delivery of their HSRP and sticker and the rider is unable to arrive on time. So, we have asked them to build a feature where the applicant can track the rider on a real-time basis. It’s similar to the feature which have on food delivery apps,” Gahlot said. The minister added that many people also complained about the need to fill the entire chassis number, which many found inconvenient. “So, now only the last five digits of engine and chassis number will have to be entered in the software,” he said. The city administration was flooded with complaints from vehicle owners who had failed to get the high-security number plates despite having paid for them and made the mandatory visit to the vehicle dealer outlets to collect them. The problem started after the Delhi government, on September 23, issued a public notice asking vehicle owners to get HSRP and colour-coded stickers at the earliest in order to avoid being penalised under existing laws. While the notice did not mention when the crackdown would begin, it created a lot of panic among people and the dealers were flooded with applications for new HSRPs. The result was that there were at least 8,000 pending applications for HSRPs as on October 1, creating a huge backlog and triggering chaos at dealer outlets. The minister had then directed that no new application should be entertained until the backlog was cleared and the crisis was resolved. At present, the status remains the same, which means even as the backlog has reduced, the manufacturers are still not taking any fresh applications. A senior official of Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited – the primary manufacturer of HSRPs in Delhi – said the home delivery project is in the advanced stages of completion and the final modalities would be ready by Tuesday, when another review meeting is scheduled. “Thereafter, we are hoping to formally launch the home delivery service by the end of the month or early November. The process will be seamless as the portal for applying will be the same -- bookmyhsrp.com. The user will be given the option to choose home delivery or self pick-up,” said the official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hsrp-home-delivery-system-to-have-live-tracking-facility-says-transport-minister-gahlot/story-6iDjwfM25M902dWA6yWFgO.html

The initiative, known as the “10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute” anti-dengue campaign was launched on September 6 with Kejriwal inspecting his residence for stagnant water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. This was followed by all MLAs doing the same in the first week and then doctors and health care workers in the subsequent weeks. “This week, shopkeepers will be urged to inspect their shops and surroundings for stagnant water every Sunday for 10 minutes, and drain it away to prevent the breeding of dengue mosquitoes. Inspecting the surrounding market areas and their shops will keep shopkeepers as well as their customers safe from dengue,” the government said in a statement. Last year, the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) played a huge role in this campaign and Kejriwal had thanked all RWAs at Talkatora Stadium, while launching the five-point action plan for RWAs to follow to combat dengue. Also Read: Involve your family in anti-dengue campaign, Delhi chief minister Kejriwal urges“This week, the key focus of the Delhi government would be on the participation of shopkeepers.

The first edition of the anti-dengue campaign was launched in 2019,” a government spokesperson said. A special helpline has also been launched by the Delhi government for the public if they require any assistance with dengue. People can call on 011-22300012 or send WhatsApp messages on 8595920530. In the third week of the anti-dengue campaign, Kejriwal had tweeted, “Delhi will defeat dengue again, and for this, today, the third Sunday of the campaign at 10am, I checked my house and replaced the stagnant water.

18-10-2020||Delhi||Farm fires contributing 22% to Delhi’s PM 2.5 load, shows data||Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) remained in the “poor” category, with the contribution of stubble fumes to the city’s PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) load doubling to 22% on Saturday from 11% a day earlier, according to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi under ministry of earth sciences.Delhi’s AQI on Saturday was recorded at 287 in the poor category, according to CPCB’s 4pm bulletin, with PM10 being the prime pollutant.Though wind speed was around 12 kmph during the day, pollution levels continued to remain poor because of stubble fumes from neighbouring states and high local pollution, scientists said. The ventilation index — function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants — on Saturday was 10,000 m2/s. A ventilation index below 2350 sq metres/second is considered poor. The mixing height is the height at which the pollutant mixes in the air.“A ventilation index of 10,000 m2/s was recorded during the day time. But at night, the wind is calm and the temperature is low. The ventilation index also falls. Air pollution levels didn’t deteriorate further only because there was wind in the daytime. The wind direction is north-westerly and will continue to remain so for the next couple of days. Stubble fires will impact Delhi’s air,” said Vijay Soni, scientist at IMD (air quality management division).Also Read: SC appoints ex-judge to monitor stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, UPData on Saturday also showed that action against stubble fires has not been as widespread this year, as compared to previous years. Far fewer subsidised straw management machines have reached farmers in Punjab and Haryana this year compared to the past two years, according to data with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In 2018-19 and 2019-20, around 51,000 machines were distributed. But in 2020-21, for this season, only 9,000 machines have been distributed in Punjab. “Less than half of the machines that were to be made available have actually reached the farmers. I cannot tell you why this has happened but the money has already been given to states for distribution of machinery,” said Trilochan Mohapatra, director general, ICAR.Anirudh Tiwari, additional chief secretary (development), Punjab said around 23,500 machines have been sanctioned for this year. But Punjab government received 77,000 applications for machines. They then organised a draw of lots to distribute the machines. But even for individuals who got selected to buy these machines and avail a 50% subsidy, they need to pay the entire amount upfront before subsidy is transferred to them. To pay the amount upfront, they need money which often comes only when harvest begins. “For example, about 50 lakh tonnes paddy has been harvested and those farmers would have got the money to buy the machinery if needed. We expect 170 lakh tonnes of paddy to be procured during the season. So, in areas where there was early harvest like Amritsar, Tarn Taran etc people have bought, machines have been delivered and they are also being physically verified so that subsidy can be paid. It was 9000 machines till last week, now the total number of machines delivered may have increased to over 10,000,” he said. “Farm fires will increase in areas where farm agitation is high and protests (against the new farm bills) are going on like Barnala, Sangrur, Bhatinda . No official or authorities will go there to check stubble burning, so farm fires will continue. Apart from this, less machines have been distributed to farmers this year . Not even 30% of harvesting is complete. So farm fires will peak next week in Punjab,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, Bharatiya Kisan Union general secretary, Punjab.Also Read: Farm fires increase in Punjab, Haryana despite assurances“There was hardly any wind till 7.30 am today. Now, winds are blowing in the north-westerly direction at a speed of only 5kmph. Minimum temperature has also fallen to 16.8 degree Celsius compared to normal of 19.4 degree Celsius. When wind direction is north-westerly, the impact of stubble burning in the northern states will be felt,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Since the winter segment of Grap was put in place from October 15, enforcement agencies have been keeping a close eye on polluting sources to prevent the deterioration of air quality in the coming months. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Saturday shut down seven polluting industries in Wazirpur industrial area. Apart from this, regular inspections are also being carried out to check open burning and dust. All municipalities have been ordered to ensure that water sprinkling is carried out along roadsides to settle dust. An action-taken report will be submitted by these agencies to the DPCC every fortnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farm-fires-contributing-22-to-city-s-pm2-5-load-hows-data/story-WOsKpvGJCS50gZnvAjRKIN.html
18-10-2020||Delhi||Manish Sisodia inspects sports varsity site in Mudka, says work will pick up pace||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday inspected the proposed site for the upcoming sports university in Mundka, west Delhi, and said the university, once set up, would make India proud in the world of sports. The Delhi government had last year passed the Delhi Sports University Bill to pave way for the setting up of the university. The Delhi Sports University Bill also grants the proposed university the right to establish constituent schools and colleges. These “sports schools” will identify and groom budding sporting talents at an early stage, the government had said, while the sports university will offer field-specific degrees to interested students. These would be on par with those offered in other courses at graduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels.“It is the vision of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to provide world-class facilities and training to our youth. If we do that, then our sports talents will leave no stone unturned in bringing home the laurels in international sporting events such as the Olympics,” Sisodia said. During the visit, Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said the work on the university was disrupted by the onset of the pandemic. “But now we want to pick up pace. We endeavour to ensure that the level of training and facilities at the Delhi Sports University is cutting-edge and so advanced that the best of the sporting talent can come and train in Delhi. Once this dream comes true, no world power can stop India from securing the gold medals in international sports competitions and events,” he said. Sisodia said the objective of Delhi Sports University is to promote world-class training, research, and academics in the field of sports as well as health and exercise. “It is our aim to provide multidisciplinary teaching and training in sports to ensure that sports professionals are better prepared for a wide range of employment opportunities.

This has emerged from a Thane Municipality Corporation (TMC) survey of close to a lakh people with co-morbidities.The TMC completed the first phase of door-to-door survey of over 19 lakh population under the My Family My Responsibility Survey launched by Maharashtra Government last month.Around seven lakh households were surveyed between September 18 and October 15. Each household was checked for people with low oxygen levels, Covid-19 symptoms and comorbidities.Dr Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner, said, “During the door-to-door survey, we conducted antigen testing of all those with symptoms. Around 73,897 such antigen tests were conducted in the last 20 days as part of the door-to-door survey. The main aim of the survey was early detection and isolation of patients. Accordingly, the teams visited each home within Thane city. Those with severe acute respiratory infections and Influenza-like illness were tested and timely treatment was provided.”A senior TMC officer added, “Initially we had fewer teams, around 100 every day, but gradually we increased the number of teams and each day around 500 teams was deployed. They surveyed around 25,000 to 30,000 households every day. In the last few days of the survey, close to 47,000 households were surveyed.”Even before the survey suggested by the state government was introduced, TMC claimed to have screened 24.5 lakh residents through door-to-door survey for two months. “Since July 1, we have been rigorously conducting door-to-door surveys, especially in areas with a spike in cases. This helped control the spread of the virus. Moreover, our teams have been trained to conduct the survey and efficiently undertake testing,” added Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/more-than-63k-suffer-from-respiratory-infections-influenza-like-iillness-thane-civic-body-survey/story-9ZMzN28qnmPUm4S9qgvixK.html

Most pandals are going ahead with the festivities.According to the Raigad police record, this year, the number of public pandals for Navratri are 1,467 whereas in the year 2019, it was 1,515, a drop by merely three per cent. The private celebrations, though, have reduced by over 28 per cent here.The Raigad police has deployed one platoon of State Reserve Police Force, four platoons of Riot Control Police (RCP) with 83 staff, four platoons of striking force with 40 staff, 41 staff from 14 police stations, 300 home guard, three teams of special force and seven staff from special branch of district as bandobast during Navratri in Raigad.Of the 1467 public pandals, 1,062 of them have statue of Durga, 217 have kalash installation and 188 have photo installation. Besides, 1,338 of private pandals are also organised this year of which 160 have statue, 1,115 have kalash installation and 63, photo.“Even as the reduction in number of pandals is far less, we will make sure that there is no crowding anywhere. The pandals have been given instruction to not let more than five people to visit at a time and no procession is allowed. The traditional dandiya and garba dance is also not allowed. We have made several teams of the total staff of 28 police stations and each team would patrol around five pandals,” Raigad SP, Ashok Dudhe, said.Quieter celebrations in Navi MumbaiMeanwhile, Navi Mumbai has 488 pandals this year as against last year’s 674 last year, less by 27 per cent. In Zone I, there are 211 public pandals as against 348 last year, down by 39 per cent.Fifteen police inspectors, 59 assistant police sub-inspectors, 349 staff and 75 women staff have been deployed for the bandobast of Zone I pandals.“The statues would not be more than four feet. We have also asked the pandals to display clear instructions on social distancing outside. The pandals would also be promoting the message of ‘My Family, My Responsibility’,” deputy commissioner of police, Zone I, Suresh Mengade, said. In Zone II, 277 public pandals would be installed this year as against 326 which was last year, with a bandobast of 13 police inspectors, 53 officers and 377 constables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/though-drop-in-number-pandals-in-navi-mumbai-and-raigad-go-ahead-with-navratri-festivities/story-PQ7HF8ktf6Cn6OjTVRbgJJ.html

Dean university instructions (DUI) professor RK Singla said, “NET/JRF qualified students are eligible for admissions to PhD and also those whose PU-PhD scores are still valid.”The PU-PhD entrance test is valid for five years. According to a university official, PU has received over 3,000 applications for PhD admissions this year; in 2019, 1,800 applications were received.The University Grants Commission’s (UGC) minimum standards and procedure for award of MPhil/PhD degrees says that all universities, and deemed to be universities, will admit MPhil/PhD students through an entrance test conducted at the level of an individual university or an institution deemed to be a university.PU dean research VR Sinha said, “At present, the matter is at the discussion level and we will figure out how to give equal opportunities to every candidate.”Research output to go downAs a result of this decision, the handful of PhD scholars at PU will have to bear the brunt of the varsity’s performance in various rankings as the research output will go down.A PU senator, professor Rajat Sandhir, said, “Ultimately this will impact our rankings as we have always scored the maximum from research output.”“The number of PhD enrolments in PU were already down since the UGC reduced the PhD slots for assistant and associate professors from eight each to four and six, respectively. The decision to scrap the test will impact students who will be passing out this year. Since the number of students appearing in the entrance test is anyway not too high, the university should consider holding the exam through online mode,” he added.A senior PU official said that if the situation allowed and the departments demanded, the entrance test may be conducted whenever it was possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-to-admit-phd-students-only-through-net-jrf-for-now/story-UdO7xV3g2FuummalW9UrBM.html

18-10-2020||Pune||Pune airport to start walk-in Covid-19 testing centre for international passengers||The city’s Lohegaon airport will soon start a walk-in Covid-19 testing facility for international passengers at the airport. The passengers coming to the city through the ‘Vande Bharat mission’ can get themselves tested by walking in at the centre or book a test before the flight lands. The airport will provide for a waiting period in case of molecular tests which give results within 15 minutes or opt for RT-PCR test and stay in a hotel for about 12 hours. Kuldeep Singh, director, Pune airport, said, “We are happy to announce the availability of RT-PCR testing for all passengers arriving on international flights. Any passenger who wishes to undertake the test can pre-book the test or contact the help desk in the arrival lounge.”“ An official from the district administration will also be present to escort the passenger to the testing facility. The samples will be collected and the passengers can either wait at the waiting area till the test results come or either isolate themselves in a hotel room in case of RT-PCR which takes up to 12 hours,” he said.“The facility is in strict compliance with the test protocols established by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL),” he said.In case if the Covid-19 test result is negative, the official will stamp ‘RT-PCR’ in indelible ink on the left hand added Singh. He said, “The passenger may then proceed to departure hall for connecting flight or alternatively may proceed for home quarantine. On receipt of a positive RT-PCR report, the passenger will be referred to the designated hospital under strict isolation protocols.”Pallavi Jain, managing director, Krsnaa Diagnostics Pvt Ltd, which will be running the testing centre, said, “We have molecular testing which is at par with RT-PCR standards of testing. The test results are available within 15 minutes. The testing centre will be set up at the airport premises by Tuesday.”“Earlier we had our technician deployed at the airport who used to collect samples, but now we will have a centre and people can rest in the lounge area till the test results are available. Also, the PMC officials will be informed for further quarantine and isolation purposes,” she said.“Multiple countries have now made it mandatory for a person to carry a Covid-19 test result which was done within 48 hours, but even a person who did test negative before the flight does not guarantee that the person would not have caught the infection during the journey and so these test results will help the passengers take the right decision accordingly,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-airport-to-start-walk-in-covid-19-testing-centre-for-international-passengers/story-WIhCliSVQfFetjpY8bMqmM.html
18-10-2020||Pune||After picking up in July August, liquor consumption dips in Pune region in September||With liquor shops shut since the lockdown in March and subsequent shutdown extensions due to Covid-19 pandemic, the state excise department for Pune region has pegged its losses for the industry between April and September 2020 at Rs 190 crore. Also, September witnessed a decline of 50.88 per cent of the revenue earnings for the region as the department could fetch only Rs 127.92 crore for the said month as compared to Rs 178.80 crore during the same period last year. Percentage-wise the overall decline has been at least 21.74 per cent, excise department officials said. According to state excise SP Santosh Zagade, the revenue losses have been significant in April and May due to Covid-19 lockdown. “However, September also shows revenue decline as full-fledged operations are yet to begin. The industry is recovering slowly and it will take time for revenues to come back to the original position again,” Zagade said. The state excise figures reveal that the department earned Rs 45.88 crore for April 2020 compared to Rs 121.71 crore during the same period last year; Rs 107.91 crore for May compared to Rs 140.03 crore during the same period in 2019; Rs 101.16 crore in June compared to Rs 124.77 crore during the same period in 2019; Rs 157.48 crore in July 2020 compared to Rs 160.53 crore during the same period in 2019; Rs 143.92 crore in August compared to Rs 148.50 crore during the same period last year and Rs 127.92 crore in September compared to Rs 178.80 crore during the same period last year. The total revenue earned stood at Rs 874.34 crore in 2019-2020 and Rs 684.28 crore in 2020-2021 during the corresponding period and total aggregate loss has been pegged at Rs 190.07 crore and total loss has been measured at 21.74%. The Pune unit of the Maharashtra state excise department took action against 23 establishments, including 21 hotels, one wine shop and a countrymade liquor shop, for violating social distancing guidelines and endangering the lives of customers amidst the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the past 48 hours. An aggregate fine of Rs 10,000 each was imposed on the said establishments. The total fine is estimated to be worth Rs 2.30 lakh and it will be deposited in the state treasury soon, Pune excise department officials had stated. Ikram Khan, owner of a prominent restaurant int he city, said, “The industry needs rebates and reduction in GST duties. Already 50 per cent of restaurants are not going to start in the future. Most of the establishments have taken loans and are paying EMIs. The excise department is resorting to coercive measures like using tapes to measure distance between two customers and measuring distances between two tables. If this is the scenario then the industry is doomed further. Heavy fines are being imposed for violations. The strictures are so many that better the industry be shutdown. The government must decide whether they want to shut the business or support it. At least 20 per cent of our earnings goes to the government. The government is our partner in business and it is high time that the chief minister intervenes in the matter.” Manish Thakur, owner of GB Restaurants in Hadapsar, said, “The hotel industry has been hit hard and there is no business for us. The excise duty paid by us has become next to nil as there is no business. The industry needs sops from the government and needs a tax holiday for next one year.” The Maharashtra government permitted hotels, beer bars, food malls and restaurants to reopen from October 5. The state government made it mandatory for these establishments to follow public safety norms related to the Covid-19 and accordingly issued guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection due to unnecessary crowding of citizens during normal business activities. All hotels and other hospitality units have been instructed to take suitable measures to restrict any further transmission of Covid-19 while providing the services. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) aims to minimise all possible physical contact between staff and guests and maintain social distancing and other preventive and safety measures against Covid-19.

18-10-2020||Lucknow||Created 7.6 cr mandays of work, spent Rs 7,118 cr on poor, claims UP govt||Uttar Pradesh had generated a whopping 7.6 crore plus mandays of employment and had already utilised Rs 7,118 crore under the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan (GKRA) since its launch earlier this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, said state’s additional chief secretary (ACS) for rural development and panchayati raj departments, Manoj Kumar Singh. The employment was created under projects such as ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’, ‘Chief Minister Awas Yojana’, ‘Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana’, ‘Panchayat Ghar’ scheme, and those related to community toilets’ construction, minor irrigation, horticulture and forestry projects, he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the scheme on June 20 this year to alleviate the economic distress caused to migrant workers and rural population due to Covid-19. The scheme contained multiple provisions for immediate assistance and also employment and livelihood opportunities, Singh added.Uttar Pradesh witnessed the highest level of reverse migration with an estimated 3.7 million (37 lakh) migrant workers returning from other states during the lockdown, according to official estimates.“The state is working towards creating an ecosystem to enable migrant workers and vulnerable families to sustain and promote livelihoods. To this effect, the state has been engaged in the collection and analysis of data of returnee migrants, skill mapping of migrants to link them to the industries as well as creating opportunities at the local level. To give a perspective, skill mapping of about 30 lakh returned migrant workers was undertaken,” said Singh giving a glimpse of the exercise undertaken by the state.The rural development and panchayati raj departments have been in the thick of action since the migrants’ reverse exodus began.Also Read: UP government clears Rs 1,960 crore festive bonanza for state employeesSingh said owing to the concerted efforts by the state, there was an unprecedented rise in the number of people employed under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).“Around 62.5 lakh labourers were employed in a single day on June 26 on the launch of the Self-Reliant Uttar Pradesh Employment Campaign. So far, wages of Rs 4,500 crore have been disbursed in the last four months to workers in the state, which is almost equal to the entire wage disbursed in the last financial year,” he said.Also Read: UP: Five, including brother of main accused, held for firing at Ballia meetingSingh added that under the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan, the UP government had taken up construction of more than 30,000 community sanitation complexes in 31 districts of the state.“Initiatives like these will be the key to providing livelihood to our migrant population. This pandemic is far from over and as we continue to battle against it, we are determined not to lose sight of the larger picture of ensuring inclusive development,” the bureaucrat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/created-7-6-cr-mandays-of-work-spent-rs-7-118-cr-on-poor-claims-up-govt/story-0Z4XYMTRDum9RPgIqYWjJP.html

In March, a passenger bus tumbled off a winding mountainous road and into a ravine in northern Pakistan, killing at least 19 people and injuring several others.Landslides after heavy monsoon rain are also common in the country and cause widespread damage mountainous areas.Skardu is located in a complex of mountain ranges that includes the Himalayas, and the town is the gateway to K2, the world’s highest peak after Mt. Everest. Large numbers of local and foreign tourists visit the peak annually. Skardu is around 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/landslide-in-northern-pakistan-buries-bus-16-killed/story-2m6HzAjpfRJCZxy00JznZN.html
18-10-2020||World||Young US poll workers brace for Election Day as virus fears keep elders home||After scrambling to replace an aging force of most at risk poll workers from the coronavirus, US election officials face the challenge of running the Nov 3 voting with untested volunteers tasked with following strict health protocols in an intensely partisan environment.A nationwide drive that recruited hundreds of thousands of younger poll workers - the people who set up equipment, check in voters and process ballots, means most battleground states will not be understaffed, a Reuters review of Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin found.In nearly all of those states, more poll workers than the 2016 presidential election have already been recruited, according to data from the US Election Assistance Commission, state election officials and private poll worker recruitment campaigns. Wisconsin did not have complete data.The new poll workers must be trained not only in the usual election tasks but also issues uniquely relevant in 2020, such as how to handle voters who violate Covid-19 safety rules and ways to de-escalate political confrontations.In a year that has seen armed militia members confront protesters, some voting rights advocates worry gun toting groups will show up outside polling places.They are also concerned by a highly unusual drive by Republicans to deploy thousands of poll watchers as part of efforts to find evidence to support President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud.Though more than 20 million Americans have already cast ballots and many others still expect to vote early in person or by mail, roughly a third to almost half of voters in critical battleground states plan to vote on Nov. 3, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.“The multitude and magnitude of issues poll workers are going to have to deal with in this election are unprecedented,” said Aaron Ockerman, executive director of the Ohio Association of Election Officials.Their success in handling those situations could mean the difference between a confidence inspiring election between Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden or the turbulence seen during primaries earlier this year when thousands of older poll workers quit amid Covid-19 concerns.In Wisconsin, a dramatic reduction in polling places caused by a lack of poll workers in April forced voters to risk their health by standing in lines for hours to cast a ballot.As those problems became apparent, election officials and activist groups including the student run Poll Hero Project and Power the Polls - a coalition of voting rights, civic and corporate organizations - began seeking volunteers to step into the breach.The new recruits are far younger than usual. Of the more than 920,000 poll workers nationwide in the 2016 election, more than 56% of them were above the age of 60, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.By contrast, nearly 90% of the more than 650,000 poll workers that have been referred to local officials this year by Power the Polls are under the age of 65, said co-founder Robert Brandon. The Poll Hero Project has recruited more than 31,000 students, more than half of them high school students, said co-founder Ella Gantman, 19, a student at Princeton University.Election officials said the widespread interest in working the polls has been encouraging and challenging.In Michigan’s rural Isabella County, Clerk Minde Lux said she hired and trained her poll workforce months ago, but her office is still being inundated with calls from prospective poll workers through a recruitment program run by the secretary of state’s office. She said she has no more time or money to train additional volunteers.“We’re just trying to keep our heads above the water, but then people get mad at us, like, ‘Oh, you don’t want us to work the polls,’“ she said.Jacob Major, 17, is one of the new faces who will work the polls in his Milwaukee neighbourhood. Major, who now leads the Poll Hero Project’s Wisconsin campaign, said many of the recent recruits are vulnerable to last-minute cancellations because young people have less control over their lives. He also is anxious that the city has not yet told him when his training will take place.Too young to cast a ballot himself, Major said nothing will keep him from showing up on Election Day.“Being a poll worker and helping so many young people to sign up as poll workers is my way of voting,” he said.In Milwaukee, where the decision to cut the number of polling places from 180 to five in the primary because of lack of poll workers led to disarray, the number of polling places on Nov. 3 will be back up to at least 173, said Jonatan Zuniga, deputy director of the Milwaukee City Election Commission.Zuniga said nearly 2,600 new poll workers had signed up for training and another 1,000 veteran workers would return, resulting in a big increase over the 2,653 poll workers the city had in 2016, according to data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.Yet with Covid-19 cases rising in Wisconsin, Zuniga said he planned to create a pool of 200 standby workers who would be dispatched on Nov 3 if others do not show up.“We’ll be monitoring that and see how many back out,” he said. “But right now we’re in good shape.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/young-us-poll-workers-brace-for-election-day-as-virus-fears-keep-elders-home/story-fusKVq3VEG8dLAnq07LiWJ.html
18-10-2020||World||Damage from August wind storm in Midwest at $7.5B||Damage estimates from a rare wind storm that slammed Iowa and some other parts of the Midwest in August are growing, with the total now at $7.5 billion, according to a new report.The August 10 storm hit Iowa hard but also caused damage in Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota and Indiana. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it’s currently the second-costliest US disaster so far in 2020, although cost estimates for widespread wildfires along the West Coast aren’t yet available.The storm, known as a derecho, generated winds of up to 140 mph (225 kph) that flattened millions of acres of crops. The derecho also knocked out power to half a million Iowa residents and damaged homes, trees and power lines. Four people died as the storm moved across the Midwest.The most expensive disaster so far this year was Hurricane Laura, which caused $14 billion in damage when it hit the Gulf Coast in August, according to the NOAA research.National Weather Service meteorologist Allan Curtis told the Des Moines Register that the derecho caused such extensive damage because it lasted for roughly 14 hours and hit crops when they were especially vulnerable. He said the damage would have been significantly less if the derecho had occurred in the spring, before crops were tall enough to be caught by the wind.“If you were looking to exert the most damage on corn crops when it comes to thunderstorms and heavy winds, when the derecho rolled through in August, it was the perfect time to do it,” Curtis said.The US Agriculture Department has estimated that Iowa farmers will be unable to harvest at least 850,000 acres (343,983 hectares) of crops this fall because of the damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/damage-from-august-wind-storm-in-midwest-at-7-5b/story-QVHJHxJcUV4hG8vyJYYaMK.html
18-10-2020||World||Healthcare workers, high-risk people will get priority for Covid-19 vaccine in New York: Governor||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that healthcare workers and high-risk populations, including some long-term care residents, would get priority in his state to receive a Covid-19 vaccine when one is approved and available.According to the five-phase preliminary plan for New York’s vaccine administration program, some details of which Cuomo announced at a news briefing, healthcare workers in patient-care settings, long-term care facility workers and some long-term care residents would be among the first to receive a vaccine.In the second phase of vaccine rollout, first responders, school staff, other public-facing frontline workers and people whose health conditions put them at extreme risk would get priority for the vaccine. In Phase 3, it would be administered to people over 65. All remaining essential workers would receive the vaccine in a fourth phase, and healthy adults and children would receive it in a fifth phase.Prioritization would also vary by geographic location based on the prevalence of the virus, Cuomo said.“This is a larger operational undertaking, I would argue, than anything we have done during Covid to date,” he told reporters.The program will likely seek to deliver some 40 million doses of a vaccine to state residents, as New York’s population is around 20 million and the vaccines in development may require two doses to be effective, Cuomo said.He said the state had sent the drafted plan to the federal government, along with questions on what funding the federal government would provide for the effort.“States cannot do this on their own,” he said.A New York state task force will carry out its own review of coronavirus vaccines authorized or approved by the federal government due to concerns of politicization of the approval process, according to Cuomo, a Democrat who has blasted President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“I think that will give people added surety in the vaccine,” Cuomo said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/healthcare-workers-high-risk-people-will-get-priority-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-new-york-governor/story-o7SKYveYkCGcNOvbHgnT3J.html

18-10-2020||World||Chinese forces prepare for possible military invasion of Taiwan||The presence of the People’s Liberation Army is increasing in China’s southeast coast as it prepares for a possible military invasion of Taiwan, according to the defense observers cited by the South China Morning Post.According to the sources, Beijing is replacing its old DF-11s and DF-15s and deploying its most advanced hypersonic missile DF-17 in the region.“The DF-17 hypersonic missile will gradually replace the old DF-11s and DF-15s that were deployed in the southeast region for decades,” the source was quoted by SCMP. “The new missile has a longer range and is able to hit targets more accurately.”Even though Taiwan has never been controlled by China’s ruling party, Chinese authorities insist that the self-governing island is an integral part of their territory, with president Xi Jinping refusing to rule out a military force to capture it if necessary.According to the Canada-based Kanwa Defence Review, satellite images show that both the Marine Corps and Rocket Force bases in Fujian and Guangdong have expanded.“Every rocket force brigade in Fujian and Guangdong is now fully equipped,” the report said.“The size of some of the missile bases in the Eastern and Southern theatre commands have even doubled in recent years, showing the PLA is stepping up preparations for a war targeting Taiwan,” the further stated.The information regarding the possible deployment of hypersonic missile comes amid heightened tensions between China and the US, with issues pertaining to disagreements over Taiwan and the COVID-19 pandemic.On Tuesday, the Chinese President during a visit to a military base in the southern province of Guangdong had instructed troops to “put their minds and energy on preparing for war”, according to news agency Xinhua.During an inspection of the PLA’s Marine Corps in Chaozhou City, Xinhua said Xi told the soldiers to “maintain a state of high alert” and called on them to be “absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable”.China in recent years has also increased military drills around Taiwan, with almost 40 Chinese warplanes crossing the median line between the mainland and Taiwan on September 18-19 -- one of several sorties the island’s President Tsai Ing-wen called a “threat of force.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-forces-prepare-for-possible-military-invasion-of-taiwan/story-Fvxh3fP3WNcHv6gPzFGnfO.html
18-10-2020||World||Economy, pandemic overshadow climate for young US voters||The two dozen students who signed up for air pollution expert James Goldstene’s advanced environmental studies class all say they are deeply passionate about fighting climate change.But when it comes to voting in the US presidential election, many said climate change was not their top issue.Their priorities ahead of the Nov. 3 election reflect those of the wider electorate: the battered US economy, the Covid-19 pandemic and racial justice.“I know everybody’s biggest issue right now within this class is environment. And it’s super important to me but another thing that I feel is more important personally because I’m an African-American woman is race,” said Kelia Surrency, 23.“The environment is 100% important to me, but I need someone in that office that doesn’t look at the Black community as lesser than.”Many in the class at California State University, Sacramento, were having trouble finding entry-level jobs or internships in the Covid wrecked economy, said Goldstene, a former top California air pollution regulator.“With Covid going on and a lot of people losing their jobs and struggling, worrying about how they are going to pay for stuff. I think that does overshadow climate,” said another student, Enrique Dominguez, 23.The students’ views illustrate how climate change, even when an issue of great voter concern, is eclipsed by other problems.“Our attention span is limited,” said Joe Arvai, director of the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Southern California. “Unless your house is on fire, you’re not going to be experiencing climate change firsthand.”Only 7% of likely voters aged 34 and under named environment and climate as their top concern in choosing a president, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 13. Among likely voters of all ages, only 4% prioritized climate and environment.By comparison, Covid-19 was the top concern for 25% of young voters, while jobs and the economy were named by 20%. Nevertheless, Democratic candidate Joe Biden has made climate change a campaign priority, his campaign said.The campaign sees young voters as important to Biden’s chances of winning the election -- a major challenge given the typically low turnout by the demographic. In 2016, turnout among voters under the age of 30 was about 46%, according to the US Census Bureau. By comparison, 71% of those 65 and older voted.Aware of voters’ worries about the economy, public health and systemic racism, Biden’s campaign has wrapped environmental issues into a broader discussion of green jobs and a healthier environment.“When you look at a really deep issue like climate, there’s no way to separate it in your solution from the interconnected and overlapping issues like job creation, economic growth, prosperity, and also health,” said climate activist and billionaire Tom Steyer, who is advising Biden on environmental issues.Biden has endorsed a $2 trillion plan to promote clean energy and repair infrastructure.His campaign has released several digital ads aimed at young people that mention climate, mostly in the context of other issues, and an online youth engagement meeting focused heavily on jobs and the economy.Biden’s campaign released a television ad focusing exclusively on climate, but it was aimed at farmers rather than young people.“Joe Biden recognizes that our country is grappling with four intersecting crises — the raging pandemic, economic collapse, persistent racial injustice, and existential threat of climate change — and is exactly why he has outlined an integrated, ambitious, and bold agenda to ensure we tackle these crises together,” said spokesman Matt Hill.President Donald Trump has sought to frame Biden’s climate plans as a radical leftist agenda that would cost too much and hurt economic growth. By contrast, his campaign has said it would continue to ease business restrictions to boost the economy.His campaign has also invoked the environment, arguing that Trump’s pro-industry policies have led to lower carbon emissions.“President Trump’s record on the environment proves you can have energy independence and a clean, healthy environment without destroying the economy, overregulating, or burdening American taxpayers,” Trump spokeswoman Samantha Zager said. “The president will continue to rely on policies of innovation and competition.”The emissions reductions noted by Trump’s campaign were driven largely by the retirement of coal plants. Air quality also continued to improve under Trump following the same trajectory as in previous Republican and Democratic administrations.It would be a mistake to ignore young voters’ concerns about the environment, said Ben Wessel, head of the youth outreach group NextGen America founded by Steyer. Stronger campaign messages on climate could draw more young voters to the polls, he said.That could be the case for Goldstene’s student Michaela Gallagher, 24. Alarmed by climate change, she says she is leaning toward casting a ballot for the Democrat because she feels he will do more than Trump for the environment. But she also might vote for a third-party candidate or skip voting.“I’m all over the place about it,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/economy-pandemic-overshadow-climate-for-young-us-voters/story-LsMGEkAZDbGvkX9kNoCb4M.html
18-10-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden are campaigning across country from each other||President Donald Trump made a rare visit to church Sunday as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden campaigned across the country from one another in key states with the November 3 election close at hand.Trump was attending services at the nondenominational International Church of Las Vegas before raising money in Newport Beach, California, and holding an evening rally in Carson City, Nevada. Biden’s schedule put him in North Carolina for a voter mobilization event in Durham and a virtual meeting with African American faith leaders. In the morning, he worshipped at a church in Wilmington, Delaware.For Trump, it was a return to a church he had visited as a candidate in October, 2016. At that time, he received a prayer on stage and toured an affiliated Christian school, seeing students and delivering remarks on alternatives to traditional public schools.Biden went to St. Joseph’s on the Brandywine, as he does nearly every week. He and his wife, Jill, entered wearing dark-colored face masks. She carried a bunch of flowers that including pink roses.The church is a few minutes’ drive from Biden’s home. Biden’s son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, is buried in the cemetery on its grounds. Joe and Jill Biden visited the grave after the service.If elected, Biden would be only the second Roman Catholic president in U.S. history and first since John F. Kennedy. Biden speaks frequently about his faith and its importance in his life.Trump attends church far less often, but has drawn strong support from white Evangelical leaders and frequently hosts groups of pastors at the White House.Trailing in national and pivotal battleground state polls with just over two weeks until Election Day, Trump has kept a more robust schedule since returning campaigning after contracting the coronavirus.Trump enters the final stretch of the campaign at a steep financial advantage — a highly unusual predicament for an incumbent. After building a massive cash edge early in the race his campaign spent lavishly. Biden kept expenses low and benefited from an outpouring of donations that saw him raise nearly $1 billion over the past three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-are-campaigning-across-country-from-each-other/story-N5cjEcUG8sAGZC0ki1WWJJ.html
18-10-2020||World||Pak fails to fulfil 6 key mandates of FATF; no action against Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed||Pakistan’s failure to fulfil six key obligations of the FATF, including action against two of India’s most wanted terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, and the sudden disappearance of more than 4,000 terrorists from its official list will most likely lead to its continuation in the ‘grey list’ of the Global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, officials said on Sunday. The virtual plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to be held on October 21-23, will take the final call on Pakistan’s continuation on its grey list after a thorough review of Islamabad’s performance in fulfilling the global commitments and standards in the fight against money laundering and terror financing. The FATF had given Pakistan a total of 27 action plan obligations for completely checking terror financing of which so far it has cleared 21 but has failed in some of the key tasks, an official privy to the developments said. The mandates which Pakistan has failed include action against all UN-designated terrorists like Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Azhar, Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Saeed and the outfit’s operational commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi. Besides, FATF has strongly noted the fact that there was sudden disappearance of the names of more than 4,000 terrorists from its original list of 7,600 under Schedule IV of its Anti Terrorism Act. “Under these circumstances, it is almost certain that Pakistan will continue in the FATF grey list,” the official said. Also, the four nominating countries — the United States, Britain, France and Germany — are also not satisfied with Islamabad’s commitment to taking strong action against the terror groups operating from its soil. Azhar, Saeed and Lakhvi are most wanted terrorists in India for their involvement in numerous terrorist acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror strikes and the bombing of a CRPF bus at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir last year. With Pakistan’s continuation in the grey list, it is increasingly becoming difficult for Islamabad to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the neighbouring country which is in a precarious financial situation. The FATF will also judge if competent authorities in Pakistan were cooperating and taking action to identify and taking enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services and had proven implementation of cross-border currency and bearer negotiable instruments controls at all ports of entry, including applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. The country’s outstanding action areas also include effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services, another official said. The FATF plenary was earlier scheduled in June, but Pakistan got an unexpected breather after the global watchdog against financial crimes temporarily postponed all mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines in the wake of grave health risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The watchdog also put a general pause in the review process, thus giving additional four months to Pakistan to meet the requirements. Pakistan needed 12 votes out of 39 to exit the grey list and move to the white list. To avoid the blacklist, it needs the support of three countries. China, Turkey and Malaysia are its consistent supporters. Currently, North Korea and Iran are on the FATF blacklist. Pakistan was placed on the grey list by the FATF in June 2018 and was given a plan of action to complete it by October 2019. Since then, the country continues to be on that list due to its failure to comply with the FATF mandates. The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terror financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF currently has 39 members, including two regional organisations -- the European Commission and Gulf Cooperation Council. India is a member of the FATF consultations and its Asia Pacific Group.

18-10-2020||World||China likely to show Covid-19 recovery economically with fresh GDP numbers||China is about to show the world that its economy is pulling further out of the chasm created by the coronavirus, setting it apart from other nations struggling to avoid renewed lockdowns.Gross domestic product for the third quarter -- due Monday -- is forecast to come in at a 5.5% expansion from a year earlier, recovering all of the lost ground from the historic contraction in the first three months of the year.Global trade has been an unexpectedly strong driver for the world’s second-largest economy, and even still-cautious domestic consumers are becoming more confident. That returning optimism is based on the nation’s success in keeping the virus practically at bay despite an occasional cluster emerging.“Right now, China has basically put Covid-19 under control,” People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said on Sunday in a webinar organized by the Group of 30. “In general, the Chinese economy remains resilient with great potential. Continued recovery is anticipated which will benefit the global economy.”Yet even amid the strengthening domestic recovery, the prospect of renewed closures amid spiking infection rates in Europe and elsewhere comes with uncertain prospects for China, which has relied on exports and manufacturing to help spur its rebound. September data for industrial production, retail sales, investment and unemployment will give a clearer reading of underlying momentum.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..“Improving consumer sentiment and consumption likely also boosted private demand. Leading indicators indicate demand is coming back at a faster pace than production at this stage of the recovery.”--Chang Shu, chief Asia economist. For the full note click hereElsewhere, at least nine central banks from Russia to Mozambique deliver interest-rate decisions, while European activity indicators could signal growth is petering out.US and CanadaIn the US, figures on residential construction starts, previously owned home sales and weekly unemployment benefit applications are the highlights of a relatively quiet week for economic data. In addition, the Federal Reserve will issue its Beige Book -- a collection of economic and business activity assessments within each of the central bank’s 12 regions.In Canada, investors will be watching for Monday’s release of the central bank’s business outlook survey as well as inflation data on Wednesday. Those reports will set up the October 28 rate decision.Europe, Middle East, AfricaThis week will offer more evidence of the euro area’s fading recovery, with flash PMIs forecast to weaken again in October. Those numbers will follow another flurry of European Central Bank speakers, giving investors final hints into their thinking before a quiet period sets in ahead of the ECB rate decision on October 29.In the UK, inflation is set to rebound after the expiry of the government’s Eat Out to Help Out restaurant support program. Markets will also be closely watching Bank of England speeches for clues on a potential stimulus top-up early in November.Hungary’s central bank holds its monthly and weekly rate decisions within the space of two days, with investors hoping for clarity about whether the two will move in tandem or diverge. Ukraine, meanwhile, will announce its key policy rate amid rising uncertainty over its independence, cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and a virus spike.The Bank of Israel may cut its key rate below the current level of 0.1%, or opt to expand government bond purchases, as the country starts to emerge from a second national lockdown.In Turkey, the central bank could hike for the second time in less than a month as inflation remains near double digits and real interest rates are still negative. The Bank of Russia is expected to stay on hold, but investors are watching closely for signs of whether its easing cycle is coming to an end amid the plunge in the ruble.Namibia’s central bank will probably keep its key rate unchanged, after its South African counterpart did the same last month. Namibia’s benchmark is already lower than its neighbor’s, which could threaten the country’s reserves and currency peg.Mozambique may also stay on hold because inflation has been ticking up. Uganda’s central bank may have some scope for easing as inflation started slowing and the economy is now projected by the IMF to contract this year.AsiaAside from Chinese GDP, other key releases in the region include Japan export figures and early Korean data for October, which will give the latest indication of how global trade is picking up.Likewise, Japan’s PMI reading will offer a picture of how the manufacturing and service sectors are recovering. Inflation data is likely to show prices still falling there.Latin AmericaMexico’s September unemployment report out Wednesday may show a third month of marginal improvement after joblessness rose to a near decade-high in June. A sluggish recovery that’s losing momentum suggests the trend level will remain elevated for some time.Mid-month readings of inflation should find prices just within the target range in Mexico, while Brazil has a bit more room to spare even as its headline number may have nearly doubled since May.As to output and demand, Argentina’s activity index looks set to post a sixth straight double-digit decline and Mexico’s retail sales report will underscore the scope of the demand-shock there.Lastly, Brazil’s current account balance report out Friday may draw more than passing interest. The billions spent to prop up cash-strapped households all but ensures a record budget gap this year, and investors and credit rating companies have taken note of government in-fighting over austerity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-likely-to-show-covid-19-recovery-economically-with-fresh-gdp-numbers/story-oJzniFlgmtUvdPmdHZxTTO.html
18-10-2020||World||Ardern’s stunning election victory holds lessons for the US||Jacinda Ardern’s emphatic election victory is seen as an endorsement of an inclusive brand of leadership that may ripple beyond New Zealand’s borders.In an age of populism and confrontation, Ardern’s message of empathy and kindness married with skillful crisis management won her Labour Party its biggest share of the vote in more than 70 years. That contrasts starkly with the divisive politics in the US as Donald Trump and Joe Biden face off for the presidency on Nov. 3.“Ardern’s approach could be a lesson for other leaders seeking to maximize their support base,” said Zareh Ghazarian, senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Monash University in Melbourne. “Not only has she been able to lead the nation through very challenging circumstances, but also successfully communicate an overall vision. In New Zealand it’s about the politics of inclusion.”Ardern, 40, won international plaudits for her response to the deadly shootings at two mosques in 2019, donning a headscarf as a mark of respect as she mourned with the Muslim community. This year, she’s demonstrated her steel in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, enacting one of the world’s strictest lockdowns to crush community transmission.She rode the resulting wave of adulation to secure the first outright majority in parliament since New Zealand introduced proportional representation in 1996. Labour won 49% of the vote and 64 of the 120 seats in parliament. The scale of the victory may fuel her global appeal among those who already view her as a standard-bearer for liberal values.Ardern is now in a position to lead New Zealand’s most left-leaning government in decades but has yet to decide whether to include her ally the Green Party, which wants more action on issues such as poverty and climate change.Ironically, her increased mandate may prompt her to rein in her left-leaning instincts as she looks to hang on to the Center-Right voters who have flocked to her banner.“It’s going to be a huge dilemma for her, whether to go to the left or stay in that Center ground,” said Lara Greaves, a lecturer in New Zealand politics at the University of Auckland. “Does she want to try to be a four term Prime Minister or does she want to make transformational policy that changes people’s lives?”Her re-election spells continuity in a nuanced foreign-policy stance toward China. Ardern has tried not to antagonize New Zealand’s largest trading partner while maintaining close ties with the U.S. and other western allies in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance.Her focus will be on the enormous economic and social challenges ahead as New Zealand charts a recovery from recession.The border is expected to remain closed well into 2021, decimating international tourism and education, while the jobless rate is projected to climb. Economists at Infometrics last week flagged the risk of another recession in 2021.The nation faces persistent budget deficits and net debt that will surge to 56% of gross domestic product by 2026 from 28% in mid 2020, according to Treasury forecasts.Labour said it will impose a 39% tax on income over NZ$180,000 ($119,000) to help pay for the Covid response and keep debt under control. It aims to stimulate investment and create jobs through major infrastructure projects and incentives for small business.Voters rewarded Ardern for her successful response to Covid-19, which stands in stark contrast to countries like the U.K., U.S. and even neighbouring Australia where authorities are still battling to contain the virus.Ardern stood out among her western peers in pursuing an explicit elimination strategy, and imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world. This shuttered the economy but wiped out community spread of the virus, allowing restrictions to be removed sooner than in many other countries. A second outbreak in largest city Auckland was also quickly stamped out with a regional lockdown, though one new community case was reported Sunday.“The way the Prime Minister has put health before the economy will be of interest, especially for other social democratic leaders around the world,” said Bryce Edwards, a political analyst at Victoria University in Wellington. “They will now see Ardern as the leader of those left parties internationally and they will want to learn from her.”Asked Sunday if she had a message for Americans as they head into their own election, Ardern said it wasn’t her place to comment.“But my hope as someone who has, of course, a strong interest in politics is that we have elections globally where we try and move beyond the divisive nature that elections can sometimes bring, because that can be damaging for democracy,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ardern-s-stunning-election-victory-holds-lessons-for-the-us/story-HAVvL5cXBGIimeNeO0efLL.html
18-10-2020||World||Protesters in Thailand carry on despite police warning||Thousands of mainly young Thais were back on the streets of Bangkok on Sunday for a fifth straight day of protests demanding sweeping political change, with demonstrations also taking place at several other locations around the country.The demonstrators, who are protesting despite a state of emergency banning them from doing so, received a new warning from police that they are violating the law. On Saturday, however, few people had been arrested as peaceful rallies were held at several points around Bangkok, the capital, with several thousand taking part.The protest movement — which is calling for the prime minister’s resignation, a more democratic constitution and a reformed monarchy — began in March at universities around the country. After a lull due to the coronavirus crisis, it was revived in late July, building up strength, particularly in Bangkok.On Sunday, rallies were called in at least a dozen provinces, including Chiang Mai, a popular tourist destination in northern Thailand. Social media spread the word, though the government said it would seek legal action against accounts posting details of planned protests.The rallies in Bangkok again drew large crowds, perhaps as many as 10,000 in all, despite the official warnings and intermittent rain.“If we are together we have a better chance to win, but if we let people fight alone there will be less chance to win,” a 24-year-old protester who called herself Pear said at a rally at the busy Asoke intersection, located in the commercial heart of the capital. “So we are here to express ourselves, what we are wanting and what we are expecting for the future as well.”The larger rally in Bangkok was held at Victory Monument, a popular meeting point that anchors a traffic circle on a main thoroughfare. The atmosphere there was jumpy due to occasional rumors that police had been spotted nearby.The authorities tried in vain to keep people from gathering by selectively shutting down stations on Bangkok’s elevated and underground mass transit lines. On Saturday, after protest organizers urged followers to meet at the city’s Skytrain stations, they had ordered all stations to be closed, to little avail.The current cycle of confrontations began before dawn Thursday, when police broke up an overnight rally outside Government House, which hosts the offices of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. It led Prayuth to declare a state of emergency, banning gatherings of more than five people and allowing the government extra powers to keep the peace.Protesters ignored the emergency decree and gathered Thursday night in large numbers at a major intersection in Bangkok’s central shopping district, overcoming half-hearted resistance by thin lines of police.A Friday night rally at a nearby intersection was crushed by a large force of riot police backed by truck-mounted water cannons. The use of force was condemned by rights organizations.Police made no efforts to break up Saturday’s gatherings, which ended peacefully at 8 p.m., as scheduled by organizers.A statement issued late Saturday night by Prayuth’s office said the government had acted within the law in seeking to stop the rallies and did not intend to deny people their rights.“The situation is very dynamic at the moment,” police deputy spokesperson Kissana Phatanacharoen said at a Sunday morning news conference. “There is no formula as to what we do or what we don’t do.”He said that if people failed to obey the law, police would be compelled to enforce it.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule and passed in a referendum in which campaigning against it was illegal is undemocratic.The protest movement became particularly controversial when it adopted reform of the monarchy as a demand. The protesters want it to act within the checks and balances of democracy.The monarchy has long been considered sacrosanct in Thailand, and is protected by a law that makes defaming the royal institution punishable by a prison term of three to 15 years. The issue has angered Thailand’s conservative establishment, especially the army, which considers protecting the monarchy to be one of its main duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-in-thailand-carry-on-despite-police-warning/story-gHQ1Wz1q4YQ4mOOUUnoV3N.html
18-10-2020||World||Vladimir Putin to hold video chat with business leaders this week||Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to have a video conference with the country’s leading business lobby group as executives seek to discuss the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and possible tax increases.The president will meet members of the bureau of Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The organization unites the biggest companies in the country and their owners.The business leaders expect that they will have an opportunity to talk about recent tax changes as well as about Russia’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, two people from companies whose leaders are due to attend the video conference said. The meeting is tentatively planned for October 21, they said.Putin usually meets with top executives and tycoons every spring during the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs business week. That event was cancelled this year due to pandemic.Russia plans to more than triple mineral extraction taxes next year to help to cover the budget gap opened by the pandemic. The tax increase covers most metals and fertilizers. Coal, gold and silver will be excluded from the measure, while the government plans a separate diamond-mining tax linked to the sales price of gems. Taxes and regulations for oil companies are also changing.Virus infections in Russia have surged in recent weeks, with daily tallies surpassing peak levels reached in the spring. Fallout from the pandemic contributed to a deep slump in the second quarter, though the Russian economy bounced back over the summer after many virus lockdown restrictions were lifted. Industrial production will probably only shrink 4.5% for the full year, while manufacturing will contract 2%, according to Industry Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-to-hold-video-chat-with-business-leaders-this-week/story-msltly0z8F204vO028MLsK.html

At least four of those detained are family members of the attacker, who had been granted 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March, was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun, which fires plastic pellets.His half-sister joined the Islamic State group in Syria in 2014, Ricard said. He didn’t give her name, and it wasn’t clear where she is now.The prosecutor said a text claiming responsibility and a photograph of the victim were found on the suspect’s phone. He also confirmed that a Twitter account under the name Abdoulakh A belonged to the suspect. It posted a photo of the decapitated head minutes after the attack along with the message “I have executed one of the dogs from hell who dared to put Muhammad down.”The beheading has upset moderate French Muslims. A group of imams in the Lyon region are holding a special meeting Sunday to discuss together what the group called “the appalling assassination of our compatriot by a terrorist who in the name of an uncertain faith committed the irreparable.”The attack has provoked global condemnation. US President Donald Trump addressed the killing Saturday night from a political rally in Janesville, Wisconsin.“On behalf of the United States, I’d like to extend my really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President (Emmanuel) Macron of France, where they just yesterday had a vicious, vicious Islamic terrorist attack — beheading an innocent teacher near Paris,” he said. “France is having a hard time and Macron’s a great guy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-demonstrations-to-pay-tribute-to-beheaded-teacher/story-APeywfS1fytj9PmhYpCfhL.html

18-10-2020||World||Can Lindsey Graham lose South Carolina? A Senate upset is possible||An epic political battle is cresting in South Carolina, where Senator Lindsey Graham, a presidential ally, is neck-and-neck with an African-American challenger two decades his junior, raising Democratic hopes of snatching a Senate seat in Trump country.Out-fundraised by Democrat Jaime Harrison, and glued to Donald Trump’s hip on issues like immigration and Supreme Court nominations, Graham is under threat like never before in a state where his Republican Party has controlled the local legislature, governor’s mansion, and both US Senate seats for at least the last 15 years.With Trump’s fortunes sinking along with his poll numbers, Democrats are eyeing potential flips in several other states as they seek to reclaim control of the Senate. But suddenly South Carolina, a traditionally conservative bastion that Harrison describes as a legacy of the slave holding “old South”, is in play, despite Graham’s repeated claims that both he and Trump will win re-election in 17 days.“Lindsey Graham’s scared,” Harrison told a crowd Saturday in North Charleston, where supporters honked their approval at a drive-in campaign event to allow social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.“He is nervous, and he should be,” the 44-year-old Harrison added. “Because the people of South Carolina are about to give him a one-way ticket back home!”A Harrison victory would send shock waves through American politics, notably because South Carolina -- where the opening shots of the Civil War were fired in 1861 -- would become the first US state ever represented by two Black senators at the same time. The state’s other senator, Tim Scott, is Republican.Harrison, whose aunt died of Covid-19 this year, recalled growing up in poverty, doing his homework in the dark when his family could not pay the electricity bill.“I know what hard times is,” the Yale graduate and former head of the South Carolina Democratic Party said, invoking the lilt of his grandparents who helped raise him.“On November 3, the people of South Carolina are going to close the book on the Old South, and write a brand new book called the ‘New South,’“ one of boldness, diversity and inclusion, Harrison said as the car horns reached a crescendo.“And out of the ashes, we will rise like a phoenix.”With his position at risk, the 65-year-old Graham campaigned Friday in the Palmetto State, stepping off a campaign bus bearing a larger-than-life image of the senator, only to highlight how he is being outspent by Harrison, who raised a staggering record $57 million in the third quarter.“Help me pay for the bus!” he pleaded, only half-jokingly, to a few dozen supporters in an otherwise deserted parking lot near Charleston.Most of them appeared to be connected to Graham’s campaign or the party apparatus, offering a striking contrast to the rowdier Harrison campaign event.Why is a conservative star who has the president’s ear and is helping guide Trump’s nominee onto the Supreme Court in jeopardy in ruby red South Carolina?Democrats and some Republicans point to Graham’s reversals on two key issues.He loathed Trump in 2016, then embraced him after he won the presidency. He also vowed to oppose confirming a new justice in an election year, only to become a fierce advocate for Amy Coney Barrett’s Senate confirmation before the election.“What has happened is Lindsey Graham has shot himself in the foot. That’s why it’s close,” Johnnie Cordero, who chairs the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Black caucus, said in a telephone interview.Graham’s supporters say South Carolinians will look past his flip-flops.“I think the Republicans are going to forgive him for those things. Things change over time,” said 68-year-old Debra Bays, a party volunteer who is door knocking for Trump and Graham.South Carolina is changing, too. Immigrants are moving to the state, and the low country along the coast is now decidedly purple.Lawyer Bennett Crites, who cast his ballot Friday at an early voting location in North Charleston, said there are many South Carolinians “disappointed in the job that Graham has done.”“So it would be a shocker if (Harrison) pulled it off, but it wouldn’t surprise me either,” he added.Despite polls showing Trump trailing Biden and RealClearPolitics labeling South Carolina’s Senate contest a toss-up, Graham insisted the prospects of re-election for him and Trump, whose toxic tone has irritated the senator, are improving.“He can be a handful who can get in the way of his own success,” Graham told AFP, but the presidency is no “personality contest” either.“As we get closer to voting day there’s a comparison going on, of where the country will go under his leadership versus that of the Democratic Party, and I think it’s getting better for us by the day.”Graham elbow bumped his supporters but wore a mask as they snapped selfies while he attacked Democrats as promoting “the most radical movement in (US) history.”But Democratic voters see Harrison as fighting for fairness, particularly in access to health care, for everyday Americans.“He’s like a breath of fresh air,” historian Don Doyle, 74, said at Harrison’s rally, and “he’s giving Lindsey a run for his money.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-lindsey-graham-lose-south-carolina-a-senate-upset-is-possible/story-DE8tZ18jXB66VDoFduz0GL.html
18-10-2020||World||Singapore’s world’s first face scan plan sparks privacy fears||Singapore will become the world’s first country to use facial verification in its national ID scheme, but privacy advocates are alarmed by what they say is an intrusive system vulnerable to abuse.From next year, millions of people living in the city-state will be able to access government agencies, banking services and other amenities with a quick face scan.This biometric check will do away with the need to remember a password or security dongle when performing many everyday tasks, its creators say.It is part of the financial hub’s drive to harness technology, from ramping up the use of electronic payments to research on driverless transport.“We want to be innovative in applying technology for the benefit of our citizens and businesses,” Kwok Quek Sin, who works on digital identification at Singapore’s technology agency GovTech, told AFP.Facial verification has already been adopted in various forms around the world, with Apple and Google implementing the technology for tasks like unlocking phones and making payments.Governments have also deployed it at airports for security checks on travellers.But Singapore’s rollout is one of the most ambitious yet, and the first to attach facial verification to a national identification database.The technology captures a series of photos of a person’s face in various lights.These images are matched with other data already available to the government such as national identity cards, passports, and employment passes.Safeguards ensure the process is secure, said Lee Sea Lin of digital consultancy Toppan Ecquaria, which is working with GovTech to implement the technology.“We want to have assurance that the person behind the device is a real person, and that it is not an image or a video,” Lee said.The technology is being integrated into the country’s digital identity scheme and is being trialled now at some government offices, including the tax authority and the city’s pension fund.Private firms can sign up for the initiative, and Singapore’s biggest bank DBS is part of the trial.Face scanning technology remains controversial despite its growing use and critics have raised ethical concerns about it in some countries, for instance, law enforcement agencies scanning crowds at large events to look for troublemakers.Singapore authorities are frequently accused of targeting government critics and taking a hard line on dissent, and activists are concerned about how the face scanning tech will be used.“There are no clear and explicit restraints on government power when it comes to things like surveillance and data gathering,” said Kirsten Han, a freelance journalist from the city.“Will we one day discover that this data is in the hands of the police or in the hands of some other agency that we didn’t specifically give consent for?”Those behind the Singapore scheme stress facial verification is different to recognition as it requires user consent, but privacy advocates remain sceptical.“The technology is still far from benign,” Privacy International research officer Tom Fisher told AFP.He said systems like the one planned for Singapore left “opportunities for exploitation”, such as use of data to track and profile people. Kwok of GovTech insisted that no data would be shared with third parties and users would be left with other options, such as personal passwords, to access services.“It is not surveillance,” he said. “The use is very specific.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-s-world-s-first-face-scan-plan-sparks-privacy-fears/story-30BoApOIy5fyqeCoJHuBqM.html
18-10-2020||World||China’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate proves safe in initial tests||Researchers in China have confirmed that BBIBP-CorV, a vaccine currently under human trial observation, has safely triggered the expected antibody immune responses.The combined early and mid-stage trials for the vaccine happened between April 29 and July 30 this year. Beijing Institute of Biological Products, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG), is currently developing the vaccine. It is one of ten potential vaccine candidates that have entered the Phase III trials around the world. Chinese scientists are currently leading the research in four such vaccine development programs, as confirmed by the World Health Organization. Based on a report by news agency Reuters, a paper published in the Lancet, a medical journal, has proved that the vaccine is initially safe. However, anticipated adverse effects such as mild fever, pain localized to the regions of injection were commonly observed in candidates. The vaccine is currently under Phase 3 trials in places outside China. Meanwhile the government has recently approved the vaccine on a conditional basis for emergency inoculation for essential workers and high infection risk groups in the country. Nearly 600 healthy individuals of varying age groups participated in the study. When two injections of three different dosages were administered, the expected antibody reactions were triggered in all individuals, as published in the paper.Two key findings from the trial were mentioned in the study. Researchers from CNBG and the Chinese Disease Control Authorities have said that there is no sufficient data to support the fact that the vaccine can evidently cure the Coronavirus. Also, while the vaccine did trigger antibody responses, observations about cell-based immune response were not mentioned. Thus the scientists could not assure on the potency of the vaccine in fighting the coronavirus. Participants aged 60 and above were also found to be slower in developing antibody responses and multiplying them, than people of younger age groups. Another subsidiary of the CNBG, is in the process of developing a similar vaccine, which is also under Phase 3 trials. An official from the CNBG has mentioned that both the vaccines could be approved for emergency usage among the general public in China, before the end of the year.

18-10-2020||World||China passes biosecurity law to prevent infectious diseases||China’s top legislative body passed a new biosecurity law aimed at preventing and managing infectious diseases, state news agency Xinhua reported late on Saturday. The National People’s Congress Standing Committee voted to adopt the law on Saturday, according to Xinhua, and it would come into effect on April 15, 2021. The law would establish systems for biosecurity risk prevention and control, including risk monitoring and early warning, risk investigation and assessment, and information sharing. It would also have provisions to prevent and respond to specific biosecurity risks, including major emerging infectious diseases, epidemic and sudden outbreaks, and biotechnology research, development and application, reported Xinhua.China had announced in May that it aimed to fast-track the passing of the biosecurity law by year-end, following the global coronavirus outbreak which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China has managed to nearly stamp out domestic transmissions of the coronavirus following aggressive measures to curb its spread. New infections detected last week in the eastern coastal city of Qingdao however ended China’s run of about two months without reporting a local case.China’s health commission last reported 13 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for Oct. 17, bringing the mainland’s total number of confirmed cases to 85,672.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-passes-biosecurity-law-to-prevent-infectious-diseases/story-1lGsVi40ms01s1HYG3SZPN.html

The annual award ranks cities in the country based on the number of new rodent treatments carried out in a year. Chicago has retained the top spot for the sixth consecutive time.Orkin, in a press release, said that rats have taken over the streets of Chicago once again.It said that 2020 is an unprecedented year due to the coronavirus pandemic which has forced pests like rats to seek new grounds in search for food. “The pandemic-driven closure of restaurants forced rodents to find new food sources. Without food waste to consume, these pests were seen scavenging new areas and exhibiting unusual or aggressive behaviour,” the company said.Orkin further said that the presence of rats will increase in the approaching colder months “as these pests seek shelter in war areas with available food and water”.It also warned people to “pay extra attention to attractants that entice rats and mice”.The other US cities facing the acute problem of rat infestation are Los Angeles, New York, Washington DC and San Francisco, said Orkin.The rankings are based on survey carried out by the company from September 1 to August 31 every year. These rankings include both residential and commercial treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chicaco-is-rattiest-city-in-the-us-says-survey-by-pest-control-service/story-GS85CjHVilxLpG7MAPVDoM.html

Kah-MAH’-lah? Kamala-mala-mala? I don’t know. Whatever,” he told thousands of his supporters during an election rally of US President Donald Trump on Saturday in Macon City in Georgia, a battleground state.Outraged, many Twitter users hit back. “#MyNameIs Preet, which means love,” tweeted Preet Bharara, former attorney general for the powerful southern district of New York. #MyNameIs Preet, which means love. https://t.co/JSO0zB77aR“#MyNameIs Meenakshi.

He expected the death toll to rise.Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Aran said the car bombing struck near the entrance of the provincial police chief’s office and other nearby government buildings in the area.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Ghor, which comes amid an uptick in attacks by the Taliban as representatives of the group and Afghan government officials hold their first-ever face-to-face talks in Qatar, where the Taliban have had a political office for many years. The negotiations are meant to end the country’s decades-long war.On Friday, the Taliban agreed to suspend attacks in southern Afghanistan that had displaced thousands of residents in recent days. It came after the US vowed to halt all strikes and night raids in keeping with the peace agreement the US signed with the Taliban in February.The US had been conducting air strikes in support of Afghan forces trying to repel Taliban assaults in Helmand province, which threatened to derail efforts to end Afghanistan’s war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-bombing-in-afghanistan-kills-12-wounds-more-than-100/story-qCButLyhLrgXphWh1ODlZP.html
18-10-2020||World||Japan’s new Prime Minister pushes Abe’s vision ahead of Asia trip||Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, left on Sunday for his first overseas foray since taking over from his predecessor Shinzo Abe last month, heading to Vietnam and Indonesia.The choice to visit southeast Asia underscores Japan’s efforts to counter Chinese influence and build stronger economic and defense ties in the region, much in line with Abe’s vision of “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” that he had pushed with Washington.“ASEAN countries are our important partners for achieving the ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific’ that Japan has been promoting,” Suga told reporters before boarding his flight to Hanoi. “As part of Indo-Pacific nations, Japan is committed to contribute to the region and I will clearly convey this to the people in and outside of our country.” His trip also reflects pandemic realities. With the US tied up with the November 3 election, Suga was unable to head to Washington straight away for talks with Japan’s most important ally after he replaced Abe, who resigned for health reasons.As he emerges from Abe’s shadow with promises to “work for the people”, Suga is proving in some ways to be even more hard line. It has raised hackles within Japan and could rile neighbours, already disgruntled by Abe’s nationalist agenda.Abe had vowed to restore Japan’s waning diplomatic stature and national pride by promoting ultra-nationalistic policies such as traditional family values and amending the post-World War II pacifist constitution to allow a greater overseas military role for his country.Suga is expected to sign a defense equipment and technology transfer agreement with Vietnam as part of efforts to promote exports of Japanese-made military equipment. It’s a signal that Suga is certain to follow in Abe’s footsteps in diplomacy.At home, Suga was best known for his behind-the-scenes work pushing Abe’s agenda as chief Cabinet secretary. He has deftly used his modest background as the son of a strawberry farmer and a teacher and his low-profile and hardworking style to craft a more populist image than his predecessor.With much of the world, including Japan, occupied with battling the pandemic, Suga is focusing more on delivering results. So far, he appears to be trying to distinguish himself from Abe by pumping out consumer-friendly policies meant to showcase his pragmatism and efficiency.With national elections expected within months, there is little time to waste.“What is always on my mind is to tackle what needs to be accomplished without hesitation and quickly, and start from whatever is possible ... and let the people recognize the change,” Suga told reporters on Friday as he marked his first month in office.He has ordered his Cabinet to rush through approvals of several projects such as eliminating the requirement for Japanese-style “hanko” stamps, widely used in place of signatures on business and government documents. He is forging ahead with his earlier efforts to lower cellphone rates and promote use of computers and online government and business.Tackling Japan’s low birthrate and shrinking population head-on, he favours granting insurance coverage for infertility treatments.“So far, Prime Minister Suga is working on policies that are easy to understand and popular to many people, as his administration apparently aims to maintain high support ratings,” said Ryosuke Nishida, a sociologist at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. At the same time, Suga’s refusal to approve the appointments of six professors out of a slate of 105 to the state-funded Science Council of Japan has drawn accusations that he is trying to muzzle dissent and impinge on academic freedoms.The flap looks unlikely to balloon into a serious crisis for Suga, who has not given any explanation apart from saying that his decision was legal and that the group of academics that advises and checks government policies should be acceptable to the public.But it added to concerns that Suga might be more forthright than Abe in quashing opposition: The council, set up in 1949, has repeatedly opposed military technology research at universities, most recently in 2017. Its objections to government funding for such research is contrary to Abe’s efforts to build up Japan’s military capability.Many Japanese, especially academics, are wary of abuse of power given the country’s history of militarism and anti-communist campaigns after the World War II.Historian Masayasu Hosaka, writing in the Mainichi newspaper, described it as a “purge.” The surprise decision sent support ratings for Suga’s Cabinet to just above 50% last week from well above 60% shortly after he took office.Adding to unease over possible interference in academic freedom, the Education Ministry urged public schools to display a black cloth symbolising mourning along with the national flag, and to hold a moment of silence to show respect for late Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, whose state-funded funeral was held on Saturday.Such moves would come as no surprise under Abe, who as grandson of wartime leader Nobusuke Kishi and heir to a political dynasty stuck to his ultra-conservative agenda.But while Suga’s own personal ideology is unknown, he followed Abe’s example in making ritual donations of religious ornaments Saturday to the Yasukuni Shrine to pay respect to the war dead. China and South Korea consider the shrine, which also commemorates executed Japanese war criminals, a symbol of Japan’s militaristic past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-new-prime-minister-pushes-abe-s-vision-ahead-of-asia-trip/story-KMCEfZqDWWbG0sOH8UOJtL.html

His ex-wife Sofia confirmed the news of Stuzhuk’s death on her Instagram profile.After Stuzhuk was rushed back to the hospital, Sofia said he was in a “grave condition” and unconscious. She told her followers that he had “problems with his cardiovascular system... his heart is not coping. His state is extremely grave. No-one can do anything with this,” Sky News reported.“I did everything I could so the father of my three children lives. But nothing depends on me now,” she added. She later announced his death, saying, “Dima is no longer with us. His heart could not stand”.Stuzhuk had shared his experience with his 1.1 million followers on his Instagram handle on October 15. He wrote, “I also thought that there was no Covid… Until I got sick”. “COVID-19 DISEASE IS NOT EPHEME (short-lived)! And heavy,” he had said.Stuzhuk developed breathing problems and stomach-ache while he was in Turkey. After returning from Turkey, he tested positive for Covid-19 and was subsequently admitted to a hospital. After eight days of hospitalisation, the body-building enthusiast was allowed for home treatment on October 15. Next day, he died of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fitness-influencer-who-believed-covid-19-doesn-t-exist-dies-from-the-virus/story-Xqa5Bc4dx1SMleL2OodRiO.html
18-10-2020||World||Covid-19 rate among dentists less than 1%: Report||A US-based report suggested that less than 1% of dentists were found to be Covid-19 positive across the globe.It was a first-of-its-kind report based on data collected in June 2020.The result is far below that of other health professionals in the US. In addition, 99% of dentists are using enhanced infection control procedures such as screening protocols and enhanced disinfection practices when treating patients. The report, published online ahead of print by The Journal of the American Dental Association, is the first large-scale collection and publication of U.S. dentists’ infection rates and infection control practices related to Covid-19.“This is very good news for dentists and patients,” said American Dental Association (ADA) Science and Research Institute Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Araujo, D.D.S., M.S., Ph.D., the senior author of the report. “This means that what dentists are doing - heightened infection control and increased attention to patient and dental team safety - is working.”Dr Araujo added that the authors of the report, researchers from the ADA Science and Research Institute and Health Policy Institute based in Chicago, are continuing to collect and will report infection rate data on dentists and have added hygienists to their ongoing survey, in collaboration with the American Dental Hygienists Association. This report focused on nearly 2,200 dentists in June, finding that 82% of dentists were asymptomatic for one month prior to the survey and 16.6% reported getting a Covid-19 test. Those who tested positive were not clustered in any particular geographic region. Among those not tested, less than 1% (0.32) were given a probable Covid-19 diagnosis by a physician. The authors weighted the results to align with U.S. dentists demographically and geographically and found an estimated prevalence of less than 1% (0.9) with a margin of error of 0.5%.“Understanding the risks associated with Covid-19 transmission in the dental setting is critical to improving patient and dental team safety,” said Dr Araujo. “This study brings us another step forward in understanding what works. Dentists are following ADA and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, and it’s helping to keep the dental team and their patients as safe as possible.”In March, The New York Times listed dentistry as one of the professions at the highest risk of Covid-19 based on data from O*NET, a database maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor. It was presumed that virus transmission could occur because of the close proximity between dental professionals and patients and because many dental procedures generate aerosols that may contain viral particles from infected individuals.This newly-published report, with the extremely low rate of Covid-19 infection among dentists, supports the effectiveness of the recommendations from the CDC and ADA in preventing virus transmission.The ADA’s guidance calls for the highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) available--masks, goggles and face shields. The ADA’s interim guidance also calls for the use of rubber dams and high-velocity suction whenever possible and hand scaling when cleaning teeth rather than using ultrasonic scaling to minimise aerosols.“The fact that dentistry was named one of the most at-risk professions for infection, but has a far lower prevalence of infection compared to other health professions, is not a coincidence,” said Chief Economist and Vice President of the ADA Health Policy Institute Marko Vujicic, PhD. “The profession has taken this issue extremely seriously, and it shows. We will continue to track the rate of Covid-19 among dentists and other facets of the pandemic affecting dentistry so it can help inform the dental profession and other industries as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-rate-among-dentists-less-than-1-report/story-C0aZ7c3hYyoM6qjQH49BnL.html

It comes just days after 13 members of a rescue team were found dead after a failed attempt to save workers from a hydropower plant engulfed by a landslide.The bodies of two employees at the plant have been found but 15 are still missing.River levels in Quang Tri had reached their highest in two decades, state media said. The disaster management authority raised its risk alert warning to the second highest level on Sunday, warning of further flooding and landslides.Vietnam is prone to natural disasters and regularly suffers more than a dozen storms each year, often bringing flooding and landslides.More than 130 people were reported dead or missing in natural disasters around the country last year, the General Statistics Office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-soldiers-dead-17-missing-in-vietnam-after-second-big-landslide-in-days/story-3sNSzyeSGoKCdIcWB8TTBP.html
18-10-2020||World||Living coronavirus found on frozen food packaging in China||China’s health authority has confirmed the detection and isolation of living novel coronavirus on the outer packaging of imported frozen marine fish in the port city of Qingdao. It is, for the first time, that living novel coronavirus has been isolated from the outer packaging of cold-chain food, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Saturday.The authorities in Qingdao, where a new cluster of Covid-19 cases were reported recently, conducted tests on all of its about 11 million population. No new clusters of cases were found after the tests, the local authorities said.In July, China suspended imports of frozen shrimp after the deadly virus was found on packages and the inner wall of a container.The CDC said it detected and isolated the living virus on the outer packaging of imported frozen cod in Qingdao. The finding was made during an investigation to trace the source of recent infections reported in the city. It has proved that contact with packaging contaminated by living novel coronavirus could lead to infection, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the CDC statement.The statement, however, did not mention the country from where the package was imported.The agency said the risk of cold-chain food circulating in China’s market being contaminated by the novel coronavirus is very low, citing recent nucleic acid test results for samples taken from the business.A total of 2.98 million samples had been tested across the country’s 24 provincial-level regions by September 15, including 670,000 taken from cold-chain food or food packaging, 1.24 million from working staff and 1.07 million from the environment.Only 22 samples from cold-chain food or food packaging tested positive for the virus, the CDC said.Meanwhile, the National Health Commission on Sunday said 13 confirmed Covid-19 cases, all arriving from outside the mainland, were reported on Saturday. There was no new locally transmitted Covid-19 case, it said. Of the imported cases, five were reported in Shanghai, four in Guangdong, two in Shaanxi and one each in Tianjin and Sichuan.As of Saturday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland reached 85,672. Altogether 80,786 patients have been discharged after recovery, while the death toll stood at 4,634, the Commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/living-coronavirus-found-on-frozen-food-packaging-in-china/story-QvOCVqGhsJlJkttgDoPhYI.html

There is foreign ministry Iran which says positive things and expresses ideas or makes statements that could be construed as supportive of a peace process, but there is another Iran that would like to keep the US entangled in a war that they would like to be unwinnable,” said Khalilzad, as quoted by Tolo News.Even though the US Special Representative called Pakistan’s efforts in the Afghan Peace Process as “positive”, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar warned that terrorism in Pakistan is publicly acknowledged by their own government. “Terrorism from Pakistan continues and terrorism from Pakistan remains publicly acknowledged by their government as a policy that they are justifying. (It) makes it very hard to conduct normal relations with them,” said Jaishankar at an online event hosted by the Asia Society.He added, “They’ve blocked connectivity between India and Afghanistan...I think until we address that problem, this challenge of how do you have a normal relationship with this very unique neighbour, is a very troubling issue for our foreign policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-official-says-al-qaeda-remains-close-to-taliban-in-afghanistan/story-2UvU0qY5pmoXaVTPkFxgYM.html

The first one was organized in January. The first-ever Women’s March was held in 2017, which had the biggest attendance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/women-s-march-to-protest-trump-administration-s-nomination-to-supreme-court/story-ysGDFKNZhXW3bVXQTyo2cO.html

The antibodies, I think the antibodies are the best thing, we’re gonna make it free,” Trump said at his campaign rally in Janesville, Wisconsin on Saturday. “This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression,” Trump added.Earlier in the day, speaking at another rally in Muskegon, Michigan, Trump warned that a Democratic victory in the November elections could make the coronavirus situation worse in Michigan, as well as the US as a whole.“Democrats would terminate our recovery with a draconian unscientific lockdown like your governor is doing right now,” Trump said, stressing that “Biden will shut down the country, delay the vaccine and prolong the pandemic.”Trump resumed his campaign trail earlier this month, holding his first rally (since his positive COVID19 diagnosis) in Sanford, Florida.Trump told his supporters in Florida that “whatever the hell they gave me” was going to be distributed around US hospitals.Trump was hospitalised with COVID-19 at the Walter Reed Military Medical Center on October 2, not long after announcing on Twitter that he and his wife Melania had tested positive for the coronavirus. While at Walter Reed, Trump was treated with an experimental antibody cocktail that targets the coronavirus spike protein.White House Physician, Dr Sean Conley, announced on October 12 that Trump had tested negative for COVID-19 on consecutive days.First Lady Melania Trump announced on Wednesday that the First Family’s son Barron, 14, had also contracted COVID-19 but exhibited no symptoms and has recently tested negative.Trump told his supporters in Wisconsin on Saturday that since Barron was young his immune system was very strong and he was able to easily overcome the virus, like many other young people. In that light, Trump called for reopening schools in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-promises-free-covid-19-treatment-at-wisconsin-rally/story-49pziK1LKrfFbCbZuFBgEJ.html

If Biden wins, China will own America--they pay him (Biden) a fortune. He works for China,” Trump said at his reelection rally in Michigan.Trump later during the course of the rally went on to label Biden as a corrupt politician adding that the Biden family is “a criminal enterprise”.“I did more in 47 months than what sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. The Democrats are pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy social security,” he added. The US President further hit out at Beijing for “flowing in” the ‘ChinaVirus’ (Covid-19) saying that the US was coming together before the outbreak.“The country was coming together and then we had the ChinaVirus flowed in. This country was coming together because there is nothing like success. Success was bringing people together,” he added.Trump said that the US has “saved millions of lives” and said that the projected deaths due to Covid-19 were supposed to be 2.2 million “but the fake news never says that”.“We had this horrible plague that came in from China and we are not going to forget that it came from China. It went from all over the world. We had signed an incredible deal with China and ink hadn’t even dried, then this happened,” Trump said further.Trump during the conclusion of his rally made the statement that if elected President, he would make the US into a manufacturing superpower and “end our reliance on China once and for all.” The US Presidential Elections took place on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-was-coming-together-before-china-virus-trump/story-aoOxTsA9WVmqoHkC2wsNwJ.html

I think we will have price transparency and we will be here for four more years and if we decide to go extra for four or eight or something...

This weakens the integrity of our institutions, which we do not want,” he said as quoted by Dawn.“But what can we do when the army is deployed at polling stations in general elections [and] Imran Khan says in every speech ‘this or that institution is with me, we are all on the same page’?” Bilawal asked, accusing the prime minister of using institutions as “political props”.“When we take the establishment’s name, we realise that only today’s generals or retired generals [are not to be blamed] but it is a part of our history that we either received dictatorship or a controlled democracy,” he said.According to Dawn, he made these remarks while speaking to reporters in Karachi after reviewing arrangements for the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) second power show, which is scheduled to be held in the city today.Earlier PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, while addressing the PDM rally via video link from London, accused the security establishment of being behind his ouster as Prime Minister and of “bringing Imran Khan into power”.The former Prime Minister named Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed alleging that they were responsible for making a “state above the state” and for the presence of “two governments” in Pakistan.A day after former Pakistan premier Nawaz Sharif tore into ‘puppet government’ of the country during Gurjanwala anti-government rally, a disgruntled Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday lashed out at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo for allegedly maligning the top army leadership, and deemed as “a circus”, the opposition’s power show.Remarking on the speech given by Sharif during the opposition rally, Prime Minister Khan said the PML-N leader was using inappropriate “language” against the army and ISI chiefs at a time when Pakistani soldiers were constantly sacrificing their lives for the nation, Dawn reported.Pakistan opposition leaders along with an “ocean” of people made their way to Gujranwala for the first show of strength of their anti-government campaign.The recently-formed Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) held its first anti-government protest in Gujranwala on Friday. The opposition comprising 11 parties including PML-N (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz), PPP (Pakistan People’s Party), and JUI-F (Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl) will be holding the Gujranwala Rally.The anti-government rally has been organised to protest against army atrocities and demand for PM Imran Khan’s resignation in the backdrop of corruption, economic slowdown, and poor governance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bilawal-bhutto-blames-pm-imran-khan-for-opposition-taking-names-of-army-generals/story-SUYO3bjY1TWf1fzBKMJtvJ.html
18-10-2020||World||China may detain US citizens in response to prosecution of Chinese military-affiliated scholars: Report||The Chinese government has warned Washington it may detain Americans in China in response to the Justice Department’s prosecution of Chinese military-affiliated scholars, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. The newspaper, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, said Chinese officials had issued repeated warnings through multiple channels to US government officials.The paper said China’s message was the United States should end prosecutions of Chinese scholars in US courts, or Americans in China could find themselves in violation of Chinese law.A State Department advisory on Sept. 14 warning against travel to China said the Chinese government uses arbitrary detention and exit bans for US citizens and others “to gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.”The White House referred questions to the State Department, which said in an emailed statement that it stresses “to the Chinese government – including at the highest levels – our concern about China’s coercive use of exit bans on US citizens and citizens of other countries, and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process.”The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.The Trump administration has increasingly accused China of suing cyber operations and espionage to steal US technological, military and other know-how in a strategy to supplant the United States as the world’s leading financial and military power. Beijing denies the allegations.In July, the Justice Department said the FBI had arrested three Chinese nationals for allegedly concealing memberships in the Peoples Liberation Army when applying for visas to conduct research at US academic institutions.Last month, the United States said it had revoked visas for more than 1,000 Chinese nationals under a presidential measure denying entry to students and researchers deemed security risks, a move China called a violation of human rights. At the time, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States continued to welcome “legitimate students and scholars from China who do not further the Chinese Communist Party’s goals of military dominance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-detain-us-citizens-in-response-to-prosecution-of-chinese-military-affiliated-scholars-report/story-spUmToHzPcD6ovcS1wCzGO.html

Whitmer, a Democrat, blamed Trump for creating an environment that encourages radical criminal behavior.The president earlier this year issued a tweet urging citizens to “liberate” their states amid lockdowns to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that the kidnapping plot took root prior to Trump’s tweet.“You got to get your governor to open up your state,” Trump said at the Muskegon rally. The crowd responded with a “lock her up” chant, to which Trump replied “lock ‘em all up.”Trump is set to deliver a second rally later in the evening in Janesville, Wisconsin.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radical-left-will-destroy-american-way-of-life-trump-attacks-democrats-over-toppling-statues-of-slave-owners/story-iaXSlJPfyzdQV38hG9i9DK.html

The troops were now only 35 miles from Srinagar when the Maharaja (Hari Singh) sent his papers of accession to Delhi asking for help”: these are the excerpts from a recently republished book, Raiders in Kashmir, penned by Major General (retired) Akbar Khan of Pakistan. The book was originally published in the 1970s and has been republished in New York.The book was released decades after Pakistan’s Operation Gulmarg in Jammu and Kashmir admits to the role of Pakistan in the conflicts in the valley.Giving out minute details of Pakistan’s aggression in Kashmir, he said that the crisis was hatched and formulated in Lahore and Pindi.The author wrote that at the beginning of September 1947, he was asked by Mian Iftikharuddin, then a leader in the Muslim League (the ruling political party) to prepare a plan to take over Kashmir.“Ultimately, I wrote a plan under the title of “Armed Revolt inside Kashmir”. As open interference or aggression by Pakistan was obviously undesirable, it was proposed that our efforts should be concentrated upon strengthening the Kashmiris themselves internally -- and at the same time taking steps to prevent the arrival of armed civilians or military assistance from India into Kashmir,” Khan said.Giving proof of top leaderships’ role in the crisis, he said, “I was called to Lahore for a conference with the prime minister of Pakistan Mr Liaqat Ali Khan. On arrival there, I first had to attend a preliminary conference at the Provincial Government Secretariat in the office of Sardar Shaukat Hayat Khan who was then a minister in the Punjab government. I saw copies of my proposed plan in the hands of some...”“On October 22, the operation began with Pakistani forces crossing the border and attacking Muzaffarabad and Domel on October 24 from where the Dogra troops had to withdraw. The next day these troops moved forward on the Srinagar road and again took on the Dogras at Uri... On October 27, India intervened and sent troops to Kashmir,” he wrote.Meanwhile, on the evening of October 27, Pakistan Prime Minister held a conference at Lahore to consider the situation arising out of Kashmir’s accession and India’s military intervention. “The Prime Minister held an unofficial conference at Lahore to consider the situation arising out of Kashmir’s accession and India’s military intervention. At this conference, among others, were also present Colonel Iskander Mirza (then defence secretary, later to be a governor-general), Chaudhri Mohd All (then secretary-general, later to be a prime minister), Abdul Qayum Khan, then chief minister of the Frontier Province and Nawab Mamdot, then CM of Punjab. Brigadier Slier Khan and I were also invited,” the author wrote.He further said, “At this conference, I proposed that an attempt should be made to liquidate Jammu in order to block the only road, along which India could send reinforcements into the valley and the rest of Kashmir. I did not suggest that troops be used for this purpose or that the government should get involved in this. I suggested only that tribesmen may be allowed to make the attempt. I thought that three lashkars of a thousand each should be used.”In the book, he also testified that the Pakistani Army had worked with the tribal forces in various incursions in Kashmir.After being appointed as the military adviser to the prime minister, on October 28, 1947, he had “rushed back to Pindi to ensure that the tribesmen received their ammunition in time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-book-by-pakistan-s-ex-major-general-accepts-country-s-role-in-kashmir-conflict/story-dDtfiye4V8EcgdD0Vf38LN.html
18-10-2020||India||Bengal governor Dhankhar gives ‘last warning’ to officials, CM Mamata on law and order||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Sunday night that law and order in the state had collapsed and he was giving his “last warning” to the government. “I want to tell the chief minister to follow the Constitution. I am here to protect it. They are playing with fire. They (bureaucrats and police) cannot be political workers and shall not be allowed to be political workers. Those who are sleeping like Kumbhakarna have no idea that there is something called destiny,” Dhankhar said. “This is my last warning,” he added. A mythical demon mentioned in the Ramayana, Kumbhakarna used to sleep for six months and wake up for 24 hours to eat. Dhankhar made the statement after meeting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and the brother of Madan Ghorai, a BJP worker, who died in hospital while in judicial custody on October 13. Lok Sabha MP Locket Chatterjee took relatives of Ghorai to the Raj Bhawan at about 7 pm. Swapan Ghorai, the brother of the deceased, fainted when he was standing with the others near the stairs leading to the entrance of the Raj Bhawan. Dhankhar was coming down the stairs when the incident happened. He talked to Ghorai after he recovered. “Do not think that you can stop the governor by trolling him. This is the last warning. If rule of law is not established be ready to face the music,” said Dhankhar. “Tearful Swapan Ghorai brother of custodial death @WBPolice victim Madan Ghorai pleaded for probe #CBI for justice. Delegation including MPs #LokSabha @me_locket @ArjunsinghWB said that this custodial death is political vendetta. There is lawlessness and anarchy @MamataOfficial,” Dhankhar tweeted after 8 pm. Incidentally, Union home minister Amit Shah told a national television channel in an interview telecast on Saturday that law and order in the state has reached a dangerous level and Bengal BJP leaders must have enough reasons to demand President’s rule. Shah, however, said the Centre follows the law and the Constitution when he was asked whether the Centre would enforce Article 356 of the Constitution. TMC Lok Sabha member and a party spokesperson, Saugata Roy said, “The governor is rude. He is acting like a BJP spokesperson. He is clearly crossing his limits. If someone has died in custody, then the court and the administration is there to look into it and take steps.” “The governor is picking up isolated incidents to show that law and order is collapsing. That can only be said when there are mass killings and upheavals. Nothing of that nature is happening in Bengal. Amit Shah recently warned the governor of a state for his language. Shah should warn Dhankhar too,” Roy said. Reacting to Shah’s comment, CPI (M) Politburo member Md Salim said, “This is a trick before the assembly elections. It has been proved that Trinamool Congress (TMC) is affiliated to the BJP. It is being offered a safe passage by Amit Shah. The Centre is dangling Article 356 like a carrot. We don’t want a safe passage.” The Calcutta high court on Friday issued back- to-back orders on separate petitions moved by the BJP and the government in connection with the BJP worker’s death at SSKM hospital in Kolkata on October 13. The man was brought from East Midnapore district while he was in judicial custody. He was arrested on September 27 in connection with a criminal case. After hearing a plea moved by the brother of the deceased, who demanded investigation into the custodial death, the single-judge bench of Rajasekhar Mantha on Friday afternoon ordered a second post mortem examination. The government told the court that the deceased, Madan Ghorai, fell ill in judicial custody in East Midnapore district and was taken to a local hospital and later shifted to SSKM Hospital. The body was handed over to the family on Friday morning after post mortem examination. The BJP alleged that Ghorai died because he was tortured by the police. Challenging the single-bench ruling, the state government moved the divisional bench of Justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee in the evening. The division bench ordered a stay on the second post mortem examination till Monday and referred the case back to the single bench, saying the government should be given time to prepare its reply and in the meantime the body must be preserved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-dhankhar-gives-last-warning-to-officials-cm-mamata-on-law-and-order/story-H4b4jKVTh79pOxD7FmaLGK.html
18-10-2020||India||BJP banks on rainbow coalition of castes to bag votes in Bihar polls||NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is counting on the support of a rainbow coalition of castes including the Dalits, who weren’t traditionally considered to be part of its support base, to ensure the return of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to power in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.The party has allocated 50% of seats to contestants from so-called non-upper castes, which is a reinforcement of its acceptance across caste groups, a senior BJP functionary said on Sunday. The party has also fielded 51 candidates from the Kayastha, Rajput, Bhumihar and Brahmin communities who belong to the upper castes that are traditionally considered BJP supporters. “Of the 110 names announced so far, 50 are from the Dalit, Mahadalit and the ST {scheduled tribe} communities. We have the support of each of these communities for the pro-development policies of the BJP,” the functionary said, requesting anonymity. With Mahadalit leader and former chief minister Jitin Ram Manjhi and his Hindustani Awam Morcha {HAM} and Mukesh Sahni of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) joining the NDA, which also has chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janarta Dal (United), or JD (U) among its constituents, the BJP says the alliance has an appeal cutting across caste lines. “The BJP believes in empowerment of all castes and groups and has a larger social base as compared to other political parties,” said national general secretary and in-charge of Bihar, Bhupender Yadav. Support from the Dalits and the iother backward classes (OBCs) is not the only reason for the BJP’s optimism about its performance in the three-phase election spread over October 28, November 3 and November 7. The party also believes that the so-called lower castes are distancing themselves from the opposition Mahagathbandhan, or grand alliance comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress and Left parties. “There are four important social groups, the Mahadalits, the EBCs {economically backward classes}, the OBCs and the tribals; and all of these have quit the Mahagathbandhan. The Mahadalits are with the BJP; RLSP {Rashtriya Lok Samta Party} that represents the OBCs walked out of the alliance, the EBCs (VIP) said they were stabbed in the back and the JMM {Jharkhand Mukti Morcha}, which represents the STs, has also kept away. This is an indication that the aspirations of these communities cannot be met by any other entity other than the NDA,” said the functionary quoted above. EBCs that make up 30% of the electorate are among the most courted voters. While the BJP has given five seats to EBC candidates, it also gave 11 seats from its share of 121 to the VIP. In 2015, the BJP gave 25 seats to EBC candidates, of which 12 won. The OBCs that make uo 22% of the electorate have been fielded from 15 constituencies in a bid to create a dent in the RJD’s vote bank. The NDA is expected to gain from the BJP’s largely upper caste vote bank and the JD (U)’s clout with the EBC and OBC voters. The JD (U)’s focus on the Mahadalits is expected to give the NDA a shot in the arm. There are around 100-odd seats, where the Dalits and the Mahadalits hold sway. And the NDA will make the most of a recent Supreme Court ruling that SC and STs do not constitute a homogenous group and sub-categorisation of these groups can be considered by the states.Since the general election of 2014, there is a perception that the BJP has been trying to shed its image as a party of Brahamins and Baniyas; which is why it has made assiduous attempts to woo the non-dominant OBCs. “The BJP’s agenda of development overrides caste. Unlike the BSP or the RJD that thrived on caste consolidation and were unabashed about catering only to the Dalits, the Yadavs and the Muslims; the BJP chose to focus on empowerment of all and winnability of the candidates,” said a second BJP functionary. The second functionary said that even the JD (U) and the Lok Jan Shakti Party that were considered partial to the OBCs, Dalits and the Muslims have fielded 18 and 16 upper caste candidates and the RJD has 12 upper caste contestants. Commenting on the BJP’s outreach towards the Dalits, OBCs and EBCs, political commentator and Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Ajay Gudavarthy said: “Under Amit Shah’s leadership, BJP moved beyond the Brahmin-Bania base and extended it to Dalits and non-Yadav OBCs by giving them greater representation. This makes their pan-Hindu claims real strong. Not offering seats to Muslims gives them this ironical advantage of having more seats to spare for different sections of the Hindus unlike the Mahagatbandhan. It also makes it an exclusive Hindu party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-banks-on-rainbow-coalition-of-castes-to-bag-votes-in-bihar-polls/story-eYlRfTKJyX5PGQhvdHilVI.html

18-10-2020||India||Days before his death, Pranab Mukherjee penned an article recalling fond memories of Sheikh Mujib||In an article penned days before his death, former president Pranab Mukherjee had fondly remembered Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and recalled how in 1972 the then Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had tried in vain to pressure him into issuing a joint statement to show that Pakistan remained undivided. Mukherjee, in his article that is published in the book ‘Voice of Millions’ to mark the centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, also reminisced how he, as a young Rajya Sabha MP, had called in Parliament for granting recognition to the then Bangladesh government in exile, as part of a political solution. The former President quoted from Sheikh Mujib’s book ‘Unfinished Memoirs’, published by his daughter 29 years after his death, to note how the Bangladeshi leader was not even aware of the independence of his country and was in exile in the Mianwali Jail near Rawalpindi at that time. He was thereafter taken to London on a special flight on the night of January 8, 1972, after Bhutto failed in his attempts to woo him. “Bhutto informed Mujib that he was the President and needed Mujib’s help. During the few days between 1st and 8th January, Bhutto spoke to him at various times and pressured Mujib to sign a joint statement. He showed Mujib many drafts...,” Mukherjee wrote.“Meanwhile, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto made repeated appeals to Mujib to establish a relationship between Pakistan and Bangladesh. A relationship that would keep Pakistan undivided. “Mujib simply informed Bhutto that he would not be able to say anything to him without first conferring with the people of his country. “In the end, a frustrated Bhutto decided to send Mujib to Britain. In the middle of the night on 8th January 1972, a special Pak Airlines plane flew Mujib, its sole passenger, to London’s Heathrow airport. When he landed at Heathrow, the local time was 6:30 am,” he said, noting from his book. Mukherjee also recollected in his article how his mind was filled with memories of the events of 1971. He was 36 years old and an MP when the people of Bangladesh were engaged in their liberation struggle. “I recall that, on June 15, 1971, I had the privilege to initiate a discussion on the floor of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, when I suggested that India should accord diplomatic recognition to the Government of Bangladesh in exile in Mujibnagar. My words are on the record in the proceedings of Rajya Sabha. “When a Member sought my suggestion on how to tackle the problem, I responded by saying: ‘I am talking of a political solution which means categorically recognising the sovereign democratic Government of Bangladesh. “Political solution means giving material help to the democratic, sovereign Government of Bangladesh.... I reminded the House of the many instances in world history when intervention on similar grounds had taken place in the past,” Mukherjee wrote in the article which, his close associates said, was his last. He also wrote about how Mujib worked hard for creation of Pakistan, but intense disagreements arose between him and the Muslim League leadership as he began to oppose various policies and their applications. “Because of this, he was imprisoned shortly after liberation for criticizing and opposing government policies at different times. If the 9 months in 1971 are included, then Mujib’s total period of imprisonment comes to 3,053 days, he said.Describing the ‘Father of Bangladesh’ as “a tireless Statesman”, Mukherjee said the legacy of ‘Bangabandhu’ and Bangladesh are intertwined together.“There are very few individuals in history who have a profound impact in the creation of Nations, indeed a subcontinent’s identity. “Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujbir Rahman stands tall amongst those few. His unbound love for his people and his struggle for them is a testament to his legacy. “As the sub-continent observes his birth centenary, we not only remember a Statesman but a man who lived and died for his great nation, in the process reaffirming the culturally ingrained values of freedom and liberty, composite secularism and inclusive development,” he said in his article. He wrote about the days of Sheikh Mujib’s schooling, before becoming the leader of Bangladesh.The former President, who is the only one from outside Bangladesh to have written in the book, said his dream of a ‘Sonar Bangla’ lives on.He also talked about how Sheikh Mujib made the ‘Chhatra League’ a mass movement that also helped in achieving the dream of Bangladesh’s independence. Mukherjee said he was in Kolkata when Sheikh Mujib was assassinated. “Of the brutal annihilation of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with his entire family (except his two daughters Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana) at the dawn of 14th /15th August 1975, the most vivid memory I have is of unbelievable shock and anger,” he remarked .Mukherjee died on August 31 at the age of 84.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-before-his-death-pranab-mukherjee-penned-an-article-recalling-fond-memories-of-sheikh-mujib/story-9DLcNzxYXFkzl0k4zZeNVL.html

The state cabinet approved the conversion of the Factories (Punjab Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, into a Bill at a meeting chaired by chief minister Amarinder Singh, an official statement said.The Bill is aimed at amending a relevant section and inserting a new section in the Factories Act, 1948. It provides for changing the existing threshold limit for small units.The change has been necessitated by the increase in manufacturing activities by small units in the state and is aimed at promoting small manufacturing units. This would help create more employment opportunities for workers, it said.In view of the absence of any provision in the existing law for compounding of offences for violations found at the time of the inspection of factories by the Inspector, the Bill will also incorporate a relevant section in the Act. This will facilitate faster settlement of cases and reduction in court action, the statement added.On October 14, the state Cabinet decided to convene a special session of the state assembly here to bring in a legislation to counter the Centre’s new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-govt-to-table-bill-in-special-assembly-to-boost-investment/story-Daz9e5ylTORme1YwgAtmeN.html

18-10-2020||India||In Hathras, anti-Romeo squads back in action to check crimes against women||Nearly a dozen teams with over 50 police personnel are part of the anti-Romeo squads that have been reactivated in Hathras to check crimes against women, officials said on Sunday. The development comes as part of the “Mission Shakti” campaign of the Uttar Pradesh government, which has faced flak over a string of rape incidents, including the alleged gangrape and death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman here, recently. “There are 11 police stations, including the Mahila Thana, in the district. There are 11 anti-Romeo squads with five police personnel in each team. One team includes three women and two men personnel. These squads would keep an eye on miscreants harassing or troubling women and girls in the district,” Hathras Superintendent of Police, Vineet Jaiswal, told PTI. The district police chief on Sunday held a meeting with all members of the squads and stressed on the need to put a check on crimes against women and girls. These squads would patrol public places like markets, the vicinity of schools and colleges, coaching institutes, bus stands, parks, among others, to prevent harassment of women and girls, and indecency against them by miscreants, a police spokesperson said. “The squads would also raise awareness among women and girls about the helpline numbers being operated by the state government and the state police. For example, they can dial 112, 181 and 1090 (women helpline), 1076 (chief minister’s helpline), 1098 (child helpline), 102 and 108 (healthcare and ambulance),” the spokesperson said. The squads will also apprise the women and children about mobile phone apps like the ‘UP COP’ and how they could be used by distressed persons, the official added. The anti-Romeo squads were constituted to check stalkers and eve-teasers in Uttar Pradesh soon after Yogi Adityanath had assumed the office of the chief minister in 2017. Facing flak over crimes against women in the state, Adityanath on Saturday had launched the ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign that focuses on ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girls, with a stern warning that perpetrators of crimes against females will be dealt with an iron hand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-hathras-anti-romeo-squads-back-in-action-to-check-crimes-against-women/story-3aM6da0LWbq3w4SDwFv7lO.html

18-10-2020||India||BJP offered bribe to Congress MLAs to switch sides in Gujarat: Congress||The Congress on Sunday alleged that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) offered monetary and other inducements to its legislators in Gujarat to switch sides, and demanded a judicial inquiry into the matter. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi claimed that Akshay Patel, Pradyumnsinh Jadeja and J V Kakadiya, who joined the BJP in June this year after resigning from the Congress, had purportedly accepted on camera to have been offered inducements for switching over. He cited their interviews to the media to allege the BJP had offered them monetary or other inducements to woo them to their side. The three have been fielded by the BJP in Gujarat for the upcoming by-polls. “The legislature, it is clear from these proofs, has become a pawn, a business plaything for the BJP, which aggressively indulges in the 3Ts -- Trading, Trafficking and Transaction-ing with MLAs and legislators,” Singhvi said. Five of the eight Congress legislators have got tickets from the BJP for the forthcoming bypolls, he added. “The issue at all is not whether he accepted it or took the bribe or not. Obviously, those speaking have denied it. The issue is the true colours of the offeror, the true moral constitutional and legal level, political level at which the offeror is functioning, namely the BJP,” Singhvi said about Patel. “The true issue is about the limitless capacity of this party to offer money. I repeat - limitless capacity, matched only by their limitless greed for power by hook or by crook, more by crook, less by hook,” he said. The Congress leader alleged that the BJP ensures the election mandate, which is the constitutional and democratic mandate, is actually a mandate for only two or three years. “It is curtailed, interrupted, obstructed to 2-3 years by ‘A’ large sums of money, ‘B’ large number of resignations, ‘C’, re-offering of ministerships and ‘D’, offering of MLA tickets,” he alleged. Singhvi alleged that this is the political morality practiced by the ruling party at the Centre and in Gujarat. “You (BJP) create an artificial majority, an artificial majority is negation of the democracy, which functions on majority, true majorities and you do it by the naked use of monetary power,” he said. The Congress spokesperson demanded a Supreme Court sitting judge probe into the matter or at least by a sitting Chief Justice of a High Court at the minimum. There should be an immediate registration of a Prevention of Corruption Act, FIR and related sections of the Indian penal codes on the criminal sides, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-offered-bribe-to-congress-mlas-to-switch-sides-in-gujarat-congress/story-MNo3rdYv8bWeXzIS64o4mN.html

Seven persons from Mizoram side were injured when villagers of Lailapur in Cachar district of Assam clashed with residents of Vairengte in Kolasib district, Mizoram’s Directorate of Information and Public Relations said.The clashes reportedly started after some people from the Mizoram side torched some huts made by Lailapur residents on a disputed portion of the border between the two states. Assam forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya along with senior bureaucrats and police officers reached the spot on Sunday and took stock of the situation there. Blaming the incident on “miscreants from the other side of the border”, the minister urged everyone to remain calm and assured the state government would provide necessary security to the residents. “We got a report last night that some temporary huts were burnt. Police were immediately rushed to the spot and the situation was brought under control. Security has been beefed up in the area and we are engaged in talks with our Mizoram counterparts,” said Cachar’s superintendent of police Bhanwar Lal Meena. Saturday’s incident comes a week after a similar flare up between both states on the border along Karimganj district of Assam and Mamit district of Mizoram. In Mizoram, the state cabinet met on Sunday and “expressed regret at the unilateral and provocative acts of disturbing peace and harmony in the border areas at three locations”. The cabinet blamed the Karimganj and Cachar district administrations in Assam as being responsible for the flare up and urged the Assam government to take urgent measures to restore normalcy in the border areas. “The government of Mizoram appeals to all persons not to attempt to use the present crisis to further their personal or collective motives,” said a statement issued by Mizoram’s home department. On Sunday Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal called up the offices of the Prime Minister and Union home minister Amit Shah and apprised them about the situation. He also spoke with Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and both agreed to resolve the issue through talks, officials said. Both Assam and Mizoram have approached the Centre to intervene in the matter and resolve the long standing border dispute between the two states. Chief secretaries of both states will have a meeting through video conference with union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Monday to discuss the latest flare up. Assam and Mizoram share a 165 km long boundary. Mizoram was part of Assam till 1972 when it became a union territory and a state in 1987. Border disputes between the two states keep occurring intermittently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/houses-torched-3-injured-in-assam-mizoram-border-clash/story-wZ38ZZYQcG3sI7x0qvvPqJ.html

Ahead of the release of Sunday’s figures, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said in Delhi that Kerala had squandered its early advantage and paid a big price for its laxity during the Onam festival.The minister said that the state was paying a huge price for negligence during Onam festivities and asked other states to learn a lesson from Kerala’s bitter experience. His criticism came hours after a government-appointed expert committee cautioned that relaxing curbs during the festive season could lead to a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases. But executive director of the Kerala Social Security Mission, Dr Mohammad Asheel criticised the Union minister’s comments saying it will only help create panic.“What the minister said is wrong. Death rate is lowest here and we have a high recovery rate also. Politics should be kept away from pandemic,” he said.But opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said like the minister he was pointing out ‘pitfalls’ for some time but the government failed to heed them. He asked the government to double the tests rather than finding refuge in outdated records. Statistics show things are not going right in the state. Kerala is one of the six worst affected states with high test positivity rate (TPR) and heavy load of active cases at 95,200. On Sunday, the TPR stood at 13.06%. Once lauded for its model pandemic control measures, Covid-19 cases surged after the first week of September following Onam festivities. Though the ground situation is grim, the state government said it has the lowest mortality rate in the country, 0.40 against the national average of 1.50 %. But many experts and opposition parties have criticised the government in finding refuge in mere records without seeing the writing on the wall. Experts have asked the government to increase the test rate considerably and give more emphasis on RT-PCR tests. Out of 39 lakh tests at least 60% have been antigen tests. They also asked the state not to include repeat tests in the tally and provide more ICU beds and ventilators. They warned critical care medical infrastructure will suffer badly if cases continue to increase at the current rate. A central health team is currently visiting the state to gauge the situation and recommend remedies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-continues-to-head-north-in-kerala-with-another-surge-of-7-631-cases/story-wbuxAGAD8hTCyyc4ryt8uK.html

The committee submitted its report on a day Union health minister Harsh Vardhan admitted community transmission of Covid-19 in certain pockets of a limited number of states in the country.The study sheds light on where India stands in its fight against Covid-19 and what lies ahead.1. India may see an exponential increase of 26 lakh cases in a month because of the festival season if precautions are not followed.2. Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal are still seeing a rise in the number of cases, while elsewhere the pandemic has stabilised.3. A second wave of coronavirus can’t be ruled out in winter. Also Read: Cannot rule out possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 during winters: NITI Aayog’s VK Paul4. Local lockdown are not effective now, but had there been no lockdown in March-April, India’s total deaths could have exceeded 25 lakh in August. The death toll now stands at 1.14 lakh.5. Only 30 per cent of the population has developed immunity so far.6. India reached the peak of Covid-19 in September and is now on the downward slope.7. The crisis is likely to be over by February 2021. By that time, there could be 10.5 million cases.8. Migrants didn’t make much difference to the number of overall infections.9. We have to be careful in the coming months also because of pollution on north India.10.

18-10-2020||India||BrahMos supersonic cruise missile: India’s latest addition to series of successful missile tests||The Indian Navy today test fired the supersonic cruise missile BrahMos, from INS Chennai, the indigenously built stealth destroyer. The test was declared a success after the missile hit its target with pinpoint accuracy by performing high level and extremely complex manoeuvres, as informed in a press release from the Ministry of Defence. Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the R&D wing of the Ministry of Defence, in a tweet confirmed the successful test. It also said that Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO and the Indian Navy for the successful launch of the missile. Here is a list of five things that you need to know about the BrahMos missile test-fired today -• All variants of the BrahMos missiles are developed by the BrahMos Aerospace, a joint venture between the DRDO of India and NPO Mashinostroyenia (NPOM) of Russia. • The missile has three variants that could be launched from air, land and water. A press release from the Defence ministry today, said that the presence of BrahMos as ‘prime strike weapon’ will enhance the capabilities of the Indian Navy’s indigenous destroyer.• Designed to attack naval surface targets, the missile has a range of 290 km. However India also successfully tested an extended 400-km range surface-to-surface BrahMos missile on September 30, this year. • Ability to extend the range of BrahMos missiles was obtained by India after its entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime or MTCR in 2016. • The missile tested today belongs to the supersonic variant and could clock top speeds of Mach 2.8, which is approximately 3 times the speed of sound. India has been in a missile testing spree recently, amidst ongoing border tensions with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Also, the missile test today comes at the backdrop of Home minister Amit Shah’s recent comments about the situation at the LAC. He said that the army is ready at any time to respond to all forms of aggression and the government is remaining vigilant about every inch of India’s land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brahmos-supersonic-cruise-missile-india-s-latest-addition-to-series-of-successful-missile-tests/story-rSnc32KNTOJxrmcyPJuoeP.html

18-10-2020||India||India set to lose Farzad-B gas field in Iran||India has all but lost the ONGC Videsh Ltd-discovered Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf after Iran decided to prefer domestic companies over foreign firms for development of the field, sources said. ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in 2008 discovered a giant gas field in the Farsi offshore exploration block. OVL and its partners had offered to invest up to USD 11 billion for development of the discovery, which was later named Farzad-B. After sitting over OVL’s proposal for years, the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) informed the firm in February this year about its intention to conclude the contract for Farzad-B development with an Iranian company, sources with direct knowledge of the development said. OVL, however, continued its engagements with NIOC over the development of the field and sought terms and conditions of the proposed contract for its evaluation, they said, adding that Iran has so far not responded to the Indian firm’s request. Farzad-B holds total reserves of around 21.7 trillion cubic feet of which around 60 per cent is recoverable, and production is slated to be around 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. Sources said unconfirmed information suggests that Iran has identified a local firm for the development of the field, but OVL has not yet given up hopes and continues to chase Iranian authorities for the contract. The 3,500 square kilometre Farsi block sits in water depth of 20-90 metres on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf. OVL, with 40 per cent operatorship interest, signed the Exploration Service Contract (ESC) for the block on December 25, 2002. Other partners included Indian Oil Corp (IOC) with 40 per cent stake and Oil India Ltd (OIL) holding the remaining 20 per cent stake. OVL discovered gas in the block, which was declared commercially viable by NIOC, on August 18, 2008. The exploration phase of the ESC expired on June 24, 2009. The firm submitted a Master Development Plan (MDP) of Farzad-B gas field in April 2011 to Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC), the then designated authority by NIOC for development of Farzad-B gas field. A Development Service Contract (DSC) of Farzad-B gas field was negotiated till November 2012, but could not be finalized due to difficult terms and international sanctions on Iran. In April 2015, negotiations restarted with Iranian authorities to develop Farzad-B gas field under a new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC). This time, NIOC introduced Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) as its representative for negotiations. From April 2016, both sides negotiated to develop Farzad-B gas field under an integrated contract covering upstream and downstream, including monetization/marketing of the processed gas. However, negotiations remained inconclusive. Meanwhile, on the basis of a new studies, a revised Provisional Master Development Plan (PMDP) was submitted to POGC in March 2017, sources said, adding that in April 2019, NIOC proposed development of the gas field under the DSC and offtake of raw gas by NIOC at landfall point. However, due to imposition of US sanctions on Iran in November 2018, technical studies could not be concluded which is a precursor for commercial negotiations. The Indian consortium has so far invested around USD 400 million in the block.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-lose-farzad-b-gas-field-in-iran/story-Y3u7M36m2M4flQ3o3asREN.html

Subodh Uniyal, minister for agriculture and horticulture in the state said that the Centres of Excellence will act as one stop centre for research and development on high-yielding seeds for the crops and fruits, studying effects of climate change on the product, promotion of the produce and making a brand. “We are working on building four Centres of Excellence in the state for apples, ginger and turmeric, walnuts and vegetables.The Central government has a scheme where states can get Rs 10 crores of financial assistance for making a Centre of Excellence. Using this scheme, we have started working on a proposal which will be sent to the Central government,” said Uniyal. The minister further said that the Central government has assured the state that financial assistance will be provided to the state for the project. The Uttarakhand government currently has one centre of excellence for aromatic plants in Selaqui. The construction of another centre of excellence is underway for organic farming in the Narendra Nagar area of Tehri Garhwal district. This project was approved in 2017 under the National Agricultural Development Plan. A centre of excellence for research and development on new techniques of farming is also being set up in Chaubatia town of Almora district, which will be equipped with laboratories, latest machinery and research apparatus. “In the long run, we are aiming to have a total of ten Centres of Excellence for different products in the state. With different centres dedicatedly working on different products, building a brand would be easier giving Uttarakhand’s Himalayan produce a separate identity,” added the minister. Last year, to promote organic farming, the agriculture department had selected an area of 78,000 hectares with most part in the hilly districts, which was divided into 3,900 clusters for growing different kinds of traditional and commercial crops of the state. Each cluster was divided into 20 hectares of land for practicing organic farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-set-up-four-centres-of-excellence-to-promote-apples-spices/story-Qpdjt8urSjRx394yvK0rDJ.html
18-10-2020||India||Judiciary’s greatest strength is people’s faith in it, judges should be fearless in their decision: SC Justice NV Ramana||The seniormost judge of the Supreme Court Justice NV Ramana has said the greatest strength of the judiciary is the faith of people in it and judges must be “steadfast in holding on to their principles” and “fearless in their decisions” to withstand all pressures and odds. Justice Ramana’s comments hold importance in the backdrop of a recent unprecedented move by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy of making allegations against him in a letter to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. Speaking at a condolence meet on Saturday for former Supreme Court judge AR Lakshmanan who passed away on August 27, Justice Ramana said, “The greatest strength of the judiciary is the faith of people in it. Faith, confidence and acceptability cannot be commanded, they have to be earned”. Justice Ramana’s remarks at a public function are the first since the controversy broke out after the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister wrote the letter. The senior judge added that “there are innumerable qualities that a person needs to live what can be called a good life: humility, patience, kindness, a strong work ethic and the enthusiasm to constantly learn and improve oneself”. “Most importantly, particularly for a judge, one must be steadfast in holding on to their principles and fearless in their decisions. It is an important quality for a judge to withstand all pressures and odds and to stand up bravely against all obstacles,” he said. Recalling the former judge, Justice Ramana said, “We should all take inspiration from his words and should strive to commit a vibrant and independent judiciary which is required in the current times”. He said his belief is that Justice Lakshmanan epitomized all the required qualities of being one of the best judges the country has seen. Justice Ramana said, “Our values are ultimately our greatest wealth, and we must never forget the same” and added that Justice Lakshmanan wore his values on his sleeves and he has learnt immensely from him about being a good person and a judge. Justice Lakshmanan, who hailed from Tamil Nadu, was appointed as a Permanent Judge of the Madras High Court in 1990 and he became Chief Justice of Rajasthan High Court and also served as Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. He was elevated as a Judge of the Supreme Court in 2002 and served till his superannuation in 2007. During his tenure as Supreme Court judge, Justice Lakshmanan was part of several Constitution benches and contributed in more than 200 judgments touching upon wide-ranging issues, including taxation, management of religious institutions, service matters, labour laws and employee welfare. After his retirement, he was appointed as the Chairman of the 18th Law Commission of India and submitted 32 comprehensive reports to the Government of India recommending various measures to improve the judicial system in the country. Several lawyers’ bodies from across the country including Bar Council of India, Supreme Court Bar Association, Supreme Court Advocates-On-Record Association (SCAORA) and Delhi High Court Bar Association have condemned the act of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister of writing the “unwarranted” letter to the chief justice making allegations against the sitting apex court judge. In an unprecedented move, the chief minister wrote the letter dated October 6 to the CJI, alleging that the Andhra Pradesh High Court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government.” He had requested the CJI to look into the matter and consider initiating steps “as may be considered fit and proper to ensure that the state judiciary’s neutrality is maintained”. The chief minister had alleged that the senior apex court judge had proximity to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and that a “former judge of the honourable Supreme Court placed this fact on record”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judiciary-s-greatest-strength-is-people-s-faith-in-it-judges-should-be-fearless-in-their-decision-sc-justice-nv-ramana/story-qKdE2fbdTnFlS1m2R9vFKL.html
18-10-2020||India||No fresh lockdowns recommended at local level: Government-appointed panel on Covid-19||No fresh lockdowns should be imposed on district or state level to contain the spread of Covid-19 unless there is an imminent danger of healthcare facilities being overwhelmed, according to a government-appointed committee chaired by IIT Hyderabad professor M Vidyasagar.The committee has also claimed that if all protocols are followed, the pandemic can be controlled by early next year with minimal active symptomatic infections by the end of February. The 10-member panel which conducted a study on “Progression of the Covid-19 Pandemic in India: Prognosis and Lockdown Impacts” has pointed out that with no lockdown, the pandemic would have hit India very hard with a peak load of over 1.40 crore cases arriving in June.The committee has developed an evidence based mathematical model for Covid-19 progression. The national level ‘super model’ is based on various parameters such as timing of the lockdown, alternative lockdown scenarios, impact of migrant workers returning to their homes, and future course of the pandemic including impact of not following safety protocols.“If all of us follow these protocols, the pandemic can be controlled by early next year with minimal active symptomatic infections by February-end. We do not yet know the weather-specific perturbations of this pandemic (in general, viruses tend to be more active in colder environment) and the effects of possible future mutations in the virus. Hence, the existing personal safety protocols need to continue in full measure. Otherwise we will see a sharp rise in infections. Fresh lockdowns should not be imposed on a district or state wide level, unless there is imminent danger of the healthcare facilities being overwhelmed,” Vidyasagar said.The committee including professors from IITs and IISc besides scientists, said that upcoming festival and winter seasons may increase the susceptibility to the infection but all activities can be resumed provided proper safety protocols are followed. It also noted that the imposition of an early and comprehensive lockdown pushed the peak of cases far into the future and also reduced the peak load on the system.“With no lockdown, the pandemic would have hit India very hard, with a peak load of over 140 lakh cases arriving in June. Given our lack of preparedness back then, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed, leading to many additional deaths. Had India waited until May to impose the lockdown, the peak load of active cases would have been around 50 lakhs by June,” the panel report said.“In actuality, the peak of active cases came in late September at around 10 lakhs. By this time, we were far better equipped to handle the pandemic in terms of diagnostics and vital equipment inventories. Without a lockdown the number of deaths in India would have overwhelmed the system within a very short time frame, and would eventually have crossed 26 lakhs fatalities,” it added.Based on temporal profiles of analyses done for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the committee concluded that the impact of labour migration on the total number of infections in these states was minimal. The committee also asserted that the imposition of various safety protocols such as wearing masks and social distancing, together with a comprehensive lockdown has allowed India to fare better than many other countries.“India has one-sixth of the world’s population (one-fifth excluding China), and one-sixth of the reported cases. However, India accounts for only 10% of the world’s deaths, and its case fatality rate of less than 2% is among the lowest in the world,” it said.The committee has recommended that the existing personal safety protocols need to continue in full measure, otherwise the country will see a sharp rise in infections. “Avoiding congestion especially in closed spaces and special care of those above 65 years and children is even more significant. Personnel with co-morbidities need to be extra cautious,” it said.The Department of Science and Technology had in June constituted a committee comprising eminent scientists and academicians to evolve a national supermodel for Covid-19 progression.The mandate of the committee was to create an evidence-based mathematical model for the pandemic after taking inputs from various groups working in the domain in the country and use it to analyse past events and future trajectories of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-fresh-lockdowns-recommended-at-local-level-government-appointed-panel-on-covid-19/story-VPbCk5XYJq2F1r1h5h4zLP.html

Sachan said that local issues, such as migration, unemployment, lack of basic facilities in hill-rural areas, among others, will be firmly raised.“We thank party president Akhilesh Yadav for reposing faith in me and thirty-eight other state working committee team members. The party has decided to contest maximum seats both in Kumaon and Garhwal divisions. Soon, a new membership drive will be initiated across all thirteen districts,” said Sachan.Lashing out at the Congress and the BJP for failing to fulfil the wishes of the local people, Sachan said that both these national parties have failed to provide good governance despite being in power for the past twenty years.“With Bahujan Samaj Party and Uttarakhand Kranti Dal being hand in gloves and sharing power with these parties earlier, local public have now realised the real face of these parties. Samajwadi Party is the only one with a difference and Akhilesh Yadav has assured of personally monitoring the working of the state committee and its progress regularly,” said Sachan.Not giving much weight to Sachan’s claims, BJP legislator Suresh Rathore pointed that Samajwadi Party has not won a single seat since Uttarakhand was carved out in November 2000.“It is the Samajwadi Party which has been rejected thoroughly by people of the hill state. They sit and decide in Lucknow, affairs of Dehradun, Gairsain, Pauri and Nainital. Suh is the case with the Bahujan Samaj Party. These parties once used to dominate Uttar Pradesh but are now surviving for their very existence,” said Rathore.The new state committee includes Avtar Singh, Suresh Parihar as vice presidents, SA Siddiqui as chief general secretary, Dr Rakesh Kumar and Dr Rajendra Parashar as general secretaries, SK Rai as treasurer, Subhash Pawar as chief spokesperson, Abdul, Hema Bohra, Ramesh Gaud, Chandra Mundappi as secretaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-2022-assembly-polls-samajwadi-party-announces-uttarakhand-executive-body/story-CQ2aKeVnDkmowWHLunL0lK.html

Ashok Das, his son Anil Das and five other members of his family were arrested for assaulting some of their tenants and stabbing Manoj Ram with a pair of scissors. Ram succumbed to his injuries at a local hospital. The tenants used to pay Rs 50 on an average for the rooms, local residents told the police. “Ashok Das and his family rented out rooms to around one dozen families many years ago. There are allegations that he recently started misbehaving with members of these families and demanded that the rent be increased to Rs 1500. This allegedly led to the quarrel. We have started an investigation,” an officer from Tangra police station said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorized to talk to the media. Eyewitnesses told the police that Ram was stabbed when he tried to save another tenant, Sunil Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispute-over-room-rent-of-rs-50-leads-to-murder-in-kolkata-slum/story-ye5sNhoEKbccpcCqAaNKON.html

Started by some Bengali priests who settled down in the hills in the last century, the puja has turned 100. Although the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the festive spirit in most parts of the country, Tindharia, a small town in the hills of Darjeeling, is all set to celebrate the festival with grandeur. Bringing back memories of the old tradition, the puja committee has constructed the idol on the site instead of buying one from the artisans in Siliguri, north Bengal’s biggest town located 27 kilometres away in the plains. It was in 1962 when the idol was made at Shankar Niwas for the last time. Also read: Study links Covid-19 with organ impairment in healthy people, offers proofThough troubled by ailments, Das is all set to play the drum which is an integral part of Durga puja festivities. “I have been doing this since 1962. I will play as long as I live,” said the octogenarian. Although the puja was started by Bengali priests, people from different communities are now part of the festivities at Tindharia, said the organisers. It is the third oldest Durga puja in the region. The puja held at Nripendra Narayan Bengali Hindu Hall in Darjeeling enters its 106th year while the one at Raj Rajeswari Hall in Kurseong turns 104. Unlike the one at Tindharia, the other two festivals have been scaled down this year because of the pandemic. People will not be allowed to have prasad or any kind of food items at these sites. Nowraj Chettri, secretary of the Durga and Kali puja committee at Tindharia, said, “We will perform the puja with more sincerity and seek blessing from the Goddess. All health protocols will be strictly followed.”The head priest of the puja, Keshari Prasad Bandopadhyay, lives in Kolkata but comes to the hills every year. In 2017, when life in the hills was paralysed by a 104-day general strike called by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in demand for a state of Gorkhaland, the puja was scaled down. Bandopadhyay however did not fail to turn up. Das, too, played the drums in 2017. “If people in Tindharia could organize puja despite the strike, no power can stop this puja. It is part of my life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-play-as-long-as-i-live-82-year-old-picks-up-his-drum-as-durga-puja-in-darjeeling-turns-100/story-sReBd32PACBrU1e2RtgAZP.html

The teenager, whose body was found floating in the canal 15km away from the district headquarters, was allegedly kidnapped and the abductors had demanded a ransom of Rs 2 crore from his parents, including his father, Mukesh Lamba.The victim was abducted on Thursday evening, when he had stepped out of his home at Dhanvantari Nagar in Jabalpur town to buy potato chips from a local grocery store.Later, the abductors made calls to the victim’s parents on their mobile phones demanding a ransom of Rs 2 crore for return of their son safely and threatened them with dire consequences if they report the incident to the police. “The body of the boy was found floating in a canal near Bichhua village under the jurisdiction of Panagar police station on Sunday morning. A towel was found tied around the neck of the body, suggesting he was strangled to death. The accused will be arrested soon,” said Alok Sharma, city superintendent of police (CSP), Jabalpur.Later, Adarsh Katiyar, additional director general (ADG) (intelligence), said in Bhopal that “an accused has been arrested”. Kamal Nath, the chief of the MP Congress committee (MPCC), took a dig at the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over the incident. “A boy is killed in Jabalpur by kidnappers after the liquor mafia took the lives of 14 people. The mafia raaj was extinguished from the state, when the Congress was in power. However, the BJP is sparing them (mafia) for reasons best known to the state government,” alleged the former MP CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-year-old-boy-abducted-body-found-days-later-in-mp-s-jabalpur-police/story-Q1Za95eeY260AyLlapY9cI.html

18-10-2020||India||In line with PM Modi’s vision, sacred forest patch set up en route Badrinath||In line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to highlight spiritual legacy and history of Char Dham shrines on the way to the sacred pilgrimage, Uttarakhand forest department has set up a special sacred forest patch called Badrivan--the forest of lord Badrinath-- where four sacred plant species associated with lord Badri--the deity enshrined at Badrinath-- have been grown and put up for pilgrims’ viewing. Pilgrims can now visit this forest patch en route to know more about the sacred trees associated with lord Badrinath. Forest officials said Adi Guru Shankaracharya, during his visit to Badrinath shrine, around year 815 AD, is said to have named the forests around Badrinath as ‘Badrivan’ because of the predominance of trees like Badri, Bhojpatra, Badriphal and so on. Earlier in July this year, the state forest department developed a Green Ramayana Park, where 30 plant species mentioned in Valmiki’s Ramayana and associated with lord Rama have been grown. The plant species that have been grown and showcased in the special forest patch include Juniperus Macropoda (Badri Tree), Betula Utilis (Bhojpatra), Hippophae Salicifolia (Badriphal) and Origanum Vulgare (Badri Tulsi) Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests and in-charge, research wing of the state forest department said this research demonstration plot has been set up in the form of a small sacred forest patch with the sole objective to showcase the peculiar ancient flora associated with lord Badrinath. “It is spread in an area of one acre on the main highway at Badrinath. Pilgrims can visit this forest patch and know more about these sacred trees. We have put boards with detailed information about these trees there”, he said “This will not only help pilgrims to know more about these sacred plants but also create more awareness about the rich Himalayan flora which has been revered since ancient times and needs to be protected and conserved at a time when many factors like habitat fragmentation, climate change, forest fires, illegal tree cutting and so on are emerging as threats to their existence,” he said. Also Read: Char Dham panel meets without chairman’s nodAll these four plant species have some sort of mythological significance attached to them. “Badri Tree has a characteristic aroma and its fruits and leaves are used to make dhoop (incense). Bhojpatra is one of the important ethnobotanical species of Badrinath area, outer bark of which has been used historically for writing as well as for making medicines. People walking to Badrinath shrine used to tie its bark under their feet for making their journey comfortable,” said Chaturvedi. The third plant species--Badriphal-- has been traditionally associated with lord Vishnu, who is believed to have survived on Badriphal while doing penance, he said.“Badri Tulsi enjoys special religious status as it is offered to Lord Badrinath. This plant is considered lord Badrinath’s favourite one and garlands made from its fresh leaves and twigs are offered at the Badrinath shrine,” he said.

On September 10, when Badrinath shrine master plan was presented before him, Modi emphasised that the Badrinath shrine area should be developed as a mini smart spiritual city, adding that the focus of Badrinath master plan should be on the spiritual legacy of the shrine. Badrinath and Kedarnath, along with Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Uttarakhand’s Char Dhams, are one of the most revered pilgrimages in the Hindu tradition and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Badrinath is located along the banks of the Alaknanda river in Chamoli district at a height of over 10,000 feet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-line-with-pm-modi-s-vision-sacred-forest-patch-set-up-en-route-badrinath/story-oV1RsRgRBx4qUkk921qhyH.html
18-10-2020||India||BJP following ‘coalition dharma’ by attacking me: Chirag Paswan||Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) president Chirag Paswan on Sunday reiterated his party’s stand of supporting the BJP, but not the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, saying that the party is “committed” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision even as he criticised the JD(U). “The Bihar first, Bihari first vision has become a stranglehold for the JD (U). I am committed to the development mantra of the PM with the idea of Bihar first, Bihari first,” he tweeted on Sunday.His statement comes a day after Union home minister Amit Shah said in an interview to a TV news channel that the LJP had left the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar on its own accord. Since LJP’s decision to contest the election on its own, BJP leaders have repeatedly backed Nitish Kumar and said that their alliance is with the JD(U). Paswan on Sunday also downplayed BJP’s recent attacks on him, saying that the BJP was only following “coalition dharma” as an ally of chief minister Nitish Kumar.“I do not need to exhibit my relations with the prime minister. From the time when my father was in the hospital to his last rites, I can never forget what he (PM) has done for me,” Paswan said in a series of tweets in Hindi.Paswan said the chief minister, also the JD(U) president, should be thankful to his ally for following the coalition dharma by giving him a “certificate” every day that it has no links with the LJP president despite “so much anger” against Kumar.“I do not want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be in any dilemma due to me. He should follow his coalition dharma. He can say anything against me without any inhibition to satisfy chief minister Nitish Kumar,” he said.He added that he is committed to Modi’s mantra of development.Experts say Paswan’s move to be vocal about his support for the BJP are timely ahead of elections. “His [Paswan’s] politics is more in keeping with likely post-poll scenario that he visualises, while the attacks are aimed at making an impact on the upcoming elections,” said Professor NK Choudhary, a Patna-based political analyst. JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said there was no confusion within the NDA’s ranks. “Ram Vilas Paswan was accommodating and flexible and understood the merits of the coalition dharma. Chirag has shown a lack of understanding of issues,” he said, referring to the late Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Manoj Jha, the main opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s Rajya Sabha (RS) member and the party’s national spokesperson, said, “The posturing of the BJP and the LJP seems to be an attempt to keep Kumar in his comfort zone till the very end and not let him see the writing on the wall, which the two NDA allies at the Centre have scripted against the third. Election is a perception battle. The perception on the ground is not easy to dispel.”The 243-member Bihar legislative assembly goes to polls on October 28, November 3 and 7.

18-10-2020||India||Why Covid-19 cases in India may increase in winter. All you need to know||Ahead of the onset of winter, experts are warning that the number of Covid-19 infections may see a sudden jump as the mercury dips. Russia and the United Kingdom are experiencing a second wave of Covid-19 aggravated by winter. There is no reason to dismiss the possibility of the same in India, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said earlier. The Covid-19 expert panel, headed by VK Paul, also asserted that India must be ready to face a second wave during the winter.Here is all you need to know about Covid-19 predictions in winter:1. In the United Kingdom, Covid-19 cases registered a 40 per cent spike with the onset of winter.2. Prediction is the UK will see 120,000 deaths in this winter.3. During early months — just after the outbreak of the infection — it was rumoured that hot and cold weather can kill coronavirus. But the virus has survived summer and monsoon and is likely to escalate in winter.4. Though there has been no confirmation on this, Covid-19 is likely to function like other flu viruses which thrive in winter conditions.5. Studies suggest all respiratory pandemics including Spanish Flu, Asian Flu, Hong Kong Flu did encounter a second wave after six months of the breakout. But for Covid-19, it will coincide with winter.6. It will also be a year this November as the virus was first detected in Wuhan in November 2019.7. Swine flu cases in Maharashtra had surged during winter, a study says.8. People with respiratory problems suffer during winter. In India, pollution is likely to add to this as major cities are highly polluted.9. Covid-19 has so far shown no behavioural change because of season change. But as the number of cases is increasing in countries where the temperature has started dipping, it is expected that Covid-19 will become more active during winter in India as well.10. In November-December, there is likely to be more unlocking in India. The spillover of festive unlocking will continue in November and December with more trains, flights, inter-state travel, which might push Covid-19 cases higher. Many European countries are going under second lockdown now to check the number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-will-covid-19-cases-increase-in-winter-all-you-need-to-know/story-8PPkHQpiBT3q2MOQazjM3L.html

She was a silver medalist at the 34th National Games in 2011 in Jharkhand. She had started coaching classes to train budding karatekas in February this year for her livelihood. But she had to shut it down in March due to the lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I had to shut the coaching after a month due to the lockdown. So I have no option but to sell hadia for livelihood,” said Bimla who was also a gold medalist at Bollywood star Akshay Kumar 4th International Kudo Championship in 2012.A commerce graduate Bimla stays with her 84-year-old maternal grandfather at Patragonda village in Ranchi’s Kanke block. Her parents live in Sagrampur village in the same block.Her father Ranthu Munda, 45, is a small farmer who also used to work as a daily labourer to provide for six other members of the family including four brothers and sisters of Bimla. “But my father’s health is not good now. So, he doesn’t go out for labourer’s jobs,” she said.“I have been living with my grandfather since childhood. My grandfather retired before 2000 when Jharkhand was not separated from Bihar. He gets pension around Rs 6,000 a month but most of his pension amount goes into his medicine,” she added. “I sell hadia at my home in the village. Average 70-80 glass of hadia is sold every day. Each glass costs Rs 4. The money I earn from selling hadia goes on buying household needs,” said Bimla, gold medalist of All India Karate Open Championship in 2015 and Federation Cup organized by All India Karate-Do Federation in 2019,.She claimed that she is among 33 players, who have been selected for Jharkhand government’s direct job scheme for sportspersons but she is yet to receive the appointment letter.“I applied for the direct job scheme in 2019, while verification was done in February this year. We were told that we would get a job by March. But, we are still waiting for the appointment letter,” she said.When sports secretary Puja Singhal was contacted, she said, “They would get their jobs in a month.”Meanwhile, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren took cognizance of Bimla’s condition. In a tweet on Sunday, Soren asked Ranchi deputy commission to provide the player all possible help in coordination of sports secretary.“When our upcoming sports policy will come into effect, the future of players will change,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-medalist-karate-player-in-ranchi-sells-rice-beer-for-survival/story-YBfpGQ3GYplL1VhBUM2jUP.html

Typically parties have formed alliances to govern but this time Labour can go it alone.A day after winning the second term, Ardern said on Sunday that she sees the election result as an endorsement of her government’s efforts to stamp out the coronavirus and reboot the economy.Speaking at a cafe near her Auckland home, Ardern said she expects to form a new government within three weeks and to prioritise work on the virus response.“We’re cracking on very quickly with the work we need to do as a new team,” Ardern said.Ardern’s popularity soared earlier this year after she led a successful effort to halt the spread of the virus by implementing a strict lockdown in late March. New Zealand has had fewer than 2,000 cases of the virus including 25 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/look-forward-to-working-together-pm-modi-congratulates-jacinda-ardern-for-poll-win/story-aqdMFzTBAxBuegwVOztWqM.html

18-10-2020||India||‘Long COVID’ linked to organ impairment in young people without pre-existing conditions: Study||Scientists, including one of Indian-origin, have assessed more than 200 people infected with the novel coronavirus and found that there was significant evidence of heart, lung, liver and pancreas impairment four months post-Covid-19 in young individuals without risk factors or pre-existing disease. The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, published in the preprint repository medRxiv, assessed 201 individuals enrolled at two UK sites -- Perspectum, Oxford and Mayo Clinic Healthcare, London -- following infection with the novel coronavirus between April and September 2020. According to the researchers, including Sandeep Kapur from Mayo Clinic Healthcare, the average age of the participants was 44, and they completed the assessments 105-160 days after initial symptoms. They said the prevalence of pre-existing conditions such as obesity and hypertension was low among the participants, and only 18 per cent of the individuals had been hospitalised with Covid-19. Nearly four months after the initial symptoms, the study found that the participants still reported fatigue, muscle aches, breathlessness, and headaches. In this low-risk population with persisting “long COVID” symptoms, almost 70 per cent of the individuals have impairment in one or more organs, four months after initial symptoms of the coronavirus infection, the researchers said. “In this young cohort with low prevalence of comorbidities, the extent of symptom burden and organ impairment is concerning,” the scientists noted in the study. Months after the initial symptoms were reported, the participants still experienced ongoing cardiorespiratory (92 per cent) and gastrointestinal (73 per cent) symptoms, and 42 per cent of individuals had ten or more symptoms, they said. According to the researchers, there was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32 per cent), lungs (33 per cent), kidneys (12 per cent), 63 liver (10 per cent), pancreas (17 per cent), and spleen (6 per cent). “Single and multi-organ impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior Covid-19 hospitalisation,” the scientists wrote in the study. Citing the limitations of the study, the researchers said the cause-effect relationship between organ impairment and infection could not be deduced, “but may be addressed by longitudinal follow-up of individuals with organ impairment.” They added that the study population was limited by ethnicity despite disproportionate impact of Covid-19 in non-white individuals. However, the researchers believe the findings have implications not only for the burden of long COVID but also for public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities. “There is urgent need for further multi-organ assessment, including blood and imaging analysis in the Covid-19 context, as well as linkage with primary and secondary care data, so that long COVID can be properly defined,” the researchers noted in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-covid-linked-to-organ-impairment-in-young-people-without-pre-existing-conditions-study/story-kPff4z9qikg5AO6ckkcXMP.html

Accordingly, he requested the Mamit district magistrate to withdraw the prohibitory order at the earliest.“ …. District Magistrate, Mamit has erroneously mentioned Betlingchhip (as also referred to as Thaidawr Ylang by few Mizos) which is currently under complete administrative control and possession of the State of Tripura under North Tripura District,” the letter said.To further bolster its claim, the letter cites construction of a watch tower done previously by Tripura government at Betlingchhip.“Tourism Department, Government of Tripura constructed a watch tower at the peak of Betlingchhip long back. It can be safely said that District Magistrate, Mamit in his prohibitory order has erroneously included Phuldungsei para/village (in Jampui) under Sabual VC of Jampui Hills RD Block in Kanchanpur Sub-Division of North Tripura District,” the letter reads.In the prohibitory order, Mizoram’s Mamit district magistrate Lalrozama stated that a Tripura-based organisation SONGRONGMA planned to construct a Shiv temple at Thaidawr Ylang falling in Mamit district without seeking permission from the Mizoram government.Also Read: Mizoram govt objects to temple construction at disputed border with Tripura, imposes prohibitory orders Stating that this would go against the interest of the local community that could disturb peace and tranquillity in the region, he imposed restrictions on assembly of five or more persons in the village and surrounding areas of Phuldungsei Zampi and Zomuantlang of Mizoram’s Mamit district since October 16 till further orders.Phuldungsei village, located at Kanchanpur sub division of North district of Tripura, has over 600 residents.

Addressing his weekly social media programme Sunday Samvaad, the minister said every state should take a lesson from Kerala situation. “The state is paying the price of its gross negligence. There were huge congregations during Onam and adequate safety measures were not taken,” the minister said.Between January 30 and May 3, Kerala reported only 499 cases and two deaths and the cases were concentrates in only a few districts, the minister said adding the resumption of interstate and intrastate travel started triggering the number.The first confirmed Covid-19 case in India was reported in Kerala on January 30. It took 203 days to breach the 50,000-mark in total Covid cases as the state managed to rein in the spread of the infection with stringent surveillance. However, the next 50,000 was reached within the next 23 days. And on October 13, Kerala’s Covid-19 tally crossed the three lakh-mark.On Saturday, 9,016 new cases of infection were reported from the state. A central team was sent to the state to examine why the situation has worsened over the past few weeks. Health experts said the next few weeks are critical for the state and asked officials and public not to lower their guard during the festive season.The state, however, government has claimed that the situation is not yet grim as Kerala’s recovery rate is high — daily recoveries are higher than daily infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kerala-is-paying-price-of-gross-negligence-during-onam-says-harsh-vardhan/story-6WdbGdBTM1F2VhktEDu81M.html
18-10-2020||India||Centre to soon issued guidelines for scaling up cycling infrastructure in India||The central government is drafting guidelines to scale up cycling infrastructure in the country, including interventions such as segregated lanes, shared streets, and intersections. The guidelines will be shared with cities as the part of the Smart City Mission of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs by Tuesday (October 20), officials aware of the development said.“The design guidelines contain national standards and processes to create cycle-friendly streets, including interventions such as segregated lanes, shared streets, and intersections. It also contains details about parking management and additional design elements such as parking of cycles, signage, and street lighting...The next phase of the document will contain implementation details and methods to measure the impact of interventions,” said an official.The ministry had launched the Cycles4Change Challenge on June 25. The challenge is aimed to help cities connect with the public and experts to develop a unified vision to promote cycling. Cities are encouraged to collaborate with experts and volunteers, as they develop and implement their plans. Citizen collaboration will also be a key metric in the evaluation of proposals submitted by the cities. India Programme of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) is helping the government in drafting the guidelines.Earlier, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi authorities had prepared a masterplan for cycling for the national capital around a decade ago. The masterplan was never implemented. “Besides planning standards for cycling infrastructure, we need to recalibrate traffic lights in cities to factor in mass movement of cycles at traffic intersections. We can integrate landscape planning with cycle infrastructure,” said KT Ravindran, an urban designer and a former chairman of Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC).On June 10, HT had reported the Centre’s recommendation to states to plan cities with pedestrian-friendly markets and more cyclists in a post-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) world.Read: Better infra may boost cycle use post-Covid, projects study“While the lockdown restrictions are is being gradually relaxed, the need for social distancing, especially in market places, will remain. The pandemic presents us with an opportunity to re-imagine streets for the public. To make market areas Covid-19 safe and people-friendly, the cities should consider the use of pavements in a big way. The need for personalised forms of transport is also expected to increase as a response to Covid-19. Cities around the world are leveraging the opportunity to expand their cycling network substantially,” the ministry had said in its letter to states.According to a survey conducted in June by the India Programme of the ITDP to understand public’s travel choices post-Covid-19, results had showed that cycling would increase up to 65%, as cities emerge out of lockdown restrictions. According to the ministry, out of the 107 registered cities, 54 had formed an official core team to work on cycling infrastructure. These cities had carried out perception surveys to understand the public’s views about cycling. Among the respondents, 95% and 95% of women and men, respectively, had said they would use cycle if their cities had better infrastructure for this mode of transport.“Cities are encouraged to contextualise these resources by using the test-learn-scale approach and present their learning as part of the workshops. The challenge has also emphasised key steps of the process, such as forming an official team, ensuring participation from women, and gathering feedback from the public at every step. Cities are also encouraged to initiate other interventions such as public bicycle sharing (PBS), rental programmes, repair clinics, and parking projects. These should be well integrated and connected with transport stations, public spaces, institutions etc,” the official said. Read: Cycling in Delhi rides high in Covid-19 era, but safety still a concernThe challenge is open to all cities under the Smart Cities Mission, capital cities of states/union territories (UTs), and all cities, which has a population of over five lakh. The challenge will be held in two stages.“Stage 1 of the India Cycles4Change Challenge mandates that cities consider at least one corridor to test segregated cycle lanes and a neighbourhood to make it safe for the use of this mode of conveyance. A minimum of five kilometres (km) of continuous corridor and a neighbourhood area up to five square (sq) km qualifies as a pilot intervention. By December 14, cities need to test the pilot along with their community and document the impact of interventions,” said the official.Around 370 km of streets and 210 sq km have been identified for pilot corridor and neighbourhood area, respectively. At least 35 cities have initiated work to this effect. Work is in progress in creating and testing the design solutions, he said.“All cities under the Smart Cities Mission are encouraged to use the project’s funds for interventions in both stages of the challenge. We will reward 11 cities with a prize of Rs one crore each as we graduate to the second stage,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-soon-issued-guidelines-for-scaling-up-cycling-infrastructure-in-india/story-g576y2tSOlx3rUrzNMX8IM.html

18-10-2020||India||BrahMos missile test-fired from destroyer INS Chennai in Arabian Sea||India on Sunday successfully test fired the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from the indigenously-built stealth destroyer INS Chennai, with the weapon hitting a pre-designated target in the Arabian Sea, the defence ministry said in a statement. The 290-km range missile --- an Indo-Russian joint venture --- has land, air and naval variants. “The missile hit the target with pin-point accuracy after performing high-level and extremely complex manoeuvres. BrahMos as prime strike weapon will ensure the warship’s invincibility by engaging naval surface targets at long ranges, thus making the destroyer another lethal platform of Indian Navy,” it said. The missile has a top speed of Mach 2.8 --- nearly three times the speed of sound. Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation, BrahMos and the Indian Navy for the successful launch. India has test-fired a string of weapons during the last two months in the midst of the ongoing tensions with China in the sensitive Ladakh sector. Sunday’s test came days after India test-fired an extended-range BrahMos supersonic cruise missile that can hit targets 400 km away. The range has been increased from the existing 290 km. The extended-range variant was tested from the Integrated Test Range at Balasore in Odisha on September 30. The configuration of the existing missile --- the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile --- has been tweaked to enhance its range. Increasing the missile’s range became possible after India’s induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in June 2016. Commissioned into the navy in November 2016, the 7,500-tonne INS Chennai incorporates new design concepts for improved survivability, stealth and manoeuvrability. The warship can carry 16 BrahMos missiles in two eight-cell vertical launch systems, besides other sophisticated weapons and sensors, officials said. Other weapons recently tested by India include a new version of the nuclear-capable hypersonic Shaurya missile with a range of 750 km and the anti-radiation missile to take down enemy radars and surveillance systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brahmos-missile-test-fired-from-indian-navy-s-stealth-destroyer-hits-bull-s-eye/story-oX4w1oTNtgAv2WOnsuBzmL.html

Dhirendra Pratap Singh, a local BJP leader, was arrested from the Polytechnic crossing on the Lucknow-Ayodhya highway, said STF inspector general of police Amitabh Yash.Singh had been on the run since Thursday even as a video circulating on social media purportedly showed him saying he had been framed in the case. So far, 7 people including Singh and his brother Narendra Pratap Singh have been arrested in connection with the incident. Around 22 other unidentified people are also named in the FIR.On Thursday, Singh allegedly shot dead Jai Prakash after a fracas broke out at the meeting at Durjanpur village in the Reoti Police Station area of the district over allotment of ration shops. The issue also triggered a political controversy after BJP MLA from Bariya assembly seat, Surendra Singh, came out in support of the main accused.Uttar Pradesh Police had said on Saturday they would invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and Gangster Act against those accused in the case. Under the NSA, one can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities believe the person is a threat to national security or law and order. Under Section 14 of the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, a district magistrate can order attachment of property, whether movable or immovable, if there is reason to believe that it has been acquired as a commission for an offence tried under this law.BJP MLA summoned by party On Sunday, BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh summoned party MLA Surendra Singh, who had attempted to defend Dhirendra Pratap Singh. “Yes, he has been summoned for his outspoken remarks. The party isn’t happy with him,” an aide of the state BJP chief told HT. After backing the accused and describing him as a BJP worker, Surendra Singh had on Saturday visited the Reoti police station and demanded that an FIR be registered as the main accused’s family had been injured in Thursday’s incident as well. It isn’t clear if the party leadership was contemplating taking action against Singh. “He hasn’t come so far,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.

A calf has been left as bait for the tiger.At compartment number 170 in the core Rajura forest area, the caged forest staff is perched on elevated structures covered by leaves on either sides of the main trapping area. The small cages are situated 40 metres away from the bridge. The employees are holding onto a rope pulling up the steel gate of the main cage that is to be used for trapping the tiger. The plan is to pull the ropes the moment the tiger steps into the cage, shut the gate, and then mobilise the a team of veterinarians who will tranquilise the feline.Clarification after controversyHowever, the method drew flak after a letter issued by the Rajura range forest officer (RFO) stated that the forest staff would be deployed daily between October 11 and 18 between 8pm and 6am and “seated in bait cages”. “The cages are being used for the staff’s own safety and not as bait. This strategy has been adopted, as it is difficult to get close to the tiger,” NR Praveen, chief conservator of forest (CCF), Chandrapur, said clarifying that humans aren’t being used a bait. On Saturday, the Nagpur-based Forest Guard and Forester Association of Maharashtra responded to the Rajura RFO’s letter. It alleged that the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) were being violated, as any tiger capture operation was supposed to be performed during the day. “The timing should be changed and due care must be taken for the safety of the forest staff,” the association said. It also pointed out that the department should consider its staff’s safety while expressing concern about long shifts that could harm their health condition.Arvind Mundhe, deputy conservator of forest (Central Chanda), said, “There is confusion over the fact that the forest employees are being kept as bait in place of the calf. No human being is being kept as bait... The first phase of this experiment ends on Sunday. We will take a call, whether we need to extend it.” At present, the forest department authorities are unable to spot the tiger during the day, said Mundhe. The department has roped in 25 Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) officers, 35 employees from the Central Chanda forest division and three veterinarians, each of whom will be assisted by seven staff members to catch the elusive tiger. Rajura forest area is spread across around 1,100 square (sq) kilometres. “We spotted the tiger after sunset on October 12 and 13 moving through its usual route. This is where the trap and cages have been put up,” said Mundhe. Independent experts also told forest officials about the ambiguous content of the letter. “I spoke to CCF Chandrapur. The forest department employees are not being used as bait. The bait site is under the bridge, while other cages will have tiger monitoring teams, who will pull the rope and shut the steel gate. The employees will feel safe due to the camouflaged cages provided to them for protection,” said Kishor Rithe, founder, Satpuda Foundation and a member of the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL).Department not considering shooting down tigerA state forest official said there has been growing demand from local residents to shoot RT1 but the department has not considered the idea yet. RT1 is believed to have killed eight people and injured three others since January 2019, although the figures aren’t confirmed. “All kills cannot be attributed to RT1. Of the eight deaths, the samples for five were sent for DNA analysis. The results have confirmed two cases due to a large male tiger. However, in other incidents, there has been no conclusive evidence,” said Mundhe.HT had reported on October 3 that Maharashtra reported the loss of the highest number of human lives due to tigers over the past decade. So far, 33 people have been killed in the state as cases of human-animal conflict continue to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-capture-tiger-maharashtra-forest-dept-deploys-staff-members-near-main-trap/story-eAlXT4Mzzgw1pfLHmePMZM.html
18-10-2020||India||India-China prepare for 8th round of military commanders’ talks next week||The eighth round of India-China military and diplomatic level talks is expected to take place next week to discuss disengagement in Ladakh even as armies of the two countries prepare for snow and winter deployment along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control (LAC).According to senior officials, both sides are not impatient over a resolution on the friction points but have decided to keep the dialogue channels open at both military commander and diplomatic levels. The talks are also aimed at preventing any vertical escalation on the friction points either due to an accident or aggressiveness of an individual commander.While the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has proposed that both sides withdraw armoured and artillery units as part of de-escalation first and then go for dis-engagement of infantry, the Indian side is very clear that armoured units cannot be withdrawn as it will give advantage to the adversary due to terrain and capability.Also read | No one can take away Indian land: Amit Shah says amid border row with ChinaAs a senior military commander explained, the issue is that the Indian Army’s approach to both north and south bank of Pangong Tso is through two very high mountain passes-- the 17,590 feet Chang La and 18,314 feet Marsimik La. While Chang La lies between the road from Leh to the contested south bank of Pangong Tso, Marsimik La lies between the contested north banks of the lake and Kongka La. The road from contested Gogra-Hot Springs near KongKa La to north Pangong Tso runs through Marsimik La.Also read | China turns Indian proposal on its head, wants de-escalation first and then disengagement“If India were to withdraw its armoured units from south of Pangong Tso to beyond Chang La or beyond Marsimik La, then they will never reach back to the contested points in a worst-case scenario as both the passes are blocked by heavy snow till April every year. The PLA, on the other hand, have an advantage as they have a six-lane Kashgar-Lhasa highway just 10 km from both Marsimik La and Kongka La with roads running right up to their posts,” said a senior official.Also read | Need to restore peace along LAC: S JaishankarWhile PLA launched aggression in Galwan Valley, Gogra-Hot Springs and north banks of Pangong Tso in April-May this year, the Indian Army was able to pre-empt their moves south of Pangong Tso to occupy the Rezang La -Rechin La ridgeline in last week of August. The situation continues to remain tense as the PLA is deployed in full in occupied Aksai Chin as well as in-depth areas up to Chengdu and Kashgar. PLA’s air force is continuing with its combat patrols in the area with nearby airbases active.Given the circumstances, the Indian Army and the PLA are deployed on the contested points with distance being maintained so that any chance of an accident is ruled out. Indian medical facilities have come up along the LAC so that victims of high-altitude sickness get immediate treatment and not wait for heli-lift to a specialised hospital at Hundar in Partapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-prepare-for-8th-round-of-military-commanders-talks-next-week/story-5jAws27EnLb76a8yTGSr9H.html

The low-pressure area is likely to become more marked during the subsequent 24 hours, as it starts to bring rainfall to the east coast -- just days after extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20cm, occurred over coastal AP, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra between October 14 and 16. It caused massive urban flooding in Hyderabad and killed at least 30 people in Telangana. Several people lost their lives due to floods in parts of Maharashtra as well.On Saturday evening, several areas in Hyderabad received heavy rain, triggering traffic snarls and water logging.Read:Hyderabad to witness more rains after days of downpoursThe depression over east-central and adjoining north-east Arabian Sea has moved westwards and lay centred around 540km south-west of Veraval in Saurashtra, Gujarat and 1,320km east and north-east of Salalah in Oman.

He has made a passing reference. I believe some restraint could have been exercised,” Shah said in an interview to News18 Group on Saturday in Hindi.No one can take away Indian land: Amit Shah says amid border row with ChinaKoshyari had written to Thackeray last week raising the issue of reopening of places of worship in Maharashtra. “I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turned ‘secular ‘ yourselves, the term you hated?” Koshyari asked Thackeray in his letter.In his response, Thackeray said he does not need a “certificate” on Hindutva from the Governor. “Do you mean that opening up religious places is Hindutva, and not opening them means being secular? Secularism is a crucial base of the oath you took as Governor. Do you not believe it?” the chief minister said.Thackeray also raised the issue of Kangana Ranaut comparing the state to Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) but he did not name the Bollywood actor. “Sir, you mention Hindutva in your letter, but I do not need any certificate or any teaching on Hindutva from you. My Hindutva does not permit me to welcome home a person who called my Maharashtra or Mumbai Pakistan occupied Kashmir,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-have-exercised-restraint-in-his-words-amit-shah-on-maharashtra-guv-koshyari-s-letter-to-thackeray/story-C0Gb9ossoSODUJk06mSZCM.html

His comments came days after Chinese President Xi Jinping asked troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for war amid ongoing tensions with India in eastern Ladakh.“We are vigilant for every inch of our land, no one can take it away... Our defence forces and leadership are capable of defending the country’s sovereignty and border,” he said in an interview with News18 Group. “Every nation is always ready (for war). That’s the purpose of maintaining armies — to respond to any form of aggression.

They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other’s positions,” said the statement.Shah was also asked if India should change its policy towards Tibet and Taiwan in a tit-for-tat response to China’s claim on Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. “It’s not right to discuss this here. It’s a very complex issue with far-reaching implications. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and foreign minister S Jaishankar have cleared India’s position (on China) on Parliament’s floor. I think that’s enough. Talks with China are underway...” he said.Both the countries have deployed more than 50,000 soldiers each along with advanced weapons and systems in eastern Ladakh.

And farmers and labourers of this country understand this,” Gandhi said.Referring to his “tractor rallies” against the laws during his recent visit to Punjab and Haryana, Gandhi said, “I came to Punjab and Haryana a few days ago and every farmer and labourer knows that these three laws are an attack on them.” He said he was happy that the Punjab government has decided to convene a special session of the Assembly on these laws on October 19 where MLAs will “decide about these farm laws”.Gandhi was delivering a virtual address at the launch of the second phase of ‘Smart Village Campaign’ in Punjab. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, some of his cabinet colleagues were among those present at the launch.Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government over the farm laws, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, according to an official statement, said: “Whatever time I have left with me, I will fight for the farmers and every other section of the state’s people.”“Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday joined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in pledging to force the Union Government to revoke the draconian Farm Laws, which they said will be debated in the special session of the Vidhan Sabha on Monday with the aim to aggressively and effectively combat the damaging impact of the legislations on farmers,” read a press statement from Punjab chief minister’s Office (CMO) on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-target-centre-over-farm-laws/story-aAGP30ajMBVpXpDP8GICFK.html

We understand that’s a very complicated, very difficult issue. There have been many negotiations on this at different levels over a different period. That’s a very high bar for a relationship,” Jaishankar said.“I’m talking of a much more basic bar, which is [that] there must be peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the border areas and that has been the case since the late 1980s. If peace and tranquillity is deeply disturbed, then obviously there will be an impact on the relationship and that is what we are seeing.”Also Read: China turns Indian proposal on its head, wants de-escalation first and then disengagementThe standoff, currently in its sixth month, has taken India-China ties to a new low, with troops firing warning shots at friction points – the first time guns have been used along the LAC since 1975. The two sides have also been unable to push forward a disengagement and de-escalation process despite several rounds of diplomatic and military talks.Jaishankar said the “big question” in the current scenario was how two large and developing countries such as India and China could find equilibrium.India had sought to normalise “what was a very difficult relationship” by developing cooperation with China since the late 1980s “on the premise that there will be peace and tranquillity in the border areas”, he pointed out.Asked if India could learn from China’s rise, Jaishankar said there were basic differences in the governance, polity and society of the two countries.In recent years, India had depended on imports and failed to create support systems that would boost manufacturing and industrial activity, the minister said.India will have to expand small and medium enterprises and strengthen its industrial base, innovation and manufacturing, he said, adding that looking to the services sector to solve all problems “is a fantasy”.A turning point in the modern era was 2008, marked by the global financial crisis and the rise of China, India and Asean, which led to economic rebalancing, he said.Also Read: Presence of Chinese troops along LAC poses a challenge, says JaishankarThis process took an even sharper turn in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which accelerated trend lines and led to greater multi-polarity, he said.India’s ability to “step up and assume global responsibility to do good” is a very important part of the country’s rise, Jaishankar said. It is also in India’s strategic interest to facilitate and partner in the rise of Africa. “If Africa becomes one of the poles of the global polity, it is better for us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-restore-peace-along-lac-s-jaishankar/story-Y5lisQ6UJrsWpnZwKAQB3O.html

During the meeting, the PM noted that the growth of Covid-19 cases in the country was showing signs of slowing down but he warned against any complacency before the deadly pandemic was brought under control.“Three vaccines are in advanced stages of development in India, out of which 2 are in Phase II and one is in Phase-III,” a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office said. “The Prime Minister further directed that keeping in view the geographical span and diversity of the country, the access to the vaccine should be ensured speedily. The Prime Minister stressed that every step in the logistics, delivery, and administration should be put in place rigorously,” the statement added. It must include advance planning of cold storage chains, distribution network, monitoring mechanism, advance assessment, and preparation of ancillary equipment required, such as vials, syringes, etc., the PMO quote Modi as saying.Also Read: Under 800,000 active cases in India for 1st time, experts have a word of cautionTop functionaries including health minister Harsh Vardhan, principal secretary to the PM PK Mishra, NITI Aayog member VK Paul and principal scientific adviser Vijaya Raghavan were present at the meeting held to chart out the future path for handling the pandemic. There has been a clear decline in daily cases, growth rate and number of deaths over the past three weeks, the PMO statement said. The Prime Minister suggested that the vaccine delivery system be developed on the lines of the conduct of elections in India. In the world’s most populous democracy, elections, especially those for the Lok Sabha, are a massive affair, with security forces, teachers, administrative officials and others being involved along with the active participation of political parties, organisations and millions of citizens.“The Prime Minister said that in a similar manner, vaccine delivery and administration systems should be put in place. This should involve the participation of States/UTs/District Level functionaries, civil society organisations, volunteers, citizens, and experts from all necessary domains. The entire process should have a strong IT backbone...” the statement said. Experts said that by pointing to the election model, the PM gave an indication of the scale at which the government plans to take the vaccination drive to the people.At the meeting, it was also discussed that Indian scientists and research teams were collaborating with and strengthening the research capacities in neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal and Sri Lanka. There are further requests from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Qatar and Bhutan for clinical trials in their countries, the statement said.Also Read| Vaccines against Covid-19 may not need to be administered annually: WHO OfficialModi directed top officials that India should not limit its efforts to its immediate neighbourhood but should reach out to the entire world in providing vaccines, medicines and information technology platforms for vaccine delivery systems.The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) in consultation with state governments and all stakeholders has prepared a detailed blueprint of vaccine storage, distribution, and administration, which was presented at the meeting. The expert group is working actively on vaccine prioritisation and distribution in consultation with the states.“The Prime Minister further directed that keeping in view the geographical span and diversity of the country, the access to the vaccine should be ensured speedily,” the PMO said.The Prime Minister said that in a similar manner vaccine delivery and administration systems should be put in place. This should involve the participation of states, union territories, district level functionaries, civil society organisations, volunteers, citizens, and experts from all necessary domains.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAs the work continues to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19, the government said two nationwide studies on the genome of the virus in India suggest it is genetically stable and has shown no major mutation. There have been concerns that any major mutation detected in the coronavirus could hinder the development of an effective vaccine. However, some recent global studies have said the vaccines currently being developed for Covid-19 should not be affected by recent mutations.Asked about the Prime Minister’s call to learn from the experience of elections and disaster management, political scientist Neelanjan Sircar said there were many areas in which the understanding can be augmented. “There is undoubtedly a large scope for learning. Elections is a little bit different because technically, election management is done by one particular body, the Election Commission, which has a particular set of resources available,” he said.Sircar said one of the aspects which came to the fore was regarding coordination vis-à-vis disaster management, which is a state subject. Sircar said many problems or issues may require coordination that may not immediately exist. This is definitely also an opportunity for us to learn, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pm-modi-pushes-poll-like-vaccine-distribution/story-9hYj9LsAFhm5qAEBNKRp8O.html
18-10-2020||India||In a narrow Kolkata bylane, a group of poor children play host to city’s smallest Durga Puja||Durga Puja – the biggest annual festival of the Bengalis – begins next week and 14-year-old Sneha Mondol is too busy now-a-days to find time to sleep and eat. The 1.5 feet high idol of Goddess Durga, which she and her friends have made, is almost complete and the children just need to give a few final touches before they take it to Kolkata on Sunday. “We are all so excited. On Sunday we will be going to Kolkata for the first time with the idol. Everything is set and a car has been hired which will take us to Kolkata and bring us back by evening,” said Mondol, a resident of Bhandarkhali, a remote village in North 24 Parganas, around 80 km east of Kolkata. While the focus will be on the biggest Durga Puja pandals in Kolkata, a group of poor children will be organising a Durga Puja in a narrow bylane in south Kolkata, perhaps the smallest puja in the city. These are children whose parents were once migrant workers and have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic, children from remote villages of rural Bengal whose families have been hit hard by Cyclone Amphan, children of sex workers from Asia’s biggest red-light area and children from a local slum. Mondol’s father, Dibakar, used to work as a carpenter at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh earning around Rs 15,000 per month. But he had to return home during the pandemic and is now almost jobless. The idol is being made by Mondol and her friends at Bhandarjhali village, while another group of children in Mathurapur village in south Bengal is busy making the decorations with sholapith. Every day they work for two to three hours in the afternoon to complete the job. It is almost done. “We are making all kinds of flowers – rose, lotus and lily among others - with sholapith. We are also making various designs in which small fairy lights would be tied. These would decorate the pandal where the puja would be done,” said eight-year-old Teesha Purkait. The simple pandal, a cubicle measuring four feet on all sides, made out of bamboo sticks is being made by a group of children whose mothers work as sex workers at Sonagachi, touted to be the oldest and largest red-light area in India. Children living in a local slum are assisting them to decorate it with face-masks, empty sanitizer bottles and face shields. A couple – Swaguna Mukherjee and Joydeep Mukherjee – who run a NGO to promote Indian art and culture is behind this initiative. The Mukherjees identified the qualities of these children during their trips to the villages and brought them together on one platform. The children are being guided in idol making and sholapith work by craftsmen in their villages. “We have been providing relief to the villagers and needy people in the city, including slums dwellers and sex workers during the pandemic and in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan. It is then that we came across these children. The idea of organizing a Durga Puja with these children was taken lately,” said Swaguna Mukherjee. A girl who earns her living by singing on the roads in the heart of Kolkata will be the sole performer of this puja. Mondol and her friends will be visiting Kolkata with the idol to set up the pandal and the idol inside it. Purkait, on the other hand along with her friends will arrive in the city to fit the sholapith lights and decorations on October 21, the day of Panchami. The annual festival starts on October 23. While the budget of the city’s mega pujas run into several lakh rupees and has even got grants from the state government, the puja organized by Mondol and Purkait along with their friends has a budget of less than Rs 10,000 which is being donated by the couple. “Please come and see our puja,” Purkait signed off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-narrow-kolkata-bylane-a-group-of-poor-children-play-host-to-city-s-smallest-durga-puja/story-03NYzXBOo2Tv2a6o9PhKmL.html

18-10-2020||India||Chhattisgarh bypolls: Amit Jogi’s nomination papers rejected||Nomination papers filed by the chief of Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) Amit Jogi for the upcoming bypolls on Marwahi constituency, a traditional seat of the leader and his father and former chief minister Ajit Jogi, was rejected by the district collector on Saturday. Jogi’s Scheduled Tribe (ST) certificate filed with the nomination papers was found “invalid”. The nomination papers of Jogi’s wife Richa Jogi, who had filed nomination for the same seat, was also cancelled by the district collector on the same ground. “After scrutiny, the nomination papers of Amit Jogi and Richa Jogi have been cancelled,” an election official of district said. A Chhattisgarh-government constituted scrutiny committee headed by DD Singh, secretary of state’s Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste development department, in its order dated October 15, 2020, had cancelled Jogi’s tribal caste certificate.The bypolls on the Marwahi assembly seat, which was empty after the death of former CM Ajit Jogi, will be held on November 3. The ruling Congress party has given a ticket to Dr KL Dhruve from the seat, while Dr Gambhir Singh is contesting on Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ticket. Amit Jogi, reacting on the rejection of his and his wife’s nomination papers, in a written statement alleged that the district collector took the action on directions from chief minister Bhupesh Baghel. He said he challenge the decision legally. “I have full faith in the judiciary and the people’s court, and justice will be done with Jogi family as usual,” he said. “The high-level caste scrutiny committee had suddenly cancelled the certificate. Everyone, except me, was aware of the development. There is conspiracy going on against me at the behest of Chhattisgarh CM. The country functions according to law and constitution not by revenge. The government has finally admitted that it is impossible to defeat Jogi in people’s court,” Jogi stated. Congress has welcomed the decision of high-powered committee. “The tribals of the state have got justice after the decision. We welcome the decision of the committee,” said state Congress spokesperson RP Singh. The controversy over Ajit Jogi’s tribal status has been a political issue in Chhattisgarh since 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-bypolls-amit-jogi-s-nomination-papers-rejected/story-T6bV1qwmOROymqpWDRNbTK.html

Police said after murdering the child, Darpana, the accused, Priyanka Yadav, 25, gave the body a bath, changed the clothes and laid it on the terrace.A neighbour noticed the body and alerted Priyanka’s husband, Tinku Yadav, who informed the police.Following investigation, the woman was arrested and booked for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.Tinku, who works as a labourer, told the police that his wife was depressed since the birth of their second daughter two months ago. He had noticed changes in her demeanor and she had also been suffering from insomnia and rarely slept at night.He claimed that Priyanka had tried to strangle Darpana around two weeks ago as well, but he had rescued her.On Saturday, Priyanka sent Darpana to an adjacent shop to buy a shampoo sachet for her. “On returning home, Darpana played in the street for some time and then came home and laid down on the bed next to her newborn sister for a nap. I was talking to neighbours in the street when one of them informed me that Darpana was lying dead on the roof,” Tinku told the police.“I rushed to the roof and found my daughter’s body on a folding bed and Priyanka sitting next to it,” he added, claiming that there, his wife confessed to having killed their daughter.Inspector Gopal Krishan, SHO at Salem Tabri police station, said the family hailed from Purniya in Bihar and had been living in Ludhiana for the past six years since the couple got married. “Darpana was their first child and they had another daughter two months ago. The woman’s husband has revealed that she had tried to kill Darpana 15 days ago also and has been mentally unstable,” he said, adding that the accused was under arrest and will be produced in court on Sunday.The child’s body has been sent to the Ludhiana civil hospital for post-mortem examination.‘She spilled all the shampoo while taking bath’Inspector Gopal Krishan said in her statement to the police, the woman claimed that her daughter had spilled all the shampoo in the bathroom while she was giving her a bath, which enraged her.She said Darpana was a naughty child and often got on nerves. When Darpana spilled the shampoo on Saturday morning, in a fit of rage, she smashed her head in the wall and on the floor, leading to the child’s death. Police found the accused’s broken bangles in the bathroom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/depressed-ludhiana-woman-murders-four-year-old-daughter-lays-body-on-roof/story-KGrOBILCco2DShYJ5fo3eJ.html
18-10-2020||Editorials||The LAC is the new LoC | HT Editorial||India and China are inching their way towards a new equilibrium on the border. The new border equation is likely to make the Line of Actual Control (LAC), marked by large buffer zones and winter withdrawals, similar to the Line of Control (LoC), marked by permanent deployments, firing range distances, and constant friction. Managing this transition, while restoring, to use the euphemism adopted by both governments, “peace and tranquility” along the border, is now the primary challenge. During this, India must show no signs of weakness or impatience as these will be exploited by a China which respects only power in its rawest, hardest sense. The two governments have been talking at multiple levels. Despite this, they have barely budged from their original positions and tens of thousands of soldiers are digging in for a stand-off that will, in all likelihood, run through the winter. Or they could well be further rounds of fighting designed to strengthen negotiating positions. There has been a sharp change in the options with New Delhi since Indian troops moved to the heights of Chushul Ridge in late August. If China is baulking at rolling back its intrusion along Pangong Tso, India will not pull its soldiers back from the heights. There is now insufficient trust between the militaries for such a move. On paper, this will seem as if India has conceded a chunk of land behind its version of LAC. And all effort must be geared even now to get China to vacate. But in reality, neither side had “actual control” of either bits of territory. They had been part of a no-man’s land and their forward deployments have now shrunk that buffer to nothing. This is a reality which Indian border policy is adjusting to.Restoring status quo ante would also imply returning Sino-Indian economic relations to what they were before. That is also out of the question. New Delhi had once seen trade and investment as a confidence-building exercise with Beijing. Today, New Delhi must draft a five-year plan to reduce China’s economic footprint in India as much as possible. And it should be working out how to do so in conjunction with other countries. Peace along the border is the obvious short-term goal, but struggle everywhere else should be India’s new long march.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-lac-is-the-new-loc/story-TKRaGzcknED9Y3LV68h7mO.html
