23-10-2020||News||Beijing aims to humiliate New Delhi. Counter it||China’s aggressions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh remind me of China’s way of dealing with India in the 1950s and 1960s. Behind the India-China bonhomie of those days, China quietly took possession of a large area in north-eastern Ladakh, and built a road across it to connect its two recently conquered alien territories, Xinjiang and Tibet. The area is an integral part of the territories of the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. Never before had China ruled that region; so it published new maps to justify its occupation of Aksai Chin. It was the first stab in its friend Jawaharlal Nehru’s back. In 1960, when the two countries were still talking peace Chairman Mao Zedong ordered his army to prepare for a major invasion of India. Which, in October 1962, again, caught India unprepared. India’s economic progress was interrupted and Nehru’s prestige hurt in India and in the world.Following that unexpected attack, the India-China relationship lay in tatters for several decades. A whiff of warmth entered their contacts in the 1980s, and, in 1993, the two countries signed an agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity on LAC. In 1996, another agreement laid down a number of confidence-building measures to be followed by Chinese and Indian forces to “maintain restraint, avoid opening fire, strengthen exchanges and cooperation to prevent any escalations of tensions”. While there were sporadic intrusions, including at Depsang, a serious incident occurred at LAC when Narendra Modi took over as prime minister (PM), with an attack at Chumar. President Xi Jinping’s first visit to India in September 2014 was accompanied by a major intrusion in Ladakh. Modi personally took up the matter with Xi, and the intrusion was vacated. In June 2017, Chinese troops tried to extend a military road close to the India-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction, which would pose a threat to both Bhutan and India, in Sikkim and in the Siliguri neck corridor. A three-month long face-off between the two armies at Doklam was resolved, followed by an informal Modi–Xi summit at Wuhan. The Chinese withdrew, and Xi’s attempt to embarrass Modi was frustrated. At the second summit in October 2019 in Chennai, the two leaders were reported to have “positively evaluated the direction of bilateral relations”. But, in April 2020, the People’s Liberation Army transgressed LAC at several points in eastern Ladakh, and a bloody encounter took place in the Galwan Valley. There were heavy casualties on both sides, but the Chinese were thrown out of the valley. At Pangong Tso, the Chinese, outflanked by the Indian Army’s occupation of the high ridges overlooking their camps, brought up 50,000 troops supported with tanks and artillery units on their side. The Indian Army, through a massive air lift, rapidly ensured counter-mobilisation to confront them. Meetings between senior military officers and the foreign and defence ministers of the two sides have failed to end this dangerous face-off.Behind China’s periodic aggressions lies a plan to secure India’s acquiescence as China’s junior, second, to humiliate our leaders and government in the eyes of our people, and subvert our civil society. Another part of this sinister design is to damage our economy through predatory trade practices, which have caused destruction of parts of our industry. China’s hostility has energised the hitherto slumberous Quad. The meeting in Tokyo earlier this month of Quad’s foreign ministers revealed the potential and possibility of acting as a balancer against China in the Indo-Pacific region. The meeting also gave indication of its role in developing the region’s infrastructure and connectivity, establishing new, resilient supply chains to support regional industry and trade, and promoting cooperation in technology. Frequent joint exercises of the Quad’s navies look like preparatory work for assumption of responsibility for regional security.India seems to have become aware of its enduring China challenge and of the importance of American support to meet that challenge. On their part, senior United States (US) officials have given expression to strong support for India. Deputy secretary in the state department, Stephen Biegun, during his recent Delhi visit, spoke of a fundamental US-India alignment “along shared security and geopolitical goals”. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also voiced strong support for India. In the US, for the first time in history, both Republicans and Democrats are united in supporting India. I trust the US-India 2+2 meeting next week, in addition to signing the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement, will focus on the gravity of the present crisis and India’s role in ensuring peace and security of the Indo-Pacific regime. The Indian Army is strong and fighting fit, but it is in need of modernisation. The Indian Navy is a highly integrated force, but it is small in size and in urgent need of rapid expansion. Our valorous Air Force is short of its requisite strength by eight or 10 squadrons of jets. With the economy stricken by the Wuhan virus, our resources are not sufficient to meet these pressing needs. The 2+2 meeting, next week, will, no doubt, take note of the gap between India’s resources and its enhanced security role in the Indo-Pacific region. A short-term American lend lease programme for India’s armed forces would be the most effective way of filling this gap. The message of such a gesture will reverberate around the world: Indo-Pacific is a reality; freedom is its soul; and democracy its strength.

23-10-2020||News||Aligning India’s STIP-2020 vision with NEP||At a time of unprecedented change, advancement in science and technology has become an important determinant in India’s transformation into a self-reliant global leader. The foundation of innovation will be built through the creative efforts of our youth and children, and we must inculcate a scientific and innovative temperament in them. With sweeping changes in policy, a paradigm shift in the processes of learning will be needed as they become more driven by critical thinking and innovation.There are two interconnected aspects. One involves exploring the mechanisms through which to promote Science Technology Innovation (STI) learning in the early stages of school education. The other explores the pathways through which research and innovation can be reformed in Higher Education (HE) and Higher Educational Institutes (HEIs) to facilitate the expansion of research and development (R&D).Former President APJ Abdul Kalam once said, “Millions of people walk in this universe, but you can enter the Marvels of the Universe only if you have curiosity and thinking. The mission of schools should indeed be a generation of curiosity. I suggest thinking should become your capital asset, no matter whatever ups and downs you come across in your life. Thinking is progress. Non-thinking is stagnation to the individual, organisation, and country.” These profound words from this visionary statesman still resonate in my mind.This was what was kept in mind while formulating the recent National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, with which our education system envisages transformational changes. There is a strong focus on analytic thinking, creative problem-solving, and critical examination of existing structures rather than just a transfer of information. As Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (STIP) 2020 is being given its final touches, it is important to draw from the experiences of NEP-2020 and align the STI ecosystem’s vision with its priorities to ensure a holistic growth trajectory.STIP-2020 aims to build an educational environment that nurtures and encourages innovative thinking and also creates pathways for its pursuit in the long-term. In the current policy-building exercise, we have kept our focus on select areas. We learn to live, we learn to think and we learn to learn.One, a major attempt has been to focus on innovation in education, which can help students and young scholars in HEIs achieve quality research outputs for STI. The proposed changes in curriculum development through a National Curriculum Framework and the complementary National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education (NCFTE) of the NEP-2020 will give flexibility in pedagogy that encourages critical thinking, scientific temper, problem-solving, innovative approaches, collaborative learning, and active learner engagement.Two, we need to bridge the disconnect between research and education to overcome fragmented learning. Making research mandatory in school education has increasingly become a priority. This should be complemented by strengthening incentive mechanisms such as Science Olympiads and Technology Innovation Awards. Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and general education are set to receive a better impetus through effective linkages. STIP-2020 bridges the gap between curricular, co-curricular, or extra-curricular areas; arts and sciences, and vocational and academic streams and provides the possibility of switching subject areas. It is also necessary to interlink academia with industry, encouraging collaborative projects and need-based capacity-building. NEP-2020 has also proposed the establishment of a National Research Foundation (NRF), which will have significant funds for supporting research in technology, science, social science, arts, and the humanities.Three, a dynamic and creative environment must be facilitated. Collaboration between ministries and HEIs is the way forward. Students will get hands-on experience in fields of their choice and once qualified can seamlessly enter industry.This will also boost vocational education, promoting entrepreneurial skills among students and make them both knowledge and job-creators. Four, we must look at science beyond the classroom. To strengthen the education base, we must establish an infrastructure base to support educational activities with a special focus on digitisation platforms, research, innovation, and entrepreneurship. And five, there must be focus on the development of assistive technologies and learning resources.This will create interactive personalised learning environments for students with specific learning disabilities and ensure that the expansion of the STI ecosystem is equitable and inclusive. This must begin right from the school level. For higher education, there is a need to support research in this domain and incentivise the development of haptics, smart devices, advanced bionics, in-built speech, and other sensory interfaces.STIP-2020 in alignment with NEP-2020 must aim to bolster innovation-driven scientific temper in the education system from the foundational stages intensifying its linkages with the economy and society. It should play a major role as a true enabler for last-mile innovation.Harsh Vardhan is minister for science and technology, earth sciences, health and family welfare.This article is a part of a series on STIP-2020 The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/aligning-india-s-stip-2020-vision-with-nep/story-NuV8QV0k8JDFZaeFTR4X2J.html
23-10-2020||News||Pakistan’s opposition is taking on the army. India should just watch||Pakistan is at another of the inflection points that seem to crop up in the nation’s path every few years largely because of the imbalance in relations between the military and the civilian government. This time, the trigger is a movement launched by opposition parties with the stated aim of removing what they describe as the “selected” government of Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan.Former premier Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) and the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) have created the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) and organised a series of “jalsas” or rallies in major cities. Latent tensions between Sharif and the military establishment exploded into the open when the PML-N leader named army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed during PDM’s first massive rally at Gujranwala on October 16, blaming them for ousting his government, pressuring judges to take up fake cases against opposition leaders, and making Khan the PM through a rigged election two years ago.Sharif, who has lived in London for almost the past year and addresses gatherings in Pakistan via video conference, kept away from PDM’s second rally in Karachi on October 18, which too attracted a huge crowd. But the incensed military retaliated by pressuring police in the port city to arrest Sharif’s son-in-law Muhammad Safdar Awan the following day. After more than 50 police officers in Sindh, of which Karachi is the capital, went on leave to protest the way the provincial police chief was harassed by military intelligence agencies to order Awan’s arrest, Bajwa ordered an inquiry and spoke to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, whose PPP rules Sindh, to calm the situation.There is already speculation in Islamabad that Sharif acted after getting signals from sections of the military upset with Bajwa — a grant of extension in service to Pakistan army chiefs, such as the one given to Bajwa last year, is usually followed by a decline in popularity — as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, key background players in Pakistan’s politics with considerable sway over political alignments. This is understandable as there is little love lost between the current PM and the Saudis. There is even buzz that Sharif received discreet messages from China, which has warily watched Pakistan’s economic decline on Khan’s watch, especially in view of its immense stake in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Perhaps, a simpler explanation is that the PDM has in its fold two of Pakistan’s most astute and street-smart leaders — Sharif and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who has long harboured outsized dreams of being PM. Both have their finger on the pulse of the streets and are capable of gathering large crowds. They know that public sentiment for the Khan government is at a low, with the price of wheat touching a record high, government employees protesting over salaries, galloping inflation and near-complete lack of support from the International Monetary Fund and the Saudis. Sharif and Rehman, more than anyone else, know the time is right to make efforts for a change.For Sharif, there is also the need to remain politically relevant, after having been ignominiously removed as premier by the Supreme Court on flimsy charges of corruption and then jailed. He left the country on bail on medical grounds, and Khan, stung by the PDM’s shows of strength, has vowed to bring him back to Pakistan. Sharif’s current efforts, in a situation where he knows he has little left to lose, are also aimed at preparing the grounds for his anointed successor, daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif.The Indian establishment, which has done well to keep away from political developments in Pakistan, must also distance itself from misinformation campaigns which don’t capture the complexity of the situation — no good has ever come of such moves in this digital age. One will have to wait for PDM’s moves to see whether the military jettisons those who are no longer useful to it or responds with more crackdowns.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pakistan-s-opposition-is-taking-on-the-army-india-should-just-watch/story-DxPqRjxmTOYfJBW9B0HR6K.html

However, in the last two years, the number of surgeries conducted per month averaged around 21,500.Emphasising that non-Covid services should not be hampered, institute’s former director Dr Yogesh Chawla said: “Since Covid-19 reports are important now, the stress should also be on developing testing methods that give prompt results and are totally reliable, so that routine services are not denied or postponed.”.The institute has recently stated that restoring all services remains a priority, but it is still evaluating the situation.Dr Ashok Kumar, the official spokesperson, said: “The emergency services have never been stopped and a large number of patients has been treated. When regular services are restored to the fullest, the backlog of scheduled surgeries will be cleared by all departments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-pgimer-sees-75-dip-in-surgeries-amid-pandemic/story-9uDUv0wbObznpi7yPCLkgO.html
23-10-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER doctors bat for continuation of plasma therapy||Even though the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is considering removing plasma therapy from the Covid-19 management guidelines, doctors at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) are of view that the experimental therapy should not be taken completely off the protocol.The clinical trials by ICMR did not show promising results. A trial conducted across 39 hospitals in India has revealed that plasma therapy neither reduces the death risk nor does it slow down the progression of the disease from mild to severe stage. Pankaj Malhotra, professor at PGI’s internal medicine department, who was the principal investigator of the trial, said though the results were not encouraging, the therapy can be continued on a set of patients fitting into the criteria and wherever a physician feels that it can yield better results.“As a part of study, we have come to know that the randomised trials did not have an impact on mortality, but at the same time we have to keep in mind that certain symptoms such as fatigue and fever were treated faster. Rather than doing nothing, we can actually do something and try this therapy on a certain subset,” he added.Head of the transfusion medicine department, Professor Ratti Ram Sharma said, “For now, there is no set treatment for Covid-19 and the therapy should be given at the discretion of the physician and to those who fall under the category of treatment. It should not be used as an over-the-counter drug.”The transfusion medicine department runs a plasma bank which caters to the need of patients from across the tricity. PGIMER was one of the centres of the ICMR’s national trial for convalescent plasma therapy. The institute had successfully enrolled nine patients, five of whom received plasma treatment and the remaining ones were on control arm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-doctors-bat-for-continuation-of-plasma-plasma/story-BkNQbjksTmfAUwffSpCSFM.html

23-10-2020||Mumbai||HC reprieve for BJP councillor Bhalchandra Shirsath, will continue to be member of Mumbai civic body’s standing committee||The Bombay high court on Friday ordered that BJP councillor Bhalchandra Shirsath will continue to be a member of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing Committee till October 27, although later in the day the general body of the corporation decided to remove him from the most important civic committee.A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice VG Bisht passed the order on a petition filed by Shirsath on Friday morning challenging October 21 decision of the civic body to remove him from the standing committee. He had also challenged the agenda for the extraordinary general body meeting held on Friday afternoon to fill the post vacated by Shirsath.Shirsath’s counsel, advocate Amogh Singh, submitted that the decision was not only illegal but was also a colourable exercise of power. He pointed out that Shirsath’s nomination on the standing committee has been approved by the corporation, issue of his eligibility was raked up at the committee’s meeting of October 21.Prabhakar Shinde, BJP group leader in BMC had taken strong exception to the issue raised by Shivsena’s Vishakha Raut. Shinde also pointed out relevant provisions of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, after which nothing further happens in the meeting. However, at about 11.30 PM, the BJP councillor received a letter from the corporation that after taking legal opinion, the standing committee had decided that he cannot baby a member of the committee, for being a nominated member and not an elected one.In this backdrop, Amogh Singh prayed for an interim order restraining BMC from filling up the ‘vacancy’.After the judges expressed utter displeasure over the sequence of events, BMC’s legal head, advocate Aruna Savla, informed HC that the decision to remove the Shirsath as a member of the standing committee was withdrawn, the concerned item on agenda of the general body was amended and the matter was to be placed before the general body to discuss and decide the issue of the BJP councillor’s removal from the standing committee.After hearing both sides, the bench allowed the general body to proceed with the meeting and make a decision as to whether Shirsath should be allowed to continue as a member of the standing committee, or not. HC added that the corporation shall not implement the decision or resolution up to October 27, when the court will further hear the matter if it decides to remove him from standing committee.“In other words, the Petitioner shall continue to be a member of the standing committee of the Corporation until this court hears the matter on 27th October 2020,” said the bench.According to his petition filed through Jeet Gandhi, Shirsath has been nominated by BJP as a councillor on March 17, 2020, and was appointed on the standing committee along with 12 others on September 28, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-reprieve-for-bjp-councillor-bhalchandra-shirsath-will-continue-to-be-member-of-mumbai-civic-body-s-standing-committee/story-3pkb4xOkBSV5lNqxbEpH3H.html

He was arrested by ED on September 7 on charges of money laundering and later remanded to the agency’s custody till September 19. In the meantime, he was tested positive for Covid-19 on September 14. Hence, his ED custody was suspended and he was sent to judicial custody. Kochhar was discharged on October 13 after Covid-19 treatment and was remanded to ED custody. The special court had remanded him to judicial custody on October 17.He had, last week, approached the special court through his lawyers Vijay Agrawal and Aashul Agrawal and requested to be shifted to a private hospitalIn his plea, Kochhar stated that he “suffered from an extremely severe and prolonged bout of Covid-19 lasting more than three weeks, with many additional complications including prolonged and severe infection which has impacted the entire body, including lungs and immune system.”“The applicant is still suffering from prolonged effects of Covid infection. Going into the jail will not be safe for the health of the applicant.

She was alone at home when the incident took place on Thursday afternoon. The accused has not been identified yet.The girl was first taken to the Naraingarh civil hospital, where the family tried to pass it off as an accidental injury.Even as the girl was referred to the civil hospital in Ambala City at night, the parents kept insisting that she was injured by an iron rod, said Dr Vandana Sharma, chairperson, district child welfare committee.It was only after the child was counselled by the hospital staff and child welfare committee representatives that she revealed that “an unknown man, who had covered his face, had raped her”. The man had even threatened her of dire consequences if she confided in anyone, said Dr Sharma.“The family knew that she had been sexually assaulted, and had even changed her clothes before taking her to hospital. However, afraid of stigma, they tried to conceal it,” she said, adding that after seeing the child’s injuries, the hospital staff took the family into confidence.A case under Section 4 (penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at the Ambala women police station.

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Sanitation workers, garbage collectors on strike in Chandigarh||Upping the ante against the municipal corporation, door-to-door garbage collectors have decided to stop lifting of solid waste from households in Chandigarh from Saturday.The strike is set to impact the whole city, in a repeat of what happened around two years back.This comes at a time when the Safai Karamchari Union went on an indefinite strike from Friday, stopping the collection of garbage and cleanliness work at markets, roads and streets. Confirming the decision, Om Prakash Saini, president, Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society, said: “We will totally stop the collection of garbage from houses. The strike will go on till the MC relents and comes to the negotiating table.”The garbage collectors are against the MC taking over garbage collection in the city. The union is demanding signing of a memorandum of understanding with the civic body, as it claims was promised to it earlier. The union is also demanding permission to collect user charges from residents directly and sell reusable solid waste. “Even though the MC General House has passed a resolution to this effect, the corporation has not committed to it in writing. Instead, the MC is insistent on collecting user charges through water bills or property tax bills, and also will pay out only a part of the earnings from sale of reusable waste articles. This will impact our income,” said Saini.On Friday too, some garbage collectors didn’t pick household solid waste from a few sectors, including 22, 27, 32, 36, 43 and 49, and other areas, like Maloya. “Collectors in these areas left the work to participate in the sanitation workers’ dharna against the MC in Sector 17,” said Saini.From Saturday, Saini warned, the union members will not allow anyone to collect garbage. “We will break the wheels of carts if it is required to stop the lifting of garbage,” he said.Resident bodies slam MCCriticising the MC for its handling of the impending crisis, Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said: “If the issue is not resolved immediately, we will pass a resolution against the MC and boycott it on every platform. The MC has failed on most civic and development issues.”Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations, Chandigarh, “During the strike two years ago, most people dumped their garbage at Sehaj Safai Kendras. While households faced limited issues, these centres were overflowing with garbage.”Sanitation workers stage dharnaOn Friday, the Safai Karamchari Union began its indefinite strike and staged a protest in front of the MC office in Sector 17. Mayor Raj Bala Malik’s effigy was also burnt.Union president Krishan Kumar Chadha said: “From Saturday, there will be complete shutdown of sanitation and garbage collection services. The MC can no longer take us for granted. The strike will go on till the MC accepts all of our demands.”Sanitation workers are against wearing GPS-enabled smart watches, and want regularisation of their services. They also support the garbage collectors’ demands.MC commissioner KK Yadav said: “We are trying to convince them not to go on strike. I have deputed the sanitation committee to negotiate with them. In case they do stop garbage collection, we will ensure the services are normalised without delay.”Rajesh Kalia, former mayor and chairman of the sanitation committee, couldn’t be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sanitation-workers-garbage-collectors-on-strike-in-chandigarh/story-9yvRvczQeKNHsgyelR82WJ.html
23-10-2020||City||Bombay high court rejects plea of a person booked for abusive tweets against Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and son Aaditya||A petitioner who sought protection from coercive action by the police for defamatory tweets against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya Thackeray over the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput – drew a sharp reaction from the Bombay high court. The court had directed the petitioner, Sameer Thakkar, to cooperate with the investigating officer which he did not follow. This led the court to dismiss his petition. Thakkar was granted interim protection by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on August 28. He was booked by the local Sitabuldi police for the tweets under sections of 292 (punishment for obscene acts or words in public) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of Information Technology Act on a Shiv Sena activist’s complaint. Seeking the court’s intervention, the petitioner prayed for quashing FIR against him and demanded security in wake of alleged threats from Shiv Sena activists. Apart from granting Thakkar interim relief, the court had also directed not to file charge sheet if the investigation was completed during the pendency of the petition. The investigating officer, on October 12, informed the high court that the petitioner was not co-operating after which Thakkar was directed to report to Sitabuldi police station every day between 6pm and 8pm from October 13 onwards. The petitioner filed an affidavit on October 20 informing the court that he had filed two more petitions before two high court benches, including Mumbai, where similar directives were issued. Therefore, it was very difficult for him to come to Nagpur to mark his presence every day. Thakkar had also moved the Supreme Court with his grievance. A high court division bench, comprising justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote, while noting down petitioner’s difficulty in running from one station to another and attending the police stations, expressed surprise over failure to inform the investigating officer about his inability to come to Nagpur. The bench also wondered as to why the petitioner had not sought any modification of the order directing him to appear daily before Sitabuldi police at Nagpur. “We can very well understand the petitioner’s difficulties in running from one police station to another. But, we can’t understand why he didn’t intimate the investigation officer about his difficulties. We also fail to understand why he hasn’t sought any modification of the high court’s earlier order till date that directed him to report to Sitabuldi police every day,” the judges said and added that “it appears that on the one hand, the petitioner seeks interim relief and on the other, he thinks he needn’t follow the conditions imposed by the high court under the impression that he can help himself without anybody’s assistance. If this is his conduct, the bench doesn’t think it would be appropriate for them to entertain this petition any further,” the bench observed. Since Thakkar had already approached the Supreme Court, the high court dismissed the petition noting that considering the conduct of the petitioner it would not be appropriate to entertain the petition any further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bombay-high-court-rejects-plea-of-a-person-booked-for-abusive-tweets-against-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-and-son-aaditya/story-fxEQ1nRXurI5nwy45uHXQJ.html

This property was offered to me at ₹11 lakh per acre. Accordingly, I handed over cheques of ₹5 crore to him (Jakhar) and transferred ₹90.5 lakh to his company Sovereign Infra Solutions,” the complainant said. Singhal said few days later, Jakhar showed him a 2016 order of the SC-appointed committee wherein his name had been proposed as a prospective buyer and the valuation report of the property had been called for. “To expedite the process and manage the valuation report favourably, Jakhar took ₹36 lakh from me,” he told the police.He alleged that Jakhar did not get the sale deed executed in his favour and when he asked him to return the money, he gave him cheques of ₹28 lakh only. Singhal claimed that Jakhar deliberately evaded all communication from him after that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/director-of-delhi-based-pacl-booked-for-cheating-panchkula-man/story-vBQQlSOKAsbed6z836y9gJ.html
23-10-2020||City||Akali Dal, BJP get a raw deal in Mohali MC ward delimitation||In a major setback to Shiromani Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party councillors, 70% seats held by them in the previous Mohali municipal corporation House have gone into ward delimitation or been reserved or deserved to their detriment ahead of the upcoming civic body elections in Punjab. The five-year term of the House ended on April 26 this year.The delimitation board constituted by the local bodies department to redraw boundaries of wards based on the recent census gave its final approval on Friday. The population under the MC’s jurisdiction has gone up from 1.64 lakh to 1.87 lakh. Among the 50 wards, 25 have been reserved for women besides five for scheduled castes (including two for women) and two for backward classes (men). While former Akali mayor Kulwant Singh’s Ward No. 49 has been converted to general from reserved (SC), his son Sarabjeet Singh Samana’s Ward No. 25 has been reserved for women.As many as 23 of 33 wards previously held by SAD-BJP have been affected, while wards of only two former Congress councillors have been converted to general category and the remaining 13 have been left untouched.Miffed over this, both SAD and BJP councillors are accusing the state’s Congress government of “dictatorship”.‘Done in undemocratic way’Mohali got a municipal council in 1984, which was upgraded to a corporation through a notification in January 2011. However, the elections were held after four years in 2015. While Congress had won from 15 wards, the SAD-BJP alliance got 23 seats. The Azad group, led by Kulwant Singh, won from 10 while two seats went to Independents. With the support of his group besides 14 Congress councillors and the two Independents, Kulwant was elected Mohali’s first mayor in August 2015. Two years later, the Azad group merged into the SAD. In the upcoming elections, the SAD and BJP will be contesting separately after their alliance at the Centre broke over the farm bills.Still waiting for the delimitation’s blueprint, Kulwant Singh said: “People of Mohali know who has done development work in the city.”During his tenure, Kulwant Singh remained at loggerheads with cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, who represents Mohali in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, as the two were often engaged in a “credit war” over development works in the city.Former BJP councillor Arun Sharma, whose Ward No. 9 has been reserved for women, said: “We all worked with dedication in our wards for five years, and now they (Congress government) have shifted our wards. It has been done in an undemocratic way.” Justifying the delimitation, former Congress councillor Bharat Bhushan Mynee said: “The 2015 elections were held according to the 2014 population data. In six years, the population increased, especially in the new sectors, necessitating redrawing of ward boundaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akali-dal-bjp-get-a-raw-deal-in-mohali-mc-ward-delimitation/story-3R2wnFhuCWgqYcRsAtOuBI.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Independent MLA from Mira-Bhayandar to join Shiv Sena||In another blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after senior leader Eknath Khadse quit the party, independent legislator from Mira-Bhayandar Geeta Jain is set to join the Shiv Sena on Saturday afternoon. Jain, a BJP rebel, defeated BJP’s Narendra Mehta after the party refused to give her a ticket in the 2019 elections. The former Mira-Bhayandar mayor contested as an independent in the last assembly polls.Shiv Sena insiders said that Jain will join the party in presence of party chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at Matoshree on Saturday afternoon. Jain was in touch with Sena functionaries after the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi and had met Thackeray on a few occasions looking for a switch.With her entry into the Sena, the party will be able to expand its base in Mira-Bhayandar region, where it has not been able to grow due to a strong BJP influence. The strength of Shiv Sena will increase to 65 (including support of Independents) with Jain entering Sena.Besides that, Shiv Sena could also benefit in the Mira-Bhayandar local body with Jain’s entry. The BJP controls the municipal body, but some corporators are in touch with Jain and could join the Sena with her or may join later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/independent-mla-from-mira-bhayandar-to-join-shiv-sena/story-DRziAD3xDaV5sqN5IMBAEL.html
23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ramlila associations shelve burning of Ravana effigies this Dussehra||With only a handful of Ramlilas being staged in the city, the festive spirit has already taken a back seat due to the pandemic. Now, Dussehra is also likely to be a low-key affair as none of the Ramlila associations in Chandigarh will burn Ravana effigies to signify the victory of good over evil. Speaking about the latest move, president of Chandigarh Kendriya Ramleela Mahasabha, Bhagwati Prashad Gaur, said, “The administration had organised a meeting with various associations of the city to give us permission for the Dussehra function. However, they gave us too little time to prepare for it and most organisations didn’t even turn up at the meeting, while the ones which were there declined to host any kind of function for Dussehra.”Tejinder Chauhan from Barara village in Haryana, who had made a 221ft tall Ravana at Dhanas last year, will also be taking a year of. He has rather chosen to make a miniature 10ft effigy of Covid. Speaking about how the Ramlila troupes will conclude their events, which in previous years ended with the lighting up of Ravana on Dussehra, adviser of the Joint Ram Leela Sangh, Ashok Chaudhary, who plays the character of Ravana, said, “We will be hosting pujas on the Ramlila stage this year. The stage will not be left vacant while we honour Lord Ram with prayers.” The Ramlila troupes which had chosen to perform this year will hold a 24-hour puja for the cast members.Jyoti Bhardwaj of the Sector-29 OCF Sanskritik Manch said that even though the professionals who hail from places like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh won’t be coming to the city, kids have started building their own Ravanas. “Children of Sector 29 got together and are building around a 18ft tall Ravana. It is nice to see kids take an initiative,” Bhardwaj added. Meanwhile, Chandigarh administration on Friday gave permission to the Youth Welfare Club of Maloya to celebrate Dussehra. The president of the club, Sobhit Kaushal, however, said, “We will not be burning Ravana, but rather taking out a Rath Yatra for which we had applied to get permission.” Rajput Dramatic Club of Ram Darbar and Uttarakhand Kala Manch of Sectors 55 and 56 were also given permission to host Ramlila.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ramlila-associations-shelve-burning-of-ravana-effigies-this-dussehra/story-NyPvjHsrVBZVh3mygHxEDJ.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Media trial in Sushant Singh Rajput case: Bombay high court says journalists have lost their neutrality||The Bombay high court (HC) did not mince words while pointing out to the fact that journalists today have lost their neutrality and the media has become polarised. The observations were made by the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni on Friday while hearing public interest litigations against the media trial in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. The court was prompted to make the observations after the advocate of one of the respondent channels submitted a report authored in 1947 by a European institute, which analysed options between self-regulation and statutory regulation for the media, and concluded that there was no need for government control.While clarifying that the channel was not guilty of the allegations made by the petitioners as it was not named by any of the petitions, advocate Ankit Lohia appearing for Zee News, however, said that he wanted make submissions in support of the contentions of other channels that there was no need for government interference in functioning of channels. He cited a 1947 report of a European institute and stated that the report had made it clear that the media should self-regulate instead of any statutory regulation.The chief justice made an observation on the submissions of Lohia and said, “We are ruled by the rule of law. In India there is a rule of law, right? How do you advocate that people who go around accusing others can find shelter of freedom of press? Journalists back then were responsible and neutral, now the media is polarised.”Justice Kulkarni then questioned Lohia why he referred to the 1947 report and not to the 1983 Law Commission report which had compared the media regulation model of India with that of European countries and had suggested that there was a need for checks and balances in the functioning of the media in India.After Lohia responded to the query stating that the media was not averse to being regulated, the bench observed, “This is not a question of regulation. This is a question of checks and balances. People forget where to draw lines. Do it within lines. You [news media] want to criticise government, do it. The issue in the present case is that someone has died and the allegation is you are interfering.”Thereafter, senior advocate Alankar Kirpekar for India TV and advocate Zeeshan Hashmi for News Nation channels also made submissions and drew the attention of the court to the fact that the media trial in the actor’s death case was a one of an instance, and hence the court should not insist on having statutory regulation on the media. They even submitted that the media was controlled by the government in countries such as China and Bangladesh, as a result of which, their independence was ranked very low internationally.Meanwhile, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, representing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) stated that the petitioners’ claims about information pertaining to the investigation in Rajput’s death case being leaked to selective media was misconceived and the three agencies had categorically denied the allegation through their affidavit. On the request of one of the petitioners, the court agreed to have further hearing in the matter next week on October 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/media-trial-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case-bombay-high-court-says-journalists-have-lost-their-neutrality/story-ZAxw4R2tgEMAqtrfNzUjLL.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department starts special lectures on various subjects on DD Sahyadri||The state education department has started a series of special lectures for students of Class 9 to 12 on DD Sahyadri. The channel will air educational content for students on various subjects. As part of the special initiative, students from state board schools across Maharashtra can listen to expert teachers talk on various subjects every day. The show titled Dyanganga will air on the channel between 7.30am and 12.30pm from Monday to Saturday from October 26. The initiative is a part of several other programmes that the state government has launched over the last few months to provide online and TV-based learning to students. “Schools are already conducting online classes for students daily. However, for students of higher grades, special guidance lectures are important. Especially, for Class 10 and 12 students’ extra preparation is essential as they have to appear for the board exams. Such initiatives will be of great help to them,” said an official from the education department. In April this year, as schools in the state remained shut due to Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, the department hosted educational content on Diksha app which is a ministry of human resource development (MHRD) platform for e-learning. Until now, students are sent a set of links on the phones of their parents or guardians and they can access this content as per their convenience to continue learning. In July, the department also launched educational channels for state board students on Jio TV. Teachers said that while it was a good move to provide additional resources, the government now needs to focus on assessment. “There are no uniform guidelines for the conduct of exams and right now assessments across schools are not consistent. This will affect the academic future of students,” said the principal of a Mumbai-based school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-starts-special-lectures-on-various-subjects-on-dd-sahyadri/story-Dz0WIqYKCB5sRessXF4q1L.html
23-10-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Urgent action required to weed out gangsters from Chandigarh||Police have to get organised The increasing number of crimes shows the law enforcing agencies in poor light. Why is the police force not as well organised as the gangsters are? Why aren’t new technology and innovative methods used to curb crimes? The Chandigarh administration with authorities in Mohali and Panchkula authorities and the law enforcing agencies have to work together to find a way to bring the criminals to book. Dr Devinder Garg, Chandigarh Community mobilisation required There is an urgent need to control and prevent youth gang violence using novel strategies such as community mobilisation, opportunities provision and social intervention. A comprehensive strategy should be developed that extends beyond law enforcement and includes elements to prevent juveniles from joining gangs and efforts to intervene and “rescue” youths who have some experience with gangs. Police agencies must be active in soliciting the support and partnership of other criminal justice agencies, the juvenile justice system, and community organisations. Only through sharing “ownership” of the problem with a broad range of people can police address the gang problem at its roots. Targeted enforcement tactics should be coupled with prevention programmes to keep juveniles off the path of gang membership, intervention to “rescue” those who are already involved, and multilevel partnerships with other government agencies and non-government organisations. Madhav Bansal, Chandigarh Plan special training modules Police personnel require special training to deal with gangs. Strict implementation of the paying guest (PG) system is required as neighbours’ inputs too have to be included with the mandatory verification of tenants. Permissions of the homeowners will be required to allow friends or relatives of the PGs to come and stay with them. Shokeen Singh Verma No criminals on campuses Spoilt brats are the product of shoddy parenting, and when in bad company of like minded youngsters, splinter groups of students in university or college hostels turn to crime. Those with similar political leanings try to form their own fiefdom on campuses instead of concentrating on their studies. Thoughtful parenting is one way to change things. University authorities and hostel wardens should also keep a watchful eye on the suspicious characters and take police help wherever needed. SC Luthra, Chandigarh Stricter laws for weapons licences Arms and ammunition license should be issued only to genuine cases and that too after a thorough background check and psychological tests. Licences of people with crime records should be cancelled. The law enforcing authorities should maintain strict checks on social media accounts and activities of criminals on bail. Pubs, bars, discotheques should not stay open till late hours. Gangster culture thrives on connections with high profiled people and politicians, and the police and higher authorities should keep tabs on such links. The courts should settle such cases as soon as possible and strict laws should be laid down so that criminals are not released on bail. Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali Disrupt communication channels The police and intelligence wing have to disrupt the communication channels and weapons, drug and cash supplies of the gangsters. A thorough probe is required into how these gang leaders are able to pass on orders and instructions to their gang members from behind the bars. The supply line of funds and arms has to be disconnected. A strict case must be made for all social media channels to block accounts linked to criminals, even those run by their followers. Karan Singh Vinayak, Chandigarh Weed out corruption from the forces The Chandigarh administration has to issue an ultimatum to the police force to maintain law and order in the city at any cost. When it comes to law everyone should be treated equally: The rich, poor, politicians and bureaucrats. A first information report ( FIR ) should be filed immediately once a crime is committed. Also, corruption in the police force must be weeded out at any cost as often criminals get away by bribing them. Check barriers should also be set up/ maintained at all city entry points to inspect each vehicle entering Chandigarh for weapons. Patrolling should also be intensified. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali The message is in the music What are musicians thinking by releasing Punjabi songs based on guns and gangs? Music is an expressive art form that can bring about positive social change. Most of the releases in Punjabi have references to gang wars and Chandigarh. If the content does not change there’s a chance that young people will be misled into associating a life of crime with glamour. According to research conducted in the past by a professor at the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad, Dr Dheeraj Sharma, on the influence of Punjabi music over youth and propensity to commit violence, 60% of the youth were found to be listening to music glorifying drug use and violence provoking songs and were more prone to committing violence. Singers and writers and the production companies that promote such music should be penalised for this. I also feel that, from the last six years, such music has in some way influenced criminal activities in the city. The youth too seem to be keen to adopt the lifestyles of the gangsters with no fear of the police, Some sort of censorship committee needs to be set up to ban such music. Simran Sharma Swachh Bharat should target crime tooThe Swachh Bharat campaign should go beyond cleaning of cities, it should also focus on bringing to book criminals, dishonest and corrupt representatives and officials. To curb crimes, policemen need to be given professional training and skill sets to handle law and order, with improved pay packages. They need to be equipped with better, modern and user-friendly equipment, especially bulletproof vests. The police force also requires an image makeover to create a fear psychosis among criminals. The arms licencing department of the tricity also needs to be integrated.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, Zirakpur Administration apathy must endChandigarh has imported this gun and gang culture from Punjab and it is no secret that these gangsters have state police patronage most of the time. The more frequent such incidents are in any state the more apathetic the administrative machinery is towards such activities. Rajeev Rai Walia, Chandigarh Monitor issuance of arms licencesFirstly, issuance of arms licences should be strictly monitored. Entry of weapons into Chandigarh should be checked and for this Central Reserve Police Force or local police teams should be deployed at various entry points to inspect vehicles for any suspected illegal activity. Weapons of owners engaging in violence should be confiscated and they should be punished immediately under the Arms Act. Priyam Aggarwal, Chandigarh Understand the root cause of violence To stop any violence, first analyse its root cause, identify the segment of the population engaged in such violence and focus on skills training and grievance redressal system for groups at risk of taking to a path of crime. Proper parenting can help. Police patrolling can be improved through mobile check posts. Cases of criminal activities should be decided in the court at the earliest to send message to the society that it is not acceptable. Dev Raj Ban civilians from carrying firearmsPeople are becoming less tolerant, so even minor brawls are turning bloody. Licensees with firearms cannot guard these instruments of death round the clock, leading to ease of misuse. Gun culture is antithetical to the ethos of free India’s civil society. Laxity of police action is evident as very few cases involving shoot outs in Chandigarh have been solved. At the moment there is no alternative to curb crimes than to impose a nationwide ban on civilians using firearms.Till then, the intent of carrying a gun or other firearm in public must be thoroughly questioned and illegal weapons confiscated.Lalit Bharadwaj, Panchkula Isolate incarcerated gang leadersThe gang culture needs to be eliminated immediately from its roots with the police urgently required to organise itself for the task. Let a deputy superintendent of police level officer be assigned the task with a select team. Work out a plan to finish the gangs and then execute it meticulously. First, identify the base of the gangs (Lawrence Bishnoi, Davinder Bambiha etc) and their prominent leaders. All of them need to be put behind bars and isolated so that they are not able to operate from prisons. Second, monitor the activities of each gang and coordinate intelligence gathering about their operations, nipping their plans before they are able to execute them. People should be incentivised and encouraged to share information about gangsters in their areas. Also, let there be cohesion in the police force, with the SSP in full control. Weed out bad eggs from the force. Colonel RD Singh (Retd), Ambala Cantonment Act against gang leaders nowDoes it not surprise anybody that most people know about these criminal gangs, their leaders, and their political and police contacts and yet they roam free and commit crimes with impunity? Why can’t these gang leaders/ members be detained under National Security Act and lodged in different jails in the country – outside their state? A strict watch should be kept on them while they are in custody. Family members should be brought on board to bring their wayward wards under control. Vinay Gupta, Ambala Cantonment What about rights of citizens?A policing philosophy based on the need to protect the rights of all citizens is the need of the hour. As in the US, even on a tip off, many crimes were prevented by the police, but this does not happen in Chandigarh. Police have to be focused on providing a service as a means to uphold the law, rather than utilising force to impose the law. At the moment the force remains understaffed, underfunded and – more so – unaccountable. There’s need for better intelligence, administrative action and aggressive intervention by trained police forces with the IT Act used to good effect. SK Khosla, ChandigarhStrict eye on gangsters in jailHow are gangsters behind bars operating? The police must answer the question and ensure that such criminal elements are always under strict surveillance. Tricity police should coordinate work to control crimes with special focus on speedy completion of investigations. Advanced weapons should be provided to the police and CCTV cameras installed at vantage points to ascertain the identities of criminals and to nab them. Saikrit Gulati, Chandigarh Early intervention a mustWe need to ensure that our communities feel a sense of responsibility to address gang violence, which has complex social, political, educational, judicial and economic layers. Those at risk of taking to a life of crime should have access to remedial education, job training and placement, with social Intervention by youth serving agencies, schools and street outreach workers. It is important to reignite a sense of urgency and focus on early preventive intervention and identification of people likely to indulge in such criminal offences to nip the evil in the bud. The UT administration should initiate suppression programmes with the assistance of non-government or other welfare organisations and practice zero tolerance policy to crimes for aggressive law enforcement . Komal Singh, Chandigarh Check problems at school levelThe government should stop issuing gun licences. Youth join the gangs for protection,enjoyment, a misplaced sense of respect, or because a friend is in a gang. They are at a higher risk of taking to crime if they are aggressive or violent in schools. Special attention should be paid to such students by their teachers and family, even the community they are a part of.Tapasya choudhary Social reforms neededVery basic reason for gang war in the city is that the members want to establish their dominant role. Once that’s done they get political patronage to checkmate their adversaries with their muscle power.The factors attributing to increasing crimes are poverty, family breakdown, failure in education, drug addiction and so on. Therefore, there is a need for the major social reforms in society to prevent youngsters from taking to a path of crime. Law enforcing agencies must ensure deterrent action against the criminals, especially the heads of gangs. SS Arora, Mohali Make election rules stricterIt is desirable to impose certain conditions for eligibility in college and university student elections. Those with a dubious record, history of crime or poor academic record should be barred. Indirect election implies that faculty-wise elections be held and the winners be eligible to contest as office-bearers of unions. Campuses should be well guarded with security guards maintaining a register and not letting anyone enter without an ID proof and details of person he or she is visiting. Many of the gangs are affiliated to the bigger gangs who enjoy VIP protection.

23-10-2020||City||Farmer issues dominate campaign songs for Baroda bypoll||With Baroda bypoll round the corner, campaign songs of political parties in Haryana are revolving around farmer issues amid protests against the Centre’s agriculture laws. Four prominent candidates—BJP’s Yogeshwar Dutt, Congress’s Indu Raj Narwal, INLD’s Joginder Singh Malik and former Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini of the Loktantra Suraksha party are locked in a fight for the rural constituency. The Baroda by election are slated for November 3. During the poll campaign of INLD patriarch OP Chautala and his son Abhay Chautala, who is also Ellenabad MLA, a song “Kisano Ki rulde feren the dane, messiah aaya sath nibhane (the farmers’ produce was lying in the mandis without procurement, the messiah (Abhay Singh) came there to help them amid Covid-19) was being played.In the song, the INLD highlights the poor condition of crop procurement amid Covid-19 pandemic, distribution of masks and sanitisers by Abhay Singh Chautala and how he had toured various mandis in the state to support farmers. The song also mentions how Abhay Chautala came out from his Teja Khera farmhouse like a cloud and helped the distressed farmers. On the other hand, the Congress has chosen ‘Zamidar yo tut leya (the farmer is broken), a song that emphasises the plight of farmers, rise in corruption and unemployment besides promising to elect Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda as the next chief minister of Haryana.The ruling BJP, which is facing protests by farmers against the three agriculture laws, has launched a song “ya mandi nyu a chal gi, MSP nyu a aavga yo bad –bad k n aavga (this mandi system and MSP will continue and every time the MSP will be released with a rise). The BJP’s theme song says “the Congress’s lie will not be sold, if you burn a tractor then we will expose your lie. You will bring Rahul and make fake perceptions. You should bring Robert and hand our land back. Modi has been giving us ₹6,000 per annum and implementing new schemes for our welfare”.The bypoll has become a prestige issue for leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government. The INLD has won the constituency from 1977 to 2005. The saffron party’s nominee has never won from Baroda, which has 54 villages. Most voters in the rural constituency belong to the Jat community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmer-issues-dominate-campaign-songs-for-baroda-bypoll/story-DHIySV7XwabpVPdrGllCPO.html

As per the municipal corporation (MC) officials, at least three bidders were required for the e-auction, but the number could not be met for the parking lots at Feroze Gandhi market, BRS Nagar market, Multi-Storey parking, Bhadaur House and Model Town extension market.While there was no bidder to take the contract of Feroze Gandhi market (reserve price Rs 80.1 lakh), BRS Nagar market (Rs 18.5 lakh) and Model Town extension market (Rs 28.3 lakh), Multi-Storey parking (Rs 80.5 lakh) got one bidder and Bhadaur House (Rs 27.5 lakh) parking lot two. Only the Sarabha Nagar block-I market, which had the lowest reserve price of Rs 4 lakh, received the adequate four bids.While the e-auction for the parking lots was scheduled to be held on Saturday, technical bids were opened on Thursday evening. MC secretary Neeraj Jain only a single lot that got four bids will be auctioned on Saturday. “The MC commissioner will decide on the further course of action,” he added. One of the parking contractors, Munish Shah said he did not apply for the contract as officials had been turning a deaf ear to problems being faced by contractors at the parking sites. “We have been submitting complaints regarding shopkeepers opposing the paid parking and absence of boundaries of lots, but MC has failed to provide any solution,” Shah said.MC to manage parking lots after Oct 30As the previous contracts of the parking lots will come to an end on October 30, MC will take over the parking lots and manage these till they are allotted again. Visitors will be charged Rs 10 for two-wheelers and Rs 20 for four-wheelers. Contractor to be blacklisted for overchargingFollowing complaints of overcharging by contractor (Arjun Yadav and Company) at the Multi-Storey parking lot near MC’s Zone-A office, MC officials have approached the finance and contracts committee to blacklist the contractor.

23-10-2020||Noida||Noida: FIR filed against three land grabbing in Barola village||The Noida authority on Friday filed an FIR against three persons on charges of land grabbing and illegal construction on a notified land in Barola village near Sector 49 along Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) Road.The authority’s lekhpal (land record keeper), a junior engineer, and a tehsildar had gone to the site to stop the illegal construction. As per officials, the land grabbers allegedly tried to forcefully stop the team.“The construction is being carried out without any approval from the Noida authority on some parts of the government land and private land against the law. When we tried to stop the construction work, the land grabbers argued with us and created a ruckus.

The suspects have been identified as Sarfaraz, 26, a resident of Bijnor, and Vishwajeet, 25, a resident of Sector 8 in Noida. The two suspects were also involved in a robbery at a company in Sector 8 last month.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that the two suspects were arrested on Friday at around 3am in Sector 8. “The two persons were travelling on a motorcycle. The police signalled them to stop but they tried to escape. The police chased them and forced them to stop. The suspects failed to provide the registration certificate of the vehicle,” he said. The police team found that the motorcycle was stolen and the suspects had doctored the registration number plate. During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they were burglars and they were looking for opportunity to commit a crime. “The police team found ₹23,000 in cash and a knife from their possession. Based on information revealed, the police later conducted a search and recovered nine stolen laptops from their hideouts,” Singh said. Singh said that on September 21, Sarfaraz and five other suspects conducted a robbery in a factory in Noida Sector 8. “During the robbery, the suspects had held a security guard at gunpoint and decamped with valuables,” he said.

The complainant, Surbhi Aggarwal, an advocate and a resident of Noida, Sector 25, said, in August, she noticed that she was unable to log into her Amazon Prime account. When she reached out to the customer care, she was informed that the email ID and mobile number have been changed. Aggarwal said that she purchased an Amazon Prime subscription on February 10, 2020, which was valid for one year. “I noticed problems in logging into my account in August. I contacted the customer care to report the matter on August 6, 2020 and my call was transferred to accounts department, where a customer care executive informed me that my email ID has been changed on June 25, 2020,” she stated in the FIR. “I informed the executive that I had not changed my email ID, and that I did not get any notification from the company regarding the change. The executive informed me that a confirmation email was sent to me and forwarded me the same,” she said. The customer care executive also informed her that a person named Omkar has been added to the new account and his address was mentioned as Ashok Nagar, Shadora, Madhya Pradesh. “The executive also told me that a bluetooth headset, worth ₹3,887, has been ordered using my account. It is very clear that my account was hacked,” she said. Aggarwal said that on August 8, 2020 she wrote an email to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, narrating the whole incident and mentioning that if no action was taken, she would be forced to file an FIR. Meanwhile, she started receiving reminders to clear the Amazon Pay bills, which, she claimed, she did not use. “I also received an email from the office of Mr Bezos, stating that her Amazon Account security breach issue has been investigated and resolved. I was never informed of the results of the investigation conducted by the company,” she said. She filed a complaint with the cyber cell which investigated the matter and directed the Sector 20 police to register an FIR on October 22, 2020. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP Noida, said the police have registered a case against Omkar and unknown staff of Amazon under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC and sections 65 and 66 of the IT Act. “The cyber cell investigated the matter and submitted a technical report to Sector 20 police.

23-10-2020||Noida||Three men pretending to be finance company officials snatch vehicle from cab driver||Three men, pretending to be officials of a finance company, stole a car from a cab driver on the pretext of impounding his vehicle since his EMI dues were pending. The suspects approached the driver and informed him that his EMI dues were pending and snatched his vehicle, saying that the procedure was as per the company norms.The victim, Prashant Kumar, later visited the finance company for updates and found out that the three suspects were not employees of the company. Kumar, a native of Mainpuri district in Uttar Pradesh, presently lives in Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad. He had bought a Maruti Wagon-R on EMI three years ago and has been working as a taxi driver since then. “On October 18, I had parked my car near City Centre Metro station and I was waiting for booking at around 8pm. Three men reached the spot and identified themselves as the representative of the finance company. They said that I had skipped EMI for the last one month and, therefore, the car would be seized,” he stated in the FIR. Kumar believed them as he had not paid the EMI. Gautam Singh, Kumar’s brother, said that the suspects had showed him some papers and their identity cards. “My brother handed over the car keys to the suspects, believing them they are officials from the finance company. Next day, Kumar visited the company to enquire about the matter. The company officials checked the details and said that three persons were not attached to the company,” Singh said. “The suspects had given Kumar a fake mobile phone number for contact. The phone was switched off when we tried to reach. This was when Kumar realised that he has been duped,” Singh said. The victim then filed a complaint in Sector 24 police station. Prabhat Dixit, station house office (SHO), Noida Sector 24 police station, said a case has been registered against unknown criminals under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “We have registered a case and launched a search to arrest the suspects. We are scanning CCTV footage of cameras installed in the area to get clues,” he said.

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||HARERA asks Gurugram realty firm to stop registration of new projects||Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA) Gurugram has put Empire Realtech along with associated company CHD Developers on notice to blacklist and debar them from further registration of new projects until the ongoing ones are completed.According to KK Khandelwal, chairman, HARERA, Gurugram, the realty firm has been asked to face cancellation of registration of project or to complete it and hand over possession to the allottees. “There is likelihood of siphoning off/diversion of funds...” an official spokesperson, quoting Khandelwal, said.He said Empire Realtech launched a project “106 Golf Avenue, Sector – 106, Gurugram” in 2011 and possession of the apartment was to be given by December 2016. However, even after four years of delay, the buyers are running from pillar to post for their apartments. “The promoter intimated revised date for completion of the project to RERA as June 30, 2021, but, keeping in view the present situation of funds and stage of construction there is likelihood of further delay of project,” he said. The bench comprising Khandelwal issued notice as to why requisite progress in the project is not being achieved by the promoter. Khandelwal said there are 642 units in the project out of which 600 units have been sold. Nearly ₹500 crore were collected from the allottees since 2016. He said the promoter has also taken loan of around ₹150 crore out of which ₹36 crore is still outstanding. Despite availability of funds from both allottees as well as lenders the project is far from completion, he added. He said there are nine towers in the project and 80% work has been completed in only three towers. Khandelwal said the construction is pending from October 2018. The allottees are very much disturbed as even after payment of 90% of the cost of apartment, there is no possibility of taking possession of the unit in near future. It seems that funds have been siphoned off by the promoter. Even after receiving more than ₹600 crore from the allottees and lending institutions, only ₹168 crore have been incurred on the construction, Khandelwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/harera-asks-gurugram-realty-firm-to-stop-registration-of-new-projects/story-j7slNoV8kY9cRCvEsZ49JO.html

The 17-kilometre-long irrigation drain starts from Delhi’s Ashok Nagar area and merges with Yamuna in Sector 168, after passing through several residential sectors of the city, such as sectors 11, 12, 22, 24, 23, 34, 35, 50, 51, 80, 137 and 168, among others. Several smaller drains merge with this drain that carry sewage water of both Delhi and Noida. Slum residents and streetside vendors often throw plastic and other kinds of waste materials into this drain leading to choking and waterlogging during the monsoon season.Apart from Kondli drain, there are other at least 300 smaller drains in the city that are equally polluted and are filled with overflowing sewage water and plastic waste.The Kondli drain, owned by the Uttar Pradesh irrigation department, will be cleaned together by the Noida authority the irrigation department.“The irrigation department has prepared a plan and sent the same to us. We are looking into this plan so that we can implement it. We will fund this project, although it will be executed by the irrigation department,” said Avinash Tripathi officer on special duty, Noida authority.As per the plan, the irrigation department will also create ponds at multiple locations of the drain.“The main objective is to improve the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of this drain, which is meant to carry only rain water. To improve the BOD, there is a plan to build ponds with plants that help in absorbing the pollutants,” said Tripathi.The UP irrigation department also said that ponds that will be built at 50 different locations and will be filled with plants that can absorb pollutants. “We have sent the proposal to the Noida authority. Once approved, the project will be implemented on the ground,” said Davendra Thakur executive engineer, Noida authority.The authority has also decided to put bamboo nets at multiple points of the smaller drains.“We have taken a decision to put bamboo nets, which are at least one-metre wide, to trap the waste materials. This would ensure that the drains only carry clean water,” said Tripathi.Noida residents have for frequently complained about the state of this drain. “The drain emits such a foul smell that we have to keep our windows shut all the time. We have written several letters to the Noida authority to address this issue. But nothing has happened so far. We now hope that the authority will do something to address this issue,” said Arun Kumar, a resident of Sector 34.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-sanctions-6-5-crore-to-clean-up-polluted-kondli-drain/story-BbGdh2U0WXb4v6q1Tw9R2L.html

A demonstration of the lights was given to mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC officials on Thursday evening.The MC officials said that the system consists of an in-built genet, two blowers, metal halide lamp. When the genset is switched on, the blowers inflate the cloth up to a height of 4.5 metres from the ground level, following which the lamp is switched on which illuminates up to 1,000 sq ft area.MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said the lights have been purchased under the smart city project and will prove of great help to the firefighters who struggle in the absence of light during night operations.Sub-fire officer Navrang Singh said, “When a fire breaks out, the power supply to that area is snapped. It becomes difficult to douse the flames and rescue people in the absence of proper lighting. We have to switch on the headlights of our vehicles or fire tenders. One light each has been allocated to five fire stations in the city. This is a useful infrastructural upgrade.”“The department is also working to purchase hydraulic platform, water bowser, fire safety suits, life/heat detectors, advanced rescue tender, mini fire tender, multiple gas detectors, hydraulic combi tool, victim location camera with breaching system, quick response vehicle, portable fire pump, communication system among other items at an estimated cost of Rs 25 crore, as part of the city’s fire brigade upgrade plan,” said the mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-portable-balloon-light-towers-to-help-ludhiana-firefighters-douse-flames-at-night/story-TZr0vdZsr5C6R7Vr0DP5wI.html
23-10-2020||Noida||PM10, PM2.5 levels rise as air quality nose dives in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad||Although different pollution monitoring agencies in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad are working in overdrive to curb local contributors of pollution, their efforts are coming to naught as air quality continued to nosedive across NCR cities Friday, largely driven by farm fires in neighbouring states and dust locally.According to the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida are seeing three times the permissible level of particulate matter (PM)10 and more than two times the permissible level of PM2.5 pollutants. These are fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometre and 2.5 micrometre. These readings shoot up only when pollution levels worsen and they are very harmful to health.As per the UPPCB, between October 12 and 18, the average PM10 level in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida stood at 299.57, 346.14 and 294.86 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm), respectively. These are three times the permissible limit of 100 mpcm. The more fine pollutant PM2.5, for which the permissible limit is 60mpcm, averaged 146.29, 134.43 and 128.43 mpcm in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida, respectively, during the same period. Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB, Ghaziabad, said, “There has been rise in PM10 and PM2.5 levels and factors responsible for increased PM10 levels could be road dust, dust from construction sites, as well as stubble and garbage burning. Vehicular emissions are primarily responsible for the rise in PM2.5 levels. To curb this spike, we are regularly surveying industrial units, farmlands and different agencies are taking up water sprinkling on roads to settle dust, among other measures.” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said authorities are already on the job to control pollution. “It is a matter of concern and departments and the authorities are already on the job. They are using different measures such as anti-smog guns and water sprinkling to settle pollutants. We have a two-pronged strategy -- first, to spread awareness at probable sources of pollution and, second, to ensure strict enforcement,” he said. Dr Vijay Dutta, senior consultant (internal medicine), Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, said, “The World Health Organization (WHO)’s air quality guidelines say the permissible limit for PM 2.5 is 10mpcm. Anything beyond that is hazardous, especially to children and the elderly. These are very fine particulate matters that can penetrate into lungs and may even get into the bloodstream.” “The pollutants can irritate airways and may cause shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, asthma episodes and chest pain. Prolonged exposure can put you at risk of lung cancer, heart attacks, stroke, and causes problems such as burning eyes, irritation in throat and on skin, dry cough and in extreme cases, premature death,” said Dr Vinay Bhatt, consultant (internal medicine), Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad. The air quality index (AQI), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on Friday deteriorated further in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida and stood in the higher ranges of ‘very poor’ category at 344, 381 and 369, respectively. On a scale of 0 to 500, with 0 being least polluted and 500 the most severe, any reading between 300 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’.The forecast by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said the most dominant factor for the deterioration in air quality was extremely calm surface winds combined with moderate levels of stubble fires. “Highly calm surface wind conditions are prevailing over the Delhi region and they are likely to continue for the next two days. There will be little dispersion (of pollutants) for an extended period and pollutants will accumulate near the surface,” Safar said. It added that the AQI will be the higher end of ‘very poor’ category on October 24 and 25 and may even go higher for a short duration. “A significant number of stubble fires have been observed in Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring regions with the count standing at approximately 1,213 on Thursday, slightly less than what it was a day before. Safar estimates the stubble burning share in PM2.5 levels to be approximately 17% as on Friday,” the agency said. Stubble and garbage burning continued unabated in Ghaziabad as well. An HT team found two instances of burning at Kallu Garhi and Kushaliya near Dasna on Friday afternoon. Earlier, similar instances were found at Kushaliya, Morta and near river Hindon behind the Mohan Nagar industrial area. “The instances of stubble burning add to PM2.5 levels. We will inspect both Kallu Garhi and Kushaliya and appropriate action will be taken up at the earliest,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pm10-pm2-5-levels-rise-as-air-quality-nose-dives-in-noida-greater-noida-and-ghaziabad/story-77INkIxs0lFUeqgvB4pCfJ.html

To avail of the facilities of the clinic, a recovered patient will have to bring his/her Covid negative test result or discharge summary card, GIMS officials said. GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta said post-Covid respiratory illness is very common and various studies have suggested that even after being discharged, patients need proper consultation regarding their post-recovery care. “As Covid-19 is an evolving disease and the complete cycle of this infection is yet to be established, many patients have persistent or recurrent problems of cough, mild fever, malaise, weakness and breathing difficulties, which are together known as the post-viral syndrome. The rising pollution and changing weather conditions may also exaggerate this syndrome,” he said. He further said GIMS also had a post-Covid followup group, where patients can post their complaints and these will addressed by medical specialists through tele consultation. “But, as these patients need to be seen physically and counselled in person, we have started a Covid-19 followup OPD clinic and pulmonary rehabilitation centre on our campus. The centre will be open six days a week, except Sundays. The recovered patients need to bring their Covid-19 negative report or discharge slip while visiting the clinic,” Dr Gupta said. The GIMS director said the hospital, having L-3 (critical care) facilities for Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar district, is holding immunisation OPD for all children daily. “We have also started the followup clinic for newborns of Covid-19 positive mothers, as a part of GIMS comprehensive Covid-19 care. All these clinics are being run under the supervision of Dr Saurabh Srivastava, the head of department of medicine, and his team,” he said. The GIMS, an upcoming tertiary care medical college and hospital, has a 250-bed isolation ward for Covid-19 patients. It is also the nodal centre in the district for sample collection, treatment and complete management of Covid-19. So far, it has managed over 2,000 Covid-19 positive patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gims-starts-post-covid-centre-for-discharged-patients/story-5c3E82MiDmQd98gH4Abm9L.html
23-10-2020||Noida||Next three months crucial in Covid-19 fight, Harsh Vardhan tells UP officials||Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said Friday that the next three months are going to be decisive in determining the situation of Covid-19 in the country and all precautions must continue to the battle against the pandemic. He was interacting with officials of Uttar Pradesh during a video conferencing meeting to review Covid-19 preparedness and measures for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour. The minister also reviewed the status of 20 districts in Uttar Pradesh that had recorded an increase in Covid cases and/or increase in the number of Covid deaths. Officials present during the video conferencing said the minister also posed questions to officials of Gautam Budh Nagar district, which has seen a rise in Covid deaths. According to the state control room records, the Gautam Budh Nagar district had 53 Covid deaths as on September 30, which later more than doubled to 66, as on October 22. “When the minister pointed out that he had certain figures based on a formula, we immediately apprised him that the case fatality rate in the district has remained at .4% for the past several months and is continuing at the same rate currently. He accepted our point of view. He additionally told officials that there should be no complacency and there has to be constant monitoring of patients, including those having no symptoms. He also told us that all precautions must continue,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar. The officials of Ghaziabad health department also took part in the video conferencing. “The minister told us that the methodology of testing, tracing and treatment should continue and more precautions have to be put in place in view of the festival season. He also talked about the age groups that are seeing a higher number of fatalities. Further, he also stated that any gatherings at local level should be allowed only after the local police station provides permission. Otherwise, strict enforcement measures should be initiated,” said an official from the Ghaziabad health department, wishing not to be named. According to records of the state health department, the number of active cases has been on the decline since September 17 when the cases peaked at 68,235 active cases. It reduced to 29,131 as on October 22. The state has a discharge rate of 92.47% till October 22, officials told the Union minister. Dr Harsh Vardhan stressed that the Uttar Pradesh needs to focus on increasing testing, surveillance, contact tracing, and early diagnosis to keep the fatality rate low. He appreciated the efforts of the state in vaccinating children left out of immunisation cycle due to coronavirus situation. “Appropriate measures are being taken to combat Covid-19. But the next three months are going to be decisive in determining the situation of Covid in the country. If we take adequate precautions and follow Covid appropriate behaviour in the coming festival and winter season, we will be in a better position to fight Covid-19,” the minister said. He further said for a big state such as Uttar Pradesh, it becomes important that the maximum thrust is given to simple precautionary measures which are effective in preventing the Covid-19 to a large extent such as wearing mask/face cover especially in public spaces, and following hand and respiratory etiquettes. He added that from recording over 95,000 cases in a day, the country has reached a point where it is seeing less than 50,000 cases a day while the national recovery rate is nearing 90%. The case fatality rate is at 1.51% and is moving towards the target of less than 1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/next-three-months-crucial-in-covid-19-fight-harsh-vardhan-tells-up-officials/story-piefwvCF2SPPAxQHulzXJN.html
23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC censures agri board for delayed pensionary benefits to former engineer||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board, Panchkula, to release the withheld amount of the retirement benefits of a former sub-divisional engineer along with 6% interest, within a month. The high court acted on the plea of one Shashi Kant Mangla, who had retired in 2016 and whose pensionary benefits were withheld on account of a charge sheet pending against him. After the high court’s intervention, all other benefits were released in 2018, but an amount of Rs 1.5 lakh was withheld on account of recovery. Mangla challenged this decision before the court. The high court observed that the chief administrator in October 2018 had calculated the actual loss at Rs 3.36 lakh and the recovery amount at Rs 1.48 lakh but later it was reduced to Rs 59,570 due to ‘wrong calculation’ on the board’s part. “This clearly reflects the level of application of mind by the board at each stage,” the bench of justice Sanjay Kumar observed, adding that Mangla’s pension was withheld even as no disciplinary proceedings were pending against him on the date of retirement. The court has not only directed release of the withheld amount but has asked the board to pay 6% interest on entire pensionary amount from his retirement on November 1, 2016, till the date of actual payment. It had come to light before the court that the former engineer was issued a charge sheet in July 2013. However, in November 2014, the inquiry officer had given him a clean chit. No action was taken on the issue until his retirement. But after he approached the court in September 2018, the board sought his objections on the inquiry report of 2014. Further, the court also noted that the board had recovered all its dues from the contractor as an arbitration award in the case where the petitioner was issued a charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-censures-agri-board-for-delayed-pensionary-benefits-to-former-engineer/story-D3iKVXP0DFT9rBG9Ngha2L.html

Some issues like the new pension scheme, the implementation of which is not solely in the domain of the university, have been taken up with the concerned quarters,” he added.Dhillon said, “Sitting on dharna and sloganeering under the current situation is unfortunate and undesirable. It vitiates the conducive and peaceful working environment of the university. It must be understood that all decisions are taken as per the rules and keeping in view the varsity’s interests.”“Farmers have high expectations from us. We all scientists and staff have to work as a team to live up to their expectations as well as remain relevant in a highly competitive environment. We cannot dither away from our responsibility,” his message read.The V-C urged the protesting employee unions to shun their agitational approach and work together for the benefit of the farming community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-v-c-urges-employees-to-withdraw-stir-work-as-team/story-52GFAqBfFSQjKmMrBf0HML.html

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents peeved over some sectors being left out of fogging list||Notwithstanding UT administrator’s directions to the principal health secretary to carry out regular fogging, sanitisation and cleanliness drives to prevent the spread of malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases, residents have complained that some sectors have been left out in the schedule drawn up for fogging in the city.Highlighting this, general secretary of the Sector 33-B Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA), Kuljinder Sra said, “Ignoring Sector 33 for fogging has become a trend over the past few years, even as the sector has a high concentration of senior citizens. Several sites close to residential areas have become mini dumping grounds,” he said, adding that the RWA had written a letter to director health services regarding this.Sector 21 has also not been included in the schedule. Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu, who is also the president of the RWA here, said, “I hope this is just an error in printing, as fogging is the need of the hour here. Several spots in the sector also need to be cleared of piles of garbage.”Meanwhile, other RWAs have complained of a half-baked job in fogging. It was scheduled at Sector 38 West on October 17, but as per the RWA president, Pankaj Gupta, many lanes were ignored. “Residents’ requests for fogging in their streets were ignored. Besides, garbage remains accumulated in the open, which can lead to diseases,” he said.Director health services Dr Amandeep Kang said, “Besides the sectors mentioned in the schedule, we also focus on other areas in the same time slot. Also, fogging is conducted wherever a case is detected. Residents can write to us if they have any complaints. We will ensure that fogging is done throughout the city.”According to the health department’s data, there has been a dip in the number of cases this year. As of September end, only 13 cases of dengue and six cases of malaria were reported in city against the 286 and 22 cases, respectively, reported last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-peeved-over-some-sectors-being-left-out-of-fogging-list/story-j3OXRyPFOJ416j13vslavJ.html

Our attempt is to involve maximum people in this fight. During the second meeting, all the associations unanimously passed a resolution to name this Ravan as ‘Pollution Ravan’. Many would be burning ‘Corona Ravan’ but we decided to fight pollution,” Leena Garad, president of Kharghar Forum, said.On Sunday at around 6 pm, ‘Pollution Ravan’ would be burnt at Sector 15, Kharghar where the pandal for Navratri has been installed by Kharghar Forum.“Every year we have a grand garba organised here. But, this year with the pandemic it’s just the idol that has been installed and people are visiting by following all Covid norms. Even on the day of Dussehra, ‘Ravan’ would be burnt by following all the norms,” Garad said.The residential associations have claimed that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) regional office of Navi Mumbai has only been conducting minor actions against the industries and not doing anything major.In the last week, the MPCB issued notices to eight companies in the Taloja MIDC over violations of pollution control norms. “As per what we noticed during our night inspections, we issued the notices. Of the eight industries, four of them received closure orders while three were served with show cause notice and one received proposed direction related to pollution,” DB Patil, MPCB regional officer, said.MSEDC and the water department have been informed to stop their supplies to the four industries that received closure notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kharghar-residents-to-fight-pollution-this-dussehra-by-burning-pollution-ravan/story-xtJ81Bq4RTVo1xjFCeozAL.html

The demolition work was done in April.“The repair work of the bridge was delayed due to the five high intensity electric cables. The state electricity board moved the three cables earlier. After this, the work of the deck slab was initiated and completed on October 18. Two cables are yet to be shifted. They have assured to move them soon,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.She added, “The work of the approach road on one side is over while the other side is under progress and will be completed by December. We have planned to open the bridge to commuters by December end.”The bridge was shut in September 2019 after it was declared unsafe by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in following an audit. The entire repair work will cost around ₹10.50cr.As the repair work got delayed, there have been complaints from the commuters regarding the ordeals they face while taking the alternative Thakurli ROB through the narrow lanes in the city. There has been a continuous demand to take up the repair work.“Even though the civic body has claimed that the work will be over by December end, looking at the amount of work at the site, the deadline will extend to next year. We will protest against the civic authority if the work of the bridge is not completed,” said Sudesh Mahadik, 45, a commuter who takes the Thakurli bridge to connect within the city.The congestion on the roads returned after lockdown restrictions were removed. “The closure of the bridge has affected us badly. We have been facing congestion on the roads for more than a year,” said Neha Salve, 30, a resident of Ramnagar, Dombivli.Chief public relations officer of CR, Shivaji Sutar, said, “Major portion of the work from railway has been completed. Only some miscellaneous work is remaining, which will be completed soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dombivli-railway-over-bridge-to-be-opened-by-december-end-commuters-fear-further-delay/story-P60KdF3pqU6Tdqqe7NvVCL.html

The matter is still pending with the district and sessions court in Ludhiana.In July 2016, Raninder had appeared before the ED in the same case and said he had nothing to hide. “I will attend the probe as they want me to and as I have nothing to hide,” Raninder had said.The ED officials, who maintain a tight-lip on the matter, claimed that Raninder has been summoned as part of the ongoing investigation in the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) violation case.Questioning the timing of the development into the case as the Punjab government-led by Captain Amarinder Singh has passed new bills to block Centre’s farm laws, the Congress party insiders called the move a “political vendetta” by the central government.The central agency had initiated actions against Raninder under FEMA after the Income Tax department filed a complaint in Ludhiana court saying he had lied under oath about trusts allegedly owned by him in Virgin Islands.Back in 2016, Raninder was summoned before the ED in connection with a FEMA violation. The IT department said that Raninder misguided the agency by claiming that he did have documents related to the family’s income and trusts abroad.The IT department alleged that Raninder was a ‘settler’ of Jacaranda Trust, which the family formed. Other undisclosed trusts include Mulwala Holdings Limited and Allworth Venture Holding Limited.The father and son also allegedly carried out ‘undisclosed’ financial transactions through a bank account in HSBC, Geneva, and HSBC Financial Services Limited (Middle East), the department said.The IT department also said the trusts were established in 2005 and most of the deals were routed through Virgin Islands. The agency submitted in the court that it has documents sourced from Virgin Islands which show Captain Amarinder Singh and his son Raninder as owners of Marine Mansions in Dubai and other properties in the United Kingdom. Both Amarinder and Raninder had earlier denied any wrongdoing and termed the charges false.Hindustan Times made several attempts to reach Raninder Singh for comments on the recent development but he remained unreachable. When contacted Punjab chief minister media advisor, Raveen Thukral, he also declined to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-chief-minister-s-son-summoned-by-enforcement-directorate-in-illegal-foreign-funds-case-to-be-questioned-on-tuesday/story-57GQ9DKK8YA16EmNMC6qAN.html

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal police to maintain separate register for suicide cases||In order to keep better track of incidents of suicide in the state, Himachal director general of police Sanjay Kundu on Friday directed all police stations to record suicide cases in a separate register. The decision was taken as there has been a marked increase in suicide cases across the state. Kundu said, “Records and data entered into a register can be of immense help in keeping track of the number of suicides cases, including cases of abetment of suicide registered under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. Maintaining a separate register in police stations will create a database that can be referred to in future cases.” Earlier, there were 26 registers in police stations. Now, ‘Register 27’ will be used keep track of suicide cases in the state. Each page will be attested by the supervisory officer, who will monitor the maintenance of the register.The station house inspector (SHO), on handing over charge of transfer will record a ‘confidential charge note’ for the assistance of his successor about the register and also mention the list of areas prone to suicides in the jurisdiction of the police station. The register will include an index comprising personal particulars of the deceased, social and economic profile, emotional profile, medical and forensic details, details and content of suicide note (if found), computer and mobile details (including details of calls, social media posts, WhatsApp messages, immediately before suicide). It has been recommended that the register be included in the training syllabus of newly included non-gazetted officers as well as Himachal Police Service (HPS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) officers. Police officers formally or informally inspecting a police station shall record their comments regarding entries in register number 27 and 13. Faulty mechanism for recording suicides At present, there is no mechanism for maintaining data regarding suicide cases in Himachal. In Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems, suicide cases are clubbed with unidentified dead bodies (UDBs). At police stations, data pertaining to suicide due to abetment and cases where only action as per Section 174 (inquest proceedings) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was taken are being mixed up. “As such it entails a lot of effort and time to sift through the data to find out the exact number of suicides,” said the DGP, adding that the purpose of the standing order (SO) was to maintain up-to-date records of suicide cases taking place in the jurisdiction of a police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-police-to-maintain-separate-register-for-suicide-cases/story-fL5jFzE1liFNYbprDUhzCK.html

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Ahead of panchayat polls, voices of dissent within BJP get shriller||With polls to Panchayati Raj Institutions and civic bodies round the corner, voices of dissent within the Bharatiya Janata Party are getting shriller so much so that the party has had to press troubleshooters into service to quash the brewing rebellion. Day after former chief minister Shanta Kumar voiced his concern over increasing ‘pollution’ in the saffron party , former power minister Anil Sharma, a sitting BJP legislator from Mandi, accused the state government of ‘harassing’ him and his family.Sharma, the son veteran Congress leader Pandit Sukhram, alleged that cops had misbehaved with his son, actor Aayush Sharma, at the border when he was coming home during the lockdown. He also alleged that power supply to his house was repeatedly snapped at midnight for over a month when Aayush, his wife Arpita and his grandchildren were staying with them in Mandi. The former power minister said he had filed a complaint at all possible levels but no action was taken. “Politics and family should be kept apart. No one will tolerate an attack on their family,” he said. Sharma had joined BJP just ahead of 2017 assembly polls and had become a minister in the Jai Ram Thakur-led government. He had stepped down after his elder son Aashray Sharma contested Lok Sabha polls on a Congress ticket. He also hit out at chief minister Jai Ram Thakur over the issue of development and alleged that the government had been deliberately ignoring Mandi constituency, which he represents. He said if former minister Sudhir Sharma could get a smart-city tag for his home turf, Dharamshala, why could the chief minister not do the same for Mandi. Sharma urged Thakur to do something to benefit Mandi and the state in his remaining two-year tenure. Sharma had also met All India Congress Committee’s Himachal in-charge Rajeev Shukla when he had visited Mandi in October. ‘Undue interference’ causes rift BJP’s chief whip Narinder Bragta is upset with urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj’s interference in his assembly segment Jubbal- Kotkhai.Meanwhile, two-time former BJP legislator Govind Ram Sharma has taken issue with the appointment of Ram Rattan Pal as chairperson of the Co-operative Federation. Govind Ram was denied a ticket and the party had instead fielded Rattan Pal Singh against Congress stalwart Virbhadra Singh. Govid Ram had also met with Virbhadra Singh recently, which had led to murmurs in political circles that he could join the Congress. A section of the BJP owing allegiance to former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal sees his son minister for state corporate affairs and finance Anurag Thakur as their future leader. Dhumal’s camp that had been lying low after his unexpected defeat in the assembly elections has begun to realign and has stepped up activities in the state . Damage controlThe brewing discontent among the top rung has seemingly raised alarm bells for the BJP. The party’s three general secretaries - Trilok Kapoor, Trilok Jamwal and Raesh Jamwal - and state party president Suresh Kashyap held a closed- door meeting with Jawalamukhi legislator and former minister Ramesh Dhawala who is at loggerheads with the party’s organisational secretary Pawan Rana . Dhawala for the last two years has been consistently accusing Rana of making attempts to undermine him. Dhawala was instrumental in formation of the BJP-HVC (Himachal Vikas Congress) alliance in 1998. Dhawala had won as an independent candidate and his support had helped BJP to topple the Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ahead-of-panchayat-polls-voices-of-dissent-within-bjp-get-shriller/story-xchhbfhVyHUXBh1H96AFQL.html

This year, prices are ruling high for last few months,” a vegetable seller said.A meat shop owner said the value of orders for this festive period is insignificant as compared to previous year.“Since lockdown in March, we continue to see a surge in essential commodity prices. Many items are beyond the reach of common people. We had to cut the budget on feasts during the Durga Puja celebrations,” Anjali Saha, a homemaker said.According to traders, prices of vegetables and fish could soften when local train services resume.“Fishermen are suffering due to lack of demand and transportation of low-value fish to city markets has been affected without local train services,” said a trader at Canning market in South 24 Parganas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/higher-prices-of-essential-consumer-goods-dampen-festive-spirits-in-west-bengal/story-bUQpkHBbqyrKClBCEzMwWM.html

Rai was arrested from his village after a court had issued an arrest warrant against him. Rai’s brother, Ajay Kumar, had alleged that he died in police custody due to torture by the Punaura police station authorities. Earlier in March 2019, two persons from Chakia in East Champaran district had died allegedly due to torture by the Dumra police station authorities.Dumra police station is also located in Sitamarhi district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/death-in-police-custody-nhrc-issues-notice-to-sitamarhi-district-administration/story-lFkEEU4dq4O9ExStixLg3N.html

The proposal planned by Estate and Land records department suggests that 118 plots have been identified in the first phase of this plan. “We have suggested the idea of leasing the amenity spaces for a private-public partnership. The proposal has been sent to city engineer for discussions and to reform the plan further,” said Rajendra Muthe, deputy commissioner, Estate and Land records department, PMC. Several residents have taken to social media to object to the proposal. “Amenity spaces are the property of citizens, paid for when we buy flats. The builder gives an area to the PMC to make the life of citizens good in the area. We also pay hefty taxes to help PMC develop and manage the area. It’s not their property and since it is public property, it should be discussed publically before taking any call. We object to this proposal,” said Vaishali Patkar, member, Citizens For Area Sabha. Citizens For Area Sabha has written to the office of the chief minister of Maharashtra (Uddhav Thackeray), stating that Pune Municipal Corporation is planning to sell reserved amenity spaces, thereby depriving citizens their legal rights of access to several civic amenities. The petition reads “Amenity spaces are public property and are meant for creating public infrastructure for citizens. Pune needs more amenity spaces for various essential utilities and amenities to be built by the PMC and Government authorities for the development of the area, providing required infrastructure, and for the welfare and healthcare of citizens. “Under the PMC - Pune Development Control rules Sec 15.4.1 Development of Amenity Spaces - the amenity spaces are to be utilised for playgrounds, gardens, parks, yoga meditation parks, primary school, high school, dispensary, fire brigade, police station, post office, electric substation, parking and like other services,” said Patkar. According to Vivek Velankar, RTI activist, “I have submitted a proposal to the PMC for alternatives for financing the city. There is no need to propose sale of amenity spaces, or of giving concessions on property taxes, instead PMC should work on getting the dues from property arrears of Rs 1,200 crore from 500 people who are above in the bracket of Rs 1 crore and above.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-clarifies-the-sale-of-amenity-space-proposal-after-residents-protest/story-bKPJxgcfWpihDTBpRGNqAL.html

The dip in rates was witnessed after wholesale market in Pune received 50 truckloads of onions compared to 40 trucks on Wednesday. On an average, Pune wholesale market receives 100 trucks of onion daily this season. As the supply was less during Tuesday and Wednesday, the onions were sold at the rate of Rs 100 kg –Rs 120 per kg. With increase in supply, the prices stabilised at wholesale market between Rs 70-75 on Thursday, while it was sold at around Rs 80 per kg in retail marker. Madhukant Garad, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) head, said, “The shortage was due to rainfall. As of today, we have received 18,000 sacks of onions totally aggregating 9,000 quintals at the market. The market rate for 10 kg onion is now between Rs 200 to Rs 700 for wholesale, while on average basis, onions are fetching between Rs 450 to Rs 550 for 10 kg,” he said. Besides shortage due to rain, the prices of onion slightly came down due to decision to import the commodity from neighbouring nations, a move criticised by farmer unions. At Lasalgaon APMC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market, 7,000 quintals of onion arrived on Thursday as well, keeping the average price of commodity at Rs 7,000 per quintal. “Onions are selling at Rs 7,000 per quintal at Lasalgaon. Farmers don’t have onions in stocks and those who have are waiting for good rates for their produce. There is shortage as the supply was affected due to heavy rains. We have onion stock which can last for one month,” said, Suvarna Jagtap, chairperson, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce. At other APMC markets in Nashik district, wholesale price of onions fluctuated between Rs 6,000- Rs 7,000 per quintal while the retail price was Rs 80 per kg. Ganpat Nimbalkar, an onion producer, said that farmers get paid at the rate between Rs 20-Rs 30 by the middlemen who bring their onion produce to the market for selling it to big customers and retailing. Vilas Bhujbal, wholesale onion trader in Pune, said, “We are buying onion at the rate of Rs 7,000 per quintal which translates into a retail rate of Rs 70 per kg in the open market. There was panic due to stock shortage, but now the rates have stabilised. Rains had been the main reason behind less arrival of trucks at Market Yard,” he said. Onion import is against farmers’ interests: ShettiRaju Shetti, leader of farmer organisation Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said that the Centre’s decision to import onion when farmers are getting good prices is against their interest. “Farmers have already suffered a lot. So, when they are getting some money in their hand, the Centre wants to import more onion,” said Shetti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/after-touching-rs-100-onion-prices-drops-to-rs-80-per-kg-in-pune/story-1dyb60FXcUj71AYGXWZWoK.html

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Anantnag SSP inspires Kashmiri youngsters to dare to dream, achieve better life||Dreams come true with hard work and focus. That’s the open secret behind Operation Dreams, playing out in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district thanks to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sandeep Choudhary. The 34-year-old J&K-cadre Indian Police Service (IPS) officer of the 2012 batch, who is from the border town of Abohar in Punjab, has struggled to achieve his dream and is inspiring hundreds of youngsters to achieve theirs despite the odds. He has been providing free guidance and coaching to youngsters, helping them qualify for competitive exams since the middle of 2018. He has named his mission Operation Dreams. More than his coaching, it is his struggle that is motivating many an aspirant to achieve his/her dream. “He is my mentor. His struggle inspires us,” says Mohammad Farhan, 24, an engineering graduate from Anantnag who cleared the Kashmir Administrative Services (KAS) exam in September. Farhan is now pursuing a bigger dream of clearing the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam. “Choudhary sir gives us tips to face interviews. I qualified the KAS exam with rank 28 but could not crack the UPSC entrance due to low marks in the mains but I’m giving it another shot,” he says. EMPOWERING FOR EMPLOYMENT Choudhary says he launched Operation Dreams two years ago to empower youngsters to crack competitive exams for government jobs without getting exploited by coaching institutes and costly study tutorials. “The advent of the coaching industry has discouraged many students from humble backgrounds to pursue their dreams for a better life. The aim of this initiative is to guide youngsters towards a self-study-based approach for cracking competitive exams,” he says. Choudhary began by coaching aspirants for the posts of sub inspector in Jammu and Kashmir Police. He was posted as superintendent of police (SP) in Jammu South in 2018 when he started by holding classes at his office before duty hours from 8am to 10am. As the number of students grew from 10 to 150, he shifted to a community hall in Jammu. Thirty-eight students from that class cracked the sub inspector entrance exam. SELF STUDY TO SELF RELIANCE Choudhary’s has been a life of struggle and self-reliance. “I was a medical student till Class 12. My father passed away just five days before the board exams. Life changed after that. I started working at the age of 19 as a clerk in a post office,” he says. He went on to study mass communication at Panjab University, Chandigarh, but dropped out a few months later. He decided to carry on studying by correspondence through Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) but at no point did he give up his pursuit for a better life. “I completed post-graduation through correspondence and continued working at the post office for five years. I cleared the competitive exams such as the bank probationary officers’ entrance, Punjab Civil Services, Reserve Bank of India, University Grants Commission’s National Eligibility Test besides the UPSC entrance, all through self-study,” he says. ADVERSITY BRINGS OUT THE BEST His coaching efforts have been appreciated in Kashmir, which has seen challenges such as militancy besides the Covid-19 pandemic. “The situation was challenging in Shopian, where I was posted as SP. Operation Dreams classes were run for a brief period there before I joined as the Anantnag SSP this February. Classes had to be moved online because of the pandemic,” he says. With the lifting of the lockdown, he has again started teaching offline twice a week, where the average participation has been of 45-50 students. “Soon, classes will be run daily on the Jammu pattern as the number of interested students has increased. There are many from far-flung areas who can’t afford coaching but yearn for a better life,” he says. Choudhary says he is trying to motivate students facing tough circumstances and adds that his proudest moment so far has been to see one of his students, Moin Khan from Jammu, get through the sub inspector exam. “Moin worked as a pizza delivery boy. He prepared for competitive exams through Operation Dreams classes. Today, he is a sub inspector in Jammu and Kashmir Police,” the SSP says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anantnag-ssp-inspires-kashmiri-youngsters-to-dare-to-dream-achieve-better-life/story-ByMKefxhtBrNDZWYr07xoL.html

Khadse, 68, who had quit the BJP on Wednesday, was inducted into the NCP at the party’s head office in Mumbai.“I have struggled for my entire life. I have sacrificed my life for the BJP, but now I will work for NCP with full strength,” Khadse said as he joined Pawar’s party.During his induction ceremony, Khadse said that he was advised by a few senior BJP leaders to join the NCP. “Not just my followers but some even BJP leaders advised me to join NCP. I had asked some senior BJP leaders if I should go to another party, they advised me to join NCP,” he said.After his resignation, Khadse had accused former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis of “trying to destroy his life and political career”. He had blamed Fadnavis for his decision to quit the party. “Fake cases were lodged against me that includes a molestation case and two cases by ACB (Anti-Corruption Bureau). Now, I will reveal who has taken how many plots,” the newly-inducted NCP member said. “I have never used a woman for politics. It is not in my nature,” he added.Khadse made his exit from Fadnavis’ ministry in 2016 after resigning as revenue minister. He also stepped down from 11 other departments after facing corruption charges. Khadse was with the BJP for over four decades.Taking a dig at Fadnavis’s 5am oath ceremony during the government formation tussle in Maharashtra in 2019, Khadse said, “Some are raising the issue of morality in my case. Where was this morality when the oath was taken at 5 in the morning to form the government?”The NCP, along with the Shiv Sena and Congress, is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), a political coalition formed in 2019 after the assembly elections in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eknath-khadse-joins-ncp-in-mumbai-in-presence-of-party-president-sharad-pawar/story-J5TrqXkvDLRF6mS5LyXHhP.html

One is from Bengaluru, another being grouped from Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Mysuru,” Bengaluru Deputy Commissioner of Police (West division) Sanjeev RPT Sanjeev M Patil said.He said the Central Industrial Security Force contingent is also being deployed in the west division.The battle in the RR Nagar constituency, where bypolls will be held on November 3, has intensified with candidates and political parties trading allegations of poll code violations.The BJP has fielded Munirathna, a Congress turncoat, while H. Kusuma and V. Krishnamurthy are the Congress and the JD(S) candidates respectively.Kusuma is the wife of a former IAS officer late D K Ravi whose ‘suicide’ had kicked up a storm in the state.She is also the daughter of a JD(S) leader Hanumantharayappa, who unsuccessfully contested the 2008 Assembly elections from RR Nagar.At present, the fight appears to be mainly between the BJP and the Congress who are leaving no stone unturned to win the seat.The election has become a prestige issue for Munirathna and Congress state president D K Shivakumar, as his brother D K Suresh represents the Bengaluru Rural constituency in the Lok Sabha under which the RR Nagar assembly segment falls.Eight days ago, a case of poll code violation was registered against Congress candidate Kusuma and the escort staff of former chief minister Siddaramaiah for not abiding by the directions of the Code of Conduct at the office of the Returning Officer for Rajarajeshwari Nagar constituency.Two days ago, the Congress workers staged a demonstration at the Nandini Layout police station alleging that the BJP activists assaulted a party worker.On Thursday, Munirathna had stated that the situation in RR Nagar has become ‘explosive’ as more than 4,000 outsiders have arrived in the constituency and were allegedly conducting a door-to-door survey.“They are collecting all the information. I appeal to people not to share personal information with anyone,” Munirathna told reporters on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-bypolls-paramilitary-forces-arrive-in-city/story-NixrPnp4Ax2Xw5ZoqIFprO.html

Nine of these stations are located in pollution hotspots, where the government will deploy intensive pollution control measures.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that on Friday, air in Alipur, Shadipur, Patparganj, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Rohini, Wazirpur, Bawana and Mundka was in the ‘severe’ zone.Also Read: Poor air quality is a danger to public health. Adopt a holistic approach At 7am, the AQI reading was 360, in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ zone. This is the second time that air quality touched ‘very poor’ in Delhi this season (post-monsoon). On October 15, the city’s air quality had turned ‘very poor’ for the first time with an AQI reading of 312.The city’s overall AQI reading was 296 on Thursday. Government agencies had forecast that the air quality would deteriorate on October 23-24. They said that calm-wind conditions would prevail, which would not allow the pollutants to disperse in the atmosphere.Measures to deal with ‘very poor’ air quality under the winter phase of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap)—a round-the-year plan to combat air pollution in Delhi-NCR—such as stopping the use of diesel generator (DG) sets had already kicked in from October 15. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that calm-wind conditions refer to the wind speed reading being zero. “This is a usual phenomenon for October-November, which is when air quality deteriorates. Some improvement is likely around October 26 when wind speed may pick up,” said a senior IMD scientist. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had on Thursday blamed stubble-burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab as the major reason behind the plunge in air quality in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-worst-in-8-months-10-of-35-monitoring-stations-record-severe-aqi-reading/story-1PlwaE6Zc4B4RRBoSiuOyJ.html
23-10-2020||Patna||Bihar MLC elections: Voting percentage jumped by 4%, says ECI||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday recorded a 4% increase from 2014 in the voting percentage to elect members of the Bihar legislative council (MLCs), which were conducted across four teacher and graduate constituencies each on Thursday. Polling took place at 976 places across 30 districts in the state to elect the MLCs. The total number of voters for graduate and teacher constituencies in Bihar was 4.06 lakh and 40,631, respectively. The exercise was the first large scale polls conducted in Bihar amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which were held ahead of the upcoming three-phase elections for the 243-member legislature assembly. Bihar’s 7.2 million voters will exercise their franchise on October 28, November 3 and 7 and the results will be declared on November 10.The MLC polls were conducted while enforcing all Covid-19 precautions, as suggested by the ECI.“All measures directed by the ECI were put in place for free, fair and safe elections at each polling station,” said the poll panel. “The overall voting percentage in 2014 was 56.33%, which has increased to 60.58 %. There is a net increase of 4%. In the case of teachers’ constituencies, the uptick is from 64% to 72.5%. This demonstrates active participation and faith of electors in the safety measures put in place by the ECI,” it added. An official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the trend showed a positive voters’ turnout for the upcoming Bihar elections. “Everyone said that voting percentages are likely to reduce,” the official said. “However, there has been a net increase in the voter turnout, which indicates that many more may choose to exercise their franchise during the upcoming assembly elections,” he added. The ECI had announced its guidelines on August 21 in a bid to hold free, fair and safe polls amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The guidelines include putting a cap on the number of people involved in door-to-door campaigning, allowing the submission of nomination forms online to providing voters with gloves before they use electronic voting machines (EVMs).Standard safety measures such as maintaining social distancing and wearing of masks, among others, would also be complied with, the ECI said.Voters suffering from a fever would be allowed to exercise their franchise in the last one hour of the polling process. Besides, the last hour of the polling process has also been reserved for Covid-19 patients and those who are under quarantine because of the viral infection, the ECI added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/voting-percentage-jumps-by-4-in-bihar-mlc-elections/story-dPr6lrcT1WJigPspr8Xz2O.html

Justice Sandeep Shinde said on Wednesday that the Supreme Court (SC) has analysed the requirements for abetment in a 2011 judgement in M Mohan’s case.“The SC had held that abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing and without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction (for abetment to suicide) cannot be sustained,” the judge said.“The alleged relationship (extra-marital) prima-facie cannot be construed as a ‘positive act’ to infer that the applicant (the architect) either instigated and aided the deceased in committing suicide,” he added and granted interim pre-arrest bail to the architect, Ashokbhai Gangar (46).Gangar had moved the HC apprehending arrest in connection with the crime registered at Badlapur (East) police station. He and the man’s wife were booked for abetting the latter’s death by suicide.The crime was registered on September 15 on the basis of a complaint lodged by the father of the deceased. The complainant said his son, who had died by suicide on September 3, had left behind a note blaming the extra-marital affair between his wife and Gangar for taking his own life.Gangar had moved the HC after an additional sessions judge at Kalyan rejected his anticipatory bail plea on October 8 on the grounds that he was not found living at the address that was mentioned in his anticipatory bail plea. Besides, the sessions judge also took into consideration that Gangar’s mobile phone was yet to be seized to recover the text messages, which he had allegedly exchanged with the woman.The HC directed Gangar to hand over his cellphone to the investigating officer (IO) in the case and also share the details of the place, where he is currently living, with the IO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/extra-marital-affair-not-sufficient-to-constitute-abetment-to-suicide-bombay-high-court/story-z4sjvMjBnTlKu41RxkF0SM.html
23-10-2020||Kolkata||Pandemic, ban on visitors, and rain ensure Kolkata’s Durga Puja remains muted one||The threat of the pandemic, Calcutta high court’s ban on the entry of visitors inside pandals and now the rain have kept Durga Puja in Kolkata a muted one this year. Hordes of pandal hoppers, that move through the streets of Kolkata on every puja night, were missing on the first day of Durga Puja, police and puja organisers said. “Thursday was the first day of Durga Puja but the massive crowd, which we usually get to see on Durga Sasthi night – the first day of the week-long festival – was conspicuously missing last night,” said an official at the traffic control room of the Kolkata Police. Puja organisers said while the number of visitors is low this year because of the threat of the pandemic, the crowd seemed to have dropped even further after the high court’s order banning the entry of visitors inside pandals and mandating authorities to put up barricades outside pandals declaring them as no-entry zones. Also read: PM Modi inaugurates Durga Puja event in Bengal, renews pitch for Covid-19 protocols“This is an exceptional year as the Covid-19 pandemic is going on. The number of visitors is very low compared to other years. The crowd of Durga Sasthi was hardly 20% of what we get every year on the first day of the puja,” said Saswata Basu secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab, which represents more than 350 city pujas. Every year, the police and puja committees have had a tough time managing the crowd, particularly in some of the prominent and award-winning pujas. In fact, in 2015, the Kolkata Police had to close down a puja in south Kolkata after there was a stampede-like situation. “The local suburban trains, which bring is lakhs of visitors from the adjoining districts, are not running. The high court order also seemed to have taken a toll. Usually on Durga Sasthi night, we have a tough time managing the crowd as people come in thousands. This time, there were just a few hundred,” said a member of a puja committee in north Kolkata. Meanwhile, from Friday morning, it started to drizzle in Kolkata and its outskirts. The IMD had warned on Thursday that a depression had formed over the Bay which was likely to cross the West Bengal coast on Friday afternoon. “Heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in the three coastal districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore on Friday. Isolated heavy rainfall in expected in the adjacent districts including Kolkata and Howrah,” said Sanjib Banerjee, deputy director of the IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre in Kolkata. Strong winds at the speed of up to 50 km per hour may hit Kolkata. There could be water logging areas in the low lying areas of Kolkata. Fishing, sea-bound activities and ferry services have been suspended in the coastal areas and people living on the islands of the Sunderbans have been advised to stay indoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/pandemic-ban-on-visitors-and-now-rain-ensures-kolkata-s-durga-puja-remains-muted-one/story-fRI67yFXNrM04ijMQsRslN.html
23-10-2020||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BSP to field candidate for Rajya Sabha polls, papers to be filed on October 26||The decision of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to field Ramji Gautam as a candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha (RS) election, slated to be held on November 9 for nine vacant Upper House seats from Uttar Pradesh (UP), has set the stage for an interesting contest. It is still an open-ended question, whether the BSP will be able to avenge the defeat of its candidate in the RS election that was held in March, 2018, or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will manage to break into the opposition’s ranks to grab the ninth seat for the Upper House from UP.In the 2018 RS election, BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar had lost, despite the combined support by both the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress. Also Read: Bihar poll temperature set to rise further with Modi, Rahul campaigning FridayAmbedkar had lost because of the cross-voting by the BSP lawmakers and the BJP’s successful bid to win over the support of the independent legislators.Lalji Verma, a BSP leader in the UP legislative assembly, said that Gautam would file his nomination papers on Monday (October 26), as the party’s candidate for the upcoming RS polls. The BSP would send Gautam to the Upper House on the basis of support from other opposition parties, he claimed.The BJP, which has 304 lawmakers in the 404-member UP legislative assembly, is sitting pretty and is all set to send at least eight candidates from the state to the RS. The SP, which enjoys the support of 48 MLAs, can, at best, send one candidate to the RS. The party has nominated Ram Gopal Yadav for a berth in the Upper House. Yadav had filed his nomination papers on Wednesday.The SP had supported the BSP in the 2018 RS polls because of the bonhomie between the two parties before the last year’s parliamentary elections. BSP leaders are hopeful that the SP will make its stand clear after Gautam files his nomination papers on Monday. Though the Congress has seven legislators, two of its rebel lawmakers are likely to support the BJP candidates. The BSP is also banking on the support from Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP), which has four lawmakers and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) that has a lone legislator.The BSP has its task cut out to get Gautam elected to the Upper House following the rebellion of party lawmakers Anil Singh and Ramvir Upadhyay. While another legislator Mukhtar Ansari is languishing in Punjab’s Ropar Jail for the past 22 months over a litany of criminal charges.The BJP, which will be left with 16 additional votes, is banking on the support of alliance partner Apna Dal (Sonelal), which has nine legislators, and rebel Congress and BSP lawmakers in a bid to repeat its 2018 feat of winning the ninth RS seat from UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-bsp-to-field-candidate-for-rajya-sabha-polls-papers-to-be-filed-on-october-26/story-5ngUkeiNrQuKfRIoHnHHCL.html

23-10-2020||Lucknow||Hathras case: Two AMU doctors, sacked for speaking to media, reinstated||The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) administration has revoked the termination of two doctors, who were allegedly removed from their posts for expressing their opinion on the Hathras gangrape case. On the request of the in-charge of the casualty medical officers, the AMU vice-chancellor passed orders reinstating both doctors on Thursday. On Seprember 14, a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gangraped in Hathras and later died in a Delhi hospital, sparking national outrage.Also Read: NHRC study recommends protecting rape accused from ‘false cases’ till found guiltyJawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC), AMU, casualty medical officers Mohammad Azimuddin Malik and Obaid Imtiazyul Haque were terminated from their posts on Tuesday, a day after the CBI team visited the hospital and questioned the doctors and staff who had attended to the woman. She had been admitted there auntil September 28 when she was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, and died the next day. The comments of the two doctors had allegedly contradicted the Uttar Pradesh Police’s stand that the forensic science laboratory (FSL) report in the case found no traces of sperm, indicating that there was no rape. The doctors had reportedly claimed the FSL report had no evidentiary value as the samples were collected 11 days after the crime. A day after their removal from the medical college in Aligarh, the two doctors received the backing of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), which sought the reinstatement of these two doctors, threatening to strike work at the medical college. AMU authorities had denied allegations that the removal of the two doctors had anything to do with the Hathras case and said the two doctors were engaged “on a temporary one-month vacancy from September 9” and thus, could be removed without prior notice. In a letter to the AMU vice-chancellor, the RDA had urged him to take immediate steps to withdraw the termination order. “If the order is not revoked within the next 24 hours, the RDA will call a general body meeting of its members and decide a future course of action,” said RDA president Mohammad Hamza Malik, alleging that action against the two doctors smacked of “vendetta politics”. With the RDA openly supporting the two doctors, the AMU administration agreed to allow them to continue to work.The JN Medical College casualty medical officers’ in-charge had already written to the vice-chancellor recommending the continuation of services by these two doctors, and on Thursday, orders reinstating the two doctors were passed by the AMU V-C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hathras-case-two-amu-doctors-sacked-for-speaking-to-media-reinstated/story-1VylyAy3vohFCwM12yBoHJ.html
23-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality turns very poor||Delhi’s air quality plunged into the ‘very poor’ zone on Friday morning. At 7am, the AQI reading was 360, in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ zone. This is the second time that air quality touched ‘very poor’ in Delhi this season (post-monsoon). On October 15, the city’s air quality had turned ‘very poor’ for the first time with an AQI reading of 312.The city’s overall AQI reading was 296 on Thursday. Government agencies had forecast that the air quality would deteriorate on October 23-24. They said that calm-wind conditions would prevail, which would not allow the pollutants to disperse in the atmosphere.Also Read: Poor air quality is a danger to public health. Adopt a holistic approachMeasures to deal with ‘very poor’ air quality under the winter phase of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap)—a round-the-year plan to combat air pollution in Delhi-NCR—such as stopping the use of diesel generator (DG) sets had already kicked in from October 15. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that calm-wind conditions refer to the wind speed reading being zero. “This is a usual phenomenon for October-November, which is when air quality deteriorates. Some improvement is likely around October 26 when wind speed may pick up,” said a senior IMD scientist. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had on Thursday blamed stubble-burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab as the major reason behind the plunge in air quality in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-turns-very-poor/story-ZugetJJkQeTmvXFlEs1irO.html

23-10-2020||Kolkata||Gurung’s re-emergence, alliance with TMC raises questions unanswered||After Darjeeling’s Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader Bimal Gurung, one of the most wanted fugitives in Bengal, surfaced after three years to announce that he was walking out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to help Mamata Banerjee win the assembly polls in 2021, crucial questions were raised by political parties across the board. Although the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) welcomed Gurung’s decision through a couple of tweets on Wednesday night, its leaders were hesitant to speak on record on how a man charged under several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) can be a formidable ally for the polls due in six months. Gurung has been in hiding since 2017. Gurung appeared before the media in Kolkata but rumblings were heard as far as in the hills, where he helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat in 2009, 2014 and 2019.“Mamata Banerjee is also the home minister. She will surely look into the legal aspects and consult experts about the charges Gurung faces. We are sure the leadership weighed the pros and cons before welcoming his decision,” a senior TMC leader said on condition of anonymity. The leader, however, did not have any answer when asked whether the Binoy Tamang faction of the GJM, which is now in control of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) as an ally of the TMC, would welcome Gurung with open arms. Anit Thapa, chairman of the board of administrators of the GTA, said, “It would have been better if Gurung had realised the truth three years ago and helped stop the killings and destruction to public property. Binoy Tamang took a big risk and restored peace in Darjeeling in 2017. The peace should continue.” Thapa and Tamang joined hands with the chief minister when the Gorkhaland movement was at its peak. They even suspended Gurung and his followers from the party after they went into hiding. Thapa’s reference to peace appeared highly relevant. While talking to the media at a hotel in central Kolkata on Wednesday, Gurung said in unequivocal terms that he was not giving up the demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland and a permanent political solution to the issues raised by the community decades ago. “There are no foes and friends in politics. Our demand is Gorkhaland and a permanent political solution. We will see which party addresses our issues and then decide our strategy for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” said Gurung in an apparent bid to keep the option of returning to the NDA open. The Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), the BJP’s ally and the second largest party in the Darjeeling hills, has slammed Gurung. Mahendra Chhetri, the GNLF spokesperson, said, “Gurung has betrayed Gorkhas around the world. We firmly believe that the BJP is capable of delivering a permanent political solution before the assembly election. The Centre must take this sudden development very seriously.” Having treated Gurung as an ally for more than a decade, Bengal BJP leaders took exception to his reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah in his statements before the media. Yet, they did not attack the Gorkha leader. The BJP used the opportunity to target the chief minister instead on the issue of the demand for a separate state carved out of north Bengal districts. “It appears that Banerjee has promised Gurung that Gorkhaland will be formed. People of West Bengal would certainly like to know whether she will be splitting the state of which Darjeeling is considered the crown,” said Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu. Also Read: PM Modi’s Bengal poll pitch hinges on delivery of development, promise of changeTaking a jibe at Banerjee, he added, “This is not the first time the chief minister has used rebels facing criminal charges for electoral advantage. She used Maoist leader Kishenji against the Left Front government before the 2011 assembly polls and got him killed in a police encounter after coming to power.” Also Read: West Bengal: Heavy rainfall likely to play spoilsport in Durga Puja celebrationsThe Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists, a small outfit in Darjeeling that supported the BJP in 2019, reserved its comments. Govind Chettri, the CPRM spokesperson, said, “We are reading between the lines.” Gurung’s trusted lieutenant Roshan Giri, who signed the tripartite GTA accord in July 2011on behalf of the party, refused to comment. He too faces charges under UAPA and was seen beside Gurung on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/gurung-s-re-emergence-alliance-with-tmc-raises-questions-unanswered/story-9KXxgUbqkAgcvEctbffTrK.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai mall fire: 2 firemen injured, 3,500 people evacuated from nearby building||Two firemen were injured and around 3,500 people were evacuated from a 55-storey building in Mumbai early Friday after a fire in a neighbouring mall escalated to level 5. Fire fighting operations at the City Centre Mall in Nagpada area of south Mumbai are underway. At least 24 fire engines, 16 jumbo tankers and 250 fire brigade personnel are at the spot trying to control the blaze. Since it’s a glass facade building, dousing the fire is proving to be a challenge, fire officials said. Shards of glass, concrete and POP are falling off and bursting out due to the fire, they added.People from the Orchid Enclave building, which is right behind the mall, were evacuated with the help of police. The rooftop of the mall building has a garden and swimming pool that belongs to residential building. Since the two are cojoined, smoke from the fire directly drifted towards Orchid Enclave.It was originally a level 1 fire that was reported at the mall around 8.53 pm Thursday. It later escalated to level 3 and then level 5, following which more support from the fire brigade was called in at 2:41am Friday.Police have also been deployed to assist the Mumbai Fire Brigade as the mall blaze has closed halted traffic on both sides of Belasis Road, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said.The ground floor of the mall is an additional three-storey building. The fire initially broke out on the second floor, which has shops of mobiles, printers, stationery, and furniture, the civic body said, adding that the fire later spread to the third floor.Mumbai mayor Kishori Kishori Pednekar, MLA Amin Patel, chairman of the standing committee of the corporation Yashwant Jadhav, and additional municipal commissioner (West Suburbs) Suresh Kakani paid visit late to the site late last night, the BMC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-mall-fire-2-firemen-injured-3500-people-evacuated-from-nearby-residential-building/story-zFl8ILuqMfRQNS2Q0wxaKK.html
23-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The job with the thermometer gun||This is a new kind of job, that came up with the pandemic: Checking the body temperature of people entering the shrine.But it must be so boring.Muhammed Shahid Hussain shakes his head. “No work is dull if it is performed honestly, and helps one to take care of one’s family,” he says, emphasizing each word, as if he had italicized them while writing.In his mid-20s, Mr Hussain is stationed at the entrance of the Sufi shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya in central Delhi. Each time a devotee enters, he raises his thermometer gun, carefully points it at the visitor, and observes the temperature before permitting admission into the dargah.But what kind of living supported him and his family before the pandemic? “Very often, I was in the shrine, serving its khadims,” he answers, referring to the shrine’s traditional caretakers. But he did try other professions, too. “I used to drive a battery-run rickshaw around the station.” He means the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station.Like all other places of worship, the shrine remained closed for many months following the coronavirus triggered lockdown. It reopened on 6 September — with great caution. Nobody is allowed to enter without a mask. Everyone has to undergo the thermometer scanning, followed by another barrier that automatically showers one with a spray of sanitiser. Pilgrims aren’t allowed to stay for more than a few minutes.Returning to the nature of his work, Mr Hussain explains that he is in charge of the day’s second shift extending from 3 in the afternoon to 10 at night, when the shrine closes for the night.He now talks fondly of his family, including his young daughter, Shagufta.Doesn’t he fear that being exposed to such a great variety of people daily puts him and his loved ones at the risk of catching the virus?He shakes his head. “This is like a duty.”During the entire course of conversation, it is impossible to figure out the masked man’s looks. He dramatically points out to a laminated I-card hanging about his neck. The card describes him as a “volunteer”.A group of visitors are queuing up. Mr Hussain gets busy with his gun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/the-job-with-the-thermometer-gun/story-tU4kkuhB7gXBxRoccKBerJ.html

23-10-2020||City||Zirakpur builder encroaches upon road to erect sales office||In a gross violation right under the nose of the Zirakpur municipal council, the builder of the Highland Park Housing Society has encroached upon the 66ft road approved in the master plan of the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to construct a sales office. The society is located on Patiala Road, which is to be connected with Airport Road.Zirakpur civic body’s executive officer Sandeep Tewari admitted that the construction was illegal and the builders had encroached upon the 66ft road by constructing a concrete office. “We have asked them to demolish it in seven days, otherwise we will do it,” he added. Surprisingly, the council had approved the project after the builder proposed its connectivity from this road only.Residents of the locality protested against the builder and threatened to intensify their stir. They said the builder had even built flats on the land earmarked for green spaces. Shubam Goyal, one of the directors of Highland Park, said, “We have just made a temporary sales office on the road for six months.”However, Rajiv Kakkar, a resident of Highland Park, questioned Goyal’s claim, stating the structure was made of concrete. Sukhdev Choudhary, president, joint action committee, Residents’ Welfare Association, Zirakpur, said, “Builders are doing all sorts of illegal activities in connivance of MC officials. How can somebody encroach upon the road approved in the master plan?” 59 illegal colonies in ZirakpurAccording to Punjab’s local government department, areas under the purview of the Zirakpur municipal council are home to 59 illegal colonies, while the count is much higher as per unofficial estimates. Most of these were developed after the master plan was notified. In addition to these, the Dera Bassi tehsil, of which Zirakpur is a part, has 57 illegal colonies in an area that falls under GMADA. The boundaries of these illegal colonies are not clearly marked, and consequently they keep expanding and eroding the master plan stipulations.

The firm has also been unsuccessful in running the refuse-derived fuel (RDF) plant to its full capacity so far.In a meeting with nodal officers of different branches of municipal corporation (MC) and the firm’s officials on Thursday, Sabharwal warned A2Z company to improve its functioning or face action. An official, requesting anonymity, said that the monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had earlier set November 30 as the deadline for the Ludhiana civic body to implement door-to-door garbage lifting and waste segregation. If the MC fails to do so, the bank guarantee of Rs 5 lakh submitted to the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) would be encashed.Where the company is failing While segregated waste is being collected from the houses and dumped at secondary dumping points, the company is lifting waste collectively, due to which the effort is being rendered useless. The company has been told to do colour-coding on tippers involved in shifting of dry and wet waste to the main dump site.Running of RDF plant Furthermore, the RDF plant is also being run at 60% of its capacity while the rest of the waste is dumped at the main dump site. Around 1,100 metric tonnes of waste is being generated in the city on a daily basis, said the official. Sabharwal said the company has not been working properly due to which a warning has been issued.

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Garbage collectors on indefinite strike in Chandigarh from October 23||Even as the festival season has kicked in, the sanitation workers and garbage collectors have gone on a warpath against the municipal corporation for not meeting their demands and announced an indefinite strike in the city from Friday. The door-to-door garbage collectors have also decided to support the strike call by the Safai Karamchari Union.While the sanitation workers are up in arms against wearing GPS-enabled smart watches, the household garbage collectors are opposing MC’s plans to introduce garbage collection vehicles and taking over the door-to-door garbage collection.“No sanitation worker will pick garbage or conduct cleanliness work in markets, roads and residential streets. The garbage can pile up as the corporation has turned a deaf ear to our genuine demands,” union president Krishan Kumar Chadha said.“It was decided in the meeting of all unions that door-to-door garbage will not be collected from Friday. Also, sanitation workers will not transport waste to the Dadumajra dumping ground. As many as 32 employee unions of various departments are supporting us. On Friday, we will march from the Medial Officer of Health office to MC office in Sector 17 and sit there on a dharna,” he added.Meanwhile, insisting that their union was going on strike in support of the Safai Karamchari Union, Om Prakash Saini, president of the Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society, said, “Garbage will be collected from houses on Friday morning and depending on MC’s response to the strike, we will decide our future course of action.”The unions had approached MC officials on Thursday for negotiations. But, no conclusive meeting could take place, it is learned.Rajesh Kalia, former mayor and chairman of the MC sanitation committee, said, “I support their genuine demands, but advise the workers not to go on strike.”BONE OF CONTENTIONThe civic body had distributed 4,000 smart watches among its employees for marking attendance and to keep a check on their location during work hours. The watches have been sourced from a company against a monthly rent of Rs 18 lakh. According to sanitation workers, while they are made to wear the devices, no other MC employee sports these.“If MC is keen on making us wear these watches, it should also show interest in regularising 2,800 posts. These watches are faulty and cause health issues,” Chadha claimed.“The corporation has not signed a memorandum of understanding with us as promised. We have been demanding permission to collect user charges from residents directly and sell reusable solid waste. But, even though the MC General House has passed a resolution to this effect, the corporation has not committed to it in writing,” Saini said.“Instead, MC is insistent on collecting user charges through water bills or property tax bills, and also will pay out only a part of the earnings from sale of reusable waste articles. This will impact our income,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/garbage-collectors-on-indefinite-strike-in-chandigarh-from-october-23/story-bp5vN6W9m0crgChwpNlVcM.html
23-10-2020||City||32 goods trains back on track in Punjab after over three weeks||BATHINDA/AMBALA/LUDHIANA: Around 32 goods trains plied on different routes of Punjab falling under the Ferozepur and Ambala divisions, a day after farmers announced to lift more than three-week-long blockade. Ferozepur divisional railway manager (DRM) Rajesh Agarwal said 12 trains were allowed to start operations on Thursday on the basis of feedback on railway tracks. “More trains will be put to track from tomorrow after assessing the situation,” he said, adding that protesters were still clearing tracks at some locations. “Protesters were squatting at about 30 spots of which 26 have been cleared by Thursday evening. After a field input from Government Railway Police (GRP) and railway engineering experts, engines were pressed into service at various places to check the safety of tracks,” said Agarwal. C Raghuveer, senior divisional security commissioner, Ambala division, said, “Farmers were squatting at 13 locations under the division and the last location was cleared by 4:30pm.” Virender Kadyan, senior divisional operations manager, said 20 goods train operated on various routes in Punjab and Chandigarh under the division. “The trains carrying food grains, fertilisers, coal, etc. moved to and fro. “It will take nearly 72 hours to resume full operations,” Kadyan said. Ludhiana industry heaved a sigh of relief as goods trains resumed operations on Thursday. Consignment of finished goods of over ₹1,000 crore were stuck at the dry ports of the city due to the farmers ‘rail roko’ protest, besides there was no supply of the raw material from outside the state. The industry has sought a concrete solution to the problem, saying they can’t afford another blockade. President of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) Upkar Singh Ahuja said, “The government should find a concrete solution to the problem. If the farmers again block the tracks after November 5, the industry will again be in a mess. The industry was already struggling to come back on track after the lockdown.”No passenger train till Nov 4 The Northern Railways has announced the cancellation of passenger train services till November 4. In a statement issued on Wednesday night, the railways said nine pairs of trains, including two Shatabdi and a Vande Bharat Express, along with 16 pairs of ‘Puja special trains’ on the Punjab and Chandigarh route, have been cancelled. Rail roko extended by a week in Majha Amritsar Farmers in Majha region under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) on Thursday extended the rail roko agitation for a week even as other farmer organisations lifted the blockades for goods trains till November 5. The state core committee of the KMSC said the farmers would continue the blockade at Devidas Pura village in Amritsar district. KMSC state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said the agitation has been extended in view of the indifferent attitude of the Centre. “The next course of action will be announced on October 28 after a meeting of the state core committee,” he said. “As far as the movement of goods trains is concerned, our sit-in at Devidas Pura will not affect the transportation of essential goods as there is an alternative route for these trains from Beas to Tarn Taran to Amritsar. We have postponed the blockade at Basti Tenkan Wali in Ferozepur till the next meeting, so the movement of goods trains will not be affected on that route,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/32-goods-trains-back-on-track-in-punjab-after-over-three-weeks/story-ZqKWyZexI9aBgvQGwaDNxL.html

The bills have made purchase of crops under MSP punishable but if the market price is already low and a farmer wants to sell his crop, who will agree to buy it? The farmers will be stuck,” Dhankar said.Hitting out at former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the run-up to the Baroda bypoll, Dhankar said, “Hooda cannot think beyond his family and wants to fight every election. He will replace his candidate (Indu Raj Narwal) in the future. His candidate is yet to win and he wants to replace him with someone probably from his family,” he said.“He fought the Lok Sabha elections and then the assembly elections. Ignoring Kumari Selja, he sent his son to the Rajya Sabha. He even wanted to contest in the bypolls,” Dhankar said.Dhankar said his party had given its ticket to an able candidate, Yogeshwar Dutt, whose entry to the Assembly will be a proud moment for every Haryanvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farm-bills-are-zero-says-haryana-bjp-chief/story-xjeXCAIt89zXaqi47mzDXN.html

District and sessions judge Arunvir Vashista observed that the crime committed by Palwinder Singh and Karamjit Kaur falls in the rarest of rare category. Karamjit, however, was sentenced to life imprisonment.All were the residents of the same village.The detailed judgment of the case was not available with the prosecution lawyers till Thursday evening.Muktsar district attorney Naveen Girdhar said on June 20, 2015, Palwinder’s car drowned in the Gang canal near Fattanwala village, in which his wife Sarabjit Kaur, daughter Gaganpreet Kaur, son Jashanpreet Singh and Karamjit’s husband Nirmal Singh were killed in a planned manner.Girdhar said as Palwinder and Karamjit had an illicit relationship, the prosecution proved in the court that the two conspired to eliminate their families.After solemnising marriage on January 27, 2016, they filed a protection petition in Muktsar. Prosecution lawyer MS Brar said after sensing a foul play in the deaths, deceased Sarabjit’s brother Gurnishan Singh filed a police complaint in March 2016.Defence lawyer Babu Singh Sidhu said the instances of buying life insurance policy by Palwinder for his wife and another insurance policy in the name of Nirmal were treated as main evidences against the convicts.“After analysing the judgment, we will file an appeal against the death sentence in the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” said Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/muktsar-man-gets-death-sentence-for-drowning-wife-two-children/story-lg80Phw2hbEHQVeIF4ZVlJ.html
23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress needs Navjot Sidhu, should be more flexible to him, says Harish Rawat||Amid discontent in a section of state leaders over the importance given to former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu in the recent weeks, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and state in-charge Harish Rawat said the Punjab Congress needs to be more “flexible and accommodating” towards him. Rawat said his (Sidhu’s) worst critics cannot deny his usefulness for the party at national level and in state politics. “We all realise that the Congress needs Sidhu’s services. If we have to take his services, we will have to spread our arms for him and be more accepting. The Congress has a history of accommodating conflicting views and visions, and different personalities,” he said on Thursday, throwing strong hints about an important role for the cricketer-turned-politician in the days to come. Rawat’s advice to the state leadership comes at a time when the party circles are abuzz with speculation about Sidhu’s re-induction into the state cabinet or appointment as the state unit chief ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab. Sidhu, who has never cloaked his ambition, was lying low ever since he quit the state cabinet over being divested of the local government ministry by chief minister Amarinder Singh in June last year. The new state affairs in-charge sees Sidhu as “Rafale in Rahul Gandhi’s armoury” and has been pushing for an important role for him in the state. Though the former cricketer’s crowd-pulling ability and oratorical flourish are well-recognized, a section of the state Congress leaders is uneasy with his abrasive style with a party MP even asking him to float his own outfit. Rawat dismissed these differences as hiccups, stating he is there to deal with such things or he would be without work. Asked if the Congress is looking at a new leadership for the party for future, Rawat said Amarinder has served Punjab and the party well and was rewarded accordingly in return. “Captain is still young and mentally alert. At any juncture, and I am not talking about 2022, it may be 2024 or later than that, when he feel it is time to hang his boots, it will be his duty to decide the next line of leadership and nurture them,” the former Uttarakhand CM told select journalists. He, in the same breath, appreciated Sidhu for the way he spoke in the assembly and the way he praised the CM. “This means he is on the right path. And, this has helped break the ice,” he added, hinting at a rapprochement between the two leaders. On Punjab Congress’ organisational set-up, Rawat said he is holding meetings with state and district-level leaders for feedback and would like to announce it in the next 15-20 days. “I plan to travel to one district in each region before going ahead with it,” he said. The Congress high command had dissolved the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee and all district committees, retaining former MP Sunil Jakhar as president, in January. Hits out at Kejriwal on farm bills Rawat hit out at Delhi CM and Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal for terming the four bills as “drama”. “If Kejriwal thinks what we have done is not right, he should tell what he is doing. He should pass his own set of bills,” he said. On AAP’s demand for MSP guarantee for crops other than wheat and paddy, he said the states’ resources will not permit this. Has luncheon meeting with MP Bajwa Rawat had a luncheon meeting with Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa at the latter’s residence in Chandigarh where the two had a one-and-a-half hour discussion on the party’s organisational restructuring, functioning of the state government and the way forward on farm bills. “Besides being an old friend, he (Bajwa) is a pillar of the Congress in the state,” the AICC general secretary said after the meeting. He also met speaker Rana KP Singh and is likely to have a meeting with Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar in Delhi later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cong-needs-sidhu-should-be-more-flexible-to-him-rawat/story-JQzI3j4r9H0UjI0e7Vy4TN.html

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Mohali real estate developers pin hope on last leg of 2020||In a bid to revive the real estate sector after a decade of slowdown compounded by the Covid crisis, developers in the district are offering prospective buyers lucrative discounts and flexible payment plans this festive season. Real estate developers say they expect the last leg of 2020 to be more profitable than the rest of the year put together. There are around 200 private housing societies in Mohali. The Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA), which has begun e-auctioning both residential and commercial properties after slashing the reserve price by 10% from October 10 to October 26, is also offering discounts to rope in buyers. GMADA additional chief administrator Rajesh Dhiman said, “We have slashed our reserve price by 10% and successful bidders making full payment within 60 days will be given an additional 10% discount. We are offering these schemes during the festival season to invigorate the realty sector.” Of late Mohali (especially peripheral areas such as Zirakpur, Kharar, and New Chandigarh) has become the tricity’s real estate development hub. Thanks to the GMADA-led IT City and Aero City projects, Airport Road too has become an up-and-coming realty destination.However, builders are optimistic about a quick turnaround as home loan interests are at their lowest in nearly two decades. They foresee a move from rentals to house ownership fuelling the demand.Builders say buyer queries are coming in and end-users are looking for ready-to-move properties. The ₹20,000 crore fund created by the Centre in June for real estate projects will also help boost the sector. The fund is expected to help complete around 3,50,000 flats and houses stuck in different stages of construction. Umang Jindal, CEO of the upcoming Homeland Unity Mall in Sector 67, says enquiries and sales from the corporate sector have gone up in the third quarter of the year. “We are offering customised payment plans as per customers’ demand.” Zirakpur Builders Association president Harish Gupta says, “Developers have suffered considerable losses over the last few months but the sector has picked up momentum. Since the RBI has restricted subvention plans (schemes where the home buyer, banker and the developer make an agreement), builders are now offering flexible plans.” “Until last year, developers would offer free tickets to exotic destinations abroad, free parking space, modular kitchens, finished bathrooms, wooden flooring and other freebies to attract customers. However, amid the pandemic buyers are preferring discounts and flexible payment plans,” he said.Before the pandemic spread, banks were offering home loans at over 8% interest . “Now, the interest rates have dropped below 7%. They are expected to fall further, making it cheaper to buy a house. For people living in rented homes in Chandigarh and Panchkula it will make better financial sense to pay home loan EMIs instead of monthly rent. Builders with ready-to-move properties stand to gain most,” Gupta added.Mohali Jubilee Real Estate Group director Sanyam Dudeja said, “We are offering safe investments with our bank-guarantee offer. We have launched a one-time discount with a lease guarantee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-real-estate-developers-pin-hope-on-last-leg-of-2020/story-nyIBZX4MzeETFiCtwdVQCO.html

Addressing mediapersons, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Rupinderdeep Kaur Sohi said the accused are residents of Fazilka and Faridkot. “They have been arrested, while four other members of the gang, including a woman, are at large,” she added. As per the police, the accused women have duped a large number of tricity residents through their planned scam. “They used to join companies as receptionists and after few days, threaten the firm owners with false rape cases. In this conspiracy, one of the their gang members, Keshav Sandhir, a resident of Ludhiana, used to impersonate a Punjab Police ASI, who would then demand money from the company owners for settling the rape case,” the DSP said. Recently, a Nayagaon resident had given an advertisement on an online marketplace, OLX, for hiring two women staffers at his guest house in Sector 25, Chandigarh. On seeing the ad, the accused visited his office. As per the victim, he hired the women on a monthly salary of Rs 9,000, but after few days, they started to threaten him to implicate him in a false rape case and demanded Rs 15,000 through their gang members, who posed as were cops. The man then approached the police following which, the Fazilka woman was caught in a trap laid by the cops. Later, the Faridkot woman was also arrested.Kharar City station house officer (SHO) inspector Bhagwant Singh said, “Recently, they had also lured a physiotherapist from Mohali by taking over Rs 1 lakh from him in the same manner. The gang was active for the last one year. We are obtaining the call details of the other accused who are absconding. We will nab them soon.”The arrested women were produced in a local court on Thursday and sent to two-day police custody.

23-10-2020||Chandigarh||MC cannot charge 20% interest over delayed ground rent payment, rules Chandigarh advisor||Adjudicating on a matter pertaining to five-star hotel JW Marriot, Sector 35, a court held by the UT advisor on Thursday held that the municipal corporation (MC) cannot charge its allottees 20% penal interest on account of delayed ground rent payment and can only impose 6% interest.The advisor set aside the resumption order issued to the Sector 35 hotel by the Chandigarh MC’s estate office branch. The firm had filed a revision petition against the order passed by the chief administrator in respect of the site. The revision petition was filed by advocates SK Jain and Vikas Jain.The petitioner’s counsel submitted that the MC’s additional commissioner-cum-estate officer had cancelled the allotment or lease of the site on account of non-payment of ground rent. The petitioner contended that the authorities had wrongly charged 20% interest on account of non-payment of ground rent while applying condition five of the allotment letter. The counsel argued that condition five applied to non-payment of principal amount of premium and not non-payment of ground rent.The petitioner submitted that the MC’s additional commissioner wrongly cancelled the lease of the site and imposed 20% interest while passing the impugned order dated November 11. The appeal filed by the petitioner had also been dismissed by the chief administrator on March 20, 2020.The counsel for the MC submitted that it was clearly mentioned in clause five of the allotment letter that in case the petitioner failed to make payment of outstanding dues then he is liable to pay 20% interest on account of non-payment of ground rent.The petitioner’s counsel said, “There is no provision under the Chandigarh Leasehold Sites and Building Rules, 1973, for charging of 20% interest on non-payment of ground rent and for cancellation of the site for non-payment of the part amount of the ground rent.”“As per the settled law any interest imposed by the allotting authority must be by way of notification or the notification has to adopted by the allotting authority. In the present case, there is no provision for charging 20% interest in the rules or acts nor have municipal corporations adopted the notification for imposition of interest,” he said.The petitioner’s counsel held that his client had been harassed because of wrongful imposition of 20% interest for non-payment of ground rent against the municipal corporation’s rules.In his order, Manoj Parida set aside the impugned order and remanded the case back to the MC additional commissioner for a fresh decision and asked him to pass a speaking order in accordance with law.Parida said, “It is clear that condition five of the allotment letter providing 20% interest is applicable only to non-payment of the principal amount premium. There is a separate provision for non-payment of ground rent under the act as well as in the allotment letter. Since the additional commissioner has not applied the relevant rules while passing the impunged orders, therefore, the revision petition deserves to be accepted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-cannot-charge-20-interest-over-delayed-ground-rent-payment-rules-chandigarh-advisor/story-l5sJ1znm8iLF6T9AS0LixK.html

23-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body may allocate fund for Covid-19 expenses in its 2021-22 budget||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) annual budget for 2021-22 is likely to have a separate budget head for expenditure related to Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of using money allotted to the municipal health department for upgrading overall health infrastructure of the city, BMC’s health department plans to keep a dedicated amount for Covid-related expenditure in 2021-22. Budget 2021 is likely to be presented in February next year. At present, BMC’s planned expenditure on Covid-19 relief work, from March till December 2020, rounds up to over Rs 1,200 crore. So far, the money has come from BMC’s contingency fund, and partly from the revenue allocations made in BMC’s budget 2020 for the health department. In January 2021, more Covid-related expenses are anticipated.The budget head for Covid-19 in the civic body’s budget 2021 will cover expenses related to purchasing ventilators; equipment for oxygen supply; medicines for Covid-19 patients in municipal hospitals; adding more beds to treat Covid-19 patients; and expenses such as salaries for medical staff, and other administrative costs.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who is in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “We have begun work to outline expenditure we are likely to incur in 2021-22 due to the pandemic, for Budget 2021. It is being deliberated to allot a separate budget head for Covid-related expenditure in Budget 2021.” He said the required figure for Covid relief was still being worked out. “BMC is likely looking at substantial Covid-related expenditure especially on the revenue side [salaries and administrative expenses such as bills], in the upcoming fiscal year. It makes sense to submit demands for this money under a separate head, instead of utilising allocations made to the public health department,” said Kakani. When the pandemic broke out in Mumbai in March, BMC began setting up multiple, temporary, jumbo Covid-19 care facilities in Mumbai, which required beds, setting up intensive care units (ICU), purchasing medical equipment, hiring additional medical staff (such as doctors, nurses, trainee doctors) as well as ward help and cleaners. “On the capital side of Covid expenditure (setting up Covid-care facilities, beds, ventilators, ICUs), it appears Mumbai civic body is confidently ready. Revenue expenditure related to Covid-19 will recur, however, along with some more capital expenditure too,” said a senior civic officer. The total estimated health budget for 2020-21 (revenue and capital expenditure) is ₹4,260.34 crore, which was increased by 14% compared to revised estimates of 2019-20. This comes to about 12% of the total budget of the municipal corporation in 2020. Budget 2020 had also allotted Rs 2 crore to upgrade Kasturba Hospital in light of the pandemic, which comes under the budget head for the civic health department. The municipal commissioner’s speech for budget 2020 read, “Mumbai may also be at risk of spreading of coronavirus that originated from China. As such, a provision of ₹2 crore is proposed in B.E. 2020-21 for strengthening of Kasturba Hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-may-allocate-fund-for-covid-19-expenses-in-its-2021-22-budget/story-nj77nj7DNbG74Qslx51DON.html

There have been 993 deaths, with the fatality rate dropping to 2.15%.Similarly, the number of new cases also seems to have been brought under control with the doubling rate that was 79 days in September increasing to 127 days.NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “Our focus on early identification, isolation and treatment policy has started showing good results, increasing the doubling rate. We ensured that the state government’s ‘My Family My Responsibility’ drive that started on September 15 was strictly implemented. The door-to-door survey for identifying patients helped and also created awareness. We also increased Covid testing in the city.”Bangar added that 2,54,700 tests in the city have been conducted so far. He said, “Population-wise, this is higher than other major cities in the state. We conduct around 3,000 to 3,500 tests daily. Over 60,000 tests have been conducted in October, more than 6,500 have been found positive at a rate of just over 10 per cent, which too has come down from the earlier 13.72 per cent. The situation is improving but with the city opening up, there is greater responsibility on us all to take further precautions and ensure that the improving trend is not reversed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doubling-rate-recovery-of-covid-cases-improving-in-navi-mumbai/story-hqcD0JnL8bVl9QZS4i37dP.html

This will ensure that the civil hospital does not fall short of oxygen supply. Similar oxygen tanks will soon be set up in Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar.“This provision is being made at government-run hospitals in various parts of Thane district. We started with the Thane civil hospital and soon will make a similar provision at Bhiwandi as well. These tanks ensure that there is continuous supply of oxygen within the hospital. This facility will help save many lives,” said Rajesh Narvekar, Collector, Thane district.Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar will have 6,000 litres of liquid oxygen tanks.These tanks will begin functioning next week in Thane. Kailas Pawar, civil surgeon, Thane District, said, “If we have 500 patients who need continuous oxygen at a time in the hospital, even then the tanks will suffice for two days. Normal oxygen and ventilators have different types of supply, so depending upon the usage the supply will vary. When the tank has only 20 per cent of supply left, an automated alert is sent to the company who will immediately send tankers to refill the oxygen supply,” said.Sanction for a similar set up in Ulhasnagar has been given, “We have received a sanction for setting up the oxygen tanks in Ulhasnagar. We are working on the other formalities and can definitely say that the tanks will be set up soon even if it is of a smaller capacity.

Several societies along the Ghodbunder Road in Thane receive water for barely 45 minutes or even less in a day. Most of them have to heavily depend on tankers for their water requirement.During the pandemic situation, residents have alleged that when water is of utmost importance to maintain sanitation and while most of them are facing financial crisis, the water crises and tanker bills have worsened the situation.The city’s population is more than 20 lakh and receives 480 mld of water supply daily. A PIL was filed in the High Court three years ago to stop new construction activities on Ghodbunder Road unless the corporation provided them with water connections. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has assured the court that the city has enough water for these complexes.Dyaneshwar Nikam, 54, a resident of Kabra Galaxy, said, “We used to get ample water supply till two or three years ago. However, with the increase in number of new constructions along Ghodbunder Road, the water problems have increased. We believe our supply is diverted to the new constructions. At present, we receive water only for 30 to 40 minutes, which is insufficient for a four-tower society with 158 flats.”Nikam said that their complex was heavily dependent on water tankers. “We pay water tax and also end up paying extra for the tankers. The corporation should stop permitting new buildings till all the existing ones have sufficient water supply.”Own dam pending (SUBHEAD)The project of the city’s own dam, Shahi Dam, is also pending for a long time owing to lack of funds. The municipal corporations in the district had, last year, decided to share the cost of construction of the dam. However, the project is still in a limbo.V Shivkumar, convenor of Brahmand Federation, a cluster of 31 societies, added, “Thane is older than Navi Mumbai. However, the city does not have its own dam. The city is expanding exponentially. To fulfil the water requirement, dam is the only solution. The water supply in Brahmand is very irregular, anywhere between 45 minutes and 90 minutes.”Vinod Pawar, executive engineer of the water supply department, agreed that there was a problem in the supply system. He said. “For more than three months, there were continuous repair works by the agencies that supplied water. Because of this, there was regular shut down and water supply was irregular. We are following up the issue and will ensure that regular supply will resume soon. Moreover, we have given a reminder letter to the concerned water supply authority for additional water supply.”He said that the issue of the dam was pending at the state level and the corporation could not do anything about it.Water crisis not just in Thane (SUBHEAD)The water crisis across Thane city was the talk of the TMC general body meeting earlier this week. The members alleged that while Thane was implementing major projects under smart city, the administration has ignored the basic issue of water supply. Apart from Ghodbunder Road, the water crisis was also felt in Kissannagar, Mumbra, Kalwa and Diva areas.Pramila Keni, opposition leader of TMC, said, “The corporation has taken projects worth crore of Rupees under the smart city funds. However, the administration has not understood the meaning of smart city. In the times of the pandemic, people in Kalwa, Diva and Mumbra have no water. How are they going to maintain hygiene. In some parts of Diva and Mumbra, residents do not even have water for essential purposes.” She claimed that while the corporation was insisting on sanitisation of the city, there was not enough water to maintain sanitisation.Siraj Dongare, NCP corporator, added, “The water crisis is severe in Mumbra too. The corporation had given an affidavit to the High Court last year stating that the city had enough water supplies. However, the situation is completely different. The administration has also demanded additional water supply to Shahad-Temghar Water Supply Authority (STEM) and Bhatsa authority, the status of which was still unknown.”The general body also claimed that several areas of Kopri, too, were reeling under water cuts. The corporators also claimed that both Diva and Lokmanya Nagar received less supply.Sanjay Bhoir, Shiv Sena corporator, added, “The water supply department should ensure that the old buildings get enough water and then provide water to the new constructions.”GRAPHICSWATER CRISIS IN THANEThe PIL: Following the acute water crisis in Thane in the summer of 2016, resident Mangesh Shellar had filed a PIL in the High Court blaming poor planning by the TMC and the haphazard way in which the civic body granted permission for new constructions along Ghodbunder Road. Following this PIL, the court had stalled permissions to any new constructions along Ghodbunder Road in 2016. The court has also asked the corporation to file an affidavit stating the water connections and occupation certificates given in the last five years. In the affidavit, the corporation stated that TMC has done water management to meet the population requirement till 2025.N-zone480 mld: Water supply Thane gets per dayWATER SOURCES:200 mld: TMC’s own water supply scheme (water source: Bhatsa Dam) 60 mld: Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (water source: Bhatsa and Tansa Dam)110 mld: Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) (water source: Barvi Dam)110 mld: Shahad-Temghar Water Supply Authority (STEM) (water source: Barvi Dam): 110 mldWHERE DOES THE DISTRICT RECEIVE WATER FROM? ** The two major dams that provide water to Thane are the Barvi and Andra dams. ** There are seven to eight small dams that also provide water to the district. ** There are seven municipal corporations and three municipal councils in the district, apart from the rural belt, that depend on this meagre water stock.WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?** Thane’s total water storing capacity needs to be increased from the current 3,000-4,000 mld to 7,000 mld, for which the proposed three dam projects in the district need to be implemented.** The district had plans to construct three dams, Shai, Kalu and Poshir, all of which are stuck for different reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cries-for-more-water-supply-own-dam-in-thane-grow-louder/story-F6DbGF6fCKE5phl7VUsZPK.html

The patients have complained that most of them, especially senior citizens, get cramps or do not fit into these washrooms.BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation, said, “The washroom is very small and I get cramps in the toilet. I am mid-sized and hence managing somehow, but most well-built people have tough time. We are forced to restrain ourselves from visiting the toilet.”The 65-year-old added that the bathroom was another disaster due to its design. “There’s no place to keep soap. Are you supposed to hold it in the hand while taking shower? Patients are supposed to stay for a minimum of 10 days here. My neighbouring patient has already spent 23 days. Can you imagine his plight? The drainage system in the washrooms is bad. You are in three to four inches of water by the time you finish your shower,” he added. He pointed out that there were no places to dry clothes.However, Kumar added that food quality was very good.The handles in the bathroom for senior citizens were also missing.Meanwhile, another 60-year-old woman from Juinagar who was admitted to the facility on Monday night, faced the same issues with washroom. She also pointed out that some patients lacked civic sense as they didn’t flush after use.Sujata Dhole, additional commissioner, NMMC, said, “The bathrooms were created during the pandemic. So, getting such massive number of lines in a short time was a challenge. The issues can be taken up by the nodal officer who would in turn inform the engineers about it.”The Cidco Exhibition Centre has 1,174 beds while 75 ICU beds with oxygen are in the pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/washrooms-at-cidco-exhibition-centre-covid-centre-in-vashi-causing-inconvenience-to-patients/story-FwujqN9dksdNEpVkpI8nSP.html

23-10-2020||Mumbai||Reverse migration in Maharashtra Congress, NCP?||After Eknath Khadse’s switch from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the two ruling parties in the state – NCP and Congress – are considering taking back some legislators and leaders who had quit to join the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in 2019. The parties aim to increase the strength they lost in the elections and lure more legislators from the BJP to discourage any attempt to pull down the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. According to NCP insiders, the party’s top brass is working on it. “Several leaders who left the party are disappointed with the BJP. They have already approached the party leadership, expressing their desire to come back. Now, it is up to Pawarsaheb to decide who he wants back,” said a senior leader, requesting not to be named. “There is a lingering uncertainty about the stability of the MVA government comprising three parties. Sitting legislators would not join the ruling parties unless they are confident that the government will last its term. Currently, the focus would be on former legislators and heavyweights from the districts,” said an NCP minister. Also Read | Eknath Khadse who moves from BJP to NCP, says 10 more Maharashtra MLAs in touch with himThe minister said that as part of mutual understanding between the three ruling parties, they will fight the Assembly by-elections together, if any sitting BJP MLA resigns to join them. “We want our strongholds back. This will be done step by step,” said a senior NCP leader. On Monday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar clarified the NCP has decided not to re-induct turncoats from Osmanabad, hinting at former MP and erstwhile close confidant Padmasinh Patil and his son Rana Jagjitsinh Patil. Both were ministers in different Congress-NCP governments, but defected to the BJP in the run-up to the Assembly elections last year. Padmasinh Patil’s sister Sunetra is the wife of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Patil was a long-time close aide of Pawar and had even handled responsibility as state president of Pawar-led Congress (S) before the outfit was merged with the Congress by Pawar. “A deliberation is going on over re-induction. We are considering it and have taken some decisions as well. For instance, in Osmanabad there will be no entry for those who have left the party. Be happy wherever you are,” Pawar said categorically. Also Read | Maharashtra leader Eknath Khadse quits: NCP’s gain, but is it BJP’s loss?State NCP chief Jayant Patil on Wednesday said, “Many senior leaders want to join us. I had a discussion with a few. Their names will be disclosed at an appropriate time.” Eight sitting MLAs, one sitting MP and many other leaders had left the NCP last year. While the NCP is banking on its citadel in western Maharashtra to poach leaders from the BJP to destabilise it, the Congress is eyeing ‘reverse migration’ from Marathwada and north Maharashtra, according to insiders. The Congress had lost its top position in district councils and municipal corporations to the BJP. “We are in touch with at least half a dozen sitting BJP MLAs and an equal number of mightier leaders from various regions in Maharashtra. Some of the leaders have been disillusioned. We are looking at heavyweights,” said a top Congress leader. BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said the exodus to the ruling parties was their wishful thinking. “This is the lie being spread by the NCP and Congress. Why would sitting MLAs or MPs quit the party when four years of their term are still remaining. No sitting legislator would want a fresh election so soon. The ground reality is different from the picture being painted.” Eighteen municipal corporations (of the total 27) and 26 district councils (of the total 34) will go to polls from February to October in 2022. With 1,100 corporators in 27 corporations, the BJP is way ahead in urban civic bodies, followed by Sena (489), Congress (439) and NCP (294). In ZPs, too, the BJP has the highest number of members. Former BJP MLA Udesinh Padvi, who joined the NCP after he was denied ticket in 2019 Assembly polls, said there will be a reverse wave. “The elected representatives in ZPs, corporations, panchayat samitis representing BJP had joined the party during the past five years ahead of respective elections. I can speak only for north Maharashtra, but most of them will come back to the NCP and Congress,” Padvi, who represented Shahada constituency in Nandurbar, is a Khadse supporter and had quit the BJP after consulting him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reverse-migration-in-maharashtra-congress-ncp/story-jl1E7wzNuW3LNskhNUj6SI.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Onion prices in Mumbai soar to Rs90-Rs100/kg||Onion prices in Mumbai soared to ₹90 to ₹100 per kilogram on Thursday, from ₹60 last week, owing to the shortage caused by unseasonal rain in various parts of the country.At Lasalgaon, Asia’s biggest onion market, the auction rate was ₹7,050 per quintal, up from last week’s ₹4,801, resulting in the price rise in Mumbai’s retail markets.According to Narendra Wadhavane, secretary, agricultural produce market committee (APMC), Lasalgaon, there is a tremendous shortage of onions due to the destruction of crops by the rain. “We hardly have 4,000 quintal of stock in the market currently, compared to the normal 12,000 to 15,000 quintals,” said Wadhavane. He said that just 284 pick-up vehicles, like tempos, trailers and two-wheelers, arrived at the APMC market on Thursday, down from the usual 1,200.“We have no choice, but to cough up as onions are one of the main ingredients in many of our dishes. However, we are now cutting down on the use of onions as we have already suffered due to lockdown. I don’t have a work from the past seven months and this has only made things worse,” said Khushi Gupta, an actor who lives in Lokhandwala, Andheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/onion-prices-in-mumbai-soar-to-rs90-rs100-kg/story-hA70PbHKM8O1Zl7D6Z4HFJ.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Doubts over political use of CBI, says Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh over withdrawal of consent||There were doubts over the “political use” of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), said Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday in justification of the state government’s decision to withdraw general consent given to CBI to investigate in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, on Wednesday withdrew the general consent given to CBI to probe cases in the state, making it mandatory for the agency to seek the state government’s permission before taking up cases within its borders.The state government suspected that the probe in the alleged television rating points (TRP) manipulation scam would be transferred to CBI after a case was lodged in Uttar Pradesh, Deshmukh said. “Although the CBI is a professional investigation agency, doubts are being raised over its use for political purposes,” Deshmukh said. “Section 6 of the Delhi Special Establishments Act empowers the state, making its consent mandatory for handing over any case to the premier investigating agency. By an order issued in 1989, Maharashtra had given general consent allowing the Central agency to take over any case. We have withdrawn the same by issuing the order yesterday,” Deshmukh added, at a press conference in Mumbai.Deshmukh was seconded by Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut, who said the CBI and other Central agencies were used to defame non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states and the decision was prompted as patience was wearing out due to instances in the past few months.“Such decisions have to be taken to protect the rights of the state when agencies like CBI, Enforcement Directorate (ED), National Commission for Women (NCW), which have some authority to investigate, are used to create trouble or defame governments of opposition parties (non-BJP ruled). Such a time came in West Bengal, it was done in Andhra Pradesh, and some more states have also done it,” Raut told reporters separately on Thursday. Deshmukh said the state government suspected the possibility of the TRP case’s transfer to CBI for political reasons. “There is a growing murmur among the public about the political use of the premier Central agency of late. The honourable Supreme Court, too, had in the past termed CBI a ‘caged parrot’. We have seen how a few sensitive cases registered in Maharashtra were handed over to Central agencies. We anticipated a similar attempt in the TRP scam and hence the order has been issued. Mumbai police is investigating the TRP case very efficiently and has made a few arrests too. After the CBI registered an FIR in the TRP scam in Uttar Pradesh, there was a possibility of our probe being handed over to the Central agency,” he said.Deshmukh pointed out that a few states like Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim, too, have issued such orders, making their consent mandatory before handing over any probe to the CBI.Raut added that on a few instances in the past few months when Mumbai Police started any probe, an FIR was lodged by some state and the CBI enters Maharashtra. “Patience has run out. The moment the police take up a case, and reach a conclusion, the Central agency files an FIR in other state, takes over the case and enters Maharashtra. How long can this go on? Maharashtra has its pride,” Raut said.The BJP has, however, said that by withdrawing the consent, the Maharashtra government is vitiating the relations between Centre and State. “The order is nothing but an attempt of creating doubts in the minds of the people and will also hurt state’s relations with Centre. State home minister’s statement is baseless as TRP case is unlikely to go to the CBI unless somebody moves court. Unlike Sushant Singh Rajput death case, the investigation in TRP case by Mumbai Police is at an advanced stage, arrests have been made and in this backdrop, the case is unlikely to be transferred to the CBI,” said BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar.He also added that spoiling its relations with the Centre may hurt the prospects of getting Central assistance for flood-hit farmers.In the recent past, the MVA government in Maharashtra and the BJP government at the Centre were involved in a tussle over investigations in sensitive cases. Immediately after it took over, the MVA planned to set up a special investigation team to probe the Bhima-Koregaon case, which was being probed by the Maharashtra police during the BJP rule in the state. However, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case in February this year.Before the TRP case, the Mumbai Police were locked in a jurisdictional tussle with the Centre and CBI over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who was found hanging at his Mumbai apartment on June 14. The case was handed over to CBI in August this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/doubts-over-political-use-of-cbi-says-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-over-withdrawal-of-consent/story-nmMCR6jmOcua5jqXSkj4mK.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Eknath Khadse who moves from BJP to NCP, says 10 more Maharashtra MLAs in touch with him||A day after quitting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Eknath Khadse, who is set to join the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), said 10 BJP MLAs were in touch with him, but they may not quit the party now. He said a few former legislators and local leaders from north Maharashtra will join the NCP, along with him, in the presence of party chief Sharad Pawar. He also claimed the NCP had offered him candidature for the Assembly polls, after the BJP denied him an election ticket last year, even as he stepped up attack on former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, saying the BJP’s formula to take backward classes together was thrown away, after Fadnavis took over the party’s affairs in the state. Khadse was a prominent leader of the BJP from north Maharashtra and enjoys a significant hold in the region. He comes from Leva Patil, one of the OBC communities that has a sizable population in north Maharashtra.The region comprises 35 Assembly seats. Of them, the BJP won 13 seats, one less than 2014, in the state Assembly polls held last year. The NCP won seven seats, while the Shiv Sena six and Congress five MLAs in the region. AIMIM won two seats and two independents were also elected in the last Assembly polls. With Khadse’s induction, NCP leaders are hoping the party would get stronger in the region. Sitting BJP MLA Sanjay Savkare (Bhusawal) is considered close to him. “Most leaders who are close to Khadse were denied tickets in the last assembly elections. This was done to cut Khadse to size,” said a close aide to Khadse. Of the 11 Assembly seats in Jalgaon district, Khadse’s hometown, most have a significant population of the Leva Patil community that supports the 68-year-old leader, who has won elections from Muktainagar for six consecutive terms.Also Read | Devendra Fadnavis calls Eknath Khadse’s allegations against him ‘half truth’“I have support of over 10 sitting MLAs, but none will join us as anti-defection law will come into force and we don’t want unnecessary elections during the coronavirus pandemic. But there are 15-16 former legislators, who will gradually join the NCP. A few of them will be joining along with me on Friday,” Khadse told HT. Besides, his daughter-in-law and Raver BJP Raksha Khadse may follow in his footsteps. “With Raksha Khadse, the BJP is likely to lose a sitting MP as well as many MLAs in the coming future,” claimed one of his close aides, requesting anonymity. Continuing his attack on Devendra Fadnavis, now the leader of Opposition, Khadse said the BJP was considered a party of Brahmins and Baniyas. “To get rid of this tag and expand party’s social base, MADHAV formula (which stoods for ‘M’ali, ‘Dha’ngar and ‘V’anjari communities) was suggested by veteran BJP leader Vasantji Bhagwat. The formula helped us change the party’s image, but soon after Fadnavis took over, he stopped its implementation. He deliberately denied election tickets to many leaders from OBC communities who would have easily won the Assembly polls,” he alleged. “I had so many opportunities to join other parties as they were also keen to take me in. But being loyal to the BJP, I didn’t take that step. In 2019, after the BJP denied me a ticket for the Assembly polls, senior NCP leaders such as Ajit Pawar, Dilip Walse Patil contacted me. The party had also sent their AB form to contest the polls. Had I taken up the opportunity, I would have been elected as an MLA again,” he said. Taking potshots at Fadnavis, he said it is because of his “able leadership” the BJP is not in the government despite winning maximum seats. “The situation would have been different if the leadership had decided to join hands with the Shiv Sena,” he said, raising questions on Fadnavis’s leadership. “My decision of joining the NCP is immoral and taking oath at 5am in the morning along with the respected Ajit Dada Pawar was a moral move,” taunted the former BJP leader. On Thursday, Khadse reached Mumbai in a chopper along with his wife Mandatai and daughter Rohini to formally join the NCP. The plan to organise a grand event in Jalgaon district is also under consideration, where all his supporters will formally join the ruling party in presence of the NCP leadership. The event will be organized later as political meetings are still not allowed in the state. Damania refutes his allegationsSocial activist Anjali Damania refuted former BJP leader Eknath Khadse’s claims that she hounded him. Damania who had filed the case against Khadse for using derogatory language against her, alleged she was harassed by Khadse. “I pursued corruption charges against Chhagan Bhujbal and Nitin Gadkari also, but they did not harass me like what Khadse did,” said Damania. “Khadse and his aides filed 32 cases against me in six districts across Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eknath-khadse-i-am-in-touch-with-10-bjp-mlas-from-maharashtra/story-tD3v6NryreT7tZ7GHFU5VN.html

Officials from the education department said they were still awaiting a nod from the state to restart admissions. “Until that happens, we cannot take any decision. We have no clarity on when that would happen,” said an official from the department. On September 9, in line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the Maratha quota in jobs and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. With this, the second merit list for admissions which was scheduled to be out on September 10 was not released. More than a month after that, admissions are yet to restart leaving over 2.42 lakh students in the lurch in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone. Hundreds of parents of anxious students have been writing to the education department requesting that the admission process be restarted soon. Arvind Tiwari, a city-based parent, recently wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “The pandemic has already wreaked havoc on the mental and physical health of students which is compounded by this uncertainty over admissions. The state government should expedite the matter and take a decision to resolve it at the earliest,” Tiwari wrote in the letter. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/a-month-on-deadlock-over-fyjc-admissions-continues-in-maharashtra/story-NmrxyG9syLdSOxHdrBKyIK.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena’s Dussehra rally in Mumbai will be live-streamed on social media||Shiv Sena’s annual Dussehra rally will be a muted affair this year owing to the restrictions on public gatherings amid the pandemic. Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray will address people on Sunday (October 25) from Savarkar Memorial in Dadar, and not from the Shivaji Park that has been hosting its annual rally since decades. Thackeray’s speech will be streamed live through social media for party workers. To circumvent the restrictions on public gatherings and political rallies, the Shiv Sena has decided to hold the event indoors where a stage will be erected for Thackeray to address scores of Sainiks who will hear his ‘aadesh’ through live streaming of the event. Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that Sena’s Dussehra rally is generally an outdoor event, but restrictions imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 would apply to the party as well. “CM Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to people to follow the rules to contain coronavirus spread, the same rules apply to us. We have decided, as per the instructions of Uddhav Thackeray, that a stage of the Dussehra rally will be erected at Savarkar Memorial behind Shivaji Park. The rally will be streamed through Facebook, Twitter and news channels throughout the nation,” Raut told reporters.The Sena is also contemplating on inviting party’s top brass at the venue. Sena insiders said that social distancing norms will be followed at the event. “We are thinking if some people from the party can be invited [at the venue]” Raut said.After several years, there is a Shiv Sena chief minister in the state. The last time a Sena leader on the CM chair was in 1999. Raut added, “This year Shiv Sena chief minister is going to give the speech. In last year’s rally, I had said that next year Shiv Sena chief minister will address the rally. With the blessings of Balasaheb, the chief minister of Maharashtra is Uddhav Thackeray. People are waiting for this rally and are keen to know about Sena’s next moves and the challenges that the state faces.

The minister has asked Maharashtra Film, Stage and Cultural Development Corporation Limited (MFSCDC) to prepare a draft for the policy. “The comprehensive policy will cover all aspects dealing with various platforms such as films, theatre, documentaries, serials to over-the-top (OTT) content. It will be presented before the state cabinet for its final nod,” Deshmukh said.He said the state cultural affairs department has also been directed to move the proposal to accord industry status to film sector so that it can get the benefits that small and medium industries get. Manisha Verma, managing director of MFSCDC, said, “The policy will have a holistic approach towards all aspects related to the sector. We will consider simplification of taxation, increasing screens, fiscal incentives, changing technology besides generation of skilled manpower. It’s a labour intensive industry and has potential of job generation. All these aspects will be deliberated upon during a webinar with all stakeholders between November 5 and 7. Valid suggestions and recommendations that we will get during the deliberation will be incorporated in the policy.”The government has also announced rebate in shooting charges at Goregaon film city up to 25% in the wake of the losses the sector sustained during the Covid-19 lockdown.Sushama Shiromani, former president of Indian Motion Pictures Producers’ Association, said, “We welcome the move as the industry status will help in surviving the sector. But it should not remain just an announcement as we have been hearing them for years. The sector is going through a very bad face and it’s about time that the government do the needful. The policy should address all the problems the industry has been facing after new platforms have evolved in the past few years. We expect due deliberation with stakeholders before the final call is taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-come-out-with-policy-for-entertainment-sector-to-extend-industry-status/story-7b2jm3GffXi1jI20BMIi6L.html

23-10-2020||Mumbai||Bhima-Koregaon case: NIA court rejects Father Stan Swamy’s plea for interim bail||The special National Investigating Agency (NIA) court on Thursday rejected the interim bail plea filed by 83-year-old activist Father Stan Swamy, who was arrested in connection with Bhima-Koregaon case.Swamy was arrested on October 8 from his residence in Ranchi and produced before the special court on October 9. He was remanded in judicial custody and has been lodged in Taloja jail since then.His lawyer, Sharif Shaikh, had moved a plea for interim bail claiming, “The applicant is 83-years old, suffering from various ailments like hearing loss from both ears, arms injury. He has undergone two hernia operations, and still is suffering from abdomen pain. He suffers intense pain from lumbar spondylosis i.e. the tear and wear of the lumbar disc and tremors in both hands due to Parkinson’s disease.”The plea also claimed that since the jails are crowded, Swamy is at risk considering the prevailing Covid-19 conditions in jails amid the pandemic.The plea was opposed by special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty on various grounds.Swamy was first questioned as a suspect in the case by the investigating agencies in 2018. He had approached the Bombay high court (HC) in October 2018 for quashing the complaint against him in this case. His lawyer Mihir Desai had then submitted to the court that Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), of which Swamy is a convenor, has no political colour. “PPSC is formed by the elite in the society with the aim of assisting prisoners unnecessarily languishing in jails in several states, and it has no political colour,” read Desai’s submissions.The prosecution had also claimed that Swamy is only considered a suspect and not an accused. Considering the prosecution’s submission, the court had then dismissed the plea for quashing the complaint against Swamy. Two years later, NIA began probing his role in the violence case.While arresting him, NIA claimed, “He also received funds through an associate for the furtherance of CPI (Maoist) activities. He is the convenor of PPSC, a frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist). The documents related to aiding the activities of CPI (Maoist) and propaganda material of the banned outfit, including its literature, were seized from his possession.”The agency in its charge sheet filed on October 9 claimed, “Evidence revealed that Swamy was in communication with CPI (Maoist) cadre com. Arun in which he communicated that after the arrest of urban CPI (Maoist) cadres from different parts of the country, particularly in parts of Maharashtra, a huge revocable damage has been caused to the party.”“He received ₹8 lakhs through one comrade Mohan for furtherance of CPI (Maoist) activities,” the agency had claimed in the charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-nia-court-rejects-father-stan-swamy-s-plea-for-interim-bail/story-PP9o6CxEoejNkzBxvISi3H.html
23-10-2020||City||Maharashtra government allows lawyers to travel on Mumbai’s local trains during non-peak hours till November 23; railway board nod likely on Friday||In a major relief to the city’s lawyers, the state government on Thursday allowed them to travel on suburban local trains during non-peak hours as per the directions of the Bombay high court (HC). The permission issued by the disaster management department has stated that the arrangement is on an experimental basis till November 23, and only lawyers affiliated to the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa as well as their registered clerks will be able to avail the facility. However, railway authorities have not yet received the railway board’s nod to permit lawyers to travel on trains. The board is likely to give its nod on Friday.On Thursday, Kishore Raje Nimbalkar, secretary of the state disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department, passed an order and noted that lawyers and registered clerks would be permitted to take trains only during non-peak hours – before 8am and between 11am to 4pm and post -7pm on working days. The order further stated that monthly passes would not be issued to the lawyers, and they would have to buy one-way tickets after showing the identity card issued to them by the Bar Council. The order also stipulates that the lawyers would have to wear the badge provided by the Bar Council at a prominent place on their attire. The order concluded with a warning that strict disciplinary action will be taken by the HC or the Bar Council against those found violating the rules. The state government, while expressing its inclination to allow lawyers to travel on local trains, had said that it would contemplate on the modalities to ensure that the facility was not misused. The order will permit around 2,000 lawyers practicing in HC and various subordinate courts to travel on local trains by following Covid-19 protocols. On Monday, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni had directed the state to consider the application of lawyers seeking permission to travel on local trains, within a day. It had also said that its previous orders to avail e-pass for lawyers on an experimental basis would be continued, so that they are able to travel by local trains and attend hearings before the HC and subordinate courts in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) till November 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-allows-lawyers-to-travel-on-local-trains-during-non-peak-hours-till-november-23-railway-board-nod-likely-on-friday/story-HXzYi6iw6qoSnMySIY8qiP.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai lawyer files complaint to invoke sedition against Kangana Ranaut||A city-based lawyer on Thursday filed a private complaint with Andheri metropolitan magistrate court against actor Kangana Ranaut for allegedly “causing disharmony among two religious groups through her tweets”.Advocate Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh has pleaded the court to direct the police to book the actor under charges of sedition for her various posts on the micro-blogging site Twitter. The plea is scheduled for hearing next month.The lawyer said that Ranaut’s recent tweet referred to Mumbai as “Pakistan occupied Kashmir” and described the state home minister as a member of the “Taliban”, which Deshmukh claimed have defamed the country.“The actor has no respect for varied communities of India, law of the land, authorised government bodies,” read the complaint.Also Read | Kangana Ranaut reacts to summons by Mumbai Police: ‘You miss Kangana so much. No worries, I will be there soon’Deshmukh claimed that Ranaut had been attacking the state government and the Shiv Sena by addressing them as murderers of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.“It is prominent to note that every Indian citizen has got the right to freedom of speech and not freedom of hate speech. We have all got limitations to use the right to freedom of speech and expression, yet several people including present accused [Ranaut] have been spreading hate, breaking brotherhood and integrity of the country through time and again provoking hate speeches that disrupt peace in the country,” the complaint mentioned.The lawyer has also referred to the actor’s comments made on the social media site after the metropolitan magistrate court in Bandra ordered police to register a case against her and her sister. The complainant alleged that Ranaut addressed the judiciary as “Papu Sena” in her comments.Ranaut and her sister have been facing a probe over their comments on social media regarding the government. The two have already been summoned by the Bandra police, which has registered a case against them on the direction of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-lawyer-files-complaint-to-invoke-sedition-charges-against-actor-kangana-ranaut/story-bEEz27EZuxjXJmgSAisJAP.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena looks to better its virtual presence, with young cadre in tow||Dragged into controversies on social media over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and Palghar mob lynching, the Shiv Sena has planned an aggressive counter – cadre and members of the youth wing, Yuva Sena, as social media coordinators who will “organically” fight Opposition’s “bots”. The party has already appointed 36 such coordinators for Mumbai and will appoint at least one person as the social media coordinator in each of the 288 Assembly constituencies by mid-November, a functionary involved in the appointments said. Party functionaries point out that the idea to give a structure to the social media department was the brainchild of Sena leader and Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray. “Initially it (social media) was an informal structure, but Aaditya ji thought that it should be formalised. Instead of relying on fake profiles and bots, the Shiv Sena, which has such a huge cadre base, will go with its cadre. It gives a boost to our party. We are appointing social media coordinators for the Shiv Sena for each Vidhan Sabha seat. For Mumbai, we have already appointed social media coordinators for all 36 Assembly seats. We have also appointed 22 state-wide social media coordinators,” said Varun Sardesai, secretary, Yuva Sena, who is managing the planning of the social media. Recently, the image of the Shiv Sena and its leadership took a beating on social media, following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the spat with actor Kangana Ranaut. However, Sardesai denied that the move to boost their social media presence was triggered by the recent incidents. He argued the accounts used on social media were fake or alien. Sardesai said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has got a positive response since the pandemic hit Maharashtra. “The Mumbai Police found 80,000 fake accounts on Twitter. Most of the accounts came up after June 2020 or they are from outside Maharashtra. During CM sir’s Facebook Live, there was not a single comment on Sushant or Kangana issue. Not a single comment was seeking ‘justice for Sushant’ or other issues because actual people were not commenting on those issues,” he said. A functionary involved in the social media planning added that these platforms play a crucial role in understanding the mood of the people, and have a direct impact on elections. “The change in the political dynamic happened late last year. Three months into a full-fledged government, the Covid-19 pandemic started. So the government did not get time to function and we did not get to show our work. If we have to beat the fake narratives of the Opposition, we need a plan,” he said, requesting anonymity. The Yuva Sena secretary added that as part of the strategy, the social media coordinators will push the work done by the Sena-led state government. “Social media has started to play a big role in deciding people’s sentiments and now that we have a positive sentiment about the government, we want to spread the work the government is doing. More than to target any particular party or the Opposition, the main focus will be to spread the work the government does,” Sardesai added. A structured social media body for the Shiv Sena will also play a crucial role in the next Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections, which will be held in February 2022. “Over seven months have gone due to the pandemic. It will take another four to six months for people to get into their routine, even if the [Covid-19] cases drop. So we will be left with eight to nine months before the BMC elections. When everybody is at home, they can get all information on the Shiv Sena’s work at their fingertips,” a functionary said. Sardesai added, “Social media will be extremely important [for BMC election]. But it is not just for BMC polls. We want to ensure the good work done by the government reaches every corner of the state.” Aaditya held a meeting with Mumbai’s social media coordinators at Sahyadri guesthouse in Malabar Hill on Monday and asked them to focus on the government’s work. A person, who was present in the meeting, said, “The key points of what Aaditya ji told the coordinators was to push government initiatives, read newspapers and online news, and most importantly, he told everybody not to abuse [on social media], even if the other person engages in it. Strict disciplinary action will be initiated against the ones who use foul language. All have been asked to respond to people with facts, no matter what.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-looks-to-better-its-virtual-presence-with-young-cadre-in-tow/story-DehadQXNyqYXnMNZA7idMN.html
23-10-2020||Education||Centre steps in to end bitter spat over DU registrar appointment||fareeha.iftikhar@htdigital.inNew Delhi:  The Union education ministry on Thursday said that the orders issued by the Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi during his leave of absence on medical grounds are not valid, and should not be acted upon by any functionary. The decision -- on a day of high drama at the university -- comes hours after Tyagi removed PC Joshi from the post of pro vice-chancellor after a bitter spat over the appointment of Vikas Gupta as registrar, a post which was lying vacant since November. Tyagi had also approved the appointment of Geeta Bhatt, a member of right-wing teachers’ group National Teachers’ Democratic Front (NDTF), as the new pro-V-C on Thursday.The ministry said that Joshi, who was appointed the acting vice-chancellor, will continue to remain in the post, and that the admission process and academic activities should continue without any delay.The directive means that Bhatt’s appointment as Pro-VC stands annulled, and so does a subsequent order ratified by her in which PC Jha was appointed as registrar.Both Bhatt and Jha declined to comment on the matter.The ministry, in a letter to Vikas Gupta -- whose appointment as registrar it appeared to back -- said that the orders by the vice-chancellor, issued while he was on leave, should not be acted upon. The ministry also communicated to Gupta that if Tyagi wants to join office, a proper medical fitness certificate should be obtained from him.The ministry’s directives came after Joshi apprised the Centre of how a notification was issued on Wednesday announcing the appointment of Jha as the new registrar “even before the working hours and without his active knowledge”. The ministry also sent a report to President Ram Nath Kovind apprising him of the developments. The President is the Visitor all Central universities. The directives are expected to end a bitter tussle between two groups -- one led by Pro-VC Joshi and the other backed by V-C Tyagi -- over the appointment of the new registrar.The saga unfolded over three frenetic days.On Tuesday, Joshi had announced that the DU executive council (EC), the varsity’s highest decision-making body, would meet on Wednesday. However, on Wednesday, even before the EC met, the joint registrar’s office issued a notice announcing the appointment of Jha as the new registrar. Hours after the notice, Joshi wrote to Jha accusing him of “illegally occupying” the registrar’s office, since it had not been ratified by the EC.“In case you are not vacating the office immediately, you will be forcibly moved out of office and action initiated against you,” Joshi said in the letter to Jha.Later that day, following the scheduled EC meeting, Joshi announced the appointment of Vikas Gupta as registrar. An unsigned letter issued by the Tyagi faction, however, declared the EC meeting illegal.On Thursday, even as Joshi announced that Gupta has assumed office as the new registrar, Jha issued an order removing Joshi as the pro vice-chancellor, and announced Bhatt’s appointment to that post.“The V-C [Tyagi] has decided to replace Joshi with Geeta Bhatt. I will continue to hold the position of the registrar. I will soon join…”Jha told HT on Thursday morning.Vice-chancellor Tyagi’s office also confirmed Bhatt’s appointment on Thursday evening, and issued a statement: “Dr Geeta Bhatt has been appointed as Pro-Vice-Chancellor, University of Delhi. She has assumed the charge as Pro-Vice-Chancellor, the University of Delhi with effect from today the 22nd October 2020.”After taking office the same day, Bhatt ratified a notification declaring Gupta’s appointment “illegal”.“The notification issued by the then pro-VC (PC Joshi) is without any jurisdiction and lawful authority. It is an abuse of process of law stipulated in the DU Act, statutes and ordinances,” the notification read.Till Wednesday, Suman Kundu had been in temporary charge as DU registrar.Responding to allegations, PC Jha said, “The appointments of PC Joshi and Suman Kundu were also reported in the EC after they took charge.”A senior official, requesting anonymity, said Jha’s office on Thursday issued a notice prohibiting Joshi and Kundu from visiting the office Viceregal Lodge (V-C’s office). “The notice read that they will only be allowed to visit the Viceregal Lodge with the permission of the registrar’s office,” the official said.Officials in the administration and several teachers also questioned the legality of Jha’s and Bhatt’s appointments. “The appointments of PC Joshi as the Pro-VC and Vikas Gupta as registrar were duly approved by the EC following all the norms. As per the DU norms, when the VC is on leave or is away for any other reason, the acting vice chancellor shall perform the functions of the VC. The acting vice chancellor can also chair the EC meeting. So, the meeting held on Wednesday was in accordance with the Statutes, Ordinances, and EC Regulations of the University,” said Rajesh Jha, an EC member.Former DU pro-V-C Sudhish Pachauri, who had taken charge as acting VC for a few months between 2015 and 2016, said: “What happened is unfortunate. In DU, we follow some statutory rules while making appointments. Any appointment, including that of the pro V-C or registrar, has to be approved by the EC. In case that has not been done, it’s not legal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/centre-steps-in-to-end-bitter-spat-over-du-registrar-appointment/story-5XGVDTge23EsMAxtCGUkBI.html
23-10-2020||Delhi||Play, pause, repeat: Durga Puja moves from pandals to phones||Nikhil Sengupta rolled the sleeves of his crisply ironed kurta as his teenage son put his laptop on the centre table and logged into the Facebook page of a prominent Durga Puja organiser in the city. Sengupta’s wife Preetha, a computer engineer, quickly fetched a book of Sanskrit shlokas from the drawer of the small home temple in their Dwarka Sector 8 residence. Soon, a temple priest started reciting some shlokas from the computer screen and the Senguptas followed – often turning pages of the book in Preetha’s hand as they missed a word or two. Around 30 km away in south Delhi’s CR Park -- a hub of prominent Durga Pujas that attract thousands of people every year-- Arindam Sharma and his family followed the rituals in a similar fashion. So did Ritika Mukherjee’s family in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Phase I. Around the same time on Thursday morning, but in different locations across the city, these families and many other devotees participated in pushpanjali – community prayers marked by offering of flowers to the deities during Durga Puja. In other years, pushpanjali is a grand affair with the prominent among the 500-odd Durga Puja venues in the Capital witnessing thousands of visitors, often compelling the organisers to break the gathering into batches and urging the priest to repeat the shlokas several times in a row. Also Read | Caution in the air as Durga Puja begins with symbolic rituals in DelhiThis year the popular pushpanjali ritual went online with the Durga Puja celebrations going low-key in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic and only around 50 organisers in the city getting the district administration’s approval for minimum arrangements (even though gatherings are prohibited). “We did a Facebook live of the pushpanjali ritual today. We will continue doing so till the ceremonies end. In general years, we have to organise seven to eight batches of prayers every day and each batch has around 350-400 devotees. Such gathering could have been a major threat this year,” said Debashis Shah, chief coordinator of the Durga Puja committee at Matri Mandir in Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave Saurav Chakravorty, managing committee member of the CR Park Kali Mandir Durga Puja, said: “The crowd for pushpanjali exceeds 30,000 in our venue in normal years. The number of batches keep varying – depending on the time of the Bhog (food offering to the deities) and the size of the crowd. Under Covid-19 guidelines, no such gathering should happen this time. So, we enabled live streaming through the temple’s website and local cable channels.” On part of the government, a lot has gone into convincing puja committee members to keep the fanfare low-key, several government officials said, adding the last two weeks witnessed scores of meetings with organisers and management committees of religious institutes. “Meetings with more than 70 such associations have been conducted in this regard only to ensure adherence to Covid-19 guidelines during the festivities,” said Neha Bansal, district magistrate (West Delhi). The few organisers who have got permission for Durga Puja this year are following the rituals with smaller idols of the deities or by installing ‘holy urns’ (kalash sthapana) in their premises. There is no room for decorated pandals, cultural programmes, fairs and food courts. Many committees have decided to distribute whatever donations they have received to people worst hit by the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/play-pause-repeat-durga-puja-moves-from-pandals-to-phones/story-ZZTfN8xCvxUdy08wE7HzwO.html
23-10-2020||Delhi||CM Kejriwal will formally open Seelampur, Shastri Park flyovers on Saturday||The much-awaited flyovers at Seelampur and Shastri Park will be thrown open to traffic from Saturday, bringing major relief to residents of east and north-east Delhi as well as those who regularly commute through these areas from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad as they would now be able to escape the congestion on the Grand Trunk (GT) Road. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will inaugurate both flyovers on Saturday at noon, Delhi’s public works department (PWD) minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. The PWD is the executing agency for both projects. “An honest government takes care not just of its citizens, but also of the finances. The estimated project cost of the Seelampur-Shastri Park flyover package was ₹303.31 crore, but the Delhi government has constructed both flyovers at a cost of ₹250 crore. Our PWD managed to save at least ₹53 crore, which is very important in times of a pandemic when the usual sources of revenue for the government are severely hit,” said Jain.PWD officials said the main six-lane flyover constructed on the Grand Trunk (GT) Road in Shastri Park has already been opened to vehicular traffic from Wednesday, That, they said, was done to test the structural stability of the flyover before its formal opening on Saturday. However, the two-lane single flyover at Seelampur will be thrown open to the public only on Saturday.PWD said the two flyovers are likely to cut travel time between Shahdara in east Delhi to Interstate Bus Terminus (ISBT) in Kashmere Gate by at least 10 minutes. At present, because of heavy vehicular movement and rampant road encroachments, multiple bottlenecks are causing snarls on the stretch. Sometimes during peak hours, it takes about 30 to 40 minutes for motorists to cross the stretch, PWD officials said. With the two flyovers now complete, they would provide a signal-free ride between Welcome in north-east Delhi and the Kashmere Gate ISBT — a roughly 8km ride on one of the most congested and traffic-heavy stretches in Delhi. The construction work had started in February 2019 and both flyovers were to be completed by March 2020. But the projects got delayed by the construction ban in November 2019 on account of rising pollution and, later, by the riots in north-east Delhi in February. They were again stalled by the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown that came into effect on March 25. Their deadline was then shifted to July 2020, but work overshot the deadline for want of labour.S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said the flyovers would bring relief to motorists headed to the Kashmere Gate ISBT and parts of Central Delhi from Ghaziabad, north-east and east Delhi. “ People from areas such as Shahdara, Seelampur, Dilshad Garden, Jafrabad and Gandhi Nagar would benefit as they now would be able to escape the congestion on the GT Road,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cm-kejriwal-will-formally-open-seelampur-shastri-park-flyovers-on-saturday/story-Z9HIV0OS4oh3tE9Z0bx5NJ.html
23-10-2020||Delhi||North MCD plans to increase house tax, waive taxes on parking contractors, alleges AAP; all lies, says BJP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation (North MCD) of burdening the public by proposing to increase house tax, while at the same time handing out relaxations to affluent contractors by waiving taxes on management of parking lots. The BJP hit back and termed the AAP’s claims as “mischievous lies”. “Under pressure from parking and advertising contractors, the BJP-ruled North MCD wants to impose a steep 34% house tax burden on the people of Delhi amid the Covid-19 pandemic. A proposal in this regard has been tabled before the standing committee,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs. He further said, “The North MCD proposes to waive the tax on parking and advertisements. North MCD gets crores of rupees as tax from advertising and parking. The BJP should use this money to pay salaries of doctors but they are waiving it off. The AAP opposes these proposals being brought by the BJP-ruled North MCD and demands that the civic body collects tax from parking and advertisement.” The Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “This is a mischievous lie. None of the 3 municipal bodies has approved any proposal to raise property tax in Delhi. As far as relaxation in advertising and parking fee are concerned, they are only for the lockdown period (between April 1 and June 30). This relaxation is being examined as per the standard policy of the central government and Delhi government, to provide relief to businesses that have lost revenue during the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-mcd-plans-to-increase-house-tax-waive-taxes-on-parking-contractors-alleges-aap-all-lies-says-bjp/story-bXKoVxNAXmvynQYi82H8JJ.html

The tunnel will be constructed at a depth of approximately 14 to 16 metres. About 2,040 concrete rings will be installed in these tunnels. Each tunnel will have an inner diameter of 5.8 metres. The entire tunnelling work on this stretch is expected to be completed in about 15 months. The alignment of the tunnel will be along the Outer Ring Road,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Dayal added, “As part of the Phase 4 work approved so far, about 27km of underground tracks will be constructed. The Janakpuri West to RK Ashram Marg corridor will have underground sections running for a length of 7.74km in total.”“These machines are especially useful for tunnelling work in congested urban areas. The DMRC has been using tunnel boring machines since Phase 1 of the Metro network. In Phase 3, when about 50km of underground sections were built, using about 30 tunnel boring machines,” the DMRC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tunnel-boring-machines-lowered-in-vikaspuri-to-start-tunneling-work-for-metro-phase-4/story-rg2PMe5303rfLUupxFGzLJ.html
23-10-2020||Delhi||Two minors sexually assaulted in Delhi, accused known to victims||Two incidents of sexual assault on minors were reported from two different places in Delhi on Wednesday night and in both cases, the suspects were known to the victims.In the first incident, an eight-year-old girl was raped, allegedly by a relative, in northwest Delhi’s Ashok Vihar on Wednesday night. Police have arrested the 25-year-old man. According to the police, the assault was reported around 10 pm when the girl’s parents, both daily wage labourers, saw her crying. When they asked, she reported injuries on her private parts. Police said the girl told her parents that one of their relatives, who lives nearby, had taken her to his house and sexually assaulted her. The parents reported the matter to the police, who took the girl to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial hospital for medical examination. Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said a case of rape under IPC section 376 and under relevant sections of POCSO Act was registered after sexual assault was confirmed. Based on her complaint, the relative, a native of Bihar, also a labourer, was arrested from his house, Arya said. In a separate incident on Wednesday night, a 16-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by a neighbour at Sarai Kale Khan in southeast Delhi. Police said they have been both friends for the past three years.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said the girl sustained a minor injury, which she reported to her mother. Her family members took her to a hospital, where it was confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted. “Since the girl is a minor, the hospital staff reported the matter to the police. Initial probe revealed the girl was with her friend alone when he sexually assaulted her. Her medical condition is stable,”the officer said.

23-10-2020||Delhi||Protesting North MCD doctors warn of hunger strike if unpaid||More than a hundred resident doctors and paramedical staff from three North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run hospitals -- Hindu Rao, Kasturba Gandhi and Rajan Babu Tuberculosis (RBTB) Hospital -- staged a protest at Jantar Mantar Thursday morning -- threatening to go on a hunger strike if their pending salaries were not paid at the earliest. Hindu Rao doctors are on an indefinite strike for the past 12 days while their counterparts from the other two hospitals joined a week ago. Around 250 resident doctors from Hindu Rao had begun a daily three-hour pen down strike from September 22 within the hospital premises. On October 10, they went on a complete indefinite strike to press for their demands. The Hindu Rao resident doctors’ association (RDA) said while they attend to patients at the emergency wing when senior consultants are not available, they have completely withdrawn from the outpatient department services. At Jantar Mantar, the protesters raised slogans against the cash-strapped BJP-ruled municipal corporation, which has been unable to disburse salaries to the medical staff after June this year. Around 500 resident doctors from the three hospitals said they will continue their strike till their dues are paid. Hindu Rao is the largest hospital run by the civic body. According to staffers, the OPD services have been hit at the three hospitals because of the agitation. Corporation officials said while emergency and OPD services have been functional at Hindu Rao and Kasturba, services at RBTB Hospital were affected on Thursday morning and resumed late in the afternoon. The Hindu Rao doctors association said the hospital has stopped taking admissions even in the emergency wing and is referring patients to other facilities. “After we went on an indefinite strike, the hospital has stopped taking any admissions. They cannot run the hospital without the resident doctors. We are just asking for our dues. How are we expected to keep working without being paid for months? How are we supposed to run our houses? We have been on Covid duty, risking our lives and still not being paid,” said Dr Abhimanyu Sardana, president of the Hindu Rao resident doctors association. The 980-bedded Hindu Rao Hospital was removed from the list of designated Covid-19 facilities on October 14 due to low bed occupancy. The Delhi government had on the same day ordered shifting of Covid patients from Hindu Rao to different government facilities. Holding a placard that read ‘I deserve to be paid’, Dr Adhiman Gupta of Kasturba Hospital said doctors are only asking for their basic right. “The central government has been saying doctors are corona warriors but has not taken any cognisance of the same doctors and other staff not being paid for months,” Gupta said. “Everyone has EMIs or rents to pay. We are forced to strike as we have run out of savings...There’s no assurance when we will get our dues,” said Santosh Singh, a nursing staff at Kasturba Hospital. North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said the agitation has become a political gimmick. He said the salaries of doctors for July was disbursed on Wednesday while paramedics have been paid till June. “Only the contractual resident doctors are on strike while all senior doctors are working and providing adequate healthcare services. I have already had a series of discussions with the protesting resident doctors and the paramedic staff. They are taking undue advantage of their rights. I already sought time till November 30 to pay the dues,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-resident-doctors-paramedics-take-protest-over-unpaid-wages-to-jantar-mantar/story-3IVma9V7FIamW2KGv7kmVM.html
23-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Women commuters allowed train travel in MMR during non-peak hours||Women commuters have been allowed to travel by suburban trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) during non-peak hours from Wednesday following a permission granted by the Union Ministry of Railways on the previous day.They are allowed to travel between 11 am and 3 pm and after 7 pm in a bid to prevent overcrowding in suburban trains amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in MMR. Western and Central Railways authorities said women passengers do not need to show their identity cards or scan a quick response (QR) code on their smart phones in their bid to travel by suburban trains. Only their tickets would be checked, they added. Thermal screenings of women passengers will be conducted before entering railway stations. Earlier last Friday, the Maharashtra government had urged the ministry to allow women commuters to travel by suburban trains. However, the ministry had asked the state government to give details of an estimated increase in the number of commuters and other modalities as preventive measures because of the viral outbreak. The back and forth between the state government and the ministry led to a delay for a few days in the grant of permission for women commuters to travel by suburban trains during non-peak hours. The Central and Western Railway authorities operate 706 and 700 local trains, respectively, daily in MMR. The rail authorities had allowed only people from the following categories to use suburban trains after the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from the end of March in a bid to keep the contagion at bay.They included employees, who were at the frontline sector battling the Covid-19 pandemic, differently-abled people and cancer patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-women-commuters-allowed-train-travel-in-mmr-during-non-peak-hours/story-i3FMWUP9AjUs9QDz5OymOM.html

23-10-2020||World||Impressive progress’, claims Pak minister after FATF’s blunt warning on terror financing||Pakistan attempted to claim victory despite being retained on the grey list of FATF, with a minister claiming that the terror financing watchdog has noted its “impressive progress.”The Financial Action Task Force on Friday decided to keep Pakistan on its grey list for four more months, noting that the country could not fully implement a 27-point action plan by the June 2020 deadline given to it.But industries minister Hammad Azhar claimed that Pakistan has achieved “impressive progress” on the FATF action plan. He said that while 21 out of 27 action items now stand cleared, the remaining six are rated as partially complete.Instead of the current action plan, discussions remained focused on how Pakistan can be facilitated “for our upcoming 2nd evaluation, due mid next year,” Azhar tweeted.Local media quoted a statement by FATF saying it “takes note of the significant progress made on a number of action plan items and to date, Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has now largely addressed 21 of the 27 action items.” But it said that “As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021”.The statement added that Pakistan needed to “address its strategic deficiencies”. The deficiencies include demonstrating that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity, which target designated persons and entities, and those who act on the behalf or direction of the designated persons or entities. It also includes demonstrating that terror financing prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-doesn-t-get-off-fatf-greylist-told-it-needs-to-do-more-against-terror/story-TSp3NTTv0rVCmYj9uBeWCJ.htmlAlso included is the need for demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all 1,267 and 1,373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf. This means preventing the raising and moving of funds, including in relation to non-profit organisations, identifying and freezing assets and prohibiting access to funds and financial services.It also includes demonstrating enforcement against violation of terror financing sanctions, including in relation to NPOs, of administrative and criminal penalties and provincial and federal authorities cooperating on enforcement cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impressive-progress-claims-pak-minister-after-fatf-s-blunt-warning-on-terror-financing/story-L4IiiMpDTH6W653hFZvQTJ.html

As I said it in February and I’m repeating it today: This is not a drill.”Tedros said too many countries were now seeing an exponential increase in infections, “and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close or above capacity -- and we’re still only in October”.He said countries should take action to limit the spread of the virus quickly. Improving testing, tracing of contacts of those infected and isolation of those at risk of spreading the virus would enable countries to avoid mandatory lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-who-chief-tedros-says-countries-on-dangerous-track/story-nAxwOQ9VdLSQMLmqIUI3WI.html
23-10-2020||World||US suicide rate fell last year after decade of steady rise||The US suicide rate fell slightly last year, the first annual decline in more than a decade, according to new government data.It’s a small decrease and the data is preliminary, but the decline is “really exciting,” said Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.The fall may be partly due to years of suicide prevention efforts, like increasing mental health screenings, she said. Other factors, like the pre-pandemic economy, might also have played a role, she added.Experts aren’t sure how the coronavirus will influence this year’s suicide numbers, though American mortality overall is looking far bleaker.Suicides had been on the rise since 2005. In 2018, the national suicide rate hit its highest level since 1941 — 14.2 per 100,000 people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted new death rate data this week showing that for 2019, it dropped to 13.9.Drug overdoses rose in 2019, and deaths from falls were up, too. But death rates for the nation’s two biggest killers — heart disease and cancer — were down, as were death rates for flu, chronic lung disease and Alzheimer’s disease. The firearm death rate was flat, probably because the small decline in suicides was offset by a slight uptick in gun homicides.When all that is factored together, the U.S. life expectancy calculation for 2019 should stay the same as it was in 2018 or maybe even increase slightly, said Robert Anderson, who oversees death data for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.“I think 2019 will turn out to be a pretty good year for mortality, relatively speaking,” Anderson said. “2020 will not.” There have been at least 300,000 more deaths this year than expected, the CDC said this week in a separate report. About two-thirds of those are being attributed directly to Covid-19, but many of the others are believed to be related to the pandemic.It’s not yet clear whether suicides are up this year.The pandemic sparked a wave of business closures, some temporary and some permanent. Millions of people were forced to stay at home, many of them alone. Surveys suggest more Americans are reporting depression, anxiety and drug and alcohol use. Adding to that dangerous mix, firearm purchases rose 85% in March, when the virus was first surging.“There are clear forces pressing suicide risk factors in a negative direction,” Moutier said, but that’s doesn’t mean suicide rates will automatically rise.There are some “silver linings” to the pandemic, she added. One is increasing acceptance that mental health distress is normal, and that it’s OK to seek counseling. Another is increasing availability of telemedicine.Anderson noted many Covid-19 deaths have been in the same set of late-middle-aged white people who are considered at high risk for suicide.“It’s possible that the rise in Covid-19 is sort pushing down the suicide rate,” he suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-suicide-rate-fell-last-year-after-decade-of-steady-rise/story-ZTe0mdrqlbIrgCO1aWnXnO.html
23-10-2020||World||US faces half a million Covid-19 deaths by end-February: Study||More than a half million people in the United States could die from Covid-19 by the end of February next year, but around 130,000 of those lives could be saved if everybody were to wear masks, according to estimates from a modelling study.The estimates, from a study by researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, show that with few effective Covid-19 treatment options and no vaccines yet available, the US faces “a continued Covid-19 public health challenge through the winter.” “We are heading into a very substantial fall/winter surge,” said IHME director Chris Murray, who co-led the research.He said the projections, as well as the real-life current evidence of rising infection rates and deaths, showed there is no basis to “the idea that the pandemic is going away,” adding: “We do not believe that is true.”US President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 221,000 Americans so far, has become the top election issue for him and Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Polls have shown that Americans trust Biden more than Trump to handle the crisis.The IHME study forecast that large, populous states such as California, Texas and Florida will likely face particularly high levels of illness, deaths and demands on hospital resources.“We expect the surge to steadily grow across different states and at the national level, and to continue to increase as we head towards high levels of daily deaths in late December and in January,” Murray said.The modelling study, which mapped out various scenarios and their projected impact on the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States, found that universal mask-wearing could have a major impact on deaths rates, potentially saving 130,000 lives.Current mask use in the United States varies widely. While some states, like New York, set strict rules on when to wear masks, others have no requirements. The issue has become political, in which some supporters have taken their cues from Trump, who is often seen without a mask and has repeatedly questioned their usefulness.“Expanding mask use is one of the easy wins for the United States ... and can save many lives,” Murray said.He added that, just as right now in parts of Europe and in some local areas of high transmission in the US, many US states would need to re-introduce social distancing measures to curb the winter surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-faces-half-a-million-covid-19-deaths-by-end-february-study/story-ZNJ9LLRU2hanULjHFN2F8N.html
23-10-2020||World||Sudan to normalise ties with Israel, announces President Donald Trump days before US elections||Sudan on Friday agreed to be the latest Arab nation to recognize Israel in a diplomatic coup announced by President Donald Trump days before US elections.The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed an accord at the White House last month to normalise relations with Israel but Sudan carries added symbolism as an Arab nation that has been at war with Israel.Trump announced the agreement by Sudan’s year-old civilian-backed government moments after he formally moved to end the nation’s designation of a state sponsor of terrorism, which was a major goal for Khartoum.Reporters were escorted into the Oval Office where Trump was on speakerphone with Sudan’s leadership and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close ally of the embattled Republican president.“This truly changes the region. It changes the lives of our peoples for the better and allows us to focus on the task of building our nations, building our future,” Netanyahu was heard telling Trump.Trump said that more Arab states are also looking to recognize Israel including regional power Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s two holiest cities.“We have at least five more that want to come in and we’ll have many more than that soon,” Trump said in a room packed with aides, few of them wearing masks despite the Covid-19 pandemic.Until last month, the only Arab nations to recognize Israel were Jordan and Egypt -- neighbors of the Jewish state that had made peace after US mediation.- Economic boon for Sudan -Both the United States and Israel committed to boosting trade with Sudan, an impoverished, conflict-ridden nation that had faced years of criticism over its violent internal campaigns until the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir last year.In a three-way statement, Sudan and Israel said delegations would met “in the coming weeks to negotiate agreements of cooperation” including in agriculture issues, aviation and migration.“The leaders agreed to the normalization of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,” it said, without setting a date.As part of the deal to get off the terror blacklist, the White House said that Sudan’s transitional government had deposited $335 million to compensate survivors and family members of anti-US attacks that took place when Bashir’s regime welcomed Al-Qaeda.Sudan’s civilian prime minister, Abdulla Hamdok, thanked Trump over the terror designation without mentioning recognition of Israel -- a step he had earlier said he was not empowered to take.“This decision will open wide the door to Sudan’s deserved return to the international community and the international financial and banking sector, as well as to regional and international investment,” Hamdok’s office said in a statement that did not mention ties with Israel.But Sudanese TV later said Sudan had in fact agreed to end the state of war with Israel and normalize ties.Also on the telephone call was Sudan’s top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who met Netanyahu earlier this year in Uganda.- Historic step -Trump had announced his plan to delist Sudan on Monday through Twitter. But in the days before he formally took the move, Israel sent a delegation to Khartoum to discuss normalization.Trump, who is trailing in the polls ahead of the November 3 vote, has used his leverage over Sudan to press for recognition of Israel.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo voiced hope on Wednesday that Sudan would “promptly” recognize the Jewish state -- a major cause for Trump’s evangelical Christian base.Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates had long enjoyed quiet relations with Israel but a move by Sudan is especially significant in light of the nation’s history.Sudan played a small part in Arab-Israeli wars and, after Israel’s decisive victory in 1967, Khartoum was where the Arab League issued its famous “three no’s” -- no peace, no recognition and no negotiations with Israel.Sudan has been seeking for years to remove the designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, which severely impedes investment as few foreign businesses want to risk the wrath of US prosecution.With Trump’s formal move, Congress has 45 days in which it can pass a resolution to object to the delisting.Congress is not expected to block the delisting but it must also approve legislation to grant Sudan immunity from further claims.Until then, the $335 million will be held in an escrow account.The money includes compensation to survivors and family members of those killed in Al-Qaeda’s twin attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-to-normalize-ties-with-israel-announces-president-donald-trump-days-before-us-elections/story-R1DNWZdwPcYlyAoKKEutvK.html

Officials of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) made the comments two days after issuing a warning about the lockdown and calling for better compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to the coronavirus disease.According to Dawn, the forum said in a statement that the positivity ratio had risen for the fifth consecutive day -- average positivity rate is 40 per cent higher during the last four days -- and that Covid-19 deaths were also increasing.“It was also noted that Muzaffarabad, Hyderabad, Karachi and Gilgit-Baltistan have a higher positivity ratio along with other areas across the country,” Dawn said quoting the statement.The statement said hospital admissions are also on the increase particularly in Punjab and there is also an increase in the number of critical patients at hospitals. “The death ratio in Punjab was 1.6 on September 1 and has now gone up to six. Meanwhile, the province’s positivity ratio has increased from 0.92 to 1.33,” the statement said.An analysis of the fatality rate showed that Pakistan’s figure stood at 2.06% as compared to the global 2.72%. “[In Pakistan] Men account for 71pc of the total deaths. Of these, 76pc are over the age of 50,” NCOC said.According to data collected by Dawn.com, Punjab and Islamabad have reported more than 100 cases for the past four days. Punjab has also seen an increase in the number of deaths during the past few days.NCOC had warned on Wednesday that it would close down services across the country once again if people continued to flout SOPs issued to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. “NCOC is closely monitoring the situation. If there is no improvement in SOPs compliance observed, NCOC will have no choice but to revert to strict measures leading to re-closures of services,” NCOC had said in a statement that day.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan had said earlier in the week that he feared a second wave of Covid-19 in the coming months in cities where pollution levels are high. “I fear that in these two months — October and November [...] cities like Faisalabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Gujranwala where there is more pollution [...] there might be a second spike in coronavirus cases. The cases are rising gradually and we hope that they don’t increase quickly; we are monitoring it,” he told participants at an award ceremony.Pakistan has 324,744 cases of coronavirus disease and 6,692 people have succumbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-covid-19-situation-worsens-authorities-say-all-parameters-in-the-red/story-BveSaH4k5a4SGo2HaYVwEN.html

There is a communication blackout. How can we have talks in such an atmosphere?” He said that India needs to rethink its decision of removing the special status for Jammu and Kashmir.“Only then can we have talks,” he said adding that the Indian action has been rejected both by Pakistan and the people of Kashmir. “India’s stance on Kashmir has suffered because of its actions.”He told reporters that when Prime Minister Imran Khan assumed office, he had proposed talks but these were rejected by India. “Now given the situation in Kashmir, we cannot give talks priority.” India, he said, has to review its one-sided decisions.He also said India’s plans to “push Pakistan into the blacklist” of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will fail because of the steps the country had taken to meet the requirements of the global watchdog on money laundering and terrorist financing.His comments came as a plenery meeting of FATF on Friday voted to keep Pakistan in its ‘grey list’ of countries whose controls over terrorism financing are deemed inadequate.“I can say this with confidence, India will fail in its designs to push Pakistan into the blacklist,” Qureshi said, adding that the world had “acknowledged” that the government and parliament had taken “concrete steps” regarding the FATF’s action plan.Of the 27 points on which the FATF had asked Pakistan to take action, “I can say with conviction we have implemented 21,” the minister said.

23-10-2020||World||US says no justification for Uighur ‘concentration camps’ in China||The deputy White House national security adviser on Friday denounced China’s treatment of Uighur Muslims, saying there was no justification for the country maintaining “concentration camps” within its borders.Matt Pottinger, who has been a leading figure in the development of President Donald Trump’s China policy, made the remark in Mandarin in an online address to the UK-based Policy Exchange think tank.“There is no credible justification I can find in Chinese philosophy, religion, or moral law for the concentration camps inside your borders,” Pottinger said in his speech, which he said was directed to the Chinese people.It represented a further ratcheting up of American rhetoric against China in the run-up to the Nov. 3 US presidential election, in which Trump, a Republican, has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.Last week, Pottinger’s boss, US national security adviser Robert O’Brien, said China was perpetrating “something close to” genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.Pottinger called on people in China “to research the truth about your government’s policy towards the Uighur people and other religious minorities.”He said they should ask themselves why The Economist newspaper had called China’s actions in Xinjiang “a crime against humanity.”The United States has denounced China’s treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses.It has not, though, so far termed Beijing’s actions genocide or crimes against humanity, designations that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang, and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.Pottinger said there was a growing consensus internationally about the need to take a more assertive stance with Beijing.He said that in a second term, Trump would continue working to diversify supply chains to avoid excessive reliance on one country - an apparent reference to China’s dominance of critical supplies laid bare at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.Pottinger spoke after China’s President Xi Jinping delivered a speech on the 70th anniversary of Chinese troops entering the Korean War to fight against US troops, in which he warned that China will never allow its sovereignty, security and development interests to be undermined.Xi did not directly refer to the present-day United States, with which relations have sunk to their lowest in decades over disputes ranging from trade and technology to human rights and the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-no-justification-for-uighur-concentration-camps-in-china/story-t3Pqe62PTXOSDYl0g99TTI.html
23-10-2020||World||Erdogan confirms Russian S-400 tests despite US objections||Turkey’s president on Friday confirmed the country tested its Russian-made S-400 missile defense system, despite objections from the United States.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had every right to test its equipment.“America’s stance is absolutely not binding for us,” he said. “We aren’t going to ask America.”Washington has strongly objected to NATO member Turkey’s acquisition of the Russian anti-aircraft system and suspended Turkey from its F-35 fighter jet program, saying the S-400s are a threat to the stealth fighter jets and wouldn’t be interoperable with NATO systems.It has also warned Ankara that it risks U.S. sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act if the S-400 system is activated.Ankara insists it was forced to purchase the Russian system after Washington refused to sell it the US Patriot system. It also argues that it’s Ankara’s sovereign right to buy the system it wants.Erdogan also suggested a double standard, saying NATO member Greece was using its S-300 missile defense system. He asked: “Is America telling them anything?”Russia delivered the Russian defense system last year. Turkey had initially said the S-400 would be operational in April, but it has since delayed activating the system. Turkish media reported last week the military test-fired the Russian S-400 air defense system in the Black Sea province of Sinop.“This means that the gentlemen are disturbed especially because this is a weapon belonging to Russia,” Erdogan said. “We are determined, we will continue on our path.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-confirms-russian-s-400-tests-despite-us-objections/story-XaQBX8wpIpGC6D7ndZEihN.html
23-10-2020||World||20 Afghan army personnel killed in Taliban attack in Nimroz||At least 20 members of the Afghan National Army (ANA) were killed in a Taliban attack on their outpost in Khashrod district, Nimroz province, on Thursday said the district governor of Khashrod.According to Tolo News, the district governor said that six others were taken hostage by the Taliban. However, the official did not provide any details on the attack.There have been no comments made by the Defence Ministry, so far. The latest incident comes in wake of an increase in violence across the country despite the ongoing peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghanistan Government in Doha.On Thursday, the Ministry of Defence said that the Taliban terrorists have expanded their attacks to 24 provinces in the last 24 hours that include Takhar, Helmand, Uruzgan, Kunduz, Baghlan, Laghman, Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, Logar, Maidan Wardak, Kandahar, Zabul, Herat, Farah, Badghis, Faryab, Sar-e-Pul and Badakhshan provinces.The Defence Ministry said that on Wednesday night in Takhar province an Afghan Air Force strike killed “12 Taliban including several of their commanders,” as reported by Tolo News.It further reported that the airstrike was conducted in the “Hazara Qarluq” village of Baharak district, according to the statement adding that during a clash between “these Taliban” and the ANP on Monday, a “number of our police” were killed.At least four civilians were killed and 10 others were injured in a mortar attack in northern Faryab province on Thursday morning, local officials said.On Wednesday, the Taliban “destroyed” an electricity pylon that brings power to Herat province the office of Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) in Herat said. The incident took place in the Kalat-e-Ghazi village in Ghoryan district.The Takhar’s deputy police chief Raz Mohammad Doorandish and nearly 50 security force members were killed in clashes with the Taliban in the province on Tuesday night, the local officials said on Wednesday. “47 people (security forces members) were killed, and three or four others were wounded,” said Amir Mohammad Khaksar, an MP from Takhar, adding that “the casualties will increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-afghan-army-personnel-killed-in-taliban-attack-in-nimroz/story-BFzboBme1SQuFwNlXXI3vK.html
23-10-2020||World||FATF dashes Pak hopes of getting out of grey list, then a harsh rebuke||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the world’s top anti-terrorism monitoring group, on Friday voted to keep Pakistan on a grey list for the Imran Khan government’s failure to fully comply with a 27-point action plan handed to it, people familiar with the matter said.The global watchdog’s decision comes as a huge setback for PM Khan who had made efforts in the run-up to the virtual meeting of the FATF plenary to get his country off-the-hook including hiring a top lobbyist firm on Capitol Hill to push its narrative. The FATF, however, didn’t let Pakistan’s status change, mostly in view of Pakistan’s inability to substantially deliver on 6 of the 27 action points.The “grey list” comprises countries whose controls over terrorism financing are deemed inadequate.The FATF noted that Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has largely addressed 21 of the 27 action items. “As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021,” the watchdog said.A person familiar with the development said the watchdog had noted progress made by Pakistan to address the technical compliance deficiencies but rebuked Islamabad for slippages on other parameters and asked it to do more.India, which bears the brunt of Pakistan’s use of terrorism as an instrument of diplomacy, had set the tone ahead of Friday’s meeting, roasting Islamabad for continuing to be a safe haven for UN Security Council designated terrorists such as Jaish-e-Mohammed chief MasoodAzhar, Lashkar-e-Taiba operations commander Zakirur Rahman Lakhvi and Dawood Ibrahim.New Delhi had also counted 3,800 unprovoked ceasefire violations along the ceasefire line in an effort to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir, drop arms and smuggle weapons and narcotics across the international boundary using drones.Pakistan was placed on the watchdog’s grey list in June 2018 after red flags were raised over its consistent failure to act against terrorist groups and plug the gaping holes in its legal framework to punish them. It has since then periodically taken some steps to demonstrate that it is making efforts.But it has been criticised for rolling back the changes when it could. Like when it expanded the “proscribed persons data” in its Punjab province to include 7,600 names in 2018 to persuade FATF to not place Islamabad in the black list. This year, Castellum.AI, a US-based tech firm that tracks watch lists globally, noticed that Pakistan had quietly erased some 3,800 names from this list.PM Imran Khan’s inability to pull his country out of the grey list is also seen as a failure of its diplomacy since it needed the support of 12 countries to back up its narrative that Pakistan should be given a reprieve since it was on its way to fulfill its commitments to fight terror funding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-doesn-t-get-off-fatf-greylist-told-it-needs-to-do-more-against-terror/story-TSp3NTTv0rVCmYj9uBeWCJ.html
23-10-2020||World||Pak’s anti-corruption body slaps fresh graft case on Nawaz Sharif||Pakistan’s anti-corruption body has slapped a fresh corruption case on deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif, compounding the legal woes of the embattled Opposition leader who has frequently attacked the powerful military as well as the government. Sharif, the 70-year-old supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) who was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court on corruption charges, is currently in London for medical treatment. The National Accountability Bureau also approved cases against Sharif’s ex-personal secretary Fawad Hasan Fawad, former federal minister Ahsan Iqbal, former foreign secretary Aizaz Chaudhry and former Intelligence Bureau (IB) chief Aftab Sultan, Dawn newspaper reported. On Thursday, a total of 11 cases were approved at NAB’s Executive Board Meeting (EBM) presided over by its chairman, retired Justice Javed Iqbal. According to the NAB, a fresh case was approved against Sharif along with Chaudhry, Sultan and Fawad for “illegally” purchasing 73 high-security vehicles for the security of foreign dignitaries. They are accused of favouritism and illegal use of vehicles, causing a loss of over Rs 1,952 million to the national exchequer. The EBM also approved a case against Ahsan Iqbal and Mohammad Ahmed, contractor/owner of private firm Ahmed and Sons, for increasing the scope of the Sports City project in Narowal from Rs 30 million to Rs 3 billion by “abusing the authority”. They are accused of illegally providing the funds of the federal government to provincial government projects after the 18th Amendment by using personal influence, which inflicted huge losses on the national exchequer. The case against Iqbal was approved two days after he had said in a private TV talk show that the NAB had been investigating the Narowal Sports City case against him for the last two-and-a-half years but did not file a reference. Sharif is already facing several cases of corruption and misuse of authority which he has declared as a result of political vendetta by the current government led by Prime Minister Khan. The approval of fresh cases followed a recent speech by Prime Minister Khan that the Opposition would see a “different Imran Khan”, which was interpreted as a threat to arrest more opposition leaders and court cases. Apart from Sharif and his close aides, the NAB approved cases worth billions of rupees of alleged corruption against several officials and businessmen for causing losses to the country in different projects. Sharif criticised the military establishment in recent speeches at gatherings of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement. Days before the July 2018 general elections, Sharif was convicted in the Avenfield properties case and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His daughter Maryam was sentenced to seven years in prison for abetment and his son-in-law Captain (retd) Mohammad Safdar to one year.Also Read | Pakistan police briefly detain Nawaz Sharif’s son-in-law In December 2018, anti-corruption court judge Arshad Malik convicted Sharif in Al-Azizia Steel Mills case and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Judge Malik was later dismissed from service over misconduct. The IHC later granted bail to Sharif, Maryam and Safdar. Sharif, after his conviction in the Al-Azizia case, was sent to jail but released for eight weeks on medical grounds. The bail-granting order lapsed while the former premier was in London. The IHC had in September fixed the appeals against conviction of Sharif in Al-Azizia and Avenfield cases. After hearing the pleas, the court rejected Sharif’s applications seeking hearing in absentia and issued his non-bailable arrest warrants. The court then issued his proclamation giving the former premier final opportunity to join the proceeding before confiscating his properties. Separately, an accountability court in Islamabad has already confiscated movable and immovable properties of Sharif because he absconded in the Toshakhana case, which is about alleged corruption in purchase of vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-s-anti-corruption-body-slaps-fresh-graft-case-on-nawaz-sharif/story-5JxGtCwBZVmB8WBsC8cMIP.html
23-10-2020||World||UK project detects Covid-19 traces in sewage||Traces of coronavirus have been detected in sewage in a UK government-led project, providing an early warning to health professionals for outbreaks in local areas or institutions across the country.The project’s results can provide local health professionals with a clearer picture of infection rates by identifying where there are high numbers, particularly for asymptomatic carriers and before people start showing symptoms, , officials said. The project has worked successfully in an area in south-west England, where sewage sampling data showed a spike in coronavirus material despite relatively low numbers of people seeking tests. The results alerted local health professionals and people warned of a spike.Testing has now been rolled out across more than 90 wastewater treatment sites in the UK, covering approximately 22% of the population in England, with plans to expand in the future, the officials added.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “This is a significant step forward in giving us a clearer idea of infection rates both nationally and locally, particularly in areas where there may be large numbers of people who aren’t showing any symptoms and therefore aren’t seeking tests.”In another project, officials said the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control identified coronavirus material in London sewage in February, before any cases were recorded in the area, providing further evidence of the effectiveness of wastewater monitoring to detect infection rates. High levels of virus material were detected in March and April followed by a considerable decrease in May and June, reflecting the impact of national lockdown measures on virus transmission.According to the World Health Organization, the likelihood of coronavirus being transmitted via sewage systems is extremely low or negligible, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-project-detects-covid-19-traces-in-sewage/story-Vn5kaL0h4OwumppeNG1w2K.html
23-10-2020||World||China not committed to curbing terrorism but using Pak as tool against India: Report||Pakistan appears to be counting on China to diplomatically shield Islamabad from accountability for its terror activities while Beijing’s desire is to use terrorism as a tool to counter India, according to Public Policy Researcher Michael Rubin.In an opinion piece for The Washington Examiner, Rubin said, “Beijing appears less committed to counterterrorism and more to a desire to use Pakistani terrorism as a tool to harass India with whom it is locked in a border clash in Ladakh.”“The reality of both great power competition and China’s efforts to undermine and replace the post-World War II liberal order is that they occur on a number of fronts. Increasingly, it appears the FATF is one of them. Rather than make substantial reforms, Pakistani officials appear to be counting on the fact that China will go to bat for them diplomatically and shield Pakistan from accountability,” he added.This statement comes ahead of the conclusion of the plenary meeting of FATF, which is expected to take a decision on Pakistan’s compliance of the action plan and whether it will remain in Grey List or Black List.The global money-laundering and terror-financing watchdog, is holding its plenary session from October 21 will decide the fate of Pakistan.Talking about the meeting (last month) between Chinese Envoy Yao Jing with Pakistan’s special adviser for finance, Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, Rubin said: “both the representatives reportedly talked far less about FATF commitments and more about the USD 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), whose success depends on Pakistan’s economic solvency and its escape from accountability to the FATF.”He further said China’s vote on Pakistan’s FATF status on Friday will show how Beijing subordinates the “liberal order” for its “narrow interests.”“...China’s action and the Friday vote on the question of Pakistan’s FATF status will be as much about countering terror finance as they are about whether China will use its membership in yet another international body to corrupt it beyond recognition, the goal being to subordinate the liberal order to Beijing’s narrow interests,” he said.Early this month, the FATF’s Asia Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering has kept Pakistan on “Enhanced Follow-up List” for its slow progress on the technical recommendations of the FATF to fight terror financing. Pakistan’s progress has remained unchanged -- non-compliant on four counts.The three-day plenary meeting will conclude on Friday. The country is in FATF’s grey-list since 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-not-committed-to-curbing-terrorism-but-using-pak-as-tool-against-india-report/story-JtD8ZlosyaR9krSTodIPUL.html

The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America,” remarked Biden .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pours-fuel-on-racist-fires-says-biden-as-two-presidential-candidates-spar-over-racism/story-zAwNqJkAZzKQBs4CKZwHLM.html
23-10-2020||World||Donald Trump seizes on Joe Biden’s oil comment to warn swing state voters||President Donald Trump during Thursday’s debate seized on Joe Biden’s pledge of eventually replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, turning the Democratic nominee’s remarks into a warning for swing state voters that oil and gas jobs could be at risk.Biden’s comment came in response to a question from Trump during Thursday’s debate in Nashville about whether he would shut down the oil industry. The former vice president, in one of his starkest comments of the campaign on the issue, said “I would transition from the oil industry, yes.”“The oil industry pollutes significantly,” Biden said. “It has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.”That response carries risk for Biden heading into the final days of the race. For weeks, Biden has been wooing voters in Pennsylvania with assurances that his pledges to ban fracking are limited to federal land and would not amount to a wholesale destruction of the oil and gas sector. He plans to campaign there Saturday.Trump seized on Biden’s remark.“Basically what he is saying is he would destroy the oil industry,” Trump said. “Would you remember that Texas? Would you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma, Ohio?”Trump, meanwhile, sought to portray himself as an oil industry saviour, boasting about his efforts in the spring to broker a global crude output cut as the coronavirus pandemic collapsed fuel demand.“We saved our oil industry,” Trump boasted, and it’s “vibrant.”Trump was trying to recreate a moment in 2020 that he used to advantage in 2016, when Hillary Clinton said, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”Biden’s climate plan aims to remove greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. electricity generation by 2035 , a target that favours emission-free wind, solar, and nuclear power, while leaving little room for natural gas-fired power plants, unless they are outfitted with expensive carbon-capture technology.After the debate, Biden sought to downplay his on-stage comment, emphasizing that the fossil fuel industry wouldn’t “be gone” until 2050, and that oil workers are “not going to lose their jobs.” Instead, he stressed, his plan would mean “a lot more jobs are going to be created in other alternatives.”“But we’re not going to get rid of fossil fuels for a long time,” he told reporters as he prepared to depart Nashville.Two Democrats in toss-up races distanced themselves from the comments.Representative Kendra Horn, the incumbent in an Oklahoma swing district President Trump carried in 2016, and Xochitl Torres Small, who’s in a toss-up race in New Mexico, both took exception to what Biden said.“Here’s one of the places Biden and I disagree,” Horn wrote. “We must stand up for our oil and gas industry.”Environmentalists came to Biden’s defense.“We absolutely agree, we need a just and equitable managed decline of oil and gas production to achieve our climate goals,” said Rebecca Concepcion Apostol, national program director of Oil Change U.S. “We look forward to working with an eventual Biden administration to ensure we phase-out oil production in line with what the climate demands while centering the workers and communities impacted by that transition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-seizes-on-joe-biden-s-oil-comment-to-warn-swing-state-voters/story-LUKggad0VBKT9Yyuff5GeM.html

Motegi pointed out that the signing came about in just four and a half months since the start of negotiations and said, “This is a manifestation of the determination of Japan and the United Kingdom to carry on vigorously promoting free trade”. Britain has said the deal meant 99% of its exports to Japan would be tariff free, and that it could increase trade by 15.2 billion pounds ($19.9 billion) in the long run, compared with 2018.The deal removes Britain’s tariffs on Japanese cars in stages to zero in 2026, which is the same as in the Japan-EU trade agreement.Motegi said after the signing that he had agreed with Truss to work together so that the deal will come into force on January 1, 2021. He also said Japan welcomes Britain’s interest in joining the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) free trade deal, and intends to provide necessary support.Japan is already a member of the CPTPP, which also links Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-signs-first-major-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-japan/story-lXxmA6OJPG0ZIy7se6vTrI.html

23-10-2020||World||Opposition fears of autocracy as Sri Lankan President gains more powers||Sri Lankan lawmakers approved amendments to the constitution that strengthened the powers of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and took away parliament’s role in making key appointments such as judges and the police chief.The new amendments were passed by parliament late on Thursday with a two-thirds majority after a raucous two-day debate.Rajapaksa, a former defence chief who oversaw the military defeat of Tamil separatists a decade ago, swept to power last November and has since consolidated control.In August, his party and its allies overwhelmingly won a parliamentary election on an election plank that included doing away with a previous constitutional amendment in 2015 that had put more power in the legislature’s hands.The government has argued that strengthening the president’s powers was required for better governance. Under the new law, Sri Lanka’s president will have the power to dissolve the 225-member legislature any time after it crosses the half-way mark of its five-year term.Opposition groups have criticised the amendments, and some wore red arm-bands in protest in parliament during the debate.Harsha de Silva, an opposition lawmaker from the capital city Colombo, said the Rajapaksa administration was pushing Sri Lanka in the direction of an autocracy. “I voted against (the bill) to protect democracy in Sri Lanka,” Silva said in a tweet.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based think-tank Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the amendments are meant to be temporary with a new constitution proposed within six months.But till a new constitution or further amendments are enacted, power will remain concentrated with Rajapaksa with limited checks and balances, he said.“It is extremely dangerous,” Saravanamuttu said.The influential Rajapaksa family has tightened its grip over Sri Lankan politics in recent years. After the August win, Gotabaya appointed his older brother Mahinda Rajapaksa - himself a former president - as prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opposition-fears-of-autocracy-as-sri-lankan-president-gains-more-powers/story-hJfcspUpgo0By5ZcLknb8M.html
23-10-2020||World||Joe Biden frames race as battle for character of US||Democrat Joe Biden is framing the election as a battle over the character of the nation, a reiteration of one of his major campaign themes.Speaking directly to the audience during Thursday night’s debate, Biden told them they’re familiar with both his and President Donald Trump’s character, their “reputations for honor” and “reputations for telling the truth.” He went on to declare that “our character is on the ballot.”His comments came in response to Trump’s declaration that he ran because Biden and President Barack Obama “did a poor job.”Trump responded that if his unfounded charges that Biden has received money from Russia and Ukraine are true, Biden himself is a “corrupt politician,” while Biden said the evidence for such allegations is a “Russian plant.”Trump immediately dismissed Biden’s charges, declaring, “You have to be kidding me. Here we go again with Russia.”Joe Biden and Donald Trump clashed on race relations, as the former Vice President called the current President “one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history.”Biden said Trump “pours fuel on every racist fire” and noted that at his last debate the president wouldn’t condemn white supremacy and told an extremist group to “stand down and stand by.”Trump portrayed himself as a champion of Black people. Repeating his standard line that no president other than Abraham Lincoln has done more for Black Americans, Trump accused Biden and former President Barack Obama of ignoring issues of racial justice.Trump told Biden: “You’ve done nothing but the crime bill which put tens of thousands of Black men in jail.”Biden said he’s been trying to change drug sentencing laws that disproportionately harmed African Americans and that the public knows his record.Trump, touting criminal justice reform and opportunity zone bills he signed, said: “I am the least racist person in this room.”Joe Biden invited the owners of a small Zimbabwean restaurant in North Carolina , Zweli and Leonardo Williams, to Thursday night’s debate to underscore the impact President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic has had on average Americans.The choice highlights the significance of North Carolina, a heavily contested battleground state that could help deliver Biden a win.President Donald Trump defended his administration’s separation of immigrant children who remain away from their families following detentions along the US-Mexico border.Trump said during Thursday’s debate that children are often brought across the border not by families but “by coyotes and lots of bad people.”The American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) told a judge this week that there were still 545 children separated from their parents from 2018.Trump said his administration had constructed more than 400 miles of his promised border barrier. He also said, “They built cages,” referring to Obama-era facilities depicted in media reports during the separations.Joe Biden disputed Trump’s answer, saying kids “were ripped from” their families in 2018.As he has done since the primary campaign, Biden defended the Obama administration’s immigration policy, admitting that it “took too long to get it right.”Former Vice President Joe Biden also said he would push for a $15 per hour minimum wage and rejects the idea that it would hurt small businesses.Biden said at Thursday’s debate: “There is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business.”President Donald Trump argued that the minimum wage should be left as an issue for the states to determine, “How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees.”The two candidates were asked about where they stand on raising the federal minimum wage as part of their final debate Thursday night. The minimum wage is now $7.25 an hour. Proponents of increasing it say the minimum wage has not kept up with inflation, making it harder for workers to make ends meet.Trump told moderator Kristen Welker on Thursday evening: “So far I respect very much the way you are handling this, I have to say.”The praise for Welker comes after Trump attacked her on Twitter over the weekend.She has “always been terrible and unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters,” he tweeted at the time.Trump has repeatedly fought with, belittled or denigrated members of the media during his tenure in office.That included CBS New correspondent Lesley Stahl, with whom the president bickered repeatedly during an interview for “60 Minutes,” which he abruptly cut off.Trump complained that the interview was unfair and released footage of it earlier Thursday.Former Vice President Joe Biden said any country that interferes in American elections will pay a price if he’s elected, saying, “They are interfering with American sovereignty.”The first debate between Trump and Biden deteriorated into bitter taunts and chaos after Trump repeatedly interrupted his opponent with angry and personal jabs.In an effort to curtail interruptions this time, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that Trump and Biden would each have his microphone cut off while his rival delivered an opening two-minute answer to each of six debate topics.Trump had been far more restrained during Thursday’s debate in Nashville, Tennessee.In a contrast to the first debate, the two presidential contenders went more than 15 minutes before interrupting each other at Thursday night’s debate. Helped by a rule that switched off the microphone for the candidate who was not talking, the two traded sharp barbs and critiques, but at least kept their voices lowered.Trump insisted he had done a good job with a worldwide pandemic and said the country needs to “learn to live with it.”Biden shot back: “People are learning to die with it.”Regardless, it was a markedly less bombastic opening than in the first debate, when Trump frequently interrupted and shouted over Biden. The president seemed fairly calm Thursday, talking about his own recent bout with the virus as an example of how the country can survive it. The candidates took coronavirus tests Thursday, and both campaigns said they came back negative.Hundreds of people were gathered on sidewalks outside the site of the final presidential debate to show their support for the candidates.Cars honked and slowed down Thursday evening to check out the scene just outside Belmont University’s campus in Nashville, Tennessee.Most of the attendees appeared to be wearing masks, though some proudly declared they would not while holding flags supporting President Donald Trump.Julie Ford, who lives in Greenbrier, Tennessee, says she hopes the candidates spend more time talking about what they would do over the next four years.She says, “I know what Donald Trump plans to do and I know what Joe Biden’s website plans to do.” But she says Biden “never gets questioned (on) what his future will look like.”She says she travelled to Cleveland for the first debate to show her support for Trump.The White House chief of staff said President Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus ahead of Thursday night’s second and final presidential debate.Mark Meadows said Trump was tested on-board Air Force One while en route to Nashville, Tennessee, and tested negative.Biden’s campaign said Thursday that he, too, was tested Thursday and tested negative.The test comes after Trump’s bout with the virus, which put him in the hospital for three nights.Both campaigns had been required to certify that their candidates and VIP guests have tested negative ahead of the debates. But Trump and the White House have repeatedly refused to say whether Trump actually was tested before participating in the first.Trump was diagnosed with the virus two days later.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he has tested negative for Covid-19 ahead of his debate with President Donald Trump.Last week during a town hall style interview on MSNBC, Trump did not specify when he was asked when he had been tested before the Sept. 29 debate. The White House announced two days later Trump had tested positive. Trump spent three nights at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center before returning to the White House.The White House was asked Thursday morning whether Trump had been tested, as Biden was, in preparation for the debate. It has not released an update.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-frames-race-as-battle-for-character-of-us/story-fU7htNuJOpffQss1DC1X2I.html
23-10-2020||World||Joe Biden demands Trump reveal tax returns, asks what he’s hiding||President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden traded charges of secretly taking money from foreign interests, after the former vice president addressed head-on Trump’s efforts to portray him as corrupt.Biden, declaring he had never accepted a foreign payment, noted that Trump has never publicly released his tax returns. He pointed at the president and demanded: “What are you hiding?”Unlike their first debate, in which Trump repeatedly talked over Biden and the former vice president called his opponent a “clown” and told him to “shut up,” the candidates initially complied with rules of the debate that called for them to allow each other time to speak.Biden showed he had anticipated that Trump would try to advance allegations that the former vice president is corrupt. Before the debate, Trump’s campaign introduced a man to reporters travelling with the president, Tony Bobulinski, who claimed without evidence to have discussed a business venture in China with the former vice president and his son, Hunter.Biden raised the topic before Trump, accusing the president and his associates of promoting Russian disinformation in unsubstantiated allegations about his Hunter Biden’s business dealings.“We are in a situation where foreign countries are trying to interfere in the outcome of our election,” Biden said. “His buddy Rudy Giuliani, he’s being used as a Russian pawn.”Trump responded by falsely accusing Biden of accepting $3.5 million from Russia. A report by Senate Republicans in September alleged that Biden’s son, Hunter, received a payment of $3.5 million from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.“I have not taken a penny from any foreign source in my life,” Biden said. Pointing his finger at the president, he said: “You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding?”“The foreign countries are paying you a lot,” Biden said. “Russia’s paying out a lot. China’s paying you a lot. And your hotels and businesses all around the country, all around the world.”Trump responded that Russia was “paying you a lot of money” when it invaded Ukraine under the Obama administration “and they probably still are.” Bobulinski, who told reporters before the debate that he had spoken with Biden and his son about a Chinese business venture that didn’t get off the ground, “was damning,” Trump said.Bobulinksi’s alleged relationship with the Bidens could not be immediately verified, he didn’t provide substantiation for his claims, and he didn’t take questions from reporters.“Release your tax returns or stop talking about corruption,” Biden said.“I called my accountants. Under audit,” Trump responded. “I’m going to release them as soon as I can, I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is.”He continued: “I don’t make money from China, you do. I don’t make money from Ukraine, you do.”Neither men provided specific substantiation for their claims that the other had received foreign payments, though Biden cited New York Times reporting on information about Trump’s taxes the paper has obtained.Biden opened their final debate by blaming Trump for the deaths of more than 220,000 Americans in the coronavirus pandemic, saying the president doesn’t deserve re-election.“Anyone who’s responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America,” Biden said. “We’re about to go into a dark winter. A dark winter. And he has no clear plan.”Biden said he would encourage all Americans to wear masks, contrasting himself with Trump, who has seldom covered his face before or after contracting Covid-19 himself. Trump defended his response to the pandemic to begin the debate, saying that spikes in cases in states including Florida and Texas have come down, his administration has directed the production of ample medical supplies, and the country is “rounding the turn.”“I was in the hospital. I had it. I got better,” Trump said. “More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a world-wide problem. I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do.”Trump accused Biden of supporting further economic shutdowns that have crushed the US economy. “We can’t close up our nation or we’re not going to have a nation,” he said.Biden’s campaign had said he was ready for a confrontation at Thursday’s debate with Trump, as the incumbent had said he would attempt to steer the discussion to allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden. But in the opening minutes, the two candidates engaged in a traditional debate over the coronavirus pandemic without resorting to personal attacks.However, at rallies and in interviews before the debate, Trump has made clear that he intends to focus the forum on airing allegations that Hunter Biden engaged in corrupt practices in Ukraine and China, claims that the president says the media is ignoring.The 90-minute debate is one of the last potential turning points of the 2020 election. Political consultants from both parties called their first debate in September a disaster, after Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden and the former vice president called the president a “clown” and told him to “shut up.”Trump slid in public polls after the episode. More than 47 million Americans have already voted in the election, giving the president less opportunity to change perceptions in his final toe-to-toe match-up with Biden.Trump backed out of what was supposed to be their second debate after the commission changed it to a virtual format because of the president’s recovery from Covid-19.The topics for Thursday’s debate are: the coronavirus, “American families”, racial issues, climate change, national security and leadership, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates.Trump will need to tamp down his aggressive posture from the first encounter, which polls by broadcast networks showed repelled viewers, and make the case for a second term, a line of argument he has struggled with in the past.Biden, who is ahead by nearly 8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, has to avoid any debate defining gaffes that change the status quo. And he needs to minimize reactions to Trump’s provocations.As he left Wilmington for the debate site in Nashville, Biden said he hoped that the encounter wouldn’t be a repeat of the chaotic first debate in late September and that Trump would follow guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19.“Hopefully he’s going to play by the rules. Hopefully everybody’s been tested. Hopefully it’s all been worked out what the rules are. We’re looking forward to it,” Biden said.The debate, at Belmont University, will have one twist after Trump talked over Biden repeatedly during the last face-off, in Cleveland. Moderators will now mute the candidates while the other gives his initial two-minute response on each topic.After the second debate was cancelled, the two candidates instead held duelling televised town halls in different cities. The combined ratings for the two programs drew a fraction of the viewership that a debate normally attracts.The Trump team said earlier this week it believed the debate would focus on foreign policy, something that neither the commission nor moderator Kristen Welker of NBC had ever committed to publicly.The Trump campaign said it would force Biden to account for his nearly five decades of foreign policy positions. Trump has long downplayed the threat posed by the coronavirus and has only intensified that message since his recovery from the disease it causes.Biden has hammered Trump for what he considers a cavalier approach toward the pandemic that has killed more than 223,000 people in the U.S.The Trump campaign has indicated that he is especially eager to attack Biden on a recent report in the New York Post that purports to cite emails between Hunter Biden and leaders of the Ukrainian energy firm whose board he sat on.Unverified emails the paper published after obtaining them from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani show a Ukrainian businessman thanking Hunter Biden “for the opportunity” to meet Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time.The Biden campaign said a review of the vice president’s calendars shows no such meeting.It has also repeatedly stressed that policy positions taken by the U.S. government and key allies were not influenced by Hunter Biden’s work.Another purported email says that Hunter Biden was receiving $10 million annually from a Chinese billionaire for “introductions alone,” though it is unclear who was involved in the introductions.Trump has long sought to cast Biden as soft on China, believing it a winning message with voters even as his own record includes plenty of praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-demands-trump-reveal-tax-returns-asks-what-he-s-hiding/story-tRS5mT9ij2puFptLxRhkjI.html
23-10-2020||World||US prez debate: Mute button brings civility as Donald Trump, Joe Biden show restraint||The mute button, or at least the threat of it, worked well this time as US President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden showed restraint and civility during the last presidential debate, unlike their first encounter when they frequently spoke over each other, creating chaos at times. Far from their raucous first meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, that led organisers to introduce the mute button, the second and final 90-minute debate between Trump and Biden at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday night was less fury and more urgency. In the first presidential debate last month, Trump, 74, and Biden, 77, fiercely clashed over a number of issues, including the Covid-19 pandemic, racism, economy and climate, marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations. A media report termed the mute button a godsend, saying it also amplified the candidates’ differences. On Monday, the non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced new rules under which it will mute microphones for two minutes of the rival speakers so as to give them uninterrupted opening remarks during the final debate. The decision to mute microphones comes after a chaotic first presidential debate that saw the two candidates interrupting each other repeatedly. The final debate was moderated by NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker. Under the new rules, Trump and Biden each had two minutes of uninterrupted time to speak at the beginning of every 15-minute segment of the debate. Both campaigns had agreed to the two-minute, uninterrupted rule. The mute button was under a member of the production crew who works for the Commission on Presidential Debates. The person was responsible for turning off the microphone. A member of each of the Trump and Biden campaigns monitored the person who controlled the mute button backstage. As hoped by the commission officials, the button allowed for a more civilised exchange of views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-debate-mute-button-brings-civility-as-donald-trump-joe-biden-show-restraint/story-DO52dzQenPkNYd9AJ3ykOO.html
23-10-2020||World||US crude oil futures dip slightly after final presidential debate||US Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden’s clean energy plans put the spotlight on oil companies and stocks during Thursday’s final debate with President Donald Trump, even though crude oil futures fell very marginally after the statements.The last debate ahead of the Nov.3 contest saw a restrained Trump and Biden discuss a range of topics, including the economy, the coronavirus pandemic and climate change.Trump pounced on Biden’s comment that he “would transition from the oil industry”, asking voters in states where the oil industry is important to note his stance, while other Republicans also said Biden would kill millions of jobs.US crude oil futures dipped 0.17% to $40.58 a barrel, following a 1.5% gain in the previous session.After the debate, Biden told reporters he was referring to a plan to stop subsidizing fossil fuels, and there would be jobs created in other alternatives.“It does sound like a reiteration of existing policy,” said Rob Carnell, Asia research head at Dutch bank ING, since Biden’s pledge of net-zero-emissions by 2050 will require less reliance on oil and more reliance on renewables for energy.“But there is a little bit of denial, everywhere, that this is actually going to happen...it’s possible that the market reaction has been the dawning realisation that this is actually what it means.”The Dow Jones oil and gas index is down nearly 49% this year.US stock futures barely moved after the debate although the Japanese yen ticked up investors’ caution increased into the election.US S&P 500 E-minis were down 0.07% at 3,452 points at 0500 GMT.“Biden came through better than Trump in this debate and this should help to cement his lead over Trump and may just help him to cross the final line with a win,” said Vasu Menon, a senior strategist at OCBC Wealth Management in Singapore.The debate followed over a week of choppy trade on Wall Street, with investors worried about whether Congress and Trump will approve another fiscal stimulus package before the election.Despite a recent decline, the S&P 500 remains up over 3% since the first Trump-Biden debate on Sept. 29, with investors voicing growing comfort with a potential Biden victory as he increased his lead in polls.Many investors in recent months have held that a second term for Trump, who favors tax cuts and deregulation, would be good for the stock market.The S&P 500 is up more than 60% since Trump’s unexpected election victory on Nov. 8, 2016, beating the 42% gain in the first four years after Democratic President Barack Obama won in 2008.Investors view Biden as likely to raise taxes, especially if Democrats wrest control of the Senate from Republicans. However, a Biden presidency, coupled with a Democratic Senate, would likely mean a larger fiscal stimulus plan than what a Republican Senate would agree to, many investors believe.However, it is unclear how Wall Street would react to the election outcome. In the run-up to the 2016 election, investors widely predicted that a Trump victory would hurt stocks due to his unpredictability and trade-war threats against China and Mexico.With expectations that the increased use of mail-in ballots by voters concerned about the coronavirus could mean no immediate winner is announced, S&P 500 options show investors are bracing for volatility in November and December.With 12 days to go, some 47.5 million Americans have turned in ballots, roughly eight times the number of early votes cast at about same point before the 2016 presidential contest, according to data compiled by the US Elections Project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-crude-oil-futures-dip-slightly-after-final-presidential-debate/story-nUdpon5o1REF1qbeGCP1SM.html

It was ignored by the GOP-led Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-blames-speaker-nancy-pelosi-for-no-new-covid-relief-bill/story-FpAT7QSN7SC5ESXNeme8wO.html
23-10-2020||World||Biden slams Trump friendship with ‘thug’ Kim||Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Thursday denounced President Donald Trump for befriending North Korea’s “thug” leader, likening his diplomacy to working with Hitler.In a sharp clash in their final presidential debate, Biden attacked Trump’s insistence that he has avoided war through his summits with Kim Jong Un.“He’s talked about his good buddy, who’s a thug,” Biden said of the young North Korean leader.“That’s like saying we had a good relationship with Hitler before he invaded Europe -- the rest of Europe. Come on.”But Biden indicated he was also willing to meet with Kim, saying his condition would be that Pyongyang works to make the Korean peninsula “a nuclear-free zone.”Trump said that former president Barack Obama had left him “a mess” on North Korea and had warned him of the risk of “nuclear war.”After the summits, “we have a very good relationship. And there’s no war,” said Trump, who also played down North Korea’s recent unveiling of a massive new long-range missile at a military parade.“He didn’t like Obama,” Trump said of Kim not meeting the former president. “He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.”Biden, who was vice president under Obama, hit back that Obama would not meet Kim because he was pushing stronger sanctions.“President Obama said we’re going to talk about denuclearization. We’re not going to legitimize you.”Trump first met in June 2018 with Kim in Singapore, the first-ever summit between the countries still technically at war, and later said that the two leaders “fell in love.”The two leaders have met two more times and North Korea has since held off on nuclear and missile tests but analysts say Pyongyang has kept advancing its weapons programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-slams-trump-friendship-with-thug-kim/story-5OczjrZFa5w5JdY8eD1sSO.html
23-10-2020||World||Israel launches airstrike on Gaza after Palestinian militants fire rockets||The Israeli military said Friday it launched overnight airstrikes in the Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants fired two rockets, with no reports of casualties or major damage on either side.The military said fighter jets and other aircraft struck a weapons manufacturing site and “underground infrastructure” belonging to the Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza.Late Thursday, Palestinian militants fired two rockets into Israel. One was intercepted by Israeli missile defenses while the other fell in an open area.Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and several skirmishes since the militant group seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel holds Hamas responsible for all attacks emanating from Gaza, including those claimed by other militant groups.Israel and Egypt have maintained a crippling blockade on the coastal territory, which is home to 2 million Palestinians, since Hamas seized power.Earlier this week, Israel announced the discovery of an unfinished tunnel dug by militants that had crossed into Israel before it was detected by underground sensors. It said the tunnel ran dozens of meters (yards) underground and was intended to facilitate attacks.Israel has uncovered around 20 such tunnels since the last war with Hamas, in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-launches-airstrike-on-gaza-after-palestinian-militants-fire-rockets/story-xPCaKR2GNKBl4Vww2XR87N.html
23-10-2020||World||Pakistan business school cancels online lecture of noted economist||A Pakistan-based business school was forced to cancel an online seminar with well-known economist Dr Atif Mian following pressure from extremist groups.Dr Mian, who belongs to the Ahmadiyya community, was slated to speak on “Why has economic growth fallen behind in Pakistan?” at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) in Karachi. However, the seminar was scrapped due to threats from extremists.“Dr Atif R. Mian’s lecture “Why has economic growth fallen behind in Pakistan?” scheduled on November 5, 2020 has been cancelled. Inconvenience is highly regretted,” IBA Karachi tweeted.Dr Mian also confirmed the news about his seminar.“Sorry to report that my zoom economics seminar at IBA Karachi has been cancelled due to threats that the university administration was facing from extremists. My very best wishes and prayers are with the students of IBA,” Mian tweeted.Back in September 2018, Atif Mian was asked to quit Imran Khan’s Economic Advisory Council within days of his appointment for being a member of the Ahmadiyya community, Dawn reported. So much for Imran Khan’s claims to protect minorities of Pakistan. He could do nothing about the smear campaign that was launched on social media seeking Mian’s removal over his Ahmadiyya faith.After Dr Mian’s announcement on IBA seminar, Wendy Gilmour, Canada’s high commissioner to Pakistan expressed regret over the development. “I am very sorry to hear this. An opportunity lost for the students and wider interested community,” Gilmour tweeted.This news comes after a UK-based All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for the Ahmadi Muslim Community had revealed details about the discrimination the Ahmadiyya community has been facing in Pakistan.In August the report titled “Suffocation of the Faithful - the persecution of Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan and the rise of International Extremism” said that persecution against the peace-loving community intensified following the partition of the Indian subcontinent and the formation of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-business-school-cancels-online-lecture-of-noted-economist/story-nFwNnzhWq8l1n7T8kgmkQN.html
23-10-2020||World||China warns Canada not to damage relations over Uyghur genocide issue||Beijing [China], October 23 (ANI): China has accused Canadian parliamentarians of spreading “lies and rumours,” over the issue of genocide against the Uyghur minority community in Xinjiang.“The sub-committee of the Canadian parliament neglects the fact of political stability, economic growth, ethnic solidarity and social harmony in Xinjiang. Its groundless statement is full of lies and disinformation. This is blatant interference in China’s internal affairs and reflects those Canadian individuals’ ignorance and prejudice,” said Chinese spokesperson Zhao Lijian while responding to Canada’s House of Commons subcommittee’s statement. This comes after a subcommittee of Canada’s Parliament called out China on genocide in Xinjiang province, The Globe and Mail reported. The committee also called for human rights-related sanctions.Responding to Canada’s subcommittee, Zhao said, “China has repeatedly made clear our stern position on Xinjiang. Xinjiang-related issues are not at all about human rights. The so-called genocide in Xinjiang is a rumour and a farce fabricated by some anti-China forces to slander China.”This follows after the Canadian committee used the term “concentration camps” to describe Chinese centres for forcible political indoctrination and skills training. It also mentioned documents with details on plans to subject women of child-bearing age to birth control in Xinjiang.“Witnesses were clear that the Government of China’s actions is a clear attempt to eradicate Uyghur culture and religion,” the committee wrote.Furthermore, the committee asked Canadian leadership to impose sanctions against Chinese officials for human-rights abuses.Xinjiang region is home to around 10 million Uyghurs. The Turkic Muslim group, which makes up around 45% of Xinjiang’s population, has long accused China’s authorities of cultural, religious and economic discrimination.Classified documents known as the China Cables, accessed last year by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, threw light on how the Chinese government uses technology to control Uyghur Muslims worldwide.However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training.The Chinese government has been admonished world-over for its repressive measures against the ethnic Uyghurs like mass detention, mass surveillance, restriction of religious and cultural identities, as well as other gross human rights abuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-canada-not-to-damage-relations-over-uyghur-genocide-issue/story-laVNWK1eejV184P1TTMF4J.html
23-10-2020||World||US: Russian hackers targeting state, local networks||US officials said that Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local governments in the United States in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers. The warning, less than two weeks before the election, amplified fears of the potential for tampering with the vote and undermining confidence in the results.The advisory from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency describes an onslaught of recent activity by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group against a broad range of networks, some of which were successfully compromised. The alert released Thursday functions as a reminder of Russia’s potent capabilities and ongoing interference in the election even as US officials publicly called out Iran on Wednesday night.The advisory does not identify by name or location those who were targeted, but officials say they have no information that any election or government operations have been affected or that the integrity of elections data has been compromised.“However, the actor may be seeking access to obtain future disruption options, to influence US policies and actions, or to delegitimize (state and local) government entities,” the advisory said.US officials have repeatedly said it would be extremely difficult for hackers to alter vote tallies in a meaningful way, but they have warned about other methods of interference that could disrupt the election, including cyberattacks on networks meant to impede the voting process. The interference could continue during or after the tallying of ballots if Russians produce spoofed websites or fake content meant to confuse voters about election results and lead them to doubt the legitimacy of the outcome.A broad concern, particularly at the local government level, has been that hackers could infiltrate a county network and then work their way over to election-related systems unless certain defenses, such as firewalls, are in place. This is especially true for smaller counties that don’t have as much money and IT support as their bigger counterparts to fund security upgrades.Officials have nonetheless sought to stress the integrity of the vote, with FBI Director Christopher Wray saying Wednesday, “You should be confident that your vote counts. Early, unverified claims to the contrary should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.”On Thursday, Chris Krebs, the head of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said officials don’t have reason to believe that hackers were looking for election infrastructure or election-related information, and aren’t aware of any activity “that would allow them to come anywhere near a vote.” He said the alert was issued in regard to the scanning of county networks for vulnerabilities, not specifically to the targeting of elections.“The election-related risk is the fact that they were in or touching an election system,” he said.The threat from the Kremlin was mentioned but not especially emphasized during a hastily called news conference on Wednesday night, when officials said Russia and Iran had obtained voting registration information — though such data is sometimes easily accessible. But most of the focus was on Iran, which officials linked to a series of menacing but fake emails that purported to be from a far-right group and were aimed at intimidating voters in multiple battleground states.John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, said the operation was aimed at harming President Donald Trump, though he didn’t elaborate on how.On Thursday, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against five Iranian entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for attempting to influence US elections.Despite Iran’s activities, Russia is widely regarded in the cybersecurity community as the bigger threat to the election. The US has said that Russia, which interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic email accounts and through a covert social media effort, is interfering again this year in part through a concerted effort to denigrate Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.US officials attribute the recent activity to a state-sponsored hacking group variously known as DragonFly and Energetic Bear in the cybersecurity community. The group appears to have been in operation since at least 2011 and is known to have engaged in cyberespionage on energy companies and power grid operators in the US and Europe, as well as on defense and aviation companies. Aviation networks are among the entities that officials say were recently targeted, according to Thursday’s advisory.According to the advisory, the hackers have obtained user and administrator credentials to enter the networks and moved laterally inside to locate what they felt would be “high-value” information to steal. In at least one breach, officials say, the hackers accessed documents related to network configurations and passwords, IT instructions and vendors and purchasing information.As of October 1, the advisory said, the hackers have exfiltrated data from at least two servers.John Hultquist, the director of threat intelligence at FireEye, said Energetic Bear moved to the top of his worry list when the cybersecurity firm observed it breaking into state and local governments in the US that administer elections, due to it having targeted election systems in 2019.Hultquist said he does not think Energetic Bear has the ability to directly affect the US vote but fears it could disrupt local and state government networks proximate to the systems that process votes.“The disruption may have little effect on the outcome. It may be entirely insignificant to the outcome — but it could be perceived as proof that the election outcome is in question,” he said. “Just by getting access to these systems they may be preying on fears of the insecurity of the election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-russian-hackers-targeting-state-local-networks/story-nxqTHk6NLVRDE5tkYobFhK.html
23-10-2020||World||China’s actions in Xinjiang amount to genocide, says Canada parliament panel||A Canadian parliamentary panel has described the persecution of the Uighurs in Xinjiang as a “genocide”, asking the government to recognise it as such and to impose sanctions against Chinese officials responsible.The Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development said it was “profoundly disturbed” at what it heard in testimony from witnesses and “convinced of the need for a strong response.” Witnesses said “the government of China has been employing various strategies to persecute Muslim groups living in Xinjiang, including mass detentions, forced labour, pervasive state surveillance and population control. Witnesses were clear that the government of China’s actions are a clear attempt to eradicate Uighur culture and religion,” it said in a statement.The panel called upon the Canadian government to “condemn the government of China’s actions against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang” and “recognise that the acts being committed in Xinjiang against Uighurs constitute genocide and work within legal frameworks of international bodies to recognise that acts being committed against Uighurs constitute genocide.” The subcommittee was “deeply disturbed by the use and apparent efficiency” and “inhumane population control measures” in the area.This was “the largest mass detention of a minority community since the Holocaust,” it noted.Survivors of concentration camps said “detainees are abused psychologically, physically and sexually.”The subcommittee is chaired by Peter Fonseca, an MP belonging to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party caucus.It said that the panel was told that “women and girls are regularly subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of gender-based violence”. It also called for action from the government with regard to supply chains for goods that may have been manufactured in China through the use of forced labour in Xinjiang. The panel recommended that the government “investigate potentially problematic sources of consumer goods and to take a strong stand against the use of forced labour, particularly when it involves Canadian companies.”It also sought enhancement of import control mechanisms “to prevent products made with forced labour from entering the Canadian market” while also seeking imposition of “sanctions on entities and individuals that benefit from the use of forced labour.”It also pointed to the pervasive state surveillance of the minorities in Xinjiang and warned that the Canadian government should ensure Canadian technology companies were in no way linked to the monitoring. It said that Canada should “take the necessary steps and conduct a review to ensure Canadian individuals, companies and public bodies are not investing in technology companies involved in supporting or facilitating the abuse of fundamental human rights in China.”Canadian foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he was “deeply disturbed” by the subcommittee’s findings. According to the outlet CBC News, he said, “Canada takes the allegations of genocide very seriously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-actions-in-xinjiang-amount-to-genocide-says-canada-parliament-panel/story-BiIUqJ01ZHjpKz5jhFFYjM.html

Experts have said such fraud is rare.Those attacks by the president have shown signs of depressing Republican interest in voting by mail. Democrats have roughly doubled the number of returned mail-in ballots by Republicans in states that report voter registration data by party, according to the Elections Project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-47-million-ballots-cast-in-us-election-eclipsing-2016-early-turnout/story-7JznYQfZsQYX1VnnVA3DHP.html

Look at Russia, look at - India, it’s so filthy, the air is filthy,” the American president said, arguing his position on climate crisis. “The Paris accord I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars, and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there - they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our business.”The American president has made a similar argument in the past - saying India and China got a sweeter deal under the Paris Accord - but he has not used this kind of language before for India.The Republican president and his Democratic challenger locked horns for their second and final presidential debate on Friday morning, India time.

23-10-2020||World||China vows retaliation if US proceeds with Taiwan arms sale||China has vowed to retaliate if the US proceeds with the sale of advanced weaponry to Taiwan worth more than a billion dollars.The statement from China’s defense ministry gave no specifics, but the development marks a further deterioration in ties between Beijing and Washington that have hit their lowest ebb in decades.The statement issued late Thursday night demanded the cancellation of the sale and an end to all interactions between the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries in order to “avoid serious repercussions for relations between China and the U.S. and their armed forces and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.” Failure to do so would “compel the Chinese side to fight back resolutely,” the statement said.The State Department on Wednesday announced it had approved the sale of 135 precision land attack missiles, associated equipment and training to Taiwan to improve its defense capabilities. The package is worth just over a billion dollars, it said in a statement. The missiles are made by Boeing. China regards Taiwan as its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary and Washington maintains only unofficial relations with Taipei in deference to Beijing. However, U.S. law requires the government to ensure Taiwan can maintain a credible defense and recent years have seen an increase in both the quality and quantity of defensive arms sold to the island.Those come as China has increased military activity around Taiwan in what it calls a deliberate attempt to force political concessions from the pro-independence administration of President Tsai Ing-wen. The increase in Chinese incursions into Taiwanese airspace and military exercises seen as targeting U.S. and Taiwanese assets add to Beijing’s years-long campaign of exerting economic and diplomatic pressure on the island, which has left it with just 15 formal diplomatic allies.In a separate statement issued late Thursday, the Chinese Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office demanded Tsai’s Democratic People’s Party end its “plotting” with the U.S. to “refuse unification through arms.” “This can only seriously undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and bring down a terrible disaster on the Taiwanese people,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-vows-retaliation-if-us-proceeds-with-taiwan-arms-sale/story-H5sVM3Ewb4iWqB0som3PJL.html
23-10-2020||World||Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora holds protest in front of Pak Embassy in US||The Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora (GKPD) and several other community organisations held a car protest rally in front of the Embassy of Pakistan in the US on Thursday (local time), remembering Pakistan’s invasion of Kashmir in 1947.Scores of people were seen chanting slogans calling Pakistan to vacate the illegally occupied Kashmir. “Pakistan vacate occupied Kashmir. Kashmir is an integrated part of India,” one of the posters read.Another poster said, “The jihadist invasion of 1947 in Kashmir didn’t happen overnight, it was planned strategically by Pakistan.”Dr. Mohan Sapru, the rally organizer and Washington DC GKPD coordinator said,“While using masks and current practice of social distancing, the rally protesters have gathered to voice their anguish and strong condemnation of Pakistan’s 73-year long perpetual policy of cross-border terrorism and overt operations in Kashmir, which have especially targeted the minority communities like Kashmiri Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists.”He also said that cross-border aggression against peaceful Kashmir by Pakistan-trained and sponsored militia called Kabalis on October 22,1947 marked the birth of the Kashmir problem.“The brutality of cross-border Islamic terrorism has continued unabated and resulted in the genocide and forced exodus of indigenous Kashmiri Hindus during the dark period of 1989-1991. Whether heinous terrorist acts happen in Kashmir, or US or any other part of the world, at the end of the day, terrorism is a blot on the conscience of humanity and cannot be a legitimate means to settle disputes in a civilized world,” Sapru said. He further said that the agony and hardships of a few hundred Kashmiri Hindu families, who continued to live in the Kashmir valley, still remain largely unaddressed.The rally participant and community activist, Sidarth Ambardar, recalled Father George Shanks’s account of the murder of nuns by the invading Kabali militia in October 1947, and desecration of the Chatti Padhshahi Gurdwara. He said: “Pakistani invaders in 1947 terrorized, looted and killed the locals.”European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS), in a recent commentary, called October 22 as the “darkest day” in the history of Jammu and Kashmir when Operation Gulmarg was launched in a bid to seize the territory.According to a European think tank, the tribal invasion had left between 35,000 and 40,000 residents dead.“The planners and perpetrators of the tribal invasion were, and remain, without doubt, the foremost enemies of the Kashmiri people. The day the invasion began on October 22, 1947, has to be the darkest day in the history of Jammu and Kashmir,” the European think tank said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmiri-pandit-diaspora-holds-protest-in-front-of-pak-embassy-in-us/story-bby4V2iCH9k7sNl0OPSOBI.html
23-10-2020||World||Trump calls CBS biased, hateful, rude for ‘60 Minutes’ interview footage||The White House on Thursday released raw footage from an interview that US President Donald Trump did with “60 Minutes” reporter Lesley Stahl, breaking an agreement to keep material from the highly-anticipated clash private until an edited version could air this weekend.The footage shows Stahl, a veteran journalist who has interviewed Trump twice before, asking direct questions and refuting some of Trump’s answers on topics including healthcare and the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Look at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS,” Trump said in post on his Twitter profile on Thursday morning, with a link to his Facebook page, where he posted the nearly 38 minute interview.The Facebook post quickly gained attention, garnering more than 26,000 comments in less than two hours.The White House had kept a single-frame copy of the interview, in which only Trump is visible but Stahl can be heard asking questions. It shows Trump repeatedly asking Stahl and her employer, CBS News, to ask tough questions of Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the Nov. 3 election.CBS News, a division of ViacomCBS Inc
23-10-2020||World||Clashes, more than chaos, mark final Trump - Biden debate||After the first presidential debate was panned so widely that organizers introduced a mute button, Thursday’s second and final debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden was far more civil.Whether because of that button or the terrible reviews — especially for Trump — the candidates interrupted each other far less frequently, even as they clashed on issues ranging from the coronavirus to crime to global warming.While Trump and Biden responded to each other’s answers — shaking their heads disapprovingly or smiling, in the case of Biden — the two largely avoided speaking over one another. And neither man tried to speak at length while he was muted during opening questions.Trump, in particular, was on his best behavior, especially early on, and especially when it came to the moderator, whom he’d repeatedly attacked before the debate.“So far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this,” Trump said to NBC’s Kristen Welker when she gave him time to respond to Biden at one point.Because of the pandemic, only around 200 people were seated inside the debate hall in the massive college arena in Nashville. That included a representative of the Commission on Presidential Debates, who was tasked with ensuring each candidate had a two full minutes of uninterrupted time to deliver opening answers on six major topics, according to debate commission chair Frank Fahrenkopf.A member of each of the Trump and Biden campaigns monitored the person who controlled the mute button backstage, Fahrenkopf told The Associated Press, noting that the button would not be used beyond the first four minutes of each topic.The button was among a handful of changes implemented by the nonpartisan debate commission to help ensure a more orderly debate following the raucous and widely criticized opening debate 23 days ago. Coronavirus restrictions also remained in place, with attendees required to wear masks at all times and audience members distanced.Organizers had initially planned to separate the candidates with plexiglass barriers, but the barrier were removed hours before the debate began. A Trump campaign official said the decision was made after White House chief of staff Mark Meadows called Anthony Fauci, the nation’s highly respected top infectious diseases expert, during a walkthrough of the venue site.Meadows put Fauci on speakerphone and Fauci told those in the room that all a barrier would do was provide a false sense of security, the person said.Trump was diagnosed with Covid-19 two days after the last debate, and he and the White House have refused to say whether he abided by commission rules and tested negative for the virus before that debate.This time, Trump was given a test aboard Air Force One en route to Nashville Thursday and tested negative, according to Meadows. Biden’s campaign reported he also tested negative.The debate commission also tightened its rules on masks, with organizers saying that any audience member who refused to wear one would be removed. Last month, several members of the Trump family removed their masks once seated in the debate hall, but were allowed to stay. This time, first lady Melania Trump, appearing in public for the first time since her own coronavirus diagnosis, as well as other members of the Trump family were seen wearing masks at times.Before the debate began, Fahrenkopf repeated the instruction to the small audience.“If you won’t leave, you’ll be escorted,” he said.Fahrenkopf had said in an earlier interview that the safety measures would help reduce the risk of infection.“The Trump campaign’s attitude was that the president was not contagious anymore, but we’re going to go with our medical advisers,” he said.As a result, the president of Belmont University, where the event was held, called it “the safest place in America tonight.”The university, a picturesque institution of more than 8,200 students just a mile from Nashville’s Music Row, also hosted a town hall-style debate between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain in 2008.There was a far smaller audience this time around.Only around 200 people were allowed inside, a mix of invited guests of the campaigns and the debate commission, students, the commission’s production team, security, and health and safety personnel. Audience members were seated in accordance with social distancing recommendations; several empty seats separated each person or small group.All audience members and support staff were required to undergo coronavirus testing onsite and wore colored wristbands as evidence of their negative tests.Ahead of the event, dozens of protesters gathered just off campus beyond the security perimeter. One of them held a large white sign: “220,000 DEAD ... Trump FAILED US.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-more-than-chaos-mark-final-trump-biden-debate/story-1W1VBCcZEN6dQkXgX014qK.html
23-10-2020||World||‘Look at India, the air is filthy,’ says US President Donald Trump at final debate||US President Donald Trump on Thursday used the word “filthy” to describe pollution in India during an exchange on climate crisis as he clashed with Democratic rival Joe Biden on Covid-19, immigration, racism, healthcare and foreign policy in their second and final debate in the race for the White House.Though better behaved and disciplined than they were in their disastrous first debate on September 29, they also launched vicious attacks on each other over corruption, character and integrity in the second showdown on Friday morning, India time, at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.Watch | US Final Presidential Debate: When Donald Trump called India filthy Trump came into the debate as an underdog, trailing Biden by wide margins in national polls and in battleground states, desperately in need of changing the trajectory of the race with just 12 days left for polling to close, by which time a large number of Americans would have already cast their votes through early in-person and mail-in voting.Also Read: Donald Trump calls CBS biased, hateful, rude for ‘60 Minutes’ interview footage“Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia, look at, India, it’s so filthy, the air is filthy,” the president said in a segment on climate crisis. “The Paris accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars, and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses,” he said.The president has used this argument before — that India and China got a sweeter deal under the Paris Accord and that’s chiefly why he left the accord. That’s a baseless assertion and India has contested it, but he had not used this language before for India, China, or Russia.The New York Times’ fact-checkers labelled Trump’s assertion “misleading”: “Air pollution in China and India is indeed a serious issue — India is one of the most polluted countries in the world. But Mr Trump is essentially talking about the countries’ contributions to climate change, and on that score, his comments fail to capture the full picture.”Also Read: Donald Trump vs Joe Biden final presidential debate: Who said whatSouth Asians for Biden, a group backing the Democrat, criticised the president’s remarks, tweeting, “Tonight, Trump called India ‘filthy’. His rhetoric has proven time and time again that he has disdain for India, as well as for people who draw their heritage from South Asia. He will never respect the vibrancy, beauty, and diversity of our South Asian community.”A congressional aide who spoke on background found it a “bizarre comment from a president who is trying to court India as a key part of his national security strategy in the Indo-Pacific. And it was “oddly timed, especially when his secretary of state and defence are headed to India next week to meet with their Indian counterparts.”The aide was referring to the upcoming 2+2 ministerial dialogue for which secretaries of state and defence, Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper, were scheduled to reach New Delhi on Monday. They will meet their respective counterparts S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In the past, the US president had mockingly called India “tariff king” during trade talks, and underplayed its Covid-19 testing record to make his administration’s response look better in the face of mounting criticism of its handling of the worst public health crisis in more than 100 years.Also Read: Biden warns Trump has no plan to stop ‘dark winter’ of Covid-19 deathsThe first 30 minutes or so of the debate was indeed about the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 223,000 Americans and infected close to 8.5 million, and is now surging again in 75% of the country, raising the spectre of a “dark winter” as Biden put it at the debate.The former vice-president landed the first punch of the night, attacking the president’s response to the epidemic: “Anybody responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America.” He then challenged the president to start by taking responsibility for it.Trump, who has refused to take any responsibility for the poor handling of the pandemic or the consequent troubles and disruptions, said he did, but with a line that was soon reverberating around twitter-verse: “Excuse me, I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here, it’s China’s fault.”Also Read: Poor air quality is a danger to public health. Adopt a holistic approach | HT EditorialTrump also took every opportunity to draw Biden into a controversy swirling around conservative circles about the foreign business dealings of his son Hunter Biden, and accused Biden of earning millions from Russia and China.But the former vice-president had come prepared. He denied the allegations, questioned the veracity of the material Trump and his allies had used, and turned it all back on the president, slamming him on his “secret” bank account in China, and refusal to release his tax returns.Their exchanges on immigration, health care, racism, energy and climate change were vigorous with repeated back-and-forth. Towards the later part of the debate, Trump began hitting Biden on “being all talk” and not doing things he wants to do now when he was vice-president for eight years.Biden had come prepared with zingers and deployed them well. During a discussion on foreign policy, he brought up Hitler when criticising Trump’s eagerness to meet and strike up a good relationship with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. “We had a great relationship with Hitler before he invaded Europe,” he said.And he had a unifying message, which he used repeatedly to contrast Trump’s partisan attacks on Democratic cities and states over their Covid-19 cases and other troubles. He promised he will be a president for all of America and not Red America or Blue America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/look-at-india-the-air-is-filthy-says-us-president-donald-trump/story-7n28Cuq5R0HbEVBzeW3lAM.html
23-10-2020||World||The Palm Fountain: Dubai makes world record for largest fountain||The glitzy emirate of Dubai broke the record for the world’s largest fountain on Thursday, as the Gulf city seeks to boost its hard-hit tourism sector amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Palm Fountain, which covers an area of 14,366 square feet (1,335 square metres), is located at The Pointe shopping and dining district on Palm Jumeirah, a man-made palm-shaped island. Mask-clad people, in keeping with coronavirus safety measures, gathered on Thursday evening to watch a show of dancing jets of water, music and lights.“GWR is delighted to officially see The Palm Fountain breaking the title of the Largest fountain,” Shaddy Gaad, Senior Marketing Manager at Guinness World Records said in a statement.“This fountain is an example of another milestone in Dubai’s architectural achievements,” it said, adding that Guinness was declaring it “Officially Amazing”.Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, already holds a string of world record titles -- including the world’s tallest building, Burj Khalifa, and the fastest police car in service, a Bugatti Veyron. The city that attracts millions of tourists had already one of the largest fountains in the world near Burj Khalifa.The new fountain has over 3,000 LED lights, 7,500 nozzles and can shoot water up to 105 metres, according to Guinness.Last month, British artist Sacha Jafri broke the record for the largest art canvas measuring 1,595 square metres, also in Dubai, Guinness said.The 44-year-old contemporary artist has said he hoped to raise at least $30 million to fund health and education initiatives for children in impoverished parts of the world.Dubai, which has the most diversified economy in oil-rich Gulf region, has been badly hit by the coronavirus slowdown.Its GDP has contracted 3.5 percent in the first quarter, following two years of modest growth. Tourism has long been a mainstay of the emirate, which welcomed more than 16 million visitors last year.Before the pandemic crippled global travel, the aim was to reach 20 million this year.Dubai is now largely open for business and tourism, but infection rates have been rising in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-palm-fountain-dubai-makes-world-record-for-largest-fountain/story-Lt7ljLkX1p0WVUgpgPsofK.html
23-10-2020||World||Biden warns Trump has no plan to stop ‘dark winter’ of Covid-19 deaths||Joe Biden on Thursday assailed President Donald Trump as having no plan to stop a “dark winter” of coronavirus deaths as they sparred in their last head-to-head clash 12 days before the election.With more people dead in the United States than in any other country, Trump insisted that Covid-19 would soon go away through medical breakthroughs and pointed to his own recovery since his first debate.“220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this,” Biden said at the televised debate in Nashville, where the two candidates avoided shaking hands due to safety risks.“Anyone who’s responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America,” Biden said.“We’re about to go into a dark winter,” he said. “And he has no plan.”After a strikingly bitter first debate, the tone initially changed, with the debate organizers empowered to mute the candidates’ microphones.Trump hit back that there would be no “dark winter” -- and defended his push to reopen the United States as soon as possible.“We’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away,” Trump said.“We have a vaccine that’s coming, it’s ready, it’s going to be announced within weeks.”- Biden seeks to keep lead -Trying to hold on to his sizeable lead in the polls, Biden was keen to keep the debate focused on the Covid-19 pandemic.With cases rising rapidly around the country as winter approaches, a Quinnipiac University poll Thursday found that nearly six in 10 people think the coronavirus is out of control.Trump’s demeanor changed in the first moments of the debate, with the normally combative tycoon speaking of his son’s Covid diagnosis and not immediately going on attack.But Trump was soon dusting off smear tactics he used against Hillary Clinton four years ago.As he had signalled he would do before the debate, Trump raised murky accusations that Biden profited from corrupt business relationships involving his son Hunter during the years that he served as vice president under Barack Obama.“I think you owe an explanation to the American people,” Trump charged -- to which Biden responded that he had never received “a penny” from foreign sources in his life.Whether the showdown at Belmont University in the country music capital can really shift the election is itself up for debate.Some 45 million Americans are estimated to have joined an unprecedented wave of early voting and polls indicate that almost all voters have already firmly made up their minds. Biden is steadily ahead, with the Quinnipiac University national poll putting him up at 51 percent to Trump’s 41.But the sheer ferocity of an election that has seen a country at its most divided in decades made the debate anything but predictable.- Keeping order -The first 90-minute Trump-Biden debate on September 29 erupted into an almost non-stop flurry of interruptions, insults and near-shouting.A majority of the disruption came from Trump. At one point, Biden turned to the president and told him to “shut up.”A second debate planned for October 15 was cancelled after Trump came down with Covid-19 and declined to take part in a virtual debate.This time, moderator Kristen Welker, a White House correspondent for NBC News, was armed with a mute button to ensure that each man can speak uninterrupted during portions reserved for statements.But Trump showed his willingness to play hardball by inviting as a guest to the debate Tony Bobunlinski, who says he was a former business associate of Hunter Biden and believes Joe Biden profited from his son’s business in China.Biden has denied any wrongdoing and calls the reports about his son a last-ditch attempt to change the course of the election with dirty tricks.The Biden campaign in a statement noted that the former vice president -- unlike Trump -- has released his tax returns and pointed to a recent New York Times report that Trump has a secret bank account in China.“This is a desperate, pathetic farce executed by a flailing campaign with no rationale for putting our country through another four years of hell,” campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.Trump was impeached last year by the House of Representatives for abusing his office in pursuit of compromising dirt on Biden’s family. He is also accused of multiple sex crimes and has seen numerous key associates during his presidency go to prison or be indicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-trump-has-no-plan-to-stop-dark-winter-of-covid-19-deaths/story-jncS9iUCz7SLwEjmHIycKO.html

23-10-2020||World||Donald Trump campaign tapes voters at drop boxes, threatens lawsuit||The Trump campaign has been videotaping people as they deposit ballots in drop boxes in Philadelphia in what it says is an attempt to catch violations, surveillance that the battleground state’s Democratic attorney general suggested could amount to illegal intimidation.The campaign acknowledged the taping in a letter from a lawyer that complained it had caught voters on video illegally depositing multiple ballots. City elections officials responded they could not confirm the activity was inappropriate under Pennsylvania law.Linda Kerns, the lawyer for the Trump campaign — which has already sued to ban the use of drop boxes — wrote to city election officials last week to request that they end the use of “unmanned drop boxes.” The New York Times first reported the development Thursday.Philadelphia and many other heavily populated counties in Pennsylvania are using drop boxes to help collect an avalanche of mail ballots under a year-old law greatly expanding such voting.Kerns wrote that video taken by a campaign representative shows three people dropping off as many as three ballots in a limited time period Oct. 14.Pennsylvania law, in most cases, requires voters to deliver their own mail-in ballots, Kerns wrote, although it makes an exception for voters with disabilities.Kerns suggested the images amount to “blatant violations” of state election law and said the campaign would sue, unless the city’s election office “commits to remedy this problem immediately.”She asked for copies of city surveillance video at City Hall, for a list of voters who dropped ballots in the Philadelphia City Hall drop box on Oct. 14, and that the ballots be set aside “until an investigation can determine whether the ballots were personally delivered” by the voter.In a response, a city lawyer, Benjamin Field, wrote Monday to Kerns to reject her assumption that the law was violated. Third-party delivery is permitted in certain circumstances, he wrote.Though the city had forwarded the campaign’s information to the district attorney’s office, Field said, the elections office does not track whose ballots are dropped into particular drop boxes.In a statement, the office of District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, said it is committed to investigating “any and all” allegations of voter intimidation and harassment. The office of the state attorney general, Democrat Josh Shapiro, warned in a statement that videotaping voters at drop boxes could be construed as illegal voter intimidation.In any case, Shapiro’s office said, Trump’s campaign had provided similar photos and videos in a lawsuit in federal court in its effort to ban drop boxes. A judge threw out the case.In another development in President Donald Trump’s battle with Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden for Pennsylvania’s key 20 electoral votes, a lawsuit filed Thursday challenged a court-ordered extension of the deadline to receive mailed presidential ballots.Plaintiffs — including four registered voters from Somerset County and a Republican congressional candidate — asked a federal judge in Pittsburgh to block the deadline extension in the presidential battleground state from going into effect.The state Supreme Court last month ordered county election officials to receive and count mailed-in ballots that arrive up to three days after the Nov. 3 election, until Nov. 6, even if they don’t have a clear postmark, as long as there is no proof it was mailed after the polls closed.Thursday’s lawsuit came 12 days before the election and three days after the U.S. Supreme Court, divided 4-4, rejected a Republican plea making a slightly different argument than Thursday’s lawsuit.The new lawsuit said the court’s deadline extension and the lack of a postmark requirement “will allow for late and otherwise unlawful ballots to be counted.”That is unconstitutionally unfair to in-person voters and exceeded the court’s authority by exercising a power that is constitutionally vested in Congress and the Legislature, it said.With the plaintiffs seeking expedited consideration, the new argument could theoretically arrive at the U.S. Supreme Court after Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is sworn in, providing a tie-breaking vote before the election.Most states make Election Day the deadline, but more than 20 states have a post-Election Day deadline.Several lawsuits — including another filed against Philadelphia by Trump’s campaign — are currently being fought over how Pennsylvania’s election is being conducted. The wave of court cases has prompted concerns that the presidential vote count will be heavily litigated and dragged out for weeks.With about 2.9 million mail-in ballots requested so far, registered Democrats have requested about 1.1 million more mail-in ballots than Republicans, or 1.8 million to 700,000, according to state data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-campaign-tapes-voters-at-drop-boxes-threatens-lawsuit/story-79B9MNOYbpJHBn8n58peaI.html

23-10-2020||World||China, marking its first war with US, urges sacrifice at home||China is going all out in remembrance of its participation against the US in the Korean War, sending a message to Washington that it’s not intimidated by American military might.President Xi Jinping will participate in a ceremony on Friday in Beijing marking the 70th anniversary since its army took up fighting in a conflict China’s government describes as the “War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.” It remains the only time China has gone to war with the US, which was commanding United Nations forces in the 1950-1953 conflict.State media has prominently featured the runup to Friday’s event at the Great Hall of the People, including coverage of a visit by Xi earlier this week to a newly opened military museum exhibition. There, he urged the Chinese people to “carry on the fighting spirit and strengthen the fighting capabilities.”PLA Daily published a lengthy commentary that declared “red lines should never be crossed, bottom lines should never be trampled on.” Other publications ran similar articles that emphasized the need for sacrifice.Also Watch | Tectonic shift as India-US look to lock intelligence deal? The display comes as relations between the two world’s largest economies are at their lowest point in decades. From military tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea, to tit-for-tat retaliation against diplomats and journalists and spats over technology, China wants to be seen as standing up to what it calls US bullying.A rousing celebration of fighting to a standoff with the Americans -- which took place in the 1950s when China was much poorer -- helps shore up anti-US sentiment and a fighting spirit among Chinese public amid talk of a “new Cold War.”In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un sent floral baskets to a cemetery for Chinese soldiers killed in the war, where participants at a ceremony to mark the anniversary “paid silent tribute to the martyrs of the Chinese People’s Volunteers,” the state’s official Korean Central News Agency reported Friday.In October 1950, Chinese troops crossed the border into North Korea at the Yalu River to fight the US-led UN forces. Beijing says just under 200,000 Chinese died in the Korean War, while some US estimates have put that figure at 900,000. Since the conflict ended with an armistice agreement and not a peace treaty, the Chinese People’s Volunteers who fought on behalf of North Korea are still technically at war with U.S.-led UN forces who fought on behalf of South Korea.Chinese forces, poorly armed and equipped at the time, would often attack in overwhelming numbers, occasionally causing American machine guns to overheat and break down. That strategy led to enormous casualties on the Chinese side, Pulitzer Prize winning historian David Halberstam wrote in his book about the Korean War titled “The Coldest Winter.”Sensitivities around the war are running high in China, where earlier this month millions of people took to social media to criticize South Korean K-Pop music group BTS member Kim Nam-joon, known by his stage name RM, for neglecting to talk about China’s role when he mentioned the Korean War at an awards ceremony in New York.Another message widely promoted on Chinese social media underlined the death toll, saying: “197,653 -- the number of martyrs who died in the Korean War. We’ve never forgotten. Please remember this number!”Some Chinese online have drawn analogies between the Korean War and China’s current battle for self-sufficiency in technology. The Battle of Triangle Hill -- a drawn out clash during the war -- has been invoked in China’s modern-day tech fight with the US, used to symbolize its determination to make technological breakthroughs after the US hit Huawei Technologies Co. with regulatory restrictions.One film set for an Oct. 23 release touches on China’s contributions in the war and is called “The Sacrifice.” State broadcaster CCTV and provincial television channels have been airing a six-part documentary about the Korean conflict. There’s even an animated series about heroes of the war aimed at Chinese teenagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-marking-its-first-war-with-us-urges-sacrifice-at-home/story-d4U2DaWWRi5yBf7GznyO4K.html
23-10-2020||World||China seethes over US-Taiwan arms deal||China on Thursday threatened to make a “legitimate and necessary” retaliation over the US sale of $1.8 billion worth of arms to Taiwan as Beijing becomes more strident over its claims to the self-ruled island.The US state department said on Wednesday it has approved the sale of 135 air-to-ground missiles to Taiwan in a move Taipei’s defence ministry said would build its combat capabilities.“We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs,” defence minister Yen De-fa said.Self-ruled Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by China, whose leaders view the island as part of their territory. China’s foreign ministry on Thursday accused the US of violating agreements signed by Beijing and Washington in the 1970s establishing diplomatic relations between the two governments.The sale is “sending a very wrong signal to separatist forces advocating for Taiwan independence, and seriously damages China-US relations,” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said. China also promised retaliation after US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the previous day the state department was designating the US operations of six more China-based media companies as foreign missions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seethes-over-us-taiwan-arms-deal/story-HZ4OkG6BK7MqH3FGUqDI4H.html

23-10-2020||World||Facebook, Twitter CEOs ordered to testify by GOP senators||The GOP push against Facebook and Twitter accelerated Thursday after Republican senators threatened the CEOs of the social media companies with subpoenas to force them to address accusations of censorship in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign. With Democrats boycotting the hearing, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the legal orders if Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey did not agree to testify voluntarily. The committee wants to hear from them about “the suppression and/or censorship of two news articles from the New York Post,” according to the subpoena document. Senators also want information from the executives about their companies’ policies for moderating content “that may interfere” with federal elections. Representatives of Facebook and Twitter declined comment. The urgency ratcheted higher Thursday as US officials said Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local governments in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers. The revelation was certain to stoke fears that Americans’ confidence in the November 3 election results could be undermined. Russia backed President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign through hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign. Facebook became an unwitting conduit for misinformation and election disruption. Facebook and Twitter acted last week to limit the online dissemination and sharing of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post that targeted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The story, which other publications have not confirmed, cited unverified emails from Biden’s son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump’s allies. One email purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet the elder Biden, who was vice president at the time. Trump’s campaign seized on the report, though the account raised more questions than answers, including whether emails at the centre of the story were hacked or fabricated. The FBI is investigating whether the emails are part of a foreign influence operation. It was the first time in recent memory that the two social media platforms enforced rules against misinformation on a story from a mainstream media publication. With the election looming, Facebook and Twitter have scrambled to stem the tide of material seen as potentially inciting violence and spreading disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories. Facebook has expanded its restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. Trump has raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process. The companies also have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene in speech on their platforms. With Trump leading the way, conservatives have stepped up their claims that Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, are biased, charging without evidence Silicon Valley’s social media platforms are deliberately suppressing conservative views. The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation, on a bipartisan vote, recently authorized subpoenas for Zuckerberg, Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The three have agreed to testify for a hearing planned for next week. Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that they say can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized the CEOs for failing to police content, focusing on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the United States. In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists. From both political parties, the companies have come under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from state attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech. On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark antitrust case against Google, accusing it of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to boost profits. It was the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. Facebook, Amazon and Apple also have been targets of antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

23-10-2020||World||Joe Biden aides say he’s ready for Donald Trump debate attacks on Hunter||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s campaign said he’s ready for a confrontation at Thursday’s debate with President Donald Trump as the incumbent says he will attempt to steer the discussion to allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden.“Every time he does that all he’s doing is reinforcing what we’ve said all along: He’s acknowledging he has no case for a second term; he has no answers to the failures of the last four years and no plans or vision for the next four,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a telephone call with reporters.At rallies and in interviews before the debate, Trump has made clear that he intends to focus the forum on airing allegations that Hunter Biden engaged in corrupt practices in Ukraine and China -- claims that the president says the media is ignoring.“Of course, the president will be looking for opportunities to make clear to the American people just exactly what Joe Biden has done,” Richard Grenell, a longtime Trump adviser, said on a call with reporters.In a written statement, Trump campaign director Tim Murtaugh said “the only question left is if Joe Biden is compromised by the Communist Party of China.” One of Hunter Biden’s former business associates, Tony Bobulinski, will be a guest of Trump’s campaign at the debate, according to Fox News.The 90-minute debate will be one of the last potential turning points of the 2020 election, as Biden and Trump seek to improve their performances at 9 p.m. New York time after what political consultants from both parties say was a disastrous first meeting.The topics for Thursday’s debate are: the coronavirus, “American families,” racial issues, climate change, national security and leadership, according to the commission.Trump will need to tamp down his aggressive posture from the first encounter, which cost him some support, and make the case for a second term, a line of argument he has struggled with in the past.Biden, who is ahead by nearly 8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, has to avoid any debate-defining gaffes that change the status quo. And he needs to minimize reactions to Trump’s provocations.As he left Wilmington for the debate site in Nashville, Biden said he hoped that the encounter wouldn’t be a repeat of the chaotic first debate in late September and that Trump would follow guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19.“Hopefully he’s going to play by the rules. Hopefully everybody’s been tested. Hopefully it’s all been worked out what the rules are. We’re looking forward to it,” Biden said.The debate at Belmont University, will have one twist after Trump talked over Biden repeatedly during the last face-off, in Cleveland. Moderators will now mute the candidates while the other gives his initial two-minute response on each topic.Presidential campaigns usually have three general election debates but Thursday’s will be the second and final one.After Trump’s hospitalization for Covid-19 and with the next debate only 14 days after his positive test result, the commission decided to make the Oct. 15 forum virtual. Trump refused to participate and the two candidates instead held dueling televised town halls from different cities. The combined ratings for the two programs drew a fraction of the viewership that a debate normally attracts.“You have one more debate that’s been heightened because the second one didn’t occur. Debates matter,” said David Winston, a veteran Republican strategist.The Trump team said earlier this week it believed the debate would focus on foreign policy, something that neither the commission nor moderator Kristen Welker of NBC had ever committed to publicly.The Trump campaign said it would force Biden to account for his nearly five decades of foreign policy positions. Trump has long downplayed the threat posed by the virus and has only intensified that message since his recovery.Biden has hammered Trump for what he considers a cavalier approach toward the pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people in the US.The Trump campaign has indicated that he is especially eager to attack Biden on a recent report in the New York Post that purports to cite emails between Hunter Biden and leaders of the Ukrainian energy firm whose board he sat on.Unverified emails the paper published after obtaining them from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani show a Ukrainian businessman thanking Hunter Biden “for the opportunity” to meet Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time.The Biden campaign said a review of the vice president’s calendars shows no such meeting.It has also repeatedly stressed that policy positions taken by the US government and key allies were not influenced by Hunter Biden’s work.Another purported email says that Hunter Biden was receiving $10 million annually from a Chinese billionaire for “introductions alone,” though it is unclear who was involved in the introductions.Trump has long sought to cast Biden as soft on China, believing it a winning message with voters even as his own record includes plenty of praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-aides-say-he-s-ready-for-donald-trump-debate-attacks-on-hunter/story-DDIYSS9jkJZZ3kPQ1zmvGK.html
23-10-2020||World||Personally allowed Navalny to get treatment abroad, says Russian President Putin||Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected accusations of the Kremlin’s involvement in the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, saying Thursday that he personally allowed his political foe to be flown to Germany for treatment.Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator and Putin’s most visible and determined opponent, fell ill on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and was flown to Germany two days later. He is still recovering there.Tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that the poison used on Navalny was a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Navalny asserted that his poisoning only could have been ordered by spymasters who wouldn’t have made such decisions without Putin’s personal involvement.Making his first public comments on Navalny’s poisoning, Putin said he had asked Russian prosecutors to allow Navalny to be flown to Germany from Siberia, where he first was hospitalized.“If authorities wanted to poison (him), they would hardly have allowed him to be sent to Germany for treatment,” Putin said during a video call with international foreign policy experts.The Russian leader noted that when Navalny’s wife asked to allow his treatment abroad, he personally asked the prosecutors to waive the restrictions on his travel stemming from an ongoing criminal probe.“I asked the Prosecutor General’s office to allow that, and he left,” he said.Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, chafed at Putin’s arguments, tweeting that “in Russia, a human life doesn’t matter” and Putin decides at his whim “whether you live or die.”Putin expressed regret about Germany’s refusal to share samples it said proved Navalny was poisoned with a type of Novichok, the same class of Soviet-designed nerve agent that was used to poison former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain in 2018.The Russian hospital that first treated Navalny said it found no evidence he was poisoned. Russian authorities have said they conducted a preliminary investigation but argued that they needed proof of poisoning to launch a full-fledged criminal inquiry.“Give us the biological materials and the official conclusions that would allow us to investigate it, and give official and formal grounds for opening a criminal case,” Putin said. “They have given us nothing. And there is no explanation why.”The Russian president said he offered to send experts to Germany to conduct a joint investigation, but alleged that Germany and its allies have stonewalled the proposal.“Let’s conduct a joint probe,” Putin said. “We are ready to work with full vigor.”The Kremlin has reiterated that before Navalny’s transfer to Charite Hospital in Berlin, Russian labs and a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk found no sign of a poisoning. Moscow has called for Germany and the OPCW to provide its evidence, and bristled at Western leaders’ insistence that Russia answer questions about what happened to the politician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/personally-allowed-navalny-to-get-treatment-abroad-says-russian-president-putin/story-b1NUMeA9cJgvVG71X7Kp9K.html
23-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Gilead’s Remdesivir is first virus drug to get FDA approval||The US Food and Drug Administration approved Gilead Sciences Inc.’s antiviral therapy remdesivir on Thursday, making it the first drug to obtain formal clearance for treating the coronavirus.Regulators had granted an emergency-use authorization for remdesivir earlier this year, and since then the drug has become a widely used therapy in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It was given to President Donald Trump this month when he was diagnosed with the virus.The approval of remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, will allow Gilead to market the drug and talk about its benefits to doctors, nurses, and patients. That could help solidify its position as a go-to medicine for Covid-19 patients even as other drugs for the disease begin to reach the market.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Veklury is now the first and only approved Covid-19 treatment in the United States,” Gilead said in a statement. While the drug was in short supply initially, Gilead said that the medicine is now widely available in hospitals across the country as manufacturing capacity has rapidly expanded.The drug hasn’t been proven to reduce deaths from Covid-19. In a World Health Organization trial, the medicine failed to reduce fatalities, according to preliminary results that were posted on preprint servers last week.Gilead has criticized the WHO study. In a letter posted on the company’s website, Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said the findings don’t negate other results.Shares of Gilead gained 4.1% in trading after the close of regular market hours on Thursday. Analysts estimate that remdesivir will have sales of $2.17 billion this year, according to 13 surveyed by Bloomberg.The company said in June that it will charge US hospitals roughly $3,120 for most patients who need remdesivir.Read more: Gilead Chooses Middle Ground in Pricing of Coronavirus DrugThe approval is based on a US government-sponsored trial involving more than 1,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients that found that those who received the drug recovered about five days faster than those who got a placebo.The overall side-effect rate was similar to the placebo in the government study. The most common side effects are nausea and elevated liver enzymes, according to the product’s label.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-s-remdesivir-is-first-virus-drug-to-get-fda-approval/story-5UXtaxI1lW4kCeSfZdnfLN.html

Through hundreds of pages of testimony, Maxwell pushed back against questioning by an opposing lawyer or simply wouldn’t answer questions.“Have you ever observed Mr. Epstein having a massage given by an individual, a female, who was under the age of 18?” Maxwell was asked in the deposition.“No,” Maxwell answered.“I never saw any inappropriate underage activities with Jeffrey ever,” she added.Though the deposition includes several pages of questions about men that Epstein knew and whether they were introduced to underage girls, the names have been redacted.The British socialite is being held in a Brooklyn, New York, lockup while she awaits trial next year on charges she trafficked girls as young as 14 for her former boyfriend to abuse. The U.S. also says she participated in some of the alleged assaults and lied during portions of her sworn testimony in depositions. She has denied wrongdoing.Civil LawsuitThe testimony released on Thursday came from a separate defamation lawsuit filed against Maxwell by one of her accusers, Virginia Giuffre. Over Maxwell’s strenuous objections, a federal judge in Manhattan this year ordered documents in that case to be made public, and an appeals court agreed on Monday.The transcripts from 2016 are the only substantive public record from Maxwell about what she said she did for Epstein, her onetime boyfriend and employer.Giuffre claimed in the lawsuit that Maxwell and Epstein made her a sex slave for the money manager when she was 16. Giuffre sued Maxwell in 2015 for calling her account “obvious lies.” The case was later settled for an undisclosed amount.“Just for the record, I have never at any time, at any place, in any moment, ever asked Virginia Roberts or whatever she is called now to have sex with anybody,” Maxwell testified in the deposition, citing Guiffre’s maiden name.The deposition occurred on April 22, 2016, and it’s likely that prosecutors will seek to present the testimony to jurors in Maxwell’s criminal trial. In the criminal case, prosecutors claim Maxwell lied nine times in the deposition when she denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities, including his recruitment of girls and his interactions with them at his properties.Parts of the deposition offer detail into Epstein’s lifestyle.“Sometimes people in the privacy of a house and swimming pool, I have seen people from time to time take their top off,” Maxwell testified. “I have seen people from time to time do that. Very unusual. Naked people around the people at any frequent period of time, I have never seen.”Repeatedly, though, Maxwell called Giuffre’s claims “lies” and “stories” and denied many of her accuser’s allegations.Maxwell frequently challenged her questioner, including asking at one point, “Would you like to ask the question properly?” and responding to one query, “Moving on.” That prompted the lawyer questioning her to remind her that she wasn’t in charge of the proceeding.At one point, she told the questioner: “You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap me, I will not be trapped.”At another point, she said, “Perhaps you are not really familiar with what massage is.” The questioner responded, “I am, I don’t need a lecture on massage.”“I think you do,” she said.Maxwell, when asked if she sought any female to carry Epstein’s baby for him, said that’s “completely rubbish.”“I never asked anybody to carry a baby for me,” she said, adding that she didn’t “recall any baby conversations with Jeffrey.”She admitted that Epstein bought her a car and loaned her money to buy a townhouse, but said she didn’t remember details of other gifts. She said he was not paying her legal fees. The two met in 1991, she said.Maxwell was questioned about a Jan. 12, 2015, email from Epstein in which he suggested she offer “rewards” to Giuffre’s friends and family to contradict her story. “Absolutely not,” Maxwell responded when asked if she ever offered such a reward. She said she had “no idea” if Epstein ever offered a reward.‘Not Coordinating’“I was not coordinating with Jeffrey,” she said when asked if she was working with Epstein to malign Giuffre.Asked if she was a citizen of “any other land” besides the U.S. and U.K., Maxwell answered “TerraMar,” which a lawyer then said was a charity project that dealt with oceans.After the deposition, Giuffre’s lawyers wrote to the court saying that Maxwell had been so evasive that they needed to question her again. Noting that Maxwell claimed any sexual interactions were with adults, they asked that she be ordered to answer their questions once again.Portions of Maxwell’s depositions and other material tied to Epstein were made public in August 2019. A day later, Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell where he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges involving girls and women. Authorities later said he hanged himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-denied-recruiting-girls-in-newly-unsealed-testimony/story-pFDIKqGafA37gPxHd7CFyO.html
23-10-2020||World||Documents British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell fought to keep secret released by US court||British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell said under oath in 2016 that she had never witnessed “inappropriate underage activities” by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to a deposition released on Thursday that she had fought hard to keep secret.Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls as young as 14 to engage in illegal sexual acts in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement in any such scheme when she gave her deposition under oath.In the April 2016 deposition from a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre - who has said Epstein kept her as a “sex slave” with Maxwell’s assistance - she did not answer directly whether she believed Epstein sexually abused minors.Also Read: Ghislaine Maxwell denied recruiting girls for Jeffrey Epstein in newly unsealed testimonyShe said instead that the only allegations she knew came from Giuffre, whom she called a “liar.”Maxwell, daughter of the late British publisher Robert Maxwell, was asked questions about her relationship with Epstein, who employed her to help run his properties, and allegations by Giuffre, according to the transcript.“I never saw any inappropriate underage activities with Jeffrey ever,” she said.“I can’t testify to what Jeffrey did or didn’t do,” Maxwell said. She later added: “I can only testify to what I know and the fact that she (Giuffre) has lied about me from the beginning to the end and repeatedly causes me to question anything that she may feel.”Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Giuffre, said in a statement that the deposition’s release was “a long-time coming and a welcome step towards revealing the evidence of the scope and scale of the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking ring.”Giuffre and the Miami Herald newspaper had sought the unsealing.DENIES WRONGDOINGU.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan had directed that a transcript of Maxwell’s testimony and other documents be released.Epstein once counted U.S. President Donald Trump, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew as friends. They have not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.Giuffre has said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including Andrew when she was 17 years old. Andrew has denied the allegations.Maxwell testified that she flew on Epstein’s planes with Clinton but wouldn’t characterize the two men as friends or acquaintances and said she was never on one of Epstein’s private islands with Clinton.“One of (the) lies she told was that President Clinton was on the island where I was present. Absolutely 1000% that is a flat out total fabrication and lie,” Maxwell said in a deposition that lasted 9-1/2 hours.Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.While Maxwell repeatedly denied wrongdoing, she was asked several times whether any indecent activities were taking place in Epstein’s orbit. Her lawyers have said the fact the questions were asked could suggest to the public that Giuffre’s lawyers believed they might have had a basis to ask them, even if the conduct never happened.JAILED PENDING TRIALLawyers for Maxwell had argued that making the deposition public could imperil her ability to get a fair trial, because jurors might hold its contents against her. A trial is scheduled for July 2021.Maxwell was arrested on July 2 in Bradford, New Hampshire, where authorities said she was hiding on a property she bought in December in an all-cash transaction with her identity shielded. She is locked up in a Brooklyn jail after the judge in her criminal case called her an unacceptable flight risk.Maxwell told lawyers that she was employed by Epstein and hired assistants, architects, decorators, cooks, cleaners, gardeners, pool people and pilots as part of the upkeep of six homes, according to the transcript, which takes up 418 pages.“... a very small part of my job was from time to time to find adult professional massage therapists for Jeffrey,” the transcript said.Maxwell appeared evasive as a lawyer for Giuffre pressed her on whether she hired Giuffre to give Epstein an erotic massage.“Virginia Roberts held herself out as a masseuse and invited herself to come and give a massage,” Maxwell testified.The deposition and other documents were cleared for release after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Monday rejected Maxwell’s “meritless” arguments that her interests outweighed the presumption the public should see the materials.Many names in the transcript of the deposition were blacked out.Epstein killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 at a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges announced the previous month.He had previously escaped federal prosecution by pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state prostitution charges, an agreement now widely considered too lenient.Asked why she maintained contact with Epstein after his guilty plea, Maxwell responded that she was “a very loyal person and Jeffrey was very good to me when my father passed away and I believe that you need to be a good friend in people’s hour of need and that it was a very thoughtful, nice thing for me to do ...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/documents-british-socialite-ghislaine-maxwell-fought-to-keep-secret-released-by-us-court/story-fy6jWDm3xTyZ6x4UeogmLP.html
23-10-2020||India||As onion prices soar, govt sets stock limit for traders||Onion prices are currently more than 100% of the past five years’ average, prompting the government to declare them as an essential commodity and imposing limits on how much traders can store. Retail traders of onion can stock onion only up to two tonne of the vegetable, while wholesale traders are permitted store up to 25 tonne, the consumer affairs ministry said Friday, a measure aimed at discouraging hoarding of the bulb, as prices spiral during the ongoing festive season. Rains in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana have disrupted harvests and damaged crops, trimming supplies to markets.“The all-India average retail price variation of onions as on 21 October when compared to last year is 22.12 % (from ₹45.33 to ₹55.60 per/kg) and when compared to last five years’ average is 114.96 % (from ₹25.87 to 55.60 per/ kg). Therefore, the prices have increased by over 100% when compared with average of last 5 years and thus the price triggers under EC Act have been reached,” the ministry said. Price levels needed to invoke stock limits under the recently amended Essential Commodities Act have been breached and the stockholding limits will be in place till December 31, consumer affairs secretary Leena Nandan said. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) law, passed last month in Parliament, allows the government to regulate perishable commodities when an extraordinary price rise occurs. The ministry statement further said: “In order to moderate the price rise, the government took a pre-emptive step by announcing a ban on onion export on 14 September so as to ensure availability to domestic consumers at reasonable rates, before the expected arrival of Kharif onion.” It added: “Thus the retail price rise was moderated to some extent, but recent reports of heavy rainfall in the onion growing districts of Maharashtra, Karnataka,Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradeshhave created concerns about damage to Kharif crop.”On Twitter, consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal said: “To control rising onion prices and curb hoarding, PM @NarendraModi government has taken the third step. Imposed stock limit of 2 tonne on retailers and 25 tonne on wholesalers.” The two earlier steps were to impose a ban on exports on Sept 5 and offloading of onions from the a federally held reserve. “Past experiences show that during sustained supply-side pressures, measures such as stock-holding limits may not dramatically alter the demand-supply mismatch,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-onion-prices-soar-govt-sets-stock-limit-for-traders/story-V4UgBybhTWF0tY5qwsdQDL.html
23-10-2020||India||‘India building ‘Asian NATO’ through Quad?’ S Jaishankar answers||The emergence of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which brings together India, Australia, Japan and the US, is an outcome of today’s multi-polar world, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. “It is very much in keeping with the times, and we will find increasingly in a multi-polar world, and a more fractured world...these ad hoc combinations of countries who will work together,” he said during an online interaction organised by the Public Affairs Forum of India (PAFI). The four countries in the Quad had come together because they find it useful to consult on issues of mutual interest, such as maritime security, connectivity counter-terrorism, resilient supply chains and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, Jaishankar said in response to a question on whether India is involved in building an “Asian NATO”. The world has moved from the Cold War era, marked by two dominant blocs and non-alignment, to a time of greater multi-polarity, when more countries can shape and influence outcomes, he said. The West has become less collective, there has been a change in the power of the US and the world has also witnessed the rise of China, he added. Earlier this month, Jaishankar participated in the second ministerial meeting of the Quad, where the four countries agreed to continue working for a free and open Indo-Pacific against the backdrop of China’s growing assertive behaviour. Next month, the navies of the four countries will participate in the Malabar exercise, with Australia recently accepting India’s invitation to join the drills. Referring to the changing dynamics in global power equations, Jaishankar described the rise of China as a “big geo-political event of our lifetimes”. The multi-polar world will create its own logic, he said. “The underlying idea is a consistent India. Independent India will express itself very differently and that is today in an example like Quad. Quad is not the only example where four countries have found it useful to consult on issues which are in their common interest,” he added. As India grows, it may have similar arrangements with other countries as well, Jaishankar suggested. “Since we have so many agendas as we become bigger, we will have areas where we will work with other countries,” he said. This wasn’t a dramatic shift, as India had also worked with other countries in the past, he said. “You had three countries who felt they had a common interest in working together to strengthen their hand vis-a-vis the West. The three countries were Russia, India and China. So before there was a Quad, there was a triangle,” he said. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific amid China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour has led to some quarters describing the Quad as a coalition with the aim of countering Beijing. Senior US officials have also spoken about the possibility of regularising and formalising the Quad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-building-asian-nato-through-quad-s-jaishankar-answers/story-zBVAmTRIeXhnukEcHb8DbJ.html
23-10-2020||India||It’s a much better time than before for actors: Ahem Sharrma||Actor Ahem Sharrma, best remembered as Karna of TV series ‘Mahabharat’, is currently shooting in Lucknow for Sanjiv Jaiswal’s film ‘Bagawat’. Life came to full circle for ‘Brahmarakshas’ actor as he is shooting for his first project in the state capital after his TV debut in 2008 series ‘Chand ke Paar Chalo’ that was set here but shot in Mumbai. “I was very curious about Lucknow as my co-actor Yami Gautam and others used to talk so much about the city. I played a London-return son of nawab. All that grew my curiosity further about tehzeeb, people, language, old-world charm and food. Then I came once for a show promotion which was just touch-and-go. This time I got chance to stay for long and despite pandemic I took out time for the city tour and had ‘chaat’ at Hazratganj,” he said with host of praises for the city and its people. Giving an insight about his current project he said, “I have never done such a role before and all I can say is that the audience will be in for a big surprise. The character is also very far from real me as the film is based on caste conflicts, revolts against atrocities and I’m representing a certain class.” Ahem has done couple of films but admits that television has given me lot of love and recognition. “Main bahut shukraguzar hu is medium ka,’ that gave me a chance to play legendary Karan, which is certainly a dream role for any actor. I feel blessed that I was able to reach out to a large audience with my character.” The actor believes in quality over quantity, “I have been very selective while taking up TV as it’s a long-term commitment. As far as films are concerned, I have done a few films but it couldn’t reach to right audience. In fact, I started my career with film the ‘Blue Oranges’ but it did not click. Had there been OTT platforms then it would have surely worked. But, it’s great that today we have a medium with a global reach. . It’s a much better time than before for actors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-a-much-better-time-than-before-for-actors-ahem-sharrma/story-lHt0WOSSwFYBFG8rsBluzH.html
23-10-2020||India||No tolerance for corruption, no place for middlemen in new India: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said there is “no tolerance for corruption” and “no place for middlemen” in new India, underlining that his government has worked tirelessly for removing corruption from the country.In his message for Vigilance Awareness Week, to be observed by all government departments from October 27 till November 2, PM Modi said, “We have worked tirelessly to remove corruption and to punish the corrupt. In new India, there is no tolerance for corruption and no place for middlemen”.He further asked the citizens to play the role of “equal partners” in the fight against corruption.“It is imperative that vigilant citizens as equal partners strengthen the processes for effective delivery unto the last,” the PM added in his written message.The Vigilance Awareness Week is observed every year by all government departments on the call of Chief Vigilance Commission (CVC), the apex body having superintendence of vigilance administration and anti-corruption measures in central government and its organisations. The theme of this year’s week long program is “Satark Bharat, Samriddh Bharat (Vigilant India, Prosperous India)”.The Commission has asked all government departments this year to conduct various activities with zeal and enthusiasm “to eliminate corruption in public life”.The PM said that the theme this year invokes collective alertness of all citizens for a strong and prosperous India and the observance of vigilance week “will inspire people to rededicate themselves for the new work culture of transparency and responsibility”.He said, “We are marching ahead with resoluteness to build a New India that is self-reliant, a nation that continuously expands its capabilities and focuses on skill acquisition. Our resolve is powered by people’s participation.”“Our vision of development is human-centric, one where the fruits of prosperity reach everyone in an equitable manner. This can be realised only when 130 crore Indians remain aware and vigilant and perform their duties and responsibilities as proud citizens,” the PM’s further added.Talking about the steps taken by the government in the last few years, the PM said: “...we have repealed several outdated laws and simplified processes. We have been striving to utilise technology optimally to improve Ease of Living and enhance Ease of Doing Business.”According to people familiar with the developments, some major steps taken by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, led by PM Modi in the last six years, include setting up a court monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) to keep a check on generation of black money.The SIT has, till March this year, detected Rs 70,000 crore worth black money, which includes Rs 16,000 crore in offshore accounts.The Black Money act 2015 was passed by the government which allows 90% penalty on undisclosed assets.In 2016, the government passed Benami Transactions Amendment Act, which enables confiscation of Benami property. Subsequently, in 2018, Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) act was brought in which allowed agencies to confiscate properties of fraudsters abroad as well. Till now, former liquor baron Vijay Mallya and diamond businessman Nirav Modi have been declared as FEOs and their extradition is being pursued in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-tolerance-of-corruption-no-place-for-middlemen-in-new-india-pm-modi/story-JKIewV8igNkf6fBSHnOEXN.html
23-10-2020||India||TRP Scam case: Arnab Goswami to appear before Mumbai police on October 24||Arnab Goswami, Republic TV editor-in-chief, will be appearing before Mumbai Police on Saturday in connection with the probe into the alleged TRP scam case. Goswami was earlier exempted from appearing before Mumbai Police on October 16 after his lawyer submitted a plea.A first information report (FIR) under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) such as criminal breach of trust, criminal conspiracy and cheating has been filed by the Mumbai Police’s Crime Branch against Republic TV channel and its senior officials. The FIR also names two other local regional channels in the matter. The FIR claims that these channels have manipulated TRPs (Television Rating Point), which then decides who gets more advertisements. So far, six people have been arrested in the case.Mumbai Police on Friday filed a fresh FIR against Republic TV and its employees for allegedly maligning the police’s image and inciting ‘disaffection’ among the police officers against commissioner Param Bir Singh. The FIR also names the channel’s executive editor, two reporters, anchor and several editorial staff members.The new FIR filed on Friday has been lodged by the Special Branch-1 (SB1), which is the intelligence wing of the Mumbai Police. The FIR, which was filed by a sub-inspector at the Social Media Lab (SML), has been registered at the NM Joshi Marg police station. According to the FIR, the police officials at SML on October 22 observed that Goswami’s TV channel broadcasted a show under its segment ‘Biggest Story Tonight’ which alleged that commissioner Param Bir Singh is spoiling the Mumbai Police’s image and his orders are not acceptable to the junior officials in the department.“By broadcasting such content, the channel and its journalists intentionally tried to incite disaffection among the police personnel against the police commissioner and the act also maligns Mumbai Police’s image,” the complainant said in the FIR.This is the fourth criminal case filed against Republic TV channel and its employees by the Mumbai Police. Apart from this and the TRP case, Goswami already has two FIRs registered against him at the Pydhonie police station and NM Joshi Marg police station respectively on charges of instigating communal tension and spreading hatred between two communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trp-scam-case-arnab-goswami-republic-tv-chief-to-appear-before-mumbai-police-on-october-24/story-NDjzfpaarJQMiDnUVAc9mK.html
23-10-2020||India||Amid criticism, Nagaland clarifies Hornbill Festival will be held virtually||The Nagaland government has attracted criticism from various quarters after a notification of its tourism department asking allied departments to initiate preparations for the annual Hornbill Festival, which is held from December 1 till 10, was circulated on social media platforms.Although the department had later clarified in sections of local media that the state’s premier festival would be organised virtually, opposition Naga People’s Front (NPF) swiftly reacted against celebration of any festival amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The NPF issued a statement on Friday terming the move of the NDPP-BJP coalition government in the state as a ‘suicidal mission’ as Covid cases are spiking up day after day.“Even if the celebration may be in virtual form, a festival is a festival, and in any festival, celebration without people’s participation there cannot be any celebration. Therefore, if the government is in the process to celebrate the festival without public participation then there is no need to hold any celebration,” the NPF said.Reminding the government that the virus could not be stopped from entering the state even when total lockdown was imposed, the party questioned as to how far it was safe to celebrate the Hornbill Festival in whatever way the government was contemplating, and whether the government could assure the safety of participants.While stating that the Hornbill Festival used to be a perfect opportunity to improve the state’s tourism sector and a time to showcase the traditional heritage of its tribes to the outside world, the opposition party felt that the influx of international and domestic tourists into the state during the pandemic would prove catastrophic.The tourism department had recorded a total of 2,82,811 visitors in the 2019 edition of the Hornbill Festival, including 3,015 foreign tourists and 55,584 domestic tourists.As of Friday, Nagaland’s Covid positive cases have reached 8,436, including 22 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-criticism-nagaland-clarifies-hornbill-festival-will-be-held-virtually/story-1OZx7rnVIB4Ain7t45uYYM.html

23-10-2020||India||FATF keeps Pakistan off blacklist for now, warns that it can’t take forever||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday decided to retain Pakistan on its “grey list”, giving it time till February next year to address what the multilateral watchdog said were “very serious deficiencies” in its efforts to counter terror financing. The decision was announced at the end of FATF’s three-day virtual plenary meeting, and the body’s president, Marcus Pleyer, cautioned that Pakistan would not be given a chance “forever” to address outstanding issues. Repeated failure to deliver on FATF’s action plan would result in a country being put in the “black list”, he said. Pakistan was placed in FATF’s list of “jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or grey list in 2018 for failing to control terror financing and money laundering. In a virtual repeat of the warning issued to Pakistan in February, FATF said in a statement: “As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021.” Pleyer, at a virtual news conference, said Pakistan had “largely addressed” 21 of 27 items in its action plan and the government had signalled its commitment to complete the rest. “But it is clear [that] even though Pakistan has made progress, it needs to do more. Pakistan cannot stop, it needs to continue to carry out reforms, particularly to implement targeted financial sanctions and prosecute and sanction those financing terrorism,” he said. The work done by Pakistan “definitely means the world has become safer but the six outstanding items are very serious deficiencies that still have to be repaired, and for that reason, the risks [have not been overcome]”, Pleyer added. In an apparent reference to Pakistan’s repeated failures to meet deadlines for the action plan, Pleyer said: “As long as we see that the country is progressing with the action items, and we have seen progress with Pakistan, we give them a chance to repair the outstanding issues but we don’t do this forever.” He added, “You can look at other countries where after a while, we have seen there is no longer progress on the action plan and the action plan has not been completed, then the countries are pushed to the black list.” Pleyer made it clear Pakistan wouldn’t be out of the woods with mere completion of the action plan. Once FATF’s plenary agrees that all 27 items had been completed, there will be an on-site visit by an assessment team to verify information given by Pakistan and see that all measures are working effectively. “After that on-site visit, the next plenary will then decide whether Pakistan has indeed fully and effectively completed the action plan and then there is a decision on whether Pakistan would leave the grey list or not,” he said. Besides, Pleyer cautioned that Pakistan is also subject to an evaluation by FATF’s regional affiliate, the Australia-based Asia Pacific Group. In its latest report issued in September, APG concluded Pakistan has fully complied with only two of 40 recommendations to counter terror financing and money laundering, and that it was “non-compliant” on four recommendations, “partially compliant” on 25 and “largely compliant” on nine. FATF’s statement said Pakistan should continue addressing its “strategic deficiencies”, including demonstrating that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terror financing activity and that investigations and prosecutions target designated persons and entities. Pakistan should demonstrate that terror financing prosecutions result in “effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions”, and it should show “effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions” against terrorists designated by the UN Security Council and those acting on their behalf by preventing the raising and transferring of funds, identifying and freezing assets, and prohibiting access to funds and financial services. Islamabad should also demonstrate enforcement and action against non-profit organisations, which are often used as fronts by Pakistan-based terror groups, the statement said. Pleyer brushed aside a question on whether Pakistan is being discriminated against by saying the country is being treated in line with the same rules that have been accepted by 205 countries globally. He also dismissed a question from a Pakistani body about the alleged involvement of Indian banks in terror financing, saying FATF isn’t an investigative body. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the six action items FATF is pressuring Pakistan to implement are the “most crucial ones that will help finish off the terror groups”. “Pakistan has was hoping to convince the watchdog to remove it from the grey list but FATF has taken a more serious view and asked Pakistan to go full throttle and terminate the state’s support to terror groups, which Pakistan will find difficult to do given the history of these groups being used as proxies by the army,” he said. “Implementing the full action plan won’t be easy because of the fear of retribution from these terror groups. We can expect Pakistan to enact more dramas, such as a crackdown and prosecution of terrorists, before the next FATF meeting,” he added. There was no immediate reaction to FATF’s decision from Indian officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatf-keeps-pakistan-off-blacklist-for-now-warns-that-it-can-t-take-forever/story-t2v3AQXgichIlOZriQaBBJ.html

23-10-2020||India||‘Thakur village’ signboard sparks tension in UP’s Meerut area||Tension prevailed in Bastora Narang village of Hastinapur in Meerut after a group of Thakurs declared it a ‘Thakur village’ on Wednesday. They put up a sign board to this effect at the entrance of the village, with paintings of Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan. Other communities, including Scheduled Castes, Muslims and Kashyaps objected to this move and submitted a complaint in the Hastinapur police station on Thursday, accusing the Thakurs of provoking people and trying to incite a caste confrontation in the village. The village has a population of over 8,000, dominated by Thakurs, followed by Scheduled Castes, Muslims, Kashyaps, Sikhs and other communities. Gram Sabha member Indramani Jayant said, “We have lived here for generations amid peace and brotherhood. Now some notorious elements are trying to incite a caste-flare-up.” Station house officer of Hastinapur police station Ashok Kumar visited the village on Friday after the signboard picture started doing the rounds on social media. He held a meeting with villagers to resolve the issue. Kumar claimed that the issue was resolved after members of both sides agreed in writing that the board would be repainted with ‘Village Bastora Natang Welcomes You’. Villagers, however, said that the Thakurs had merely omitted the word ‘Thakur’ and ‘Rajputana’ instead of repainting the board and writing a welcome message on it. Deshraj Kashyap, a villager, said that it all started on Wednesday when a group of Thakurs painted a state government board put up for the publicity of PM Saubhagya Yojna. It was then installed at the entrance of the village after writing “Thakur Gram Bastora Narang me aapka hardik Swagat hai”(Thakur village Bastora Narang heartily welcomes you) with pictures of Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan. Indramani Jayant demanded that action should be initiated against those who attempted to sabotage peace and harmony in the village and the controversial board should immediately be uprooted. SHO Kumar said that those who were involved in it would be identified and strict action will be taken against them. He said that no case had been registered in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thakur-village-signboard-sparks-tension-in-uttar-pradesh-s-meerut/story-jRV6sqvucxntN9CcBhYHJK.html

23-10-2020||India||‘Lucknow gives very pleasant vibes’||Leaving a well-paid job behind to pursue her dream of acting, actor Donal Bisht feels that she is more than glad to have taken the decision. “I believe that passion should be followed else one tends to regret it later in life. I left a media job, of a flourishing anchor, to fulfill my dream. I remember how I used to work throughout the month in Delhi and travel to Mumbai for auditions on off days. It was very difficult to persuade my parents as for them I had a good job and that was important,” said the pretty actor during her recent visit to Lucknow for a shoot. The ‘Dil Toh Happy Hai Ji’ actor said that being camera friendly made her crack auditions promptly. “Yes, it took me just four months before I was able to get roles in shows like ‘Kalash Ek Vishwas’, ‘Ek Deewana Tha’, ‘Roop’, ‘Ek Mard Ka Naya Swaroop’ among others. As an actor, I got opportunity to portray stories of different characters. Being an anchor did make me camera-friendly and it was easy to emote as I was never camera shy.”Her Lucknow visit was for a video shoot. “It was a short visit but still I loved it. I got such pleasant and spiritual vibes from the city that it made me all de-stressed. Hopefully next time I’ll get more time to savour Mughlai delicacies,” Donal said. Talking about her current shows she said, “Thankfully in these tough times I’m able sustain and get quality work. Web series ‘The Socho Project’ is a beautiful musical story where I play a rockstar whereas the other series is a very emotional drama with actor Iqbal Khan.

23-10-2020||India||‘I don’t do roles that fail to excite me’||After a career span of almost two decades, versatile actor Shakti Anand wishes to only do projects that excite him. “Unlike two decades back, the audience today is smart and fast. They have an in-built dislike button. That being so, I don’t wish to give my blood and sweat to a show, or series, that fails to excite me. ‘Maza nai ayega toh public watch nahin karegi’ irrespective of the money spent on the project,” said Anand, best remembered for shows like ‘Saara Akaash,’ and ‘Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.’He said that having big names in the cast does pull in audiences to a show, “Audiences trust those actors who they have watched on screen for years but that charm is short-lived, say for a week. After that it’s only script and right characterisation that can take a show forward,” he said. About working during the pandemic, Anand said, “I was working during the peak of the pandemic, as my project demanded it, and so we shot in Goa. Initially, I was in a state of panic but as the work started it was all okay. Luckily, work continued to pour in and being selective, I picked up two-three projects both for OTT as well as TV.” Anand is currently shooting for a web as well as a TV show and enjoying playing diverse characters. “When I was offered TV daily ‘Humari Waali Good News’ I loved the idea but was in two minds to age on screen and play a lifeless character that has nothing much to do. But when they confirmed the script, my role actually did come out well etched. On the web, I’ll be seen playing an antagonist in the upcoming series ‘Naxalbari’ and I’m loving every bit of it. Another OTT series is also in the pipeline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-don-t-do-roles-that-fail-to-excite-me/story-Nc1A2HLgJ6ZyRVCCfytO6I.html
23-10-2020||India||Lucknow keeps festive spirit high||Durga Puja festivities started off in high spirits but with precautions. A number of pandals in the state capital began the celebrations with ‘sthaphana’ ritual in presence of core-committee members on ‘shrashti’ (sixth day) of Navratri. Thin attendance was witnessed at the puja pandals, which for the first time were sans food stalls, ‘bhog’ counters and entertainment zones. Pushpanjali (offering of flowers) to the deity has been replaced by ‘aanjali’ (offering with imaginary). The fun element full of chit-chat, gossip, baithiki and adda baazi at food counters might be missing this year but puja spirit still remains high, said Jayonto Sarkar of Trans Gomti Dussehera & Durga Puja Committee. “Instead of Chandrashekar Azad Park we organised puja at a guest house with a limited entry to abide by the safety rules. We are not encouraging people from outside and admission has been restricted from nearby-areas only,” he informed. Ankita Khan, who has set her wardrobe for all the days, shares that the dress code on ‘ashtami’ will be a bright saree this year. “For the first time due to pandemic my sister, who is working in Bangalore, couldn’t fly down. Till last year during puja we used to enjoy late night pandal hopping near my residence on La Touche Road but this time the pattern has been tweaked though our rejoicing spirits are high,” she said. Manoj Bhadra, president of Bondhu Mahal, B-Block, Indira Nagar informed that this time they have got a three-feet idol. “From Friday we hope for a bigger turnout so we are all geared up to abide by all the protocols. People are not allowed to hang round and throng the pandal.” Thursday being the first day of puja the celebration was a low-key affair. But a good turnout is expected in coming days amid norms of social distancing. “Appeal to all is to follow all the guidelines and be safe. All pujas are providing live ‘darshans’ too so there no need to get disheartened,” added Bhadra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow-keeps-festive-spirit-high/story-hdTb7i82pgQi6mK6WhtY0K.html

It’s filthy. The air is filthy.”On Friday, air pollution in New Delhi and surrounding cities was at its worst in eight months, with the air quality index surging above 300 on a scale of 500, indicating “emergency conditions”.Trump referred to India to defend his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, said one environmental expert.“Trump’s commentary on India’s air in the backdrop of his justification from withdrawing from the Paris pact is unfortunate and juvenile,” said Vimlendu Jha, the founder of an activist group, Swechha.“America is historically the largest emitter in the world and currently the second largest one,” he added.Trump was correct, said Kapil Mishra, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Trump is right,” Mishra said on Twitter. “Our air quality is actually filthy.

He was carrying a sleeping bag, a storage device, his military identity card and a mobile with a charger. He was released after a thorough interrogation and completion of the necessary formalities,” the officials said. He was returned to the PLA at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point, where senior commanders from both armies have been holding military talks to reduce friction in the eastern Ladakh theatre. On the day he was held, the army said in a statement that Corporal Wang had been provided medical assistance, including oxygen, food and warm clothes to protect him “from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions”. Indian and Chinese military commanders met for the seventh time on October 12 in their latest attempt to defuse tensions. The Indian side demanded comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the talks. The two sides agreed to continue with the dialogue process to arrive at a mutually-acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh theatre. In a joint press statement issued a day after the talks, they said they had a better understanding of each other’s positions in the sector after the latest round of talks. India and China are expected to hold the eight round of military talks soon, although a date has not been announced yet. The situation in the eastern Ladakh theatre will also figure prominently on the agenda for the upcoming Army commanders’ conference that will be held in New Delhi from October 26-29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-soldier-who-strayed-into-ladakh-carried-sleeping-bag-mobile-official/story-RIJsQMbeRO9rgj2GIDMBJI.html

Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the world’s largest vaccine maker by volume, said his company plans to launch at least one vaccine every quarter likely by the beginning of next year.These will include Covishield, Covovax, COVIVAXX, COVI-VAC, and SII COVAX. Covishield, which is being developed by the United Kingdom’s Oxford University, and licensed from British-Swedish drug-maker AstraZeneca, is currently undergoing Phase 3 of clinical trials in India among nearly 1,600 people. Serum Institute of India has partnered with AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine candidate, which is expected to be launched in the first quarter of next year and immunisation can start by January if the clearances are given early.Also read | IAVI, Serum Institute sign pact with Merck to develop coronavirus neutralising antibodies“The plan is to launch at least one vaccine every quarter beginning with Covishield, which we licensed from AstraZeneca, likely by start of 2021... We are already making 20-30 million doses and can increase the production to 70-80 million a month. Currently, we are consciously producing less considering the shelf life of the vaccine,” Adar Poonawalla told BusinessToday.in on Thursday.It reported that the second anti-coronavirus disease vaccine from Serum Institute Life Sciences (SILS), a new company floated by SII, is likely to be Covovax, which is a spike protein vaccine being developed in association with biotech firm Novovax.Novovax has an arrangement with SII to produce one billion doses of the vaccine in 2021. The BusinessToday.in report said that the Phase 1 clinical trial of Covovax began in May 2020 in Australia and it is currently into the second phase of development. A phase-3 clinical trial with up to 30,000 subjects is expected to begin by end of 2020, it added.Also read | No adverse effect of Oxford University vaccine on 163 Mumbai volunteers during clinical trials, says BMCAdar Poonawala said the new manufacturing facility SILS is coming up near the SII facility in Pune and will take two years for completion. Poonawalla also said, according to BusinessToday.in, that SILS will outsource the capacity of SII until then.Poonawalla added that the privately-held company has already invested 70% of the Rs 3,000 crore capex required in land, buildings, plants, raw materials, and other related infrastructure. SII will postpone its earlier expansion plans to develop a few new vaccines for the US and European markets. “Once completed, between SII and SILS, we will have a capacity to manufacture over 2.3 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines, provided there is demand and requirement,” the report quoted Poonawalla as saying.India’s infection tally went up to 7.76 million with 54,366 new cases of the coronavirus disease and 690 related deaths, according to the Union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-readying-1-billion-doses-of-5-covid-19-vaccines-adar-poonawalla/story-zOzN90HaVPOy45d1G10eoJ.html

23-10-2020||India||Adani Group set to begin airport operations in 3 new cities, including Ahmedabad||After winning the bid to acquire the operations of the Mumbai airport in August this year, Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) is currently preparing itself for a new set of airport takeovers in the coming days. The group would essentially, for a 50-year-lease, maintain the operations, management and development of the airports at Mangaluru, Lucknow and Ahmedabad from October 30, November 02 and November 11 respectively.The decision has been made after the company was asked by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to take over the three airports before November this year.As announced in the company’s Annual Report of 2019-2020, Adani Group considers itself “well-positioned to become leading airport operator in India.” The report also announced that the group won the bids for operations in six airports at Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram, under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model announced by the central government.The company also said that they would operate under a hybrid business model that comprises two revenue structures - aero and non-aero revenues. The non-aero revenues would be aimed at tapping the potential of “non-passenger airport visitors.”While there were plans to handle airports in the post-Covid-19 era in the report, the lockdown induced by the pandemic has widely hindered Adani’s plans for airport domination. The company announced in June this year that the acquisitions of operations in Guwahati and Jaipur airports were halted, as reported by Mint.Another challenge that the company faced was a legal battle with the Kerala state government after the latter opposed the privatization of Thiruvananthapuram airport, calling it ‘not in public interest.’ However, the Kerala High Court on October 19 this year dismissed the contention of the state government, as reported by the Mint.Members of the opposition have alleged favouritism on part of the central government for offering all airports to the Adani Group. “There’s a clear violation of norms in giving airports to a single private entity. Govt ignored the advice of some of its own ministries and departments. Changes in norms enabled Adani group to win all six bids,” Congress leader had said, according to news agency ANI.Despite the challenges, Adani would proceed with the takeovers as announced earlier, a press release from the AAI mentioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adani-group-set-to-begin-airport-operations-in-3-new-cities-including-ahmedabad/story-RPot8tkA8YsT6GsrucDv7L.html

They (Pakistan) also fear if they would not have approved the bill they could have got sanctions from the UNSC. Now, this has given us hope that things will happen in a structured way,” Singh told ANI.He also said that there will be a lot of repercussions if Pakistan will not act according to the verdict of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). “If they will not act according to the ICJ verdict there will be a lot of repercussions. The realisation of that itself has given us hope that thing will actually move in the right direction.”He further said that India has been very vocal about all the documents relating to the Kulbhushan Jadhav and emphasised, “We need consular access which should be unconditional and unimpeded.”Arvind Singh’s statement comes after Pakistan National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Law and Justice approved the bill for review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s conviction on Wednesday.Jadhav has been sentenced to death by a military court for espionage.Pakistan claims that Jadhav was arrested from Balochistan in 2016 on charges of espionage. India has rejected Pakistan’s allegations and said he was kidnapped from the Iranian port of Chabahar. In early 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced him to death.Federal Minister for Law and Justice Farogh Naseem said that the bill to review the conviction of Jadhav has been introduced with the directives of the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance, reported Dawn.The ordinance allows Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in a high court.Farogh warned that in case the bill was not adopted by Parliament, Pakistan could face sanctions for not complying with the ICJ’s verdict. The law minister said that India could be filing a contempt petition against Pakistan in the ICJ by promulgating the said ordinance.Recently, India had lashed out at Pakistan for failing to provide consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav.The ICJ had upheld India’s claim of the Pakistani regime committing the grievous violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations on several counts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-approves-bill-for-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-conviction-fearing-sanctions-jadhav-s-friend/story-VhGEubsB9YE4uP9yZQm8dP.html

Each college would have a task force and deputy commissioners of districts have been authorised to coordinate and monitor things at their district level, he also said.“We have not discussed it for now.

Online classes have already started in October,” he said when asked about any decision to cut short the syllabus.Karnataka, which is among other severely affected states, has 100,459 active cases, 671,618 people have recovered, 10,696 have succumbed to the coronavirus disease.Here is what you need to know about the guidelines:1.

23-10-2020||India||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: BJP’s promise of free Covid vaccine completely legal, says Ravi Shankar Prasad||Amid the criticism from opposition parties over BJP’s free coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine promise to the people of Bihar in its election manifesto, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday cleared the air by saying the provision of free vaccine to Bihar after the requisite approval is completely legal. The BJP’s 11-point manifesto was released by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, BJP Bihar chief Sanjay Jaiswal and party’s national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav on Thursday. Apart from the free vaccine promise, other points in the manifesto included creation of 1.9 million jobs in Bihar and the evolution of the state as an information technology (IT) hub. Prasad termed the vaccine promise as a ‘historical step’ and said that no opposition party should have any issues if the BJP is thinking progressively and giving priority to health care. According to news agency ANI, the Union law minister while addressing a press briefing in Patna said “It is shocking that some are terming it a political ploy. Should promises made for improving health care, caring for people’s health not be made? This declaration is completely legal, it only is problematic for people who make tall claims before elections but do not implement it on the ground.”Prasad pointed out the free vaccine promise shows the party’s commitment towards people’s health adding that it is a revolutionary step. Several opposition parties have labelled the BJP’s vaccine promise an election stunt. On Friday, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut questioned whether non-ruled BJP states would be denied free access to vaccine. He added that such promises show the party’s discriminatory nature. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday had tweeted, “GOI just announced India’s Covid access strategy. Kindly refer to the state-wise election schedule to know when will you get it, along with a hoard of false promises.” Meanwhile, Chattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday also accused the BJP of politicising public health.

23-10-2020||India||India looks to army chief’s visit to Nepal to bring ties back on even keel||India is looking to army chief Gen MM Naravane’s upcoming visit to Nepal to help put bilateral ties back on an even keel after a bitter border row, especially by building on the traditionally strong ties between the two armies, people familiar with developments said on Friday. Naravane is expected to be in Nepal during Nov 4-6, when he will meet his Nepalese counterpart Gen Purna Chandra Thapa and top civilian leaders. Nepal’s President Vidya Devi Bhandari will also confer the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army to Naravane at an investiture ceremony. Ahead of Naravane’s trip, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Samant Kumar Goel made a low-key visit to Kathmandu on Thursday during which he met Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Oli’s spokesman Surya Thapa was quoted by media as saying that Goel’s discussions with Oli focussed on not allowing any “interruption in friendly relations between Nepal and India [and] resolving all outstanding issues through dialogue and continuing mutual cooperation”. Also Read: Nepal Government not to bear costs of Covid-19 test, treatmentBilateral ties were hit in May after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a key border road to Lipulekh region, which is claimed by Nepal. Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory, exacerbating the row. The two sides are yet to hold talks on the border issue, though the people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the visits by the RAW and Indian Army chiefs are expected to calm relations and prepare the ground for more substantive engagements. “The ties between the two militaries are very robust and there are 136,000 Indian Army pensioners in Nepal, who form part of the strong links between the two sides,” said the person cited above. Oli’s decision to remove deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokhrel – who was critical of India – from the defence ministry during a cabinet reshuffle on October 14 was seen by some in New Delhi as an indication of a desire to improve ties before the Indian Army chief’s visit. However, the people played down speculation in this regard. “We see this more as an internal compromise between two groups in the Nepal government and more of an internal matter for them,” one of the people said. Also Read: Himalayas poised for a series of big earthquakes, may extend to Delhi, Chandigarh: StudyThe people noted that Nepalese leaders themselves have referred to what is called the “roti-beti ka rishta” – a reference to close links forged through trade and inter-marriages in border districts of the two countries – and said this one of the foundations for the strong economic and political linkages with Nepal. Despite China’s efforts to forge stronger economic links, Nepal’s access to the sea is via India, and it imports a large proportion of its requirements from and through India. Nepal imported goods worth $6.52 billion from India in 2017 and exported goods worth $420.18 million the same year. India’s security establishment also continues to have concerns about China’s activities along Nepal’s borders, including possible encroachment of territory, despite a recent denial issued by both Kathmandu and Beijing about the reported occupation of land by Chinese troops in the remote border district of Humla. “There are reports that China has illegally occupied Nepal’s land in several places spread over the border districts of Dolakha, Gorkha, Darchula, Humla, Sindhupalchowk, Sankhuwasabha and Rasuwa. Several of these places are catchment areas of rivers,” a second person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-looks-to-army-chief-s-visit-to-nepal-to-bring-ties-back-on-even-keel/story-5Ps0sF6jdRo0HDAIp1IIaJ.html

23-10-2020||India||Plea in SC lists reasons to raise women’s marriageable age, power imbalance is one||A transfer petition filed in the Supreme Court demanding uniform marriageable age of 21 years for men and women claims that the disparity in age of marriage has resulted in aggravating the gender inequality that exists within a marital relationship.The petition has been filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay demanding that his petition on the same question pending with the Delhi high court is transferred to the Supreme Court along with a similar petition filed by one Abdul Mannan, pending with the Rajasthan high court.Since the issues raised in the two petitions are similar, Upadhyay invoked the power of the Supreme Court under Article 139A which allows cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of law, pending before two or more high courts, to be transferred to the Supreme Court.The transfer petition said, “While men are permitted to get married at the age of 21, women are married when they are just 18. The distinction is based on patriarchal stereotypes, has no scientific backing, perpetrates de jure and de facto inequality against women, and goes completely against the global trends.”The petition claimed that 125 countries have uniform minimum age of marriage for boys and girls and by ending the discrimination in age, women will have equal opportunities as men to pursue their education, employment opportunities without being hindered by family compulsion to get married.Upadhyay argued that women in a married relationship are expected to perform a subordinate role vis-à-vis the husband. “This power imbalance is deeply aggravated by the age differential, because age itself constitutes a hierarchy of power. A younger spouse is therefore expected to respect and be servile to her elder partner, that aggravates the pre-existing gender-based hierarchy in the marital relationship,” his petition stated.All laws that deal with marriage, whether it be the Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, Indian Christian Marriage Act or the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, have fixed the marriageable age for men and women as 21 and 18 respectively.Also Read: Muslim League’s women wing urges PM Modi not to raise marriageable age for womenUpadhyay raised the demand for uniform minimum age of marriage before the Delhi high court in August last year. On August 19, 2019, the Delhi HC issued notice to the Centre for its response. Around the same time, another petition came to be filed before the Rajasthan HC raising the same issue. The Rajasthan HC issued notice to the Centre on Abdul Mannan’s plea on February 5, 2020.Both petitions have said that the marriageable age discrimination is a violation of fundamental rights of equality (Article 14), protection against discrimination (Article 15), and dignity of life (Article 21) and also India’s commitment under the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-lists-reasons-to-raise-women-s-marriageable-age-power-imbalance-is-one/story-dUOy4ptNQQOVzWpBS2EPwJ.html

With his savings wiped out, Beria, the eldest child of his family, was forced to come back to his home in Jurlakani village in Deogaon block of Bolangir district.Beria would probably have been toiling away as an MGNREGS worker had Bolangir district collector Chanchal Rana not chanced upon him during his visit to Deogaon block on Tuesday.“I found him digging a canal under MGNREGS with his father Baisakhu. It was a little disturbing for me. As an engineering graduate, he was supposed to be in a better place, doing more skilful work. So, we offered him the job of a data entry operator in National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) cell of the district where he would get better remuneration. I would also personally try to get him a job matching his education and skills,” said Rana, who is also an engineer by education.Also Read: Odisha Lokayukta serves notice to BJD MLA over allegation that he blew up a flood embankmentBeria and three of his siblings were brought up with much hardship by their daily wager father Baisakhu Beria. “As he did not get any work after returning home from Chennai, he decided to work under MGNREGS. After all one has to survive,” said Beria’s father.Over 6.6 million white collar professional jobs were lost from May till August 2020 as per Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Those rendered jobless during the pandemic included engineers, physicians, teachers and accountants.In Malkangiri district, tehsildar of Kalimela, Alok Kumar Anugulia managed to save Kondh tribal boy Surendra Khara from the clutches of labour mafia by buying him a smartphone so that the boy could resume his online classes.Khara, a Class IX student of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya-1 in Malkangiri district, was all set to migrate to Bhadrachalam district in Telangana as a daily wager to arrange money for a smartphone for his online classes. The Kalimela tehsildar got to know about the local labour mafia trying to entice the boy and rescued him.Khara, 18, did not have a smartphone, and could not join the online classes of his school. “Though I had textbooks, there was no one in my village to guide me. I was scared of lagging behind in studies and decided to migrate to Bhadrachalam in Telangana. I thought I would earn enough to buy a smartphone, come back within two months and resume my studies,” he said.However, Khara panicked when he learnt that the labour agent was not taking them to Bhadrachalam but to Bengaluru. He and others in the group were then rescued by Jai Malkangiri, a volunteers’ group.“He is good in his studies. His 17-year-old brother and 14-year-old sister have already dropped out from school and become daily wagers. I want him to study and so bought him a smartphone. I did not want the student dropping out because of a smartphone. I have suggested that his family moves him to Mathili where he will stay with the volunteers of Jai Malkangiri so that the local labour mafia can’t entice him. Once his school re-opens he would go,” said the tehsildar.As per Odisha school and mass education department, about 38 lakh out of 60 lakh students in Odisha did not have access to online education, forcing several parents in Odisha to sell their belongings to buy smartphones for their children. A couple in Mayurbhanj district had to sell their milch cow to buy a smartphone for their daughter. Similarly, a housewife in Cuttack district had to sell her gold earrings to buy a smartphone for her daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-engineer-worked-as-mgnregs-worker-after-losing-job-rescued/story-NqRcGqu9MbK5ppVfefaOXP.html

The Prime Minister is scheduled to address another rally in Bihar today — at Bhagalpur, where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will also address an election rally.What featured prominently in both of his addresses were praises for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the Centre’s development plans for Bihar.Earlier today at Sasaram, Narendra Modi acknowledged Nitish Kumar’s fast action to tackle the Covid-19 situation of the state. “Had Nitish Kumar not acted fast, the pandemic could have killed many more people in Bihar,” PM Modi said.In his second rally at Gaya, he reiterated his trust in the Nitish Kumar government. Talking about Naxal activities, Modi in Gaya said, “In the last few years, a lot of effort and strict actions have been taken to limit the activities of Naxals in the country. Naxal presence has now been restricted to limited areas.”“The opposition parties have formed a ‘pitara’ against NDA, they call it ‘Mahagathbandhan’. But each and every citizen of Bihar is aware of every bit of that Mahagathbandhan which allowed naxal movement in the past,” the PM added.In both the addresses, the prime minister mentioned Svamitva (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) Scheme, which aims to use drones to maintain land records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/praise-for-nitish-kumar-central-govt-schemes-what-dominated-pm-modi-s-election-speeches-in-bihar/story-RCEaRNawfcA1WTutfsGRoM.html

Professors Amit Agrawal and Rajneesh Bharadwaj, who are attached to IIT-Bombay’s department of mechanical engineering, has conducted the study.The findings have revealed that up to eight seconds after a Covid-19 patient coughs held the key, as suspended exhaled droplets permeate the air, where the level of the viral infection is likely to go up by 23 times. Also read: Top medical body ICMR issues advisory for use of Feluda Covid test“The presence of a mask drastically reduces the volume and significantly cuts down the risk of the viral infection for other persons present in a room. Similarly, actions such as coughing into the elbow and the use of a handkerchief can reduce the volume of a cough cloud and, consequently, the chances of dispersion of the virus,” the study stated.The researchers had set out to analyse the volume, temperature, and relative humidity of the cloud produced by coughing to understand their dispersion in the surrounding air. They had used a mathematical model to analyse the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of the cough cloud. They found that the cough cloud lasted between five and 14 seconds following which it would dissipate.“An N-95 mask not only cuts down the number of droplets exhaled by a Covid-19 patient, but also reduces the amount of infected air produced by the person,” said the researchers.They exuded confidence that the findings would help understand how SARS-CoV2, which causes Covid-19, spreads in the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surgical-n-95-masks-can-reduce-covid-19-cough-cloud-by-7-23-times-says-iit-bombay-study/story-53ypexnpINgLBezVaemynN.html
23-10-2020||India||Goa anticipates huge losses this year as govt keeps foreign tourists at bay||As Covid-19 cases begin to rise again across Europe and Russia dimming hopes that India may reopen its borders for foreign tourists this season, Goa is staring at the first ever season without the arrival of European tourists since the 1960s when the first hippies arrived here. The Indian government on Thursday announced that most visas including for all OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India), PIO (Person of Indian Origin) card holders and foreign nationals were being restored except for tourist visas. Goa Tourism says the restriction on tourism visas will deal a huge blow to the industry. Goa’s tourism season usually begins with the receding monsoon and as winter sets in across the northern hemisphere, those seeking to escape the often biting cold climes choose to spend time in warmer parts of the world and Goa is among the preferred destinations for those seeking to travel. “I have been coming to Goa for about 15 years, I guess, [and] I know there are plenty out there who have been visiting for much longer than I have. I have heard Goa is already opening up to tourism… [but] no sadly there is no chance of visiting India this winter. Until this pandemic is under some control, it is just too dangerous especially for an older and not so healthy folk!” Polly Hoad, a British tourist, who said she will have to sit out the harsh winter back home in the UK for the first time in 15 years. She is not alone. For many Britishers for whom travelling out of the UK for the winter had become a habit and Goa was a destination of choice, an inability to travel even if they are willing to take the risk, will force them to sit back. “It will be our first Xmas in England for over twenty years but I will make the best of it,” Lili Angel, another regular tourist, said. Also Read: Vistara to operate more flights to Goa and London to cater to rising demandWhile tourism has reopened in the state and people from within other states of India have begun to come in, India is not issuing tourists visas as of now and is unlikely to lift the restrictions any time soon, especially, given the return of a second wave in much of Europe including the UK, Germany, Poland Russia and Ukraine, the primary sources of foreign tourists to Goa. The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) believes that the arrival of foreign tourists is vital for the state’s tourism industry. “Foreign tourists travel in larger groups and stay for a longer time, often the average duration of stay is between 14-21 days. To compensate for the loss of a single foreign booking, a hotel will have to secure four to five different bookings of domestic tourists to maintain the same level of occupancy,” Nilesh Shah the president of the TTAG, told HT. Also Read: ‘Unwarranted’: Navy responds to obstacle charge in Goa’s ‘development’A domestic tourist on average stays between 3-7 days. Many mid to large hotels depend entirely on foreign arrivals through deals with charter companies and now find themselves all at sea.“We have been working with the government to try and get some arrangement in place wherein tourists can be chartered in via an air bubble agreement of some kind,” Shah said. “It (the continued suspension of tourist visas) is obviously a disappointment. At the same time, we also have to be realistic keeping in view that cases are rising once again in Europe, so the future remains uncertain,” he added. “The government needs to announce that tourist visas will be allowed once again, if not immediately then two months down the line because people can then begin to plan their holidays. Tourists especially foreign tourists like to plan their holidays well in advance and do not suddenly get up and decide to travel the next day,” he added. Across the last three calendar years, Goa received around eight million tourists, around one million of which were from abroad. The number is expected to fall sharply this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-anticipates-huge-losses-this-year-as-govt-keeps-foreign-tourists-at-bay/story-ZqiaOBQqT3XlB5Mw9DZvjO.html

The letter, written by the secretary of Indian Union Women League, P K Noorbana Rasheed, says delaying the age of marriage will give way to “live-in relationships” and “illegitimate relations”.She said when many developing countries had brought down the legal age of marriage from 21 to 18 years considering the biological and social needs, it is not proper for India to take a hasty decision in favour of raising women’s legal age for marriage. She said instead of implementing the Prohibition of Child Marriages Act 2006 in letter and spirit, attempts to raise the marriageable age of women was unfair.Also Read: UP cops gather evidence of Kerala scribe’s role in Hathras violence incitement plot“There was a report recently, that in rural areas, 30% of women are getting married before they attain the age of 18 years.

However, the date and time of the test will be determined by the company.Sputnik quoted the organisation as saying that the vaccine will be tested in the second phase of its clinical trials before moving on to phase 3.Last week, the expert committee of DCGI had recommended granting permission to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for conducting phase 2 clinical trials of Russian Covid-19 vaccine candidate, Sputnik V, in India.According to a government official, Dr Reddy’s Lab has stated that in phase 2 clinical trial--”would include 100 subjects and for phase 3, it would take 1400 subjects.”“Once the pharma company would submit the safety and immunogenicity data of phase 2, it would be analysed by the expert panel and then they can proceed for the phase 3 trial,” the official added.On October 13, ANI had reported that Dr Reddy’s Laboratories re-applied fresh protocol to DCGI in order to seek its approval for conducting phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine.It may be noted that on October 5, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) had done a thorough evaluation of the previous application submitted by Dr Reddy’s lab. Thereafter, the SEC had directed the pharma company to apply with a revised protocol along with more information. The Indian drugmaker has joined hands with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine as well as its distribution.As per the RDIF, it will supply 100 million doses of its potential Covid-19 vaccine to India drug company Dr Reddy’s Lab.Last month, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, RDIF informed that Russia is in close dialogue with the Indian government and drug manufacturers of India regarding localisation of production of its Sputnik V vaccine in India.Also, a prestigious medical journal The Lancet had published the results of clinical trials of Phase I-II of the Russian vaccine demonstrating its safety and efficacy.On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine candidate developed jointly by RDIF and the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19.According to Russian researchers, Sputnik V is a human adenoviral vector vaccine that fights against coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-tested-on-100-indian-volunteers/story-LrSXo2Z4DF08aKF4BiK1PI.html

The ICMR has been enhancing Covid-19 testing capability across the country by expanding and diversifying testing capacity by leveraging technology and facilitating innovation in affordable diagnostic kits,” the ICMR said in a statement.Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMR said, “We have effectively responded to the evolving epidemic through focused and collaborative efforts of the Centre, state and UT governments.” “Exponential increase in testing has led to early identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment of Covid-19 cases along with effective contact tracing. These have eventually resulted in a sustained low fatality rate,” he said.“This testing milestone is testimony to the fact that India has been successful in implementing strategy of the 5T approach ‘Test, Track, Trace, Treat and use of Technology efficiently, which will enable us to contain the spread of the pandemic,” he addedRamping up of testing facility across India was at the core of increased testing per day, he said. Through our ardent efforts, it was ensured that a specific testing platform is made available addressing general testing (RT-PCR), High-throughput testing (COBAS), testing at remotest places and PHCs (TrueNAT, CBNAAT),in containment areas (rapid antigen testing) and for a large number and migrant population testing (pooled sample testing), Bhargava said.The total number of diagnostic laboratory has reached 1,989.

23-10-2020||India||‘Give me vote, I will give you vaccine’: Sanjay Raut mocks BJP’s vaccine promise to Bihar||Taking a swipe at the BJP’s election manifesto for poll-bound Bihar that includes free Covid-19 vaccine to all of Bihar, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that earlier it used to be ‘give me blood and I will give you freedom’. “But now it has become ‘give me vote and I will give you vaccine’. Only those who vote for BJP will get vaccine. It shows BJP’s discriminatory nature,” the leader said on Friday, alluding to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s iconic speech that he made in Burma in 1944.Shiv Sen is contesting in around 50 seats in Bihar, as announced by the party earlier.The promise of a vaccine — that is undergoing trial — at free of cost during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic drew sharp reactions from all political corners. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi slammed the party and tweeted, “GOI just announced India’s Covid access strategy. Kindly refer to the state-wise election schedule to know when will you get it, along with a hoard of false promises.”Soon after the BJP announced free vaccine for Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh too walked the same path and promised free vaccines.While questions are being raised whether the vaccine promise violates Model Code of Conduct, people familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times that the promise may not be seen as a violation. “Under section 123 (2) of the Representation of People’s Act, 1951, a declaration of public policy, or a promise of publication, or the mere exercise of a legal right without intent to interfere with an electoral right, shall not be deemed to be interference within the meaning of this clause,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-me-vote-i-will-give-you-vaccine-sanjay-raut-mocks-bjp-s-vaccine-promise-to-bihar/story-1CbQ2cznU86wXn97q5uHSJ.html

Why did Rahul Gandhi meet the kin of those in Kerala, accused of inciting Hathras violence? He must make his talks public with the kin of those accused of fanning trouble in Hathras,” Zafar Islam said.Rahul met Kappan’s family on Wednesday during his three-day Kerala tour and promised them all help. Kappan was arrested with three others at a toll plaza near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh while heading to Hathras to meet the family of the gang rape victim.Syed Zafar Islam, former managing director with Deutsche Bank, who was elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha from UP on September 4, also accused Rahul of selective outrage over rape incidents.“Why is it that Congress only sees crime in UP but remains silent on the issue of rape in Rajasthan?” Islam asked, referring to the rape of two minor girls in Baran over which the BJP had staged protests against the Ashok Gehlot government.Also Read: Wife of arrested Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan meets Rahul GandhiThe BJP leader also hit out at the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party for “parroting lies” and “spreading confusion” on the issue of new farm laws. “Deliberately, an atmosphere is being created by opposition parties like the SP and the BSP, whose leaders are saying that the government was planning to end the minimum support price (MSP) for various agricultural crops.

23-10-2020||India||IAVI, Serum Institute sign pact with Merck to develop coronavirus neutralising antibodies||International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit organisation, and Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine producer by volume, on Thursday announced an agreement with Merck, a leading American multinational pharmaceutical company, to develop SARS-CoV-2 neutralising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The antibodies have been co-invented by IAVI and Scripps Research, a non-profit American biomedical research facility, as innovative interventions to rein in the global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The agreement builds on the advanced antibody discovery and optimisation expertise of IAVI and Scripps Research gained from years of experience in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) neutralising antibody research and development and on Merck’s and SII’s significant capabilities in design and scaling up of accelerated manufacturing processes for mAbs production…” stated a press release.The three organisations are working in tandem for the global development plan.If the highly potent and broadly cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody candidates make progress and are shown to be efficacious in clinical trials, either as a single antibody or a potential combination of both candidates, then Merck will take the lead in commercialisation of the breakthrough research in developed countries.SII will take the lead in global manufacturing and also commercialisation in low-and middle-low-income countries, including India.““We’re acutely aware of the tremendous potential for monoclonal antibodies to be used in Covid-19 response. By combining the scientific achievements of IAVI and Scripps Research with our partners’ development, manufacturing, and distribution expertise, we are hopeful that this partnership will result in globally accessible antibodies that are available to all, who can benefit from them,” said Mark Feinberg, president and chief executive officer (CEO), IAVI, in a statement.Belén Garijo, vice-chairman, executive board and deputy CEO, Merck, said, “Together with IAVI and SII, we look forward to demonstrating the potential application of these monoclonal antibodies in the management of Covid-19. We share a common purpose to accelerate this promising science and deliver effective solutions that address global challenges presented by this pandemic.”Neutralising mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 are widely considered to be promising candidates for Covid-19 treatment and prevention.“…Given the breadth and scale of our technology and our long-standing devotion to improving health especially in low-income countries, I am confident that we and our partners are on a productive path that will lead to a much-needed, globally available tool for Covid-19 treatment and possibly prevention,” said Adar Poonawalla, CEO, SII.Encouraging results for Covid-19 antibody treatment have emerged from preclinical research and also initial clinical trials.“mAbs have the potential to play an important complementary role to Covid-19 vaccines both for treatment and potentially for prevention, especially for those individuals who, due to age or medical conditions, may not benefit from vaccination,” the release added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iavi-serum-institute-sign-deal-with-merck-to-develop-coronavirus-neutralising-antibodies/story-xs1WK3KbwACbnKGORpTKkK.html

23-10-2020||India||Council for Centre-state collaboration on science to come up under new policy: Govt||The Union science minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, has said that a Centre-state council will be created for collaboration of the governments on policies related to science and innovation. This is in line with the collaborative approach that the government has adopted for the formulation of the new Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy – 2020. “The new policy proposes the institutionalisation of Centre-State science, technology and innovation engagements. This will a permanent pathway for percolation of science to the grassroot levels. There is a need to identify national priorities that will be driven by the needs of the states. Through formal linkages like this, we hope to carry out continuous highest level of engagements, extensive capacity-building exercises, technology development support programmes, and other related activities,” the minister said on Thursday at the Centre-state consultation on the policy. Also read: Minister invites suggestions for ‘people-centric’ science and tech policyHe added that such a mechanism will also increase communication and avoid duplication of efforts. “So far, there have been four science and technology policies in the country, but what we are formulating right now is unique. It is completely decentralised. This is the first time the state governments are directly involved in the formulation of the policy,” said Dr Akhilesh Gupta, who heads the secretariat formulating the new policy. The consultation meeting was attended by representatives of 26 out of 28 states and four out of nine Union Territories. Among those who attented were the chief minister of Meghalaya, Conrad Sangma, deputy chief minister of Manipur, Yumnam Joykumar Singh, deputy chief minister of Tripura, Jishnu Dev Varma, and deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Dinesh Sharma.Sangma suggested that a deep interest in science needs to be cultivated from a young age and organising competitions can motivate children. “We focus a lot on dance, singing, cricket, but there is no competition for innovation and science. Young minds should be trained to innovate and such competitions could incentivise them. We are going to start these competitions in our state,” he said. “Some of the states suggested setting up a co-funding mechanism with the Centre. Strengthening of the existing state level councils under the department of science and technology was also recommended. When it came to the quality of education in state institutes, some suggested that central institutes like IITs and Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research could collaborate with state universities in the respective states where they are. Another suggestion was to encourage innovation as a national policy and even at school level,” said Dr Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/council-for-centre-state-collaboration-on-science-to-come-up-under-new-policy-govt/story-puSdtaSwHQI450iwrvsmYJ.html

Experts have questioned the rationale behind holding the key talks between the foreign and defence ministers of the two sides at a time when the US election could lead to a change of government. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defense secretary Mark Esper will be on a two-day visit to India for the dialogue with their counterparts S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh on October 27. Asked about this issue at the weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “As regards the timing of the meeting, you would know that diplomatic calendars have their logic. You will notice that the earlier two meetings have also been held towards the end of the year.” Also Read | On India-US agenda, a plan to share defence intel from Ladakh to South China SeaThe maiden 2+2 dialogue was held in New Delhi in September 2018 and the second one in Washington in December 2019.

The signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) is also on the cards to facilitate sharing of classified satellite and sensor data. “The third 2+2 ministerial dialogue will entail a comprehensive discussion on cross-cutting bilateral issues of mutual interest. In addition, both sides will exchange views on salient regional and global issues,” Srivastava said, declining to go into details. The discussions during these dialogues have enabled both sides to take forward their relationship and strengthen the institutional framework for cooperation across all sectors, he said.

23-10-2020||India||MP, Tamil Nadu CMs promise free Covid-19 vaccine||New Delhi: Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh chief ministers said on Thursday that as soon as a vaccine for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is available, they would provide it to the people of their respective states free of cost. Taking to Twitter, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wrote, “Coronavirus vaccine preparation work is going on fast in India. As soon as the vaccine is ready, it will be made available to every citizen of Madhya Pradesh for free.” Chouhan’s announcement decision came hours after Tami Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami declared that a vaccine will be distributed free of charge in his state as well.“Once COVID-19 vaccine is ready, it will be provided to all people of the state free of cost,” announced Palaniswami a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party ally All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Earlier in the day, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman released the Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto for the Bihar assembly elections, and promised free Covid-19 vaccine for the people of the poll-bound state. The announcement kicked off a political storm with the opposition accusing the BJP of trying to politicize the pandemic, and the ruling party stating that the announcement should not be seen as a poll promise as health is an important aspect of public policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-tamil-nadu-cms-promise-free-covid-vaccine/story-BpNHieZB3GI3NmgWDqtBAJ.html
23-10-2020||India||Wind shift brings drop in air quality in Delhi||The air quality in Delhi again deteriorated on Thursday, reaching the brink of the “very poor” category as a reduction in wind speed and a change in wind direction brought in pollutants from stubble fires in Haryana and Punjab that caused a spike in pollution levels throughout the country’s northwest.The condition is expected to further deteriorate over Friday and Saturday as conditions will remain unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, government agencies have warned.In Delhi, the overall air quality index (AQI) on Thursday was 296, considered in the “poor” zone, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reading. An AQI of 201 to 300 is considered “poor” while an AQI of 301 to 400 is considered “very poor”, and is associated with respiratory illness to people on prolonged exposure.Several parts of northwest India — particularly areas in the National Capital Region such as Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Panipat — recorded “very poor” air on Thursday.Wind direction was variable with easterly in the morning, and north-westerly in the afternoon. North-westerly winds tend to blow fumes from stubble fires from northern India towards the Capital. Stubble fires touched the highest of the season on Thursday as 1,428 fires were observed in Haryana and Punjab.“Winds were calm in the afternoon and blowing at a speed of only 5 kmph in the day... The air quality is expected to deteriorate further on October 23-24 on account of reduced wind speed. We are expecting wind direction to change tomorrow to north-easterly again but it will not have any significant impact on air quality because winds will remain calm. Conditions are not favourable for dispersion (of pollutants),” said Vijay Soni, scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Senior Delhi government officials blamed crop stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab as the major reason behind the plunging air quality in the Capital.“We cannot control stubble burning in the neighbouring states, because of which air pollution is increasing in Delhi. We are repeatedly requesting the Central government and state governments to cooperate and to stop the stubble fires,” said Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai.While the share of stubble burning to overall pollution in Delhi reduced to 9% on Thursday from 15% the day before, calm winds lowered the ventilation coefficient (thus not allowing dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere), according to the forecast of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing.The ventilation index was 5,000 sq metres per second on Thursday — a ventilation index below 6,000 sq m/s is considered not conducive for dispersal of pollutants in the air, according to CPCB. Ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants.“Calm wind conditions mean the wind speed was zero and hence there was no dispersion. This is a usual phenomenon for the months of October and November, which is when air quality deteriorates. Air quality is likely to touch the ‘very poor’ zone and remain in the same category over the next two days. Some improvement is likely around October 26 when wind speed may pick up,” said Soni.On Thursday, the minimum temperature settled at 17.2 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The maximum was 33.4 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal.A feeble western disturbance (WD) is also likely to impact northern India around October 25. “There can be some rain in the hills in Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh but it is a weak system,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre adding that “intense weather and heavy rains are expected in northeast India and West Bengal this week.”The rain may marginally bring down the minimum temperature across northern India over the next week, officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wind-shift-brings-drop-in-air-quality-in-delhi/story-JTK0UBR9V4r6K0DzZCwsGK.html
23-10-2020||India||Govt to sell onion buffer stock, relax import rules||The government will sell more onion from its buffer stock and has allowed quicker imports by relaxing conditions for overseas purchases, the consumer affairs ministry said on Thursday, as retail prices crossed ₹100 per kg in Mumbai and Pune in a festive-season spiral. The central government has relaxed the Plant Quarantine Order, 2003, allowing traders to import non-fumigated onion and without phytosanitary certification, a formal declaration by an exporting country or an importer guaranteeing that shipments are free of pests and plant diseases.“To facilitate the import of onion, the government has, on 21.10.2020, relaxed the conditions for fumigation and additional declaration on Phytosanitary Certificate under the Plant Quarantine Order, 2003 for import up to December 15, 2020,” an official statement said.  The government has already started moving onion from its buffer stock for sale beginning in the second half of September, a senior official in the consumer affairs ministry said. “Higher quantities of stocks will be offloaded throughout the festive season,” the official said , requesting anonymity.Widespread rains have damaged onion crops and held back harvests, trimming supplies to Lasalgaon, Asia’s largest onion wholesale market in Maharashtra’s Nashik. “The retail price of onion has shown a marked increased from end of August 2020, though the price level was below that of last year till October 18. A sharp spike in prices of onion in past the 10 days by ₹11.56 per kilo has taken the all-India retail price of onion to ₹51.95 per kilo which was 12.13% higher than the last year’s price of ₹46.33 per kg,” the consumer affairs ministry said in its statement. Prices are likely to cool after fresh harvests from rain-hit Maharashtra replenish the markets by mid-November. According to consumer affairs ministry’s market intelligence, 3.7 million tonnes will start arriving in markets, which will help cool prices. “On Wednesday, wholesale rates in Lasalgaon shot up to ₹6,100 a quintal (100kg) for some varieties, from ₹4,700 on Thursday, the last trading day of last week,” said Prakash Kumawat, an official of the Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee. In Pune, the price of onion rose to around ₹120/kg on Thursday, reported news agency ANI. The consumer affairs ministry official said Indian high commissions in onion-supplying countries had been asked to “contact the traders for pushing for greater imports of onions to the country”. Non-fumigated onions would be fumigated after arrival in India by the importing trader through an accredited fumigator agency. If pests are detected, they would be eliminated through fumigation and the consignments will be released with no additional inspection fee. “Such consignments of onions for consumption will not be subjected to four times additional inspection fee on account of non-compliance of conditions of import under the Plant Quarantine Order, 2003,” the consumer affairs ministry statement said. A bout of bad weather and heavy rainfall in the major onion growing districts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka have caused damage to standing kharif crop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-sell-onion-buffer-stock-relax-import-rules/story-NhSxubRbrYtZOTawKQzN2N.html
23-10-2020||India||Drugs smuggled in over boundary wall, sold in Tihar jail||An inquiry into the death of a prisoner inside Tihar jail last month has revealed that drugs and other contraband are regularly thrown into the premises from across the compound wall and sold to the inmates. The racket was exposed after a probe was ordered into the death of Sikander Dogra who, according to a prison officer aware of the inquiry report, complained about drug smuggling inside jail No 1. Two days later, on September 24, he was stabbed to death by four prisoners. “We have found that the drugs inside jail 1 were being brought inside the jail with the help of outsiders who throw the banned items into the prison. The prison wall shares its boundary with different roads, such as the main Jail Road in Hari Nagar. Once the drugs were thrown inside the prison, they would be picked up by the prisoners and then sold to other inmates. Getting banned items inside through the main gate is difficult because of the multilayer security,” said the prison officer, requesting anonymity. Also Read | Delhi: Tihar director-general tests positive for Covid-19After Dogra blew the whistle on the racket, a group of prisoners also managed to record videos on phones smuggled into the prison that were later posted on social media. In the videos, the prisoners alleged that some jail officers were also involved in Dogra’s murder. The officer cited above said that although there have been instances of jail warders finding mobile phones being used by inmates, smuggled in using the same modus operandi, this is the first time that they have found an organised network throwing drugs into the prison compounds. Many former prisoners that HT spoke to said on condition of anonymity that the price of a banned item inside jail increases multiple times compared to what it costs outside. “A bundle of bidi could cost less than ₹50 outside, but inside the jail, its price could be around ₹500. There are gangs inside each jail who trade in such banned items and set a price on the item,” a former prisoner said. “Some places were identified as the drop zones. During the inquiry, some inmates came forward with anecdotal claims of prisoners receiving packets of marijuana and hashish from across the road. We have marked the drop zones and recommended large fishing nets to be placed between the walls of the prison and the road’s boundary wall (outside) to ensure that banned items do not land at these drop zones and are caught in the net,” said a second prison officer. The report will be submitted to the prison’s director general. The inquiry will also look into how the four men who stabbed Dogra smuggled a knife inside the prison. A warder, who filed the report on Dogra’s death, has mentioned that a knife was used in the murder. “It is always the endeavour of the prison department that no contraband item enters the jails,” Sandeep Goel, director general of Delhi prisons, told HT. “The prison officers are briefed to always be on alert and prevent any entry of any banned items inside the jails. Further if any violation is noticed, action is taken against the inmates and even the staff found engaged in any manner in such illegal activity.” Dogra was arrested by the police in February 2019 for illegal possession of arms. Police records show Dogra was named in at least 20 criminal cases such as robbery, snatching, murder, vehicle theft and under the Arms Act. In the past, there have been cases of prisoners who tried to successfully smuggle drugs or cell phones by taking it orally or hiding it in the body cavities. Prisoners have also been admitted to hospital when they were unable to get the smuggled items out of their body. Before taking the banned items inside prison, such items are wrapped in polythene sheets and hidden in body cavities. Jail officials suspect that this case could be an organised racket of getting drugs and selling them inside prison. The government is yet to allow the use of body scanners inside the prison -- a longstanding demand by Tihar prisons. Prison expert Sunil Gupta, who was Tihar prison’s law officer for over three decades until his retirement in 2015, said the prison officers must look into the role of the jail staff too. “It is difficult to smuggle a single items inside the prison without the involvement of an insider. By saying that the drugs were thrown into the prison negates the role of jail personnel in the inquiry. When banned items are thrown into the prison, it is often picked up by the jail personnel. Prisoners do not have access to all corners of the prison. The trade of smuggled items depend on how strict the superintendent is,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-smuggled-in-over-boundary-wall-sold-in-tihar-jail/story-By9daHsCMg3TnwfWCMNX5O.html
23-10-2020||India||Why is everyone promising jobs in Bihar elections?||After the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) promised a million government jobs if the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) it leads is voted to power in Bihar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has tried to outdo it by promising 1.9 million jobs in its election manifesto, released on Thursday. The BJP’s promise will be an embarrassment of sorts to its alliance partner Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), whose leader and chief minister  Nitish Kumar has described the RJD’s promise as impractical. The political polemics notwithstanding, what explains the mad rush for promising jobs in the Bihar elections? An HT analysis shows that unemployment may be a bigger problem in Bihar than in the rest of India. Bihar’s unemployment rate is higher than the all-India average According to the 2018-19 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the official source of employment statistics in India, the unemployment rate in Bihar was 10.2% in India, way above the all-India average of 5.8%. A comparison with previous Employment Unemployment Surveys (EUS), the predecessor of the PLFS, and the 2017-18 PLFS shows that joblessness in Bihar has been worsening vis-a-vis the rest of India. In 2004-05, Bihar’s unemployment rate was 0.8 times the all-India unemployment rate. This ratio has increased over the years. It was 1.6 in 2011-12, 1.2 in 2017-18, and 1.8 in 2018-19.   !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Only 10% of jobs in Bihar are salaried jobs Granted, unemployment rates do not capture the true labour market pain in a country like India. If all managers lost their jobs and started working as farmers or construction workers, the unemployment rate would remain unchanged. Therefore, it is important to look at the quality of jobs in addition to the absolute numbers. Bihar fares worse than the all-India average when it comes to the share of workers who have a regular job. According to the 2018-19, PLFS, 23.8% of India’s workers had a salaried job. This number was just 10.4% for Bihar. The share of workers with a salaried job has increased from 4.2% in 2004-05 EUS, which corresponds with the period when Nitish Kumar took over the chief minister of the state. However, the points remains that it is still significantly worse than the all-India situation.   !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Also Read | ‘Deriding people of Bihar’: Congress targets BJP over its free Covid-19 vaccine promise in manifestoBihar sees the biggest outmigration for work among major states Lack of quality jobs in the state has forced Bihari workers to out-migrate for employment. According to data from the 2011 census, Bihar had the highest share of migrants who moved out for work, employment or business reasons. A 2018 World Bank paper by Gaurav Nayyar and Kyoung Yang Kim found that migrant remittances had a share of 35% in Bihar’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) and positively affected consumption at the household level. A disproportionate dependence on remittance incomes must have hurt Bihar more than other states after the nationwide lockdown imposed in March this year, in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease outbreak. It is natural that discontent with a poor job scenario in the state has become a big issue in the polls which are taking place just a few months after the lockdown.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Employment is an issue which cuts across class and caste lines Politics in Bihar has been dominated by caste-based fissures for a long time. While the RJD-led alliance can bank on the support of Muslims and Yadavs, it is not enough to ensure victory in the state. By championing the cause of employment, the opposition is trying to take up an issue which resonates across caste and class boundaries, especially sections which have been pro-National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the past. Unemployment rates had risen sharply among all major social groups in the state between 2011-12 and 2018-19. The increase was the highest among people who belong neither to the scheduled castes (SCs) nor from the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Every fifth person who at least had a graduate degree and was a part of the labour force – either working or looking for a job – was unemployed in Bihar in 2018-19. Unemployment rates even for those with very little education were significantly higher in Bihar than the all-India numbers.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-everyone-promising-jobs-in-bihar-elections/story-PakeHDedmBrT36EG7xRkKP.html
23-10-2020||India||3,882 new cases in Delhi, highest since sept 19; positivity rate jumps to 6.61%||The number of daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recorded in Delhi continued on an upward trend, inching closer to the 4,000-mark as the Capital added 3,882 infections on Thursday — the highest since September 19. So far, 344,318 people in Delhi have been infected and 6,163 fatalities recorded in the seven months since the first case was reported in the city on March 2.The positivity rate — the proportion of tests that come out positive for Covid-19 — was at 6.61% on Thursday, the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin showed. The seven-day average of positivity rose from 5.4% to 6.4% in the last two weeks.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageExperts say the recent increase in the number of samples testing positive for Covid-19 could be attributed to the rise in molecular tests such as the RT-PCR that are more accurate in diagnosis than the antigen tests.Over 16,000 RT-PCR tests daily have been conducted for the last two days. On average 14,877 daily RT-PCR tests were carried out in the last seven days, accounting for 27.9% of the total tests conducted in the time period. This is an increase from the average of 11,528 tests per day carried out the week before (making up 23.2% of the total tests) and the 9,254 two weeks ago (19.2% of total tests). The molecular RT-PCR test amplifies the genetic material of the virus collected using a throat or nasal swab and is very sensitive. The alternate Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) are cheap, can be deployed in dispensaries and clinics, and give results within 15 minutes. But they are not as sensitive as RT-PCR and are prone to throwing up false negatives i.e. diagnosing people who are infected with Covid-19 as uninfected. “The sensitivity of the rapid antigen test is about 60 to 65% at best; if we use more RT-PCR tests, of course we will detect more cases. But I think the current increase in the cases is not just because of the RT PCR tests; there might be some increase happening for real. It is the festive season, people are stepping out, going shopping and all this leads to increase in the transmission of the infection and higher number of cases,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The Delhi government had scaled up testing three-fold to about 60,000 tests a day in September after the city saw a surge in the number of cases of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-882-new-cases-in-delhi-highest-since-sept-19-positivity-rate-jumps-to-6-61/story-NN4n11opLsW9dSl4zHdMJM.html
23-10-2020||India||Congress leader’s T-20 move to aid UP Brahmins. Narrow mindset, says BJP||A team of 20 volunteers (T-20) will be set up in every district to provide legal aid and other assistance to the Brahmins, said senior Congress leader Jitin Prasada. The effort is an apparent move to win the support of the community in Uttar Pradesh. “We are setting up teams of 20 volunteers. There is a spurt in crime, and targeted attacks against Brahmins have come to our notice,” said Prasada, who is also the patron of the Brahmin Chetna Parishad. Though Prasada said he had been raising such issues in view of the ‘step-motherly’ treatment being meted out to the Brahmins in the state, his assertions are being viewed as an attempt to indulge in caste divide and woo the community. “This is an attempt to woo the community. But it is the outcome of lowly politics and a narrow mindset. Uttar Pradesh has moved away from caste politics and this is the time of sabka saath, sabkaa vikas. The BJP government in the state is working for all sections of society,” said Chandramohan, UP BJP spokesman. Prasada, however, maintains that the Brahmin Chetna Parishad was formed to resolve grievances of the community and he was not indulging in any caste politics. The Congress leader’s observations about the law and order and crime issues were endorsed by leaders of other parties as well. “BSP chief Mayawati has been saying there is jungle rule in the state. The incidents of crime have gone up against Dalits, backward classes, minorities and Brahmins as well,” said BSP legislature party leader Lalji Verma. Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said crime against weaker sections and women had gone up and the BJP government had failed to bring about any improvement. “There is an increase in crime against economically and socially weaker sections. The SP has been raising this issue,” said Chaudhary. This is not for the first time that Prasada has raised such an issue. The former Union minister said he had visited 40 districts for the cause of the community and would cover the remaining districts soon. On August 10, 2020, Prasada had sent a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath demanding restoration of public holiday on Parshuram Jayanti. The Samajwadi Party had announced plans to install a 108-ft statue of Parshuram in the state capital. The Bahujan Samaj Party had responded by vowing to install a bigger one. The move was seen as a bid to woo Brahmins, who constitute 10% of the state’s electorate, as Parshuram, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu in the Hindu pantheon, was also a Brahmin. On August 22, CM Adityanath, while speaking on the law and order situation in the state assembly, took on the opposition for its apparent ploy of projecting Parshuram as a Brahmin icon, saying Parshuram was no different from Lord Ram. Ram and Parshuram, the CM said, were both incarnations of Lord Vishnu and therefore attempts to drive a wedge in the society in their name would prove futile. UP BJP general secretary Vijay Pathak said dividing people on caste lines was not justified. He said the state government was working for people of all sections of society. Pathak said Prasada should also look at the situation in Rajasthan before making any comments about Uttar Pradesh. Will the attempts to woo the people on caste lines help political parties? “The era of caste division is over. We do not see a caste divide now as it was earlier. It may be because of inter-caste marriages. While the caste divide is declining, the political parties are making efforts to cement the division,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-s-t-20-move-to-aid-up-brahmins-narrow-mindset-says-bjp/story-jpnQBEePWz0tKPhSU7hKrJ.html

He urged Indian companies to step up their investments in the state.Yediyurappa made these remarks while virtually addressing various industry captains at an event organised by the Public Affairs Forum of India (PAFI), National Forum 2020. The Karnataka CM highlighted numerous business opportunities and investments that were available for domestic investors in the state in IT, ITES services, machine tooling, manufacturing, aerospace, biotechnology, and engineering design.Stating that Karnataka is a nearly US$ 250 billion economy with strengths in a wide range of industries - machine tools, heavy machinery, automobiles, electronics, aerospace, defense, biotechnology - the CM emphasised the benefits of the New Industrial Policy 2020-2025, launched by the BJP government, which he said would help “to build a prosperous Karnataka and create large-scale employment opportunities”.Stressing that the state is committed to bringing ease to regulatory compliance for businesses, he said they were working in partnership with departments and various stakeholders to make it easier, simpler and quicker for businesses to start and operate in the state.Large, small and medium scale industries minister Jagadish Shettar, who also spoke at the event, said that the state is taking cautious steps to reboot the economy and support economic activities. “The recent NITI Aayog 2019 Innovation Index has Karnataka at the top. This has been possible due to the availability of quality human resources, reputed higher educational institutions, and a significant thrust on research and development aided by a proactive administration and conducive investment climate,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-received-highest-investment-among-states-this-year-bs-yediyurappa/story-VIAJmd7Xi9gVgwYZ9JdiZI.html
23-10-2020||India||EC moves top court against MP HC order restricting physical rallies||The Election Commission of India (ECI) approached the Supreme Court on Thursday against an order of the Madhya Pradesh high court’s Gwalior bench, which put stringent restrictions on physical campaigning by candidates for the assembly by-elections in the state next month in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The conduct and management of elections is overseen by ECI under the Constitution, the poll watchdog said in its petition submitted through advocate Amit Sharma. It added that the high court order was passed in total disregard of ECI’s guidelines on gatherings and the state’s Covid-19 protocol that allowed such congregations with curbs. The petition also cited Article 329 of the Constitution that lays down an express bar on interference by courts in electoral matters. The ECI move came two days after the Gwalior bench of the high court directed the administrators of nine districts in its jurisdiction (Gwalior, Guna, Morena, Bhind, Ashok Nagar, Datia, Shivpuri, Sheopur and Vidisha) to grant permissions for physical public rallies, irrespective of the size of the gathering, only if virtual meetings are not possible ahead of the bypolls to 28 seats slated for November 3. The state has 52 districts.The right to health and life of ordinary people is more sacred and precious when set off against the right to campaign of candidates in an election, the court observed in its October 20 order that has triggered a flutter. Even if a physical congregation is permitted by the district (DM) magistrate and ECI, it can take place only after the political party/candidate deposits money with the DM that is sufficient to purchase double the number of masks and sanitisers required for those attending the event, according to the court. Additionally, the candidate will have to file an affidavit that “he shall be personally liable to distribute masks and sanitiser to all the members of the congregation before the meeting/congregation starts”, the court said. In its appeal, ECI said its Covid-19 guidelines on poll meetings were formulated on September 25 in exercise of its powers under Article 324, which gives the watchdog authority to conduct and oversee the electoral process. The guidelines permitted “public gatherings” and “election rallies” in adherence to standard operating procedures (SOP) of the state government that allows political gatherings of over 100 people with safety measures, the petition said. ECI requested the apex court for urgent listing of its appeal since the next hearing in the high court is expected to take place on Friday. Separately, two candidates of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — Pradyuman Singh Tomar (Gwalior) and Munnalal Goyal (Gwalior East) — too challenged the high court order before the Supreme Court and prayed for urgent listing of their pleas. The two separate pleas said the HC order should be set aside as it interfered with their right to contest elections. “The impugned interim order has violated the petitioner’s right to conduct election campaign through physical gatherings as permitted by the Election Commission, Central Government and State of Madhya Pradesh,” said the petitions presented in the court by advocate Astha Sharma. The same high court order by a two-judge division bench of justices Sheel Nagu and Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava also ordered that first information reports (FIRs) be lodged against Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and state Congress president Kamal Nath for alleged breach of Covid-19 protocols in holding rallies. On Tuesday, the state filed status reports indicating 10 FIRs have been registered against organisers of election rallies conducted in alleged breach of Covid-19 protocol. This list, however, did not include the names of Tomar and Nath. During Tuesday’s hearing, the state assured the high court that the names will be included. The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by lawyer Ashish Pratap Singh, who sought a total restraint on physical gatherings in the backdrop of the Covid crisis. In state capital Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, too, said on Thursday his party will move the Supreme Court even as he cancelled two of his election meetings in Gwalior-Chambal region in view of the Gwalior bench’s order. “We can’t hold meetings in parts of Madhya Pradesh but can do that in other parts of the state. Public meetings and rallies are being organised in Bihar (for the upcoming assembly elections there). We are going to Supreme Court for justice and hope, we will get justice,” he said. District election offices in the state, meanwhile, started seeking affidavits — made mandatory by the court — from candidates on distributing masks and providing sanitizer at face-to-face election meetings, provided they get all the clearances to hold such an event and follow social-distancing norms. “We are going to hold physical meetings and rallies...for that, we will submit an affidavit to the district administration,” a senior BJP leader who did not want to be named said. State Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said the party was not planning to challenge the order at this moment. “Of course, whatever judgment comes from the Supreme Court will be applicable to all in the state and elsewhere...However, our stand is there should be uniformity in the process of election campaign across the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-moves-top-court-against-mp-hc-order-restricting-physical-rallies/story-LBt06MXbUvR2Delwl78QBL.html
23-10-2020||India||IS operative caught in Delhi used Bitcoins to fund terror. It’s India’s first: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has claimed in a charge sheet filed last month that Islamic State operative Jahanzaib Sami had arranged a Bitcoin wallet address, through a British contact, on which he asked associates to deposit funds -- the first documented allegation of the use of cryptocurrency in terror activity in India. Sami, 36, and his wife Hina Bashir were arrested in Delhi on March 8 for allegedly planning to carry out attacks in India. According to the charge sheet, they received the Bitcoin address on Threema, an instant messaging app, from an account called Caged Pearls, which belongs to a British woman based in Syria. “She had given her Bitcoin wallet address to Sami and requested him to deposit money in that account. He had asked his associates to deposit funds in this wallet address,” reads the NIA charge sheet, which HT has reviewed. He also got in touch with a Libya-based IS operative who possessed an ID ‘Sech Tech’, to discuss arranging funds through “blockchain technology”. Cryptocurencies such as Bitcoins leverage a technology known as blockchain, a decentralised, distributed ledger that tracks transactions. These are anonymous and nearly impossible to track, and are commonly used in dark web transactions. The charge sheet said Sami discussed the possibility of using this to source weapons and explosives raw material. According to the charge sheet, Sami planned to carry out 100 bombing in a single day. Also Read | 14-member IS module that returned ‘disillusioned’ from Iraq, Syria busted: NIASech Tech, a member of IS’s intelligence and media unit, told Sami that he works in dark web and provides Bitcoins for funding of the outfit, the NIA said. “They also discussed arranging funds through stolen credit cards for procuring weapons,” the charge sheet said. The increasing use of cryptocurrency by terror organisations like IS and Al-Qaeda to fund their activities has worried security and intelligence communities across the world. The US Department of Justice, on August 13 said it seized millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency this year, and 300 of the accounts belonged to IS, Al-Qaeda, and the military wing of Hamas. People familiar with the NIA probe said this may be the first time any terror activity in India has been linked to Bitcoins. “We are trying to unearth more details,” said an officer who asked not to be named.The NIA charge sheet also alleges that Abdullah Basith, a key IS member lodged in Tihar jail since August 2018, was using smartphones inside the prison for almost 10 months between June 2019 and February this year to interact with Sami and several ISIS commanders abroad – including Maulvi Abdullah, head of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), handler Huzaifa-al-Bakistani, Abu Usman-Al-Kashmiri (Head of Indian affairs of ISKP), Abu Umar, Munasib Bhai and Abu Algama from inside Tihar jail. Huzaifa and Umar were killed in Afghanistan while Kashmiri was arrested by Afghan security forces earlier this year after an attack on a gurdwara in Kabul in March. NIA is investigating the Kabul attack as well and is likely to visit Afghanistan soon. The charge sheet states that Basith, from Hyderabad, had strong connections in IS since 2016, and first procured a phone with a SIM belonging to an Indian service provider in June 2019. He used it to contact Abu Umar, the in-charge of Nida-e-Haq (the official Urdu media of IS) on Telegram app. This phone was detected by jail authorities in September and seized. Then, in November 2019, he was transferred from Jail number 8 to 3 where he obtained another phone with a SIM card. This phone was traced in February this year by jail authorities, according to charge sheet. From jail, he radicalised some young Muslims selected by Sami, and motivated them to make graffiti at public places against CAA/NRC (Citizenship Amendment Act/National Register of Citizens), according to the charge sheet. “Investigation also revealed that Basith’s wife received funds sent by Huzaifa Al Bakistani while he was in jail,” chargesheet said. While in jail, Basith had also told Sami that he had plans to radicalise Muslim persons in prison to join the ISIS, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-charge-sheet-alleges-bitcoins-used-by-is-operatives-to-fund-terror-activity/story-1qVgzJ5Ipj3t2DCrPmWpvO.html

The man was 43 years old.The minor girl then surrendered before the police, the officials said “During interrogation on Thursday, the girl said her father used to work as a labourer. He was a habitual drinker and used to beat her mother in an intoxicated state almost daily. The girl said neighbours used to mock them about the family feud. She was upset over the physical torture her mother was subjected to by her father as she told us, “ said KK Verma, sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP), Bairasia.“On Wednesday evening, the man returned to the house and started abusing his wife. The girl couldn’t control her anger and attacked him with an iron rod. He fell down. The girl then picked up a stick and continued to hit her father on his head. The man died on the spot. Later, neighbours informed the police but the girl herself surrendered before the police,” said Verma.The girl’s mother registered her statement with police and shared the same story, said the police officer.The girl was produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) on Thursday afternoon and is currently undergoing counselling as she is in a state of trauma.

23-10-2020||India||‘Cannot shy away from liability’: Tahir Hussain’s bail plea junked||A Delhi court on Thursday dismissed an application for bail by suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain in three cases of rioting, arson, murder and conspiracy connected with the communal riots that rocked north-east Delhi in February.In denying him bail, additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav observed that Hussain’s house had become a hub of rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash what he described as the “worst communal riots since partition in Delhi.” He also said the riots were “a gaping wound in the conscience of a nation aspiring to be a major global power”.The riots started as clashes between protestors against and in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, and went on to acquire a communal colour. The violence between February 23 and 27 left 53 people dead and 607 injured.Yadav observed that during the communal riots, Hussain had held the powerful post of councillor. “It is prima facie apparent that Hussain abused his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration,” he said.Enough material existed on record to presume that Hussain “was present at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but rioters as human weapons, who at his instigation could have killed anybody”.Hussain’s lawyers have in the past denied the allegations against him and said he was a victim of political rivalry. Hussain had in interviews before his arrest said that he was a riot victim and not an accused. He also claimed that his family members had to flee the neighbourhood during the riots because they were feeling unsafe.In his 18-page order, the judge said that the allegations against Hussain are “extremely grave in nature”. “Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the accused, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house became the hub for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since the partition in Delhi.”He added: “The spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a premeditated conspiracy. At this stage, I am reminded of a famous English saying that goes ‘when you choose to play with embers, you cannot blame the wind to have carried the spark a bit too far and spread the fire’ ”.The judge said: “When the applicant (Hussain) is at the receiving end, he cannot pass the buck. He cannot plead that he had no role to play since he did not participate physically in the riots. It is prima facie apparent that the applicant abused his muscle power and political clout to foment communal violence in the area.”He noted that besides the three cases in which he has sought bail, Hussain is also an accused in eight other cases related to the riots.“I do not find any force in the arguments of learned counsel for the applicant that applicant has been falsely implicated in the present matter or that there is no legally sustainable evidence available against him. On the contrary, I find the ocular evidence of independent witnesses aforesaid to be categorical, which gives the clear details qua the active role played by him in the incidents in question,” the court said.Delhi Police’s special cell has charged Hussain with rioting, murder and inciting rioters. He has also been charged with hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots and funding the communal riots. Several civil society members and student activists have criticised Delhi Police for its allegedly lopsided investigation of the riots and for arresting those who led the anti-CAA protests across the city in the months leading to the riots. Police have denied the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-shy-away-from-liability-tahir-hussain-s-bail-plea-junked/story-dcqB0GUEs55jthZ5bk742N.html
23-10-2020||India||Delhi High Court tells Facebook, Google to remove woman’s personal pics||The Delhi high court has directed Facebook, Google and agencies, including the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), to take measures to remove the intimate pictures of a woman who said she shared them with a male friend in 2012 when she was a teenager. He put them up on social media sites after their relationship soured.Justice Vibhu Bakhru on Tuesday directed the police to forward the offending material to the NCRB, stating that the content undeniably falls within the scope of sexually explicit material relating to a child. The court also directed the police to use the resources available with NCRB and/or other agencies to identify the people who were re-uploading the offensive content in India and take action. “...Respondent nos.2 (Facebook) and R3 (Google) are also directed to use such measures as available with them to remove the contents which are similar to the contents of the URLs earlier removed...,” the court said in its ruling.The woman, now aged 24, had petitioned the court to issue directions to various social media companies to remove all the offending URLS and content that had her images on them. The woman told the court that she shared the photographs when she was 16 years old with a friend, who had threatened to take his life otherwise.According to her plea, when she was studying in Delhi, she came to be acquainted with a boy who was in the same class. She alleged that he started blackmailing her emotionally and compelled her to send intimate photographs of hers to him, and she complied. After completing her schooling, she secured admission in an institution abroad in August 2014 and moved out of India. She said the man attacked her when she was abroad and was also held guilty by a foreign court, which issued restraining orders against him. She told the court that in October – November 2019, she became aware that he had posted her intimate pictures on various platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. The court, in July, had asked the various social media platforms to remove the URLs and objectionable content. But the photographs had been widely circulated and were being uploaded by people other than the man. Facebook, in an affidavit, told the court that it had implemented a number of measures to combat the spread of child pornography including working with National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) which is a non-profit organization involved in helping find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization. The social media company said NCMEC had created Cyber Tipline, providing an online forum to receive reports of suspected child porn content on the internet. When Facebook identifies child pornography on its platforms, it immediately removes the content, the company claimed. Google also filed an affidavit claiming that it had adopted various protocols to deal with child pornography or Child Sexual Abuse Material on its YouTube platform. Google said the measures included removal of objectionable content on individual reporting and the Trusted Flagger Program to provide robust tools to individuals, government agencies and non-government organizations for effectively notifying objectionable content on YouTube. Appearing for the ministry of electronics and Information technology, advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, the central government’s standing counsel, told the court that NCRB acts as a nodal agency for technical and operational functions of the On-Line Cyber Reporting Portal: “www.cybercrime.gov.in.” Following the affidavits, the court directed the social media platforms and agencies to remove the content, subject to technological limitations, and disposed of the plea by the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-high-court-tells-facebook-google-to-remove-woman-s-personal-pics/story-J0nb4ZpqCbCwg49x2fsS9L.html
23-10-2020||Editorials||Joe Biden retains the edge||The final United States (US) presidential debate was a normal affair with the two candidates laying out their respective visions for their country. However, for a trailing President Donald Trump, normal is not enough. The debate was his last real chance to woo the large number of in-between voters who support Republican policies, but oppose Mr Trump. Initial polls indicate he won a thumbs up only from the same 42% of voters who have always been with him. Democratic hopeful Joe Biden gave a standard performance but, given his lead in national and swing state polls, that was all he needed.It will take a small miracle for Mr Trump to win next month. The president is struggling most against an enemy to whom he has no response: Covid-19. He sought to brazen it out in the debate by falsely claiming the pandemic was under control, but even among conservatives, his credibility on the virus is minimal. Combined with his personality, this has cost Mr Trump heavily with two pillars of his 2016 voter coalition — elderly whites and suburban women. Add large numbers from these two groups to Mr Biden’s solid liberal, white and minority base, and it is hard to see Democrats losing in November. Winning the national vote is already assured. More critically, given the electoral college system, Mr Biden has seen margins increase steadily in the upper Midwest states even as he ties Mr Trump in Red strongholds in the South.Foreign policy continues to be the stepchild of the election. This should be no surprise. The success of anti-establishment politics and the deep racial and class polarisation are symptoms of severe domestic challenges. If Mr Biden wins, it will be, in large part, because he is seen as the candidate who will heal the social wounds bleeding the US today. Countries such as India may be concerned that the US struggle against China, so fervently taken up by Mr Trump, will see a dilution under a Democratic administration. A long view should be taken. The foundation on which the US’s superpower status rests is the strength of its social contract and the coherence of its domestic institutions. If these fall apart, isolationalism and parochialism will overwhelm Washington’s desire for global involvement. Mr Trump thrives on divisiveness at home and this makes it harder for the US to look abroad. A Biden administration, on the other hand, will attempt to rebuild the domestic consensus that ensures the US remains globally engaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/joe-biden-retains-the-edge/story-1cws6GMDQ2K4BrdslsIKaM.html
23-10-2020||Editorials||Poor air quality is a danger to public health. Adopt a holistic approach||The State of Global Air 2020 report, which was released on Wednesday, has two warnings for India. First, India recorded the highest annual average PM 2.5 concentration exposure in the world in 2019, and second, the country has had the worst levels of PM 2.5 levels in the world for the last decade. This runaway pollution is leading to a deleterious impact on the health of the people. In 2019, over 116,000 infants in India died within a month after birth due to exposure to severe air pollution, the report said. This finding is based on research that suggests exposure to polluted air during pregnancy is linked to low weight and premature birth. The report also suggested that long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in India in 2019. Although the link between air pollution and Covid-19 is not yet fully proven, the report acknowledged that there is evidence linking air pollution with increased heart and lung disease. This means that exposure to high levels of air pollution during winter months could exacerbate the effects of the disease.In the last few years, there has been increasing scientific evidence of the effect of air pollution on health, pushing the central and state governments — often with the prodding of the judiciary — to take a raft of measures to tackle the menace. For example, the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) has a Graded Response Action Plan since 2017, and there has been talk of implementing a regional “airshed management” plan to curb pollution in the city. The Delhi government is also experimenting with a new organic way of decomposing stubble with Indian Agriculture Research Institute’s “Pusa decomposer”.Despite these efforts, the Delhi-NCR region’s pollution load has remained high. While one has to accept the city’s geographical location and its meteorological challenges, there are also several man-made factors (other than stubble burning) — vehicular emissions, construction dust, garbage burning — that can be controlled to ensure cleaner air. To do that, there has to be a holistic approach that pushes policy changes in Delhi and its neighbouring states and overcomes the issue posed by the multiplicity of political interests. There must also be monitoring on a real-time basis as well as a strong push towards the behaviourial change of citizens. There is no room for delay, for lives are at stake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/poor-air-quality-is-a-danger-to-public-health-adopt-a-holistic-approach/story-LnoWBmoUCtba08pdRxYcGP.html
23-10-2020||Editorials||The political twist in the Darjeeling hills||For over a decade, the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM), led by Bimal Gurung, has supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The quid pro quo was simple. For the BJP, the support of the Nepali-speaking community in the Darjeeling hills helped it make inroads into West Bengal, where it had little presence, and win Lok Sabha elections. For the political leaders of the hills, where a battle for a separate state of Gorkhaland has persisted for three decades, supporting the BJP was seen as a possible avenue to have the Centre on their side when the state government was against them, and either get a new state or wrest more power. With Mr Gurung declaring that he will no longer support the BJP, and instead back the Trinamool Congress in state elections, the political dynamics have changed. This turn appears to be driven by a set of factors. When the BJP appeared sympathetic to the Gorkhaland movement, it had almost no presence in the rest of Bengal — but this has changed. Given that the mood in the state is against the creation of Gorkhaland, the BJP cannot risk supporting the hills’ quest for self-rule. The BJP was also then in Opposition — but as the ruling party at the Centre, it has to take into account security considerations. Intelligence agencies have emphasised the strategic importance of the Darjeeling-Siliguri belt, and are not comfortable with separate statehood. And finally, the fact that Mr Gurung feels he will be safer, if he has the protection of the state government has tilted the decision despite the Trinamool’s opposition to statehood. But irrespective of the reasons, the loss of GJM as an ally will hurt the BJP in the hills in next year’s polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-political-twist-in-the-darjeeling-hills/story-3zfOGU7F9y45Z0hm9lTy5K.html
